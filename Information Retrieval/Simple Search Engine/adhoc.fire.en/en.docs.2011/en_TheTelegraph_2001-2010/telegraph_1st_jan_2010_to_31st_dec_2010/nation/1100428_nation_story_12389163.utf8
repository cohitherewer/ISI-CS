The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Debate on air power against rebels
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Debate on air power against rebels
          SUJAN DUTTA                          A BSF helicopter on a rescue mission in Dantewada on April 6                                  
	New Delhi, April 27: The Indian Air Force has called for brainstorming within the security establishment on the use of air power in counter-Maoist operations at the behest of the Union home ministry.        
	The move follows the refusal of central forces in Chhattisgarhs Dantewada to move out of their camps and chase the guerrillas in the first two days after the April 6 killing of 75 CRPF jawans and one state policeman.        
	Despite protestations that the air force will not be used for strikes, the use and expansion of air power is far from being a closed question.        
	Since the April 6 killings, the air force has already deployed two additional Mi-17 helicopters in or near Dantewada for evacuation of casualties and movement of troops. The total number of helicopters involved in the offensive across the Eastern Ghats is now 12, including three helicopters of the BSF.        
	The first of the brainstorming sessions is scheduled to be held by the IAF-supported think tank, Centre for Air power Studies (CAPS), on April 30. Titled Left Wing Militancy and Use of Air Power, the discussions will involve senior retired and serving air force officers in sessions that are not open to the public.         
	The discussions are likely to be opened by Air Chief Marshal Pradeep Vasant Naik. Representatives of the home ministry are also expected to attend.        
	The Air Headquarters has sought inputs from experienced officers as it drafts the rules of engagement that it will propose to the government in the event that its involvement in the counter-Maoist offensive is deepened.        
	The air force is concerned that use of air power is not confused with air strikes. As Air Chief Marshal (retired) S. Krishnaswamy told The Telegraph: It is important that the political leadership is aware of the ways in which air power can be exploited in the counter-Naxalite operations. Using air power does not necessarily mean bombing or firing.        
	Serving and retired air force officers will give inputs to the Air Headquarters as it draws up a plan that may include use of helicopters for propaganda (by dropping leaflets  as in Lalgarh  and by loudspeaker broadcasts), para-dropping of trained policemen and on the improvements in air surveillance.        
	Even on the question of using lethal air power, the Air Headquarters wants specific directions from the government on passive and active air strikes. One officer defined passive air strike as the use of airborne weapons only in support of an operation by ground forces (for example, when a police patrol is ambushed).         
	Active air strike would denote aerial firing/bombing as a pre-emptive measure before ground forces move in to capture territory. The risk of innocents being wounded/killed is highest in active air strikes.        
	On April 7, a day after the killings of security forces, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, asked about the use of the armed forces, had said: As of now, we have not taken any view in this direction. All these options are kept open and continuously reviewed.         
	Visiting Jagdalpur the same day, home minister P. Chidambaram had said it was too early to review the policy on the offensive.        
	But on the ground in Dantewada, especially in Chintalnar, the CRPF camp nearest to the killing field in Mukram, the policemen were insistent on air support. Chidambaram had said: There is no proposal to use the army in the operations against Naxalites. But the Centre may revisit the mandate of not using the air force against the Naxalites.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US envoy clears air on Headley access
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Headley                                   
	New Delhi, March 23: The US today said no decision had been taken on giving Indian investigators direct access to David Coleman Headley.        
	The statement, made by US ambassador to India Timothy Roemer, comes a day after the Centre said it would send a team by mid-April to quiz the Pakistani-American who pleaded guilty to conducting the recce for the 26/11 attack.        
	 ...No decision on direct access for India to David Headley has been made. The US department of justice will work with the Government of India regarding the modalities of such cooperation, Roemer said in a suo motu statement.        
	Roemer said his statement was an effort to clarify assistant secretary Robert Blakes comments during the latters trip to India last week. Blake had publicly said in Delhi that Indian investigators would have access to Headley.        
	Sources stressed the ambassadors comment about direct access probably meant Indian investigators would get to question Headley alongside US officials.        
	As the assistant secretary indicated, the US is committed to full information-sharing in our counter-terror partnership and, in fact, in this case, we have provided substantial information to the Government of India and we will continue to do so, Roemer said.        
	Senior home ministry officials claimed that Roemers statement was not a snub. They argued that the US had taken no decision on the issue for the simple reason that India had made no formal request so far.        
	The ministry officials seemed confident they would get to interrogate Headley. We are confident of being granted access to Headley. We are taking legal advice on the matter. We will soon make a formal request, said an official.        
	Last week, home minister P. Chidambaram had directed the National Investigation Agency to quickly prepare documents to start judicial proceedings in which Indian authorities could get Headley to answer questions and testify.        
	Ministry sources had yesterday said a team of legal experts and NIA sleuths would travel to the US to grill Headley.

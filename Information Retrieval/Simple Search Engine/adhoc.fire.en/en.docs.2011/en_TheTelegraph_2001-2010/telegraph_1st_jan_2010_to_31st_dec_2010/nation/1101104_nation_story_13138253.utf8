          ARCHIS MOHAN                          Former US President Bill Clinton addresses Parliament during his visit to India in March 2000. File picture                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: Union parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Kumar Bansal might just be keeping his fingers crossed.        
	He isnt going to the extent of issuing Indias honourable MPs a good-manners advisory, but hes sure hoping they will mind their ps and qs when President Barack Obama addresses a joint session of Parliament a little after 5pm on Monday.        
	Back in March 2000, after then President Bill Clinton had finished his 35-minute address to the august House, they had fallen over themselves to shake hands with him as he walked down the middle of Parliaments Central Hall. It had been pure bedlam.        
	I hope our MPs will conduct themselves with dignity and meet the US President with dignity, Bansal said today.        
	Honourable members are aware of their responsibilities. I am sure the event will be conducted in a very dignified manner.        
	In its report published on March 23, 2000, The Telegraph had said of the House fiasco: Suddenly the elected representatives of India lost all sense of dignity and decorum and mobbed William Jefferson Clinton like 10-year-old autograph hunters. Media reports estimated that Clinton shook hands with some 300 MPs by the time he exited the Parliament House precincts.        
	That day, an MP occupying the seventh seat from the aisle, therefore beyond Clintons reach, almost fell on his colleagues closer to the President and then extended his hand. It reached Clintons thighs and the accommodating leader pulled it up and down in a slow handshake.        
	Not to be outdone, MPs cutting across party lines grabbed at Clintons hands. A Tamil Nadu MP even managed to put a tri-coloured uttariya on Clinton, who smilingly adjusted the garment and thanked the legislator twice. Several MPs fell to the ground in the melee.        
	Even Vinod Khanna, no stranger to being mobbed since his Bollywood days, overtook a few MPs in the aisle to have some of Clintons gleam rubbed on him. The MPs were falling all over the place.        
	Shyama Sinha, a Bihar MP, told reporters after what to Clinton must have seemed a never-ending handshake: I wont wash my hands for three months. It was left to Pramod Mahajan, then parliamentary affairs minister, to rescue Clinton from the throng as he shouted: Leave him alone.        
	Possibly, some bit of the chaos had to do with Clintons personality, and some with the content of his speech. He had touched on Kargil, Mahatma Gandhi, Bangalores rise as an IT hub  all issues that struck a chord with the MPs.        
	His clever avoidance of the Kashmir minefield  he said he had not come to South Asia to mediate between India and Pakistan  also won over the MPs, as also the fact that a US President had come calling after 22 years.        
	The only discordant note had been struck by Left leaders, who criticised the pushing and pulling as demeaning. We still behave like slaves before imperialist forces, a CPM legislator had commented.        
	Today, both Bansal and Prithviraj Chavan, the minister of state in the PMO, said the Obama visit was extremely significant. Bansal said the Central Hall should have been spruced up more for the historic occasion. It would have been good if they had beautified it. It is as it used to be, he said.

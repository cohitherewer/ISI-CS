          OUR BUREAU                          Bhattacharjee                                   
	Calcutta, May 29: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee cancelled a news conference scheduled at Alimuddin Street today, with party sources hinting the chief minister wanted to avoid unpleasant questions on yesterdays train tragedy.        
	However, the CPM did not let go of the opportunity to discredit railway minister Mamata Banerjee. The party brought together a host of Left-leaning film personalities and writers at Rabindra Sadan this evening to condemn the Jhargram attack.        
	The assembly, which included Mrinal Sen, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Sabyasachi Chakraborty, and Papiya Adhikari as well as former cricketer Sambaran Banerjee, also took part in a candlelight vigil.        
	The CPM had earlier wanted to take out a procession condemning the attack. However, the party was restricted to the candlelight vigil after the Election Commission objected to the rally plan, saying it would amount to violation of the election code of conduct with only a day left for the civic polls.        
	Last evening, Sen, Gangopadhyay, Soumitra Chatterjee, Tarun Majumdar, Nabaneeta Dev Sen and Rituparna Sengupta had joined others in issuing an appeal to the people to make todays protest assembly a success.        
	CPM mouthpiece Ganashakti too carried the reactions of personalities such as Nirendranath Chakraborty, Usha Ganguly, Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Abul Bashar and Chuni Goswami, who condemned the attack on the passenger train. Many of them made an appeal through the newspaper to mobilise public opinion against the Maoists.        
	Asked why Bhattacharjee had called off todays news conference, CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim said: The death toll from yesterdays crash is rising. In the midst of this, it would not have been prudent to get into political wrangling. That is why the chief minister cancelled the briefing. He added that it would not be right to attribute motives to an assembly of intellectuals who came to condemn the incident.        
	Some party sources said the chief minister wanted to avoid uncomfortable questions on whether the state government had taken adequate measures to ensure security in Maoist-hit areas.         
	Mamata had said yesterday that law and order was a state subject. Buddhababu could have faced questions on security, which would have been embarrassing for him ahead of the civic polls. The elections are just a day away, a CPM leader said.         
	Journalists could have prodded him to react on Trinamul MP Sisir Adhikaris remarks yesterday that the incident (the train derailment) was the handiwork of evil forces who are out to vilify Mamata. The chief minister does not want to get into such controversial issues now.        
	If the candlelight vigil by Left-leaning artistes left a tacit message, some of their counterparts who support Trinamul were not to be left behind. They went a step further.        
	At a news conference held at the Press Club to condemn the dastardly act, Bratya Basu, Suvaprasanna, Samir Aich and Debobrata Bandopadhyay labelled the train derailment a sabotage orchestrated by the Left. If Trinamul has an entente with the Maoists, then why would they want to destroy our image? So its obvious who the beneficiary is, Bandopadhyay said.        
	With TV channels beaming the Press Club event live, the state poll panel objected. Police commissioner G.M. Chakrabarti sent a team to the venue and the meeting was called off abruptly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tea time at Chicaco? Never on May Day
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tea time at Chicaco? Never on May Day
          G.C. SHEKHAR                           Sukumaran in front of Chicaco Hotel                                  
	Chennai, April 30: Have tea at Chicago every day, except on May Day.        
	If you are one of those with a rebel streak, Chicago Hotel is the place where you could sip rebellion.        
	But never go to Chicago Hotel on May Day  its the only day of the year it remains closed.        
	May 1, celebrated as International Labour Day, is special for this tea stall-cum-eatery, named after the US city where organised labour movement took off in 1886.        
	This small joint in Adyar, south Chennai, too, was born out of a workers revolt, thats why the name Chicago. Never mind the wrong English spelling  Chicaco  on the hotel signboard. A careless printer, says T.T. Sukumaran, the owner.        
	On May Day, the 22 workers of the eatery get their annual bonus and dress allowance. Those who have worked 300 days in the past year get gold rings. Also, the best three workers, selected by our regular customers, get special incentives, says Sukumaran, who quickly adds that his fellow workers are also co-owners.        
	So what was their revolt about?        
	Standing outside his stall, the die-hard Marxist, who had left Thalassery in Kerala to escape police harassment, recalls that day.        
	I once worked in a tea stall in north Chennai where the owner made us work from 4 in the morning till midnight with no weekly off. One day, in 1974, when he beat up a colleague, all of us struck work and ensured that the shop remained shut for a week.        
	Finally, police were called in and a settlement was reached. Each worker was to be paid Rs 20,000 and was allowed to go. With that seed money I started this small tea joint and decided to name it after Chicago, the birthplace of labour rights.        
	The 1886 agitation had been about standard workdays of eight hours. On May 1, several labour unions across the US went on strike. On May 4, when the police marched in to break up a meeting in Chicagos Haymarket Square, a bomb explosion led to the death of about a dozen people.        
	The protests didnt have an immediate impact, but they proved effective subsequently as eight-hour workdays became the norm in many countries.         
	Eighty-eight years later, when Sukumaran opened his hotel, he and his colleagues raised slogans in support of the Haymarket rally before stepping in to start their business. I can proudly say this has been a model tea stall where workers welfare is given as much importance as service to customers. We hold monthly meetings to get feedback from the workers on how to improve work conditions and business, Sukumaran says.        
	The stress on workers welfare is also one reason why the joint has a healthy daily turnover of Rs 30,000. Its a small place, but its clean and has a nice working class ambience about it, says M.V. Ashwin, a regular customer.         
	One of the workers, Jegan, who joined as a 14-year-old, has resisted better offers. Nobody is overworked here. All of us have been insured and during weddings in our family most of the expenses are met by the owner, he says.        
	A local CPM functionary, Sukumaran doesnt support bandhs. On bandh days, I make sure the shop remains open and tea is supplied free of cost to anyone who comes here, says the 59-year-old. No one should go hungry because of a bandh.

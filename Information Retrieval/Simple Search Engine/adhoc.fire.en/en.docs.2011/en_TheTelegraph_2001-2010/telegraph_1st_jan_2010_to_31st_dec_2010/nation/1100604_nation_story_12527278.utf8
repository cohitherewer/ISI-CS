          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 3: When Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik came calling at Berhampur in his home district of Ganjam today, he found the media missing for the first time.        
	The scribes of the district were boycotting Patnaiks visit in protest against the recent assault on them by the students of MKCG Medical College and Hospital and the polices failure to take action. The mediapersons were attacked on Monday night when they had gone to the hospital to cover a clash between the medicos and relatives of a deceased patient.        
	Its unfortunate that the police have not been able to arrest any of those who attacked us while they rounded up the relatives of the dead patient for allegedly roughing up the doctors and postgraduate medical students, said Jay Bardhan Das, the president of Berhampur Press Club.        
	We will continue to boycott the programmes of all ministers and MLAs of the district until the culprits are brought to book, Das added.         
	Covering their faces with black cloths, the scribes today sat on a dharna near Mahatma Gandhis statue at Gandhi Nagar Square in the city. Leaders and members of Berhampur Bar Association and Opposition parties were present at the dharna site to express solidarity with the media.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 8: The army, which is investigating the allegation of misconduct by a top general after a complaint by his juniors wife, was looking into all aspects and if necessary will order a Court of Inquiry, official sources said here today.         
	The investigation was also looking into why the complaint was not made through the right channels  when the lieutenant general was in Israel on an official visit last month  and if competition among top officers had a bearing on the case, an army source said.         
	We are not trying to pre-judge the case. All we want to say now is that we are looking into everything about it, the officer said.         
	The officer has a good spoken reputation and his record was being kept in mind, the source said.         
	The allegation was made by the wife of the technical secretary, a colonel, against the engineer-in-chief, Lt General A.K. Nanda. The 59-year-old, is one of the principal staff officers to the army chief, General V.K. Singh.         
	Nandas wife had also accompanied him on the trip to Israel in May during which he allegedly misbehaved. His technical secretary opted to leave his army headquarters office in New Delhi and has since been posted in Bhopal.         
	The junior officers wife complained to the army chiefs wife, Bharti Singh, who is also the president of the Army Wives Welfare Association.         
	When the news broke last Friday, army headquarters sources said the investigation was ordered despite a large number of loopholes in the account of the allegations.

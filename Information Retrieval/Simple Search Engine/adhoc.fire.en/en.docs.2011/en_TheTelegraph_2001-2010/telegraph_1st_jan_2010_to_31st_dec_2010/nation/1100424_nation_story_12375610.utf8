The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wait for Modi exit before JPC decision
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Wait for Modi exit before JPC decision
          OUR BUREAU                          Sharad Pawar                                  
	New Delhi, April 23: The Congress core group today discussed the Opposition demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe into the IPL mess but failed to make up its mind.        
	It left it to the Prime Minister to elicit the views of the Congresss allies, particularly the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), before arriving at a decision.        
	Most Congress leaders are opposed to the demand for a House panel probe but the high command wants to watch the outcome of Mondays IPL governing council meeting first.        
	Its possible that the Opposition may relent if the fuss over the IPL begins to die down in case Lalit Modi exits the league, the Congress leadership believes. On Tuesday, then, the focus may well shift to the cut motions. The government will take a second look at the IPL only after that.        
	Sources said the Congress could anyway not have decided unilaterally on a joint parliamentary committee (JPC): it would need the consent of ally NCP, some of whose top leaders are entangled in the controversy.        
	In case the government decides it is best to shift the burden from its own shoulders to a House panel even against the NCPs wishes, it can take that risk only after achieving its primary object of getting Modi out of the IPL.        
	Manmohan Singh may broach the demand for a JPC probe at the next cabinet meeting if the Opposition keeps up the pressure till then. At todays core committee meeting, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee briefed Singh on the findings of the economic offence sleuths. Home minister P. Chidambaram, defence minister A.K. Antony and Ahmed Patel were at the meeting.        
	Earlier, many Congress leaders and cabinet ministers had argued in informal conversations that the House panel demand was unreasonable. They felt the BJP was jockeying for some sort of control on the investigations while the Left and others were just looking to embarrass the government over charges relating to certain ministers.        
	Some leaders said that past experience suggested that JPCs had almost become a tool to kill inquiries.        
	But a united Opposition  the BJP, Janata Dal (United), CPM and the CPI  today demanded a House panel probe, alleging the government was acting selectively and trying to protect certain ministers.        
	Leader of the Lok Sabha Opposition Sushma Swaraj said that after Shashi Tharoor, two other Union ministers now faced the charge of misusing their office and securing financial benefits out of their association with the league.        
	She cited newspaper reports alleging that Air India diverted a passenger flight for use as a chartered plane to ferry civil aviation minister Praful Patels daughter and IPL players.        
	NCP boss Sharad Pawar said he was not worried at the allegations against his family and party leader Patel, or at the demands for a House committee probe.        
	Why should we worry? We have nothing to do (with the IPL mess). Let the Opposition do whatever they want to, Pawar said.

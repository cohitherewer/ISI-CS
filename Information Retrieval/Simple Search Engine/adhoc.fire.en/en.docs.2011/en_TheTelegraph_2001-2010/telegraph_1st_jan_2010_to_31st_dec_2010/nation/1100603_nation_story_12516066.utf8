          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          New Bihar Congress president Kaiser. (Deepak Kumar)                                  
	Patna, June 2: In an apparent bid to set its faction-ridden house in order in poll-bound Bihar, the Congress high command today replaced state Congress chief Anil Sharma with Mehboob Ali Kaiser, a Muslim face.         
	Sonia Gandhi has also replaced the general secretary and in-charge of Bihar affairs, Jagdish Tytler with Mukul Wasnik, clearly giving weight to Rahul Gandhis agenda to rope in the youth power in the run-up to the Assembly polls due in October/November.        
	The revamping of the state unit of the party precedes a protracted war between Sharma and Tytler. Moreover, most of the party legislators and cadre were opposed to the duo and had given in writing to the party high command to replace them.        
	The Congress high commands action is aimed at ending the feud in the party and strengthening its support base among the Muslims and Dalits. Wasnik, a young Dalit leader, and Kaiser are reply to Nitish Kumars efforts to expand his base among the Muslims and Dalits by taking up special measures to benefit the Mahadalits and Pasmanda Muslims, said a Congress leader.        
	At least 100 office-bearers of the state unit had offered in writing to the high command to demit their posts, demanding removal of Sharma and Tytler. Those who had offered to resign included MLAs, MLCs and former state Congress chief Sadanand Singh.        
	That the party has tried to end the feud in its rank and file became evident when Kaiser said: We will sit with all senior leaders to work out a strategy to do well in the polls. Our primary goal is to ensure the partys success here.        
	We will launch a unified campaign to ensure our victory, he said. The Congress has been out of power in Bihar for the past 20 years.        
	As of now, the Congress has 10 MLAs in the Assembly and has a long way to go to emerge as a relevant political force in the state. Of course, the partys poll percentage has gone up from 5 per cent in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls to 13 per cent in the 2009 edition.

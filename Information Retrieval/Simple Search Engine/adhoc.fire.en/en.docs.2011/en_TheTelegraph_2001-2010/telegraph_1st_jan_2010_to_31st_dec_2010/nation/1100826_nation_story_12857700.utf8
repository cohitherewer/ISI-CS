                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      One thorn plucked, focus on land takeover bill
          OUR BUREAU                            Mamata Banerjee, Manmohan Singh                           
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today assured Rahul Gandhi that he had set the ball rolling to bring an amended land acquisition bill as soon as possible, now that the nuclear liability bill was out of the way.        
	Manmohan met Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, who has declared her opposition to the land bill, before assuring Rahul that efforts would be made to table an amended one in Parliaments winter session.        
	Congress general secretary Rahul and his team had called on Manmohan to request him to take a view on acquisition of farmers land in the light of the continuing agitation in Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Asked if the bill would be tabled in the next session, Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh, who accompanied Rahul, said: This is what we have been assured. The Prime Minister has said he will try to get it passed as soon as possible.        
	Before meeting Rahul, Manmohan held talks with Mamata, in the presence of finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister P. Chidambaram. Mamata denied that land acquisition was raised at todays meeting, but said the Centre had recently sought her views on the matter.        
	This issue (land acquisition) was not raised in the meet. Recently, however, the government has asked for our view and we will give it in writing, Mamata said.        
	The Prime Ministers assurance to Rahul comes a day before the proposed gherao of Parliament by farmers, orchestrated by Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh, a major player in western Uttar Pradesh. The call has won wide support from the Opposition.        
	By securing an assurance from Manmohan, the Congress appears to be cornering the credit for championing the cause of farmers in Uttar Pradesh. Rahul is working hard to revive Congress fortunes in the heartland ahead of the 2012 Assembly elections. He had recently visited Tappal village in Aligarh, the epicentre of the farmers protest for higher compensation for land acquired for the Yamuna expressway by the Mayavati government.        
	Before meeting Manmohan, Rahul told reporters land acquisition was a big issue and the Centre needed to take a definite view on it. Told that the amended land acquisition bill was hanging fire, he said: I am aware of it. He simply nodded when told it was Mamata who was blocking the bill.        
	Following Mamatas opposition, the Centre had put the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill, 2007 which seeks to bring amendments to the Land Acquisition Bill, 1894  in cold storage despite the cabinet clearing it in July last year. Mamata had virtually threatened to walk out of the government if the bill was passed in its present form.        
	The agitation by Aligarh farmers has come in handy for the government to pressure Mamata to allow passage of the amended bill. Digvijay said: When a way out can be found on the nuclear bill through discussion, why cant this be done? The issue can be discussed with Mamata Banerjee.

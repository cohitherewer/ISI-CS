          RASHEED KIDWAI                                           Manmohan Singh in Hyderabad House on Tuesday. (PTI)		    
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: Some Congress leaders undertaking a cost-benefit analysis of the plenary feel that the Prime Ministers offer to depose before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) may open the floodgates of other ministers being summoned by various parliamentary panels.        
	Throughout today, AICC, PCC and DCC delegates called on Sonia Gandhi as part of state-wise interactions and photo sessions. Although Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi were not present in most of the frames, the two earned praise.        
	The general perception at 24 Akbar Road, the party headquarters, was that the Prime Ministers unprecedented offer to appear before the PAC has driven a wedge among Opposition ranks.        
	However, some Congress MPs have said they fear the offer will embolden other panels to call ministers  a step that was halted in the 1960s.        
	Congress managers involved with organising the plenary said the high point was the affirmation of Singh as a politician  the stirrings of which were seen during the nuclear deal stand-off with the Left.        
	A delegate, quoting an economist-ministers remark that Dr Manmohan Singh is the most overrated economist and most under-rated politician, said it was difficult to disagree with the second part of the observation.         
	At another level, Singhs plainspeak has cleared the air around a perception that in UPA-II, his position was becoming vulnerable. On the first day of the plenary, Sonia took the lead to offer handsome compliments as if she had some inkling of a low-whisper campaign that Singh may not complete full term as the head of the government till 2014.        
	Twenty-four hours after Sonias pep-talk, an assertive Singh spoke out, indicating that he was not only in command but also capable of political manoeuvres and leading from the front.        
	While Sonia retained her role as a field marshal making judicious use of in-house talent and resources, the 83rd plenary saw the rise of Rahul as the future leader.        
	Rahuls brief speech showcased him as a dreamer and visionary who has many ideas and plans whose time for implementation is about to begin.        
	The Congresss resolve to target the BJP-RSS on terrorism has evoked mixed responses. Conservative sections of the party are somewhat apprehensive Digvijay Singhs formulation that majority communalism is more dangerous than that of minorities may boomerang.        
	But the leadership appears to have taken a calculated risk to gauge the impact during the Assembly polls of Assam, Bengal and other states.

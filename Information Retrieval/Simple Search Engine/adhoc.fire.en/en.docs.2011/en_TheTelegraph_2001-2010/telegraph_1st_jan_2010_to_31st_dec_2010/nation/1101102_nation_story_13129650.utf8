          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 1: Students of a fake engineering institute, allegedly run by a senior professor of IIT Kharagpur, today demanded a CBI probe saying they had no confidence in the internal inquiry being conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology.         
	The affected students of the Institution of Electrical Engineering (IEE), running in Kharagpur for the past two years, wrote to human resource development minister Kapil Sibal to ask for the CBI probe.         
	Amit Kumar Ghosh, the head of the aerospace engineering department of IIT Kharagpur till last week, was president of the institute that lured students claiming it was a branch of the IIT.         
	We have been duped by professor Ghosh. He was running the fake institute IEE. Now our certificates do not carry any value since IEE is an unapproved institute, said M. Ramu, an affected student.         
	The institute, which was offering a diploma in electrical engineering, had not been approved by the All India Council of Technical Education, mandatory for an institute to offer a course in any technical subject.

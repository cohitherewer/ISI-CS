The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shashi slams IPL chief, cloud stays
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shashi slams IPL chief, cloud stays
          OUR BUREAU                      Sunanda Pushkar                          
	New Delhi, April 13: Shashi Tharoor has levelled specific charges against Lalit Modi in a statement but the factor most relevant to his role as a minister is his assertion that he neither invested nor received a rupee for my mentorship of the Kochi IPL team.        
	The iteration will stay under glare because Sunanda Pushkar, whom the junior foreign minister says in the statement he knows well, has been offered free equity by Rendezvous, part of the consortium that has bagged the IPL franchise for Kochi.        
	Tharoor added that whatever my personal relationships with any of the consortium members, I do not intend to benefit in any way financially from my association with the team now or at a later stage.         
	However, until and unless Rendezvous or Sunanda comes up with a credible explanation why she has been given the equity  so far unnamed sources have suggested the stake was given keeping in mind future contribution  a cloud will hang over the largesse which the Opposition has virtually termed an indirect bribe.        
	Tharoor has denied in the statement, which he issued today in his personal capacity after tweeting Ive had enough, Mr Lalit Modis allegation that I called him during his meeting with investors in the Kochi consortium in Bangalore on Saturday night in order to press him not to question the composition of the consortium.         
	But Tharoor said he did call Mr Modi to ask why he was further delaying the approval of the franchise when all the legal requirements had been fulfilled. As a public representative  Tharoor is an MP from Kerala capital Thiruvananthapuram  it is not unusual for a minister to pursue the case of his constituency. He has said a Kerala IPL team is a dream of many young people in and from the state.        
	But the disclosure of free equity for Sunanda  revealed neither by her nor by Tharoor but by his current adversary Modi  has changed the complexion of the ministers overdrive, drawing charges of abuse of official position.        
	It need not have been so had Tharoor or Rendezvous made such a disclosure the day the consortium bagged the franchise.         
	Tharoor has tried to defend himself by saying Rendezvous includes a number of people, including many I have never met, and Sunanda Pushkar, whom I know well.         
	The minister has also underscored the point that the consortium bid successfully in an open and transparent process. Their unexpected success upset the plans of a lot of powerful people, who had wanted the franchise to go elsewhere.        
	Beyond that, Tharoors defence rests on a series of charges against Modi but the statement does not shed light on the ethical questions the revelations have raised. The minister has steered clear of such issues by saying that contemptible efforts have been made to drag in matters of my personal life which I do not intend to dignify by commenting on them.        
	On Modi, Tharoor did not pull any punches. Various attempts were made by Mr Modi and others to pressure the consortium members to abandon their bid in favour of another city in a different state. Mr Modi raised assorted objections to the bid documents but finally had no choice but to approve them. His extraordinary breach of all propriety in publicly raising issues relating to the composition of the consortium and myself personally is clearly an attempt to discredit the team and create reasons to disqualify it so that the franchise can be awarded elsewhere.         
	Tharoor has given an almost blow-by-blow account, explaining why he had intervened. Mr Modi had held up approval by the IPL of the franchisee agreement earlier in the day, by insisting on the reversal of a change in the document that he himself had earlier suggested. This change was made, the consortium members flew to Bangalore and met with Mr Modi after that nights IPL game for what they had been told would be a routine exercise.         
	Instead they were submitted to a barrage of questions which led some to suspect that Mr Modi was seeking a further excuse to delay approval. This was the reason for my intervention with Mr Modi. Had he conducted himself in good faith throughout, no call would have been necessary.

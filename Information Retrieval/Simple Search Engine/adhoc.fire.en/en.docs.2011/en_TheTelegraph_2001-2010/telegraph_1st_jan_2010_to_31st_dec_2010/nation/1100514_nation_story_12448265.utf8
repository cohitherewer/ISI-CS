          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 13: The heat was scorching in the capital today, yet Jairam Ramesh managed to bring the mercury down by several degrees  but only for himself.        
	Both the Congress and the government said the environment minister was safe, at least for now.        
	But the message of Jairams survival came laden with intrigues typical of the Congress. While some said the minister  in a spot of bother since his dig at what he called the Centres alarmist attitude to China  had been let off despite an offer of resignation, others denied it. This group said he would be ousted at the right moment as sacking a minister on an issue involving China would send a wrong signal.         
	An official in the Prime Ministers Office confirmed that Jairam had indeed offered to quit on Monday itself when Manmohan Singh ticked him off for his indiscretion. The offer, the official added, had been rejected.        
	A few PMO officials, however, denied that Jairam had offered to quit.         
	Congress sources, too, dismissed suggestions that the minister had offered to resign. You are wasting your time on a false story, said a general secretary. I have checked, there was no offer or demand for resignation. Party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed talked of an explanation, not a resignation offer.         
	Sources said Jairam himself had flatly denied he had offered to resign. The minister refused to talk to the media.         
	Amid all the confusion, the message that came through was the minister would stay. But there was no denying that his image had taken a beating and his detractors were having a field day.        
	A cabinet minister burst out laughing when asked if Jairam, who had been nominated to the Rajya Sabha from Andhra Pradesh, would get a ticket this time from the southern state or Beijing. Jairams term in the upper House ends next month.        
	We have no problems with US lobbyists and there are many in this government, a senior leader said. Why so much fuss about a China lobbyist?         
	What should be a cause for concern for Jairam is the lack of support from friends in the party who have advised him to be more polite.

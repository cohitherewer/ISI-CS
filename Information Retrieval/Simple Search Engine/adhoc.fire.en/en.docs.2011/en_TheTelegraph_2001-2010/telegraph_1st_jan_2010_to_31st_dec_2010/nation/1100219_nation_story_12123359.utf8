          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 18: The Bengal cabinet today allowed leasing of vested land in municipal areas for 99 years to settlers, the move coming months before elections to 82 civic bodies.        
	Officials said such land would be leased only after it was proved that a settler had occupied it 20 years back. The leaseholder will have to pay Re 1 as salami (security) and land tax according to existing rates.         
	We have decided to give land where a person has been staying at least for 20 years. Also, the land should not be earmarked for a government project, state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said tonight. He added the monthly income of the leaseholder should not be over Rs 6,000.         
	Bhattacharya was evasive when asked if the move was cleared with an eye on the elections. It is a long-standing demand of the people who have been staying on government land. So we will have to this at any cost.

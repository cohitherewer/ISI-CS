The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoist tentacles in Telangana: Andhra
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Maoist tentacles in Telangana: Andhra
          OUR BUREAU                          Osmania University students after the high court verdict ordering removal of forces from the campus                                  
	New Delhi/Hyderabad, Feb. 19: The Andhra Pradesh government today claimed the Telangana movement was not student-driven and had been infiltrated by hardened Naxalites.         
	The claim was made while presenting the states case in the Supreme Court against a high court order that had thrown out paramilitary forces and the Rapid Action Force from within the Osmania University campus, the nerve-centre of the Telangana agitation.         
	It is our perception that there has been large-scale Naxalite infiltration into the Telangana movement, counsel for the state Harish N. Salve told the court while asking for a stay on the high court order. The situation is volatile there. Can we be told whether armed forces or para-military should be used?         
	Deployment, Salve said, was based on a daily review of intelligence inputs at the highest level. Can the high court decide that?        
	A two-judge bench stayed the high court order. The high court should have at least given 24 hours to the state government to respond, the bench said.         
	The state only got a few hours to rustle up a defence, its lawyers had claimed.         
	The bench, however, sounded a note of caution, saying unnecessary show of force (at this volatile juncture) might lead to unnecessary violence. When you deploy, why cant you have self-restraint?        
	The bench then stayed the order, but directed the state home secretary to personally supervise deployment within and outside the campus and ensure that no member of the armed forces misused his authority.         
	On February 16, Andhra Pradesh High Court, acting on a petition alleging excesses by the forces, had directed the state to immediately withdraw all paramilitary forces and the RAF from within the Osmania campus, remove all tents and barricades and maintain law and order with unarmed policemen posted at the police post inside.         
	Salve said courts could always order a probe into alleged excesses committed by armed forces, but the state government could not be prevented from erecting barricades to prevent mobs coming out of the campus into residential areas. Now there are no armed policemen all around. The Naxalites want a free run in the area, he alleged.         
	The statement had echoes of the Bengal governments claim during the Nandigram violence when it had said Maoists had infiltrated villagers groups fighting against land acquisition.         
	We have videographed the entire happenings on the campus, Salve said. The agitation (spearheading Telangana) does not appear to be student-driven.        
	The political divide over statehood has sharpened with Congress legislators from Telangana walking out of the Joint Action Committee. Henceforth, we will continue the Telangana agitation on our own and get a separate state, said former home minister K. Jana Reddy.

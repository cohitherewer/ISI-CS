          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: The Supreme Court will hear a Calcutta High Court Bar Association petition against a high court decision to let off state CPM secretary Biman Bose and party leaders Benoy Konar and Shyamal Chakraborty on contempt charges for speaking out against high court on Nandigram.        
	The trio had spoken out at a meeting on Rani Rashmoni Avenue in November 2007, a day after the high court declared the March 2004 police firing on villagers illegal.         
	The bar association had then moved a petition, claiming the leaders had tarnished the courts image. So, the high court issued notices asking them why they should not be punished for contempt but later let them off on a technicality.        
	The court can either initiate contempt suo motu (on its own) or act on a petition filed by an individual with the advocate-generals (AG) consent.        
	The high court dropped proceedings saying it could not initiate action on a petition filed by the bar association without the AGs consent.        
	But now the bar association and the Incorporated Law Society have filed an appeal, saying they had drawn attention to the leaders derogatory remarks, so the high court could not have let them off on grounds that the petition did not have the AGs consent.        
	Information of a contumacious act may be supplied by a private person through a petition without the consent of the advocate general and on the basis of such petition, the court may take cognizance suo motu, they contended.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: Congress president Sonia Gandhi has told the partys Andhra Pradesh unit to withdraw from the Joint Action Committee (JAC) on Telangana and stop adding fuel to the fire on the division of the state.         
	Sources said she was disturbed to find her party leaders being part of the problem the Centre was desperately trying to solve.        
	The high commands message was conveyed to the partys Andhra president, D. Srinivas, when he called on Sonia yesterday.        
	Sources said Sonia went to the extent of cautioning Srinivas that the Centre would be compelled to impose Presidents rule if the law and order situation continued to slide. Although the leadership doesnt favour such a move, Sonia is said to be unhappy at the incidents of suicide by students.        
	Sources said Sonia told Srinivas that the party should not go into agitation mode at a time the Centre was trying to resolve the crisis. She asked him not to allow Congressmen to indulge in pressure tactics like resignations and fasts but patiently wait for the Centre to spell out its next course of action. She said there was no need for a big party like the Congress to play second fiddle to smaller parties in the Telangana JAC.         
	Srinivas, on his part, is said to have conveyed to Sonia that the absence of any tangible signs of a forward movement on the creation of Telangana was creating unrest. He requested her to tell the Centre to move faster to convince the people that the issue had not been put into cold storage, and wanted a mechanism to divide the state announced without delay.         
	Srinivas had claimed after meeting Sonia yesterday that the leadership was serious about creating a separate state.         
	But the leadership made it clear again today that it would not come under pressure of deadlines and appealed to the people to maintain calm. Chief spokesperson Janardan Dwivedi told reporters that the first priority of the Congress was to restore peace and normality in the state.         
	The Centre is planning to announce some kind of a mechanism within the next few days. One option being considered is setting up a committee of bureaucrats for wider consultations. Another view supports a judicial commission to study the nature of bifurcation.         
	There is a feeling in the party that building up another violent campaign for a united Andhra will be difficult and there is not much risk involved in taking a forward step.         
	The judicial commissions terms of reference may mention the task of redrawing the boundary, the fate of Hyderabad, sharing of river waters and other resources. But if the government prefers a panel of bureaucrats, it will be a signal that the Centre is not prepared to reignite the flames before Parliaments budget session.

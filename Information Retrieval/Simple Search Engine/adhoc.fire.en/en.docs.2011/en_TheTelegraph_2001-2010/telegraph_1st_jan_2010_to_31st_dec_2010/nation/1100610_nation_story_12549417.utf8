	New Delhi, June 9: India will repeat its demand for voice samples of the handlers of the 26/11 terrorists when P. Chidambaram visits Islamabad later this month, home ministry sources said today.         
	We will again demand voice samples of Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed and Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi to match them with the samples we already have, said a ministry official. Saeed is the founder of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba, which India has blamed for the Mumbai attack. The Jamaat is an alleged front for the banned Lashkar.        
	The home minister is scheduled to hold talks with his Pakistani counterpart Rehman Malik on June 26 on the sidelines of a Saarc conference of home ministers. The home secretaries will meet a day before, the sources said.        
	Indian authorities had collected several voice samples when the terrorists, including the only surviving gunman Ajmal Kasab who was last month sentenced to death, were communicating with their handlers.         
	If Pakistan agrees to hand over the samples, they can be forensically matched with the ones sleuths in India have.        
	Pakistan has so far refused to give the samples despite repeated requests from India, and Chidambaram in particular.        
	Home secretary G.K. Pillai is expected to travel to Islamabad armed with evidence the National Investigation Agency is now collecting from its interrogation of US terror suspect David Coleman Headley, alleged to have done the 26/11 recce.         
	While India has Saeeds voice samples, the evidentiary value of any provided by Pakistan will be more.

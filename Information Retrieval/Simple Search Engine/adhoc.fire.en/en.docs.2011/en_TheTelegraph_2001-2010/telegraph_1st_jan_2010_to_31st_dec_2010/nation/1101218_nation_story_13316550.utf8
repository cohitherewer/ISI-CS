The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Law ministry bypass gives govt black eye
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Law ministry bypass gives govt black eye
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: Violation of established protocol of seeking law officers opinion only after a reference from the law ministry has put government departments in a spot on the 2G spectrum issue and the case of Prasar Bharati CEO Baljit Singh Lalli.         
	Until recently, when ministries had to seek legal opinion on any issue, they would send the files across to the law ministry which would refer the case to law officers. The law officers advice would be routed back the same way. In case of any differences, the matter was referred to the cabinet.         
	But in the spectrum allocation and Lalli cases, the telecom and I amp;B ministries either sought legal opinion within the department or went directly to law officers, bypassing the ministry.        
	Former telecom minister A. Raja ignored the law ministrys opinion in 2008 to refer the spectrum issue to an empowered group of ministers.         
	In a letter to the Prime Minister, he described it as out of context ostensibly because opinion was only sought on the limited point of how to process the too many applications for spectrum.         
	The law ministry had instead suggested a complete review of the policy decision to allot spectrum on a first-come-first-serve basis instead of auctioning it.         
	After that, the telecom minister sought the solicitor-generals opinion on further changes in the first-come-first serve policy just before issuing the first press release.         
	G.E. Vahanvati, who was then the solicitor-general and is now the attorney-general, cleared it without taking the mandatory consent of the law ministry.         
	The telecom ministry also procured three ill-advised legal opinions from a legal adviser brought in on a four-year deputation from the law ministry in 2007. The officer, Santokh Singh, was suspended on November 29, 2010. He was transferred back to the law ministry after the Supreme Court began hearing petitions about the 2G case.         
	Singh cleared the arbitrary change in the cut-off date for receiving applications for spectrum. This was later struck down by Delhi High Court.         
	The officer, who advised the telecom ministry on 2G and 3G spectrum, also said the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Central Vigilance Commission do not have the power to look into the ministrys policy decisions such as spectrum allocation.         
	Singh cleared the ministrys move to permit some companies ineligible to apply for licenses to change their share-holding patterns to become eligible.         
	In the Lalli case, additional solicitor-general Mohan Parasaran, on a reference from the law ministry, had recommended that there was prima facie evidence in the vigilance commission report of July 16 to refer Lallis case to the President to set the stage for a Supreme Court inquiry against him before he could be removed.        
	But the Prasar Bharati board under Lalli then went directly to the attorney-general for an opinion, paying hefty fees, the vigilance commission later found out. Attorney-general Vahanvati overruled Parasaran and said Lallis version should be considered by the information and broadcasting ministry before his case was referred to the President.

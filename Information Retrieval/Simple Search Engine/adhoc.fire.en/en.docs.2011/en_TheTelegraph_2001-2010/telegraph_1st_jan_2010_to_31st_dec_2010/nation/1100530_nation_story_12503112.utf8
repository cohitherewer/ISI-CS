          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 29: Five bombs were found near the railway tracks at Chaukipada today, barely 300 metres from the Jharsuguda junction in Orissa, a day after the train crash in Bengal.        
	A bomb-disposal squad, led by the district superintendent of police, reached the spot, around 374km from Bhubaneswar, at 7.30am and defused the low-intensity crude bombs in half an hour.        
	There was a brief disruption in services along the Howrah-Mumbai route. Only a goods train and a passenger train got held up for some time at the Jharsuguda junction. The situation returned to normal by 9am, said Kavita Jalan, the superintendent of police.                    
	The bombs were lying only 5 feet from the tracks. It appears to be the handiwork of mischief-makers who wanted to spread panic after the Bengal tragedy, Jalan said. The GRP is investigating the case with assistance from the district police.         
	A railway official said the place where the bombs were found was about 100km from the Jharkhand border.         
	Explosives haul        
	Police seized large quantities of explosives from a Maoist camp in the Baunsaguda forest, 60km from the rebel-affected Malkangiri district, yesterday. The Maoists escaped after they saw our personnel. They left behind the explosives, Malkangiri SP Anirudhha Singh said.

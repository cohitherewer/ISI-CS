The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mixed signals on Digvijay cop claim
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mixed signals on Digvijay cop claim
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Digvijay Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: Digvijay Singhs claim that police officer Hemant Karkare, who was killed in the Mumbai terror attack, was being troubled by Hindu groups has evoked a mixed response among Muslims in Uttar Pradesh.         
	The Samajwadi Party was disconcerted. The ruling Bahujan Samaj Party didnt sound perturbed.         
	A Digvijay aide said the Congress general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh made the statement to end Muslim alienation from our party in the state.         
	The aide explained: After the Ayodhya verdict, Muslims were upset with the Centre because willy-nilly, they were convinced that the catacylsmic events concerned with the temple-mosque dispute happened during a Congress regime and were directly or indirectly instigated by it.         
	After the judgment, the aide claimed, Digvijay wanted to issue a statement putting things in perspective. But the leadership was not keen on one, he said.         
	The effect was there to see in the Bihar polls. The Muslims drifted away from the Congress, he added. The aide claimed that after Digvijays claim about Karkares phone call, people, that is Muslim intellectuals and activists who stopped calling me after the verdict, re-established contact.         
	Others, though, are not so sure.         
	Masoom Moradabadi, the editor of an Urdu daily Jadid Khabar, said: Barring one newspaper, no other played it up.         
	Moradabadi, who was part of the Congresss group of war room strategists in for the 2009 elections, said: If Digvijay has evidence pointing to the culpability of Hindu terror outfits, let him pressure the government to start an inquiry.         
	Zafarul Islam, the president of the All India Muslim Majlis-e Mushawarat and editor of the Urdu fortnightly Milli Gazette, had a different viewpoint. I welcome Digvijays statement because Karkare is a hero for the Muslims. He was the first and only police officer to see the other side of things. The usual practice after a terror attack is to round up innocent Muslims, slap false cases against them and keep them in jail without trial Islam said.         
	Rasheed Masood, a Samajwadi Rajya Sabha MP from western Uttar Pradesh, accepted Islams point, but he was not sure how Digvijays statement would play out politically.         
	Muslims are no longer swayed by slogans and verbal flourishes. They vote according to a strategy. If Muslims deserted us in the 2009 polls, it wasnt only because of Kalyan Singh. It was because we didnt have another solid vote bank they could add to, said Masood.         
	Uttar Pradesh Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh agreed. If Muslims didnt root for us in Bihar, it was because the upper castes were not with us. The Muslims didnt want to waste their votes on us. Now in Uttar Pradesh, the Brahmins and Thakurs are annoyed with our general secretarys statement. He will have to quickly make amends. Or else even Muslims will see no point in remaining with the Congress.

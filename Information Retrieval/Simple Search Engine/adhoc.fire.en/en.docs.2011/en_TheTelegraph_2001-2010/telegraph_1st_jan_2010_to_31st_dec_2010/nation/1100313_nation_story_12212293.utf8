          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 12: Sonia Gandhi is gearing to sell the womens reservation bill as one of the Congresss biggest achievements, outflanking the BJP and the Left in the scramble to claim credit.        
	She met state Congress presidents today and asked them to take this message to the people by using the opportunity of the partys 125-year celebrations, being held across the country.        
	Sonia said these celebration programmes must not be simply routine  the message had to be properly articulated, drawing on the past, building on the present and projecting a vision for the future. The Congresss commitment to the empowerment of the aam aadmi must be conveyed with clarity.        
	Yesterday, Sonia had met party ministers, MPs and All India Congress Committee (AICC) officials and underlined the significance of the bills passage through the Rajya Sabha.        
	She hasnt indicated when the bill might be brought to the Lok Sabha but senior Congress leaders denied that the party was preparing to stuff it into cold storage. They said the bill would be passed in the budget session, which ends on May 7.        
	The Congress realises that the BJP is trying to squeeze mileage out of the crucial support it provided the bill in the Rajya Sabha. Sonia, therefore, has been clubbing the bill with the UPA governments other major initiatives such as the Right to Information (RTI) Act and the rural job guarantee scheme.        
	She told the state party chiefs that the RTI Act marked a revolutionary step for transparent governance, empowering citizens to hold us accountable for our actions.        
	The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), she said, has empowered the rural masses. The right to education will provide quality primary education to all our children  and now, the womens reservation bill.        
	The Congress had gone into overdrive after passing the NREGA too, activating the entire party machinery to advertise the achievement.        
	Sonia told the state unit presidents the results of the 2009 general election were an affirmation of the peoples faith in the Congress and that this was the time for consolidation. The youth must be made aware of the history of the independence struggle as no other party can claim to have a legacy as rich as ours, she said.        
	Sonia said the AICC was planning a series of national seminars on the freedom struggle. She added that the party would bring out several publications to mark the 125 years of its foundation.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Amar feels Maya pain
          OUR BUREAU                      Jaya Prada at the Delhi news conference where she defended Amar Singh. (PTI)                          
	Lucknow/New Delhi, Jan. 31: Hours after Amar Singh said he felt Mayavatis pain, she decided to give him some pain of his own to feel.        
	A letter from the chief ministers office (CMO) landed with the Uttar Pradesh police chief last evening prodding him to appoint a firm of chartered accountants to help a fraud investigation against Amar.        
	Nudged by Allahabad High Court, the police had last October filed an FIR accusing the then Samajwadi Party general secretary and his wife of merging some companies they owned to convert black money into white.        
	The letter asked the police to speed up the probe, on which the state government had so far been going slow.        
	You are directed to immediately take action and set up the special cell as per the high court directives. You are free to hire a CA firm so that the investigation could be completed on time, the letter said.        
	The police had sought the chief ministers permission to appoint a CA firm to help the investigations but the letter had lain with the CMO till it suddenly decided to act yesterday.        
	Just hours earlier, Amar, under attack from Samajwadi leaders, had said in an interview that he could sense the pain Mayavati had felt during the guesthouse episode.        
	He was referring to a Samajwadi attack in 1995 on the Lucknow state guesthouse, where Mayavati was staying, after she had withdrawn support to the then Mulayam Singh Yadav government.        
	 Mohan Singh, Amars successor as Samajwadi general secretary, said he was not surprised at Amars move. Now that he is facing probes in Uttar Pradesh in connection with more than one case, Amar Singh has no option but to build political bridges with the ruling party in the state, he said.        
	Jaya support        
	Samajwadi MP and actress Jaya Prada today publicly supported Amar, pointing to his poor health and warning that if anything happened to him, those Samajwadis who were targeting him would be responsible.        
	Who gave Mohan Singh the right to call Amar mad and shameless, she asked at a news conference . How can the statements he (Mohan) made against Amar Singh be described as the partys viewpoint? Mulayam Singh owes it to Amar Singh to check his new general secretary, she said.                    
	The former Bollywood star announced she would be part of the Lok Manch, the non-political forum Amar has floated to voice peoples issues.        
	Samajwadi official Ram Asresy Kushwaha, however, said both Amar and Jaya Prada were history for the party and demanded disciplinary action against them for attacking Mulayam and his family.        
	Party sources, however, said nothing would be done in haste. We will see how his Lok Manch pans out and what he says, a source said.

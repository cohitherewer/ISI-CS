The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | May Day church bar on Nepal Maoists
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      May Day church bar on Nepal Maoists
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, April 30: Maoists thronging Kathmandu for their grand May Day rally tomorrow are unlikely to get shelter in Catholic churches, after the communitys top body in India urged the Nepal Church to stay off politics.        
	The higher-ups in the Nepal Church had sought advice from the more experienced Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI) after Maoist leaders demanded accommodation for thousands of cadres coming for the rally.        
	The CBCI apparently advised against aligning with any political party as it would harm for the larger interests of the Church. The CBCI has a big say in the Nepal Church, which was part of Indian dioceses until 1983.        
	It is not advisable for any church body to align openly with any political party. The Nepal Church had asked for our opinion and we have given it. But the final decision is up to the Nepal Church, said a CBCI official.         
	The Maoists are going all out to make their rally historic and will demand the Nepalese governments resignation. They have declared an indefinite strike from May 2 if the regime does not relent.        
	The Maoists asked the vicar of the Assumption Church, among Kathmandus largest, to accommodate supporters for a few days. They had given the vicar 24 hours to reply. According to the CBCI official, the Maoists even threatened the priest with dire consequence if the reply was negative. The priest got worried and asked for our opinion, the official said.         
	The Maoists have also approached the Protestants churches in Nepal, though they are very few of them there.        
	The relations between the Catholic church, which runs a large number of educational institutions across the country, and the Maoists have never been good.         
	The rebels had forced shut a newly opened Church-run school in Simara town after a students union affiliated to the Nepal Maoist Party launched violent demonstrations over a hike in fees.         
	Several school buses were set ablaze earlier this month.         
	As many as 50,000 students are said to be studying in various Catholic schools across Nepal.

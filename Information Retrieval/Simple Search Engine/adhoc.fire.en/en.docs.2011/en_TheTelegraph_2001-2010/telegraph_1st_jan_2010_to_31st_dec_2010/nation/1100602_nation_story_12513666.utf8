          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 1: The Congress high command today sought imposition of Presidents rule in Jharkhand.         
	President Pratibha Patil accepted the cabinets recommendation, putting the state under central rule for the second time in two years. The Congress state units demand to somehow manage numbers to form the government was overruled by New Delhi.        
	The Union cabinet met this morning and took the decision on the basis of governor M..H. Farooks report, which clearly said no party or group was in a position to form a stable government.         
	The Soren government was reduced to a minority on May 24 when the BJP, which has 18 MLAs, and the Janata Dal (United) with two legislators, withdrew support.         
	The BJPs decision to snap ties with Soren, moved by the Opposition on April 27, was followed by ugly political bargaining with several flip-flops on JMM chiefs part.        
	The BJP was miffed with Soren because his party voted for the Manmohan Singh government in Parliament on cut motions.        
	 The Congress, which had initially adopted a hands-off policy to avoid getting into murky deals, later tried to sew up an alternative coalition.         
	Although the Congress high command was always worried about its image after the BJPs credibility took a huge beating in the state, its state unit argued the voters would detest the absence of a democratic government. The high command was, however, determined not to give the reins to the JMM.         
	The state party unit also tried to persuade ally Babulal Marandi, the chief of the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM), to accept a deal but the ministerial ambitions of too many legislators derailed the effort.        
	The Congress leaders have not lost hope yet of forming the government.         
	The Congress, with a strength of 14, and ally JVM with 11, will require 17 more MLAs to form a government. The party may make a fresh bid after the Bihar elections in October.

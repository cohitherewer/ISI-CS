The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Omar feels let down by Delhi
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Omar feels let down by Delhi
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      A police car after being set on fire in Srinagar on Monday. (AP)                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 13: The continuing deadlock is frustrating for Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah, who had renewed lobbying for the withdrawal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) from central Kashmir districts.        
	According to reliable sources, he had been assured that the Centre would clear the way for lifting the act partially.        
	Among those Omar met in New Delhi before leaving for Srinagar this morning were UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Union home minister P. Chidambaram, who is known to favour partial lifting of the AFSPA.        
	Tensions emanating from the current logjam could well sour his relations with New Delhi and create friction between the National Conference and the Congress.         
	In what appeared to be a concerted exercise, Omar had called his own cabinet to meet while the CCS was in session at the Prime Ministers house in expectation of a major announcement from New Delhi.        
	The first clue to the absence of any breakthrough came from Srinagar. Prompted by signals from New Delhi, Omar called off his cabinet meeting with an anti-climactic and customary appeal to people to refrain from violence.        
	Although Omar has refrained from public articulation of his exasperation, sources close to him say he has begun to nurse a sense of being let down by New Delhi. This is the second time in less than a week that Omar has expected a major announcement that has failed to emerge from New Delhi.         
	But a section of opinion at the Centre is also veering round to the view that Omar is putting too much onus on New Delhi at the cost of leaving his own house in disorder.        
	Law and order is essentially the state governments responsibility and despite receiving all possible support from the Centre, he has failed to deliver, said a senior Congress leader who did not want to be named. At the end of the day, running Kashmir is his responsibility.

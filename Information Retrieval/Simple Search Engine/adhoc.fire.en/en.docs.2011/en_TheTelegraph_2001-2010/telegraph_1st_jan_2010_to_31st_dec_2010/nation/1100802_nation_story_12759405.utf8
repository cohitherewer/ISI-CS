	Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 1: K.M. Mathew, 93, a doyen of the Malayalam media and chief editor of the Malayala Manorama group of publications, died at his home in Kottayam this morning.        
	Till the very last, he visited the Manorama office every day. People from various professions gathered at his home to pay their last respects. The body, kept for public homage at his home, would be taken to the Manorama office tomorrow ahead of the 4pm funeral.        
	Mathews 56-year stewardship of the media house witnessed the papers growth into one of the countrys top-selling vernacular dailies with a circulation of 17 lakh.         
	The Padma Bhushan awardee kept himself largely away from the limelight but possessed personal charm and warmth. His newspaper leant politically towards the Congress, a legacy of his fathers participation in the freedom struggle, and took care of the commercial interests of pro-Christian farmers, especially rubber growers.        
	Mathukuttichayan, as he was fondly called, enjoyed the fierce loyalty of his employees because he was sensitive to their needs.        
	Marxist chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan said: Although the Left had sharp differences with his political and ideological positions, Mathew was one of the few editors who deeply influenced Kerala society over the last five decades. Even when he opposed the policies and perspectives of the communists, he always ensured that the opposing views were also accommodated in his newspaper.

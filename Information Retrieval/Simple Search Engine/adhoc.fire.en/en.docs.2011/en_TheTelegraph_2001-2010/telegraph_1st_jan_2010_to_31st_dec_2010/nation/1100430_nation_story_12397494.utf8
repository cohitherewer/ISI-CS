                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Spy who drove 600km from Pak for friends 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                                    Dr Khemraj and wife Dr Champa Sharma in their clinic in Rajouri district; Madhuri Gupta       
	Srinagar, April 29: When Madhuri Gupta, the Indian diplomat alleged to be spying for Pakistan, and her two college friends fixed a get-together last month, she travelled all alone and all the way from Islamabad to remote Rajouri in Jammu  a meeting that is now under the scanner of intelligence agencies.         
	Madhuri and her friend Prem Lata, a doctor running a clinic in Delhi, had visited the house of their common friend Dr Champa Sharma in the Sunderbani area of Jammu on March 29.         
	Prem Lata said all three had been pre-medical students at New Delhis Lady Hardinge College in the late seventies.        
	Madhuri Gupta came all the way from Islamabad in her official car to reach Sunderbani and I flew by air to Jammu from Delhi and later boarded a car to that place, said Prem Lata.         
	So did Madhuri drive all alone to Sunderbani, which would be a journey of around 600km from Islamabad? Yes, she can do it. She drove in her official car which had an Islamabad number, Prem Lata said.         
	That car later aroused the suspicion of an army unit based in Sunderbani, which is some 80km from Jammu.         
	Prem Lata said some armymen came to the house of Dr Khemraj, Champas husband, to enquire about the suspicious vehicle. They were told that Madhuri is a diplomat and after checking the facts, they left, she said.         
	Both Champa and her husband are under the scanner of intelligence agencies over that visit.         
	Khemraj today said Madhuri was just an acquaintance whom he had last met over 25 years ago until her March visit.        
	They (the two) had stayed here for two days and it was only because she was a friend of Prem Lata who is, in turn, a long-time friend of my wife Champa Sharma. Prem Lata had phoned us that she and her friend would be visiting us, he said.        
	Officials said the two were questioned by agencies about that meeting. They have been co-operating and nothing untoward has been found so far, an officer said.        
	Prem Lata, however, said the three had been friends for over 30 years. We were studying together in pre-medical at Lady Hardinge College (during the late 1970s). Champa and I later became doctors while Madhuri joined the IFS, she said.         
	Madhuri and I would meet occasionally and it was after a long time that we fixed a meeting with Champa. It was very hot here (in Delhi) and we decided to go to Sunderbani, Prem Lata said.        
	So did she notice anything suspicious about Madhuri? Not at all. She cannot be an anti-national. She cannot be involved in this. She is very bold and will tell people on their face and this may have led her to trouble, Prem Lata replied.         
	She also defended the doctor couple from Rajouri. They are decent people and are being unnecessarily dragged into this controversy, she said.        
	Khemraj said he had earlier met Madhuri during his posting in the Ramban district of Jammu. That was in 1984. She was on her way to Srinagar and met us en route, he said.         
	Khemraj denied having any contact with Madhuri over phone or email. There was no contact after 1984 till she came on March 29 and stayed with us for two days, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Ahmedabad, Jan. 20: IPS officer Geeta Johri, convener of the special investigation team probing the 2002 riots, has offered to resign after being pulled up by the Supreme Court in the investigation of the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case which, ironically, she had cracked.        
	The SIT was set up by the apex court to investigate the riots. SIT head Raghavan said he had received the resignation letter from Johri. I will discuss with her and then forward it, he said.        
	Johri, the first woman IPS officer from the Gujarat cadre, had investigated the Sohrabuddin encounter case, which she concluded was fake. Her report subsequently led to the arrest of three IPS officers.        
	However, the Supreme Court, which recently transferred the case to the CBI, pulled her up for poor investigation. The court rapped Johri for trying to obfuscate the inquiry by talking about Sohrabuddins criminal record.        
	Johri said she was disgusted. I can answer questions raised about the investigation in the Sohrabuddin case and other cases, but I am disgusted with personal allegations that have been thrown at me, she said.

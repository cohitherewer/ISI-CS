The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Paternity suit on Tiwari survives 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Paternity suit on Tiwari survives 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      N.D. Tiwari                          
	New Delhi, March 17: A Delhi High Court division bench has rejected veteran politician N.D. Tiwaris plea that a paternity suit against him be dismissed because it was filed too late, saying human relations cannot be treated in the same manner as commercial or civil transactions.        
	The court will now hear the suit filed by Rohit Shekhar, who has claimed that Tiwari is his biological father. The original case was reported by The Telegraph in October 2008.        
	The 84-year-old Tiwari, who had to resign in ignominy as Andhra Pradesh governor after allegations of a sex romp in the Raj Bhavan, had sought dismissal of the paternity suit on the ground that it was not filed within three years of the petitioner turning 18.        
	Shekhar, now 30 and a lawyer, had petitioned that Tiwari had shortchanged him and his mother Ujjwala Sharma since 1995 and refused to meet them.         
	The division bench today asked: Could it then be expected that on feeling neglected, Shekhar should have immediately run to court? The court cannot, at the incipient stage, delve into Shekhars mind in order to ascertain the time at which he felt that he had no alternative but to go to the extreme of moving the court which is always a point of no return.         
	At one point, the division bench said: An infidelity by a spouse is condoned by a subsequent conjugation. By the same yardstick Tiwari had renounced Shekhar between 1995 and 2002, would then he be expected to file a suit if relations had mended thereafter? We do not have before us an explicit and public statement made by Tiwari at any stage prior to the filing of the application, denying or disowning his fatherhood.        
	The court directed all parties to appear before a single judge on April 7, when the suit would be heard. Last year, a high court judge had said the case could not be heard in Delhi and should be filed in Hyderabad since Tiwari was Andhra governor then.        
	But the division bench said: Since the rejection or repudiation of parentage by him occurred in Delhi, it is meritless to contend that the court has no jurisdiction. The plaint is replete with incidents which have transpired at his residence in Delhi.

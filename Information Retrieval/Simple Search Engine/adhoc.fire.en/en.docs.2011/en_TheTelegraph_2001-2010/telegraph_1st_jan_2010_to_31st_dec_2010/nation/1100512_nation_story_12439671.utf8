The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Afzal   defence from Omar
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Afzal   defence from Omar
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                     
	Srinagar, May 11: Omar Abdullah today appeared to defend Afzal Guru when he said the Parliament attack convicts glamorous name was behind the calls to send him to the gallows quickly.        
	I believe he (Afzal) is at number 30 in the line (of those) waiting to be hanged. Why dont you ask questions about the 29 that come before him instead of focusing your attention on one person just because his name happens to be more glamorous? the Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said in Jammu when asked about Afzals death sentence.        
	Omar said Afzal guru or anybody else who has been sentenced to death by hanging has recourse to appeal to the President. I feel law will follow its own course, he said after addressing an ex-servicemens rally at the Northern Command headquarters in Jammus Nagrota.         
	Omars comments came against the backdrop of growing calls to hang Afzal  who is from Sopore in Kashmir  since last week when Mumbai attack convict Ajmal Kasab was given the death penalty.         
	Omars National Conference had opposed the sentence when it was in the Opposition and had even asked the President to consider his mercy plea favourably. But after the party came to power last year, it has avoided the issue fearing a strain in ties with ally Congress.

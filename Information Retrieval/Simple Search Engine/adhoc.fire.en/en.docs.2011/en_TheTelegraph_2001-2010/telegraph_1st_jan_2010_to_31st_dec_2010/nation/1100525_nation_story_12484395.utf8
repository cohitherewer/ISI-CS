          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Security forces on vigil at a forest Dantewada                                  
	Raipur, May 24: Six militia members, including a self-styled commander, were arrested in Dantewada last night, more than a month after Maoists used a red herring to ambush a CRPF foot patrol in a Chhattisgarh forest and massacred 76 personnel.        
	SP Amresh Mishra said the six were rounded up from Kottabura village, some 4km from Chintalnaar where the massacre took place on April 6, following a tip-off.         
	Though not hardcore members of the CPI(Maoist), Jan Militia commander Barsa Lakhma and the five others  Oyam Hidma, Podiyami Hidma, Kawasi Budra, Oya Ganga and Dura Joga  played a vital role in what became the rebels bloodiest attack on security forces.        
	A day before the attack, CRPF personnel had lost a wireless set in Chintalnaar. During interrogation, the militia members revealed that they had handed over the gadget to a Maoist strike squad camping in the area.         
	According to Mishra, the rebels had anticipated that the security personnel would come looking for the wireless set and laid a trap. Lakhma did not have much information on the hierarchy or the strategies and operation of the red army. He reported to Papa Rao, the CPI(Maoist)s Jagargunda area commander, Mishra said, adding that the gadget was used to intercept CRPF messages.        
	During interrogation, Lakhma also revealed that some 300 rebels had participated in the April 6 operation. Of them, 190 were hardcore Maoists from company No. 8 of the CPI(Maoist) while the rest were Jan Militia members.

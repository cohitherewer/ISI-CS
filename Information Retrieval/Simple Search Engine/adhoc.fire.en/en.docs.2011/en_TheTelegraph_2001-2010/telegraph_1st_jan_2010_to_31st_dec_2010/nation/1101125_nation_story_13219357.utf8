The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Test for BJP: how to ensure Nitish doesnt do a Naveen
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Test for BJP: how to ensure Nitish doesnt do a Naveen

	New Delhi, Nov. 24: The BJP is hoping to leverage its 90 per cent strike rate in Bihar to re-position itself as a strong nucleus of the NDA coalition.        
	But the party also realises that its ambitions can be achieved more on the terms and conditions spelt out by its allies, present and prospective, and not necessarily according to the script it used in the past.         
	That essentially means that like in the late 1990s when it relegated its pet ideological issues to the background to take its first serious shot at power in Delhi, the regrouping and enlarging of the NDA might entail ejecting its stars like Narendra Modi from the main political frame and not uttering a word on provocative subjects like Ayodhya.         
	Tough calls to take but then we cannot let the Congress rule forever, can we? asked a central leader, credited with taking a pragmatic view of coalition compulsions.        
	The results prove that the only alternative to a Congress-led coalition is the NDA. Our Bihar coalition government ran smoothly for five years. We have run other coalition governments too. The NDAs strength should increase. These elections can be the launching pad, said Arun Jaitley, the Rajya Sabha Opposition leader.        
	The BJP believes it can recreate the ambience of the nineties and even thwart the emergence of a third front if the CPM  that fancied itself as the kernel of such a grouping  gets considerably weakened after the Bengal and Kerala elections. The CPMs friends  the AIADMK, Telugu Desam Party and the Biju Janata Dal  might look for a non-Congress option that the NDA might offer.        
	If the BJP was a direct beneficiary of the pro-Nitish wave that swept the state insiders conceded the point the party looked at its spectacular showing in a nuanced perspective. Especially after the initial flush of victory and the delusions of grandeur that a sharper strike rate might have induced were somewhat tempered.         
	Unlike the Congress that seemed palpably inclined to jettison its allies wherever it could, the BJP nursed no illusion of going solo in the near future.        
	This alliance paid off because we respected and accommodated our partner in every way, despite reservations within our own party. We have proved we are a more reasonable ally than the Congress. If Congress leaders had shed their egos and tied up with Lalu and Paswan, we might have got just a simple majority, a source said.        
	The BJP had calculated that its exemplary behaviour in Bihar vis--vis allies might send a message to its former partners such as the BJD and the TDP that sundered their links when Hindutva began dominating its political discourse.         
	We paid a price in Orissa where the BJD made it on its own, rued a source, recalling that the BJP could have distanced itself from the Sangh fraternity when the attacks on Christians began.        
	The fear that Nitish Kumar might do a Naveen Patnaik when Narendra Modi went on a self-projection blitzkrieg last June during the BJPs national executive prompted the central leaders to rein in the Gujarat chief minister.        
	Realising that Nitish will be one of its most valuable leaders in the 2014 elections  because its existing allies like the Akali Dal might be unseated before that and the Shiv Sena is caught up in a family spat  the BJP laid down some ground rules to keep him on its side.        
	Foreground development in its political discourse and not get distracted by ideology. This was the reason why Ravi Shankar Prasad, who went gung-ho on the Ayodhya verdict, was told not to mention it in his campaign.        
	Accept the same terms of portfolio-sharing as in 2005. Keep Sushil Modi as the deputy chief minister because he supposedly shares the best rapport with Nitish in the BJP after Jaitley.        
	Reinforce the perception that the BJP was a friend of the minorities. Nitish transferred his Muslim votes to us only because we were able to fight the notion that we are anti-Muslim by keeping Modi and Varun Gandhi out, a source said.        
	The immediate fallout of Bihar on the BJPs internal power dynamics might be that Modi  a prime ministerial aspirant  might remain grounded in Gujarat, and Varun, whose acolytes think he will be Uttar Pradesh chief minister someday, might not go beyond being a youth leader.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoists mow down divided forces, force surrender of arms in Bihar
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Maoists mow down divided forces, force surrender of arms in Bihar
          GAUTAM SARKAR                                            
	Aug. 30: Seven security personnel were killed in an encounter with Maoists in Bihar on Sunday and several injured survivors appeared to have handed over their weapons after the guerrillas issued an ultimatum to surrender or die.        
	The costly mission and suggestions of an ignominious surrender  one survivor said the personnel were ordered to get down on their knees  has triggered a blame game between state and central forces.        
	The state forces accused the CRPF of decamping when the firing started while the central force said the over-ambitious police wanted to corner credit for themselves and acted in haste without making adequate preparations.        
	The battle unfolded in the Kajra hills, part of the inaccessible Kodashi valley, 30km from southeast Bihars district headquarters of Lakhisarai and about 150km from Patna.        
	 A search is on for 11 missing security personnel in the woods, some of whom may have been taken hostage, sources said. The Maoists later reportedly demanded the release of their jailed comrades.        
	The forces, numbering around 80 and comprising the state auxiliary police (SAP), Bihar Military Police (BMP) and the CRPF, had entered the picturesque valley to weave a trap around the Maoists.         
	But it turned out to be a trap in reverse. The Maoists, numbering around 400, fired on them from behind bushes, caves and the thick foliage for over four hours, killing seven jawans. Seven were wounded and are recuperating in Patna Medical College Hospital.        
	Angry at the loss of lives, members of the Bihar Policemens Association allegedly beat up the Lakhisarai superintendent of police, Ashok Kumar Singh, when he went to bring the bodies.         
	The BMP and SAP jawans alleged that the CRPF men had promised cover fire but fled.        
	A CRPF officer alleged that the force was kept in the dark about the purpose of the mission. Ashok Kumar Singh sent the requisition of 34 CRPF personnel for routine patrolling. But he sent the CRPF team with another 43 BMP personnel for an ambush inside the highly inaccessible valley between two hill ranges. We remained completely in the dark about the move, said the CRPF officer.        
	The officer claimed that local intelligence sources had hinted at the presence of Maoists at the Sitla Kodashi hamlet inside the valley.         
	In order to take the credit, the officer put us in the dark. If we were intimated, we would have been better prepared, the CRPF officer said.                  
	Asked about the allegation, Singh said: I deputed Bullan Yadav, the officer in charge of Kabaiya, as he had knowledge of the topography but unfortunately, he failed to establish co-ordination with the CRPF and was killed.        
	Satyendra Giri, an SAP jawan from Aurangabad district, said: The Maoists took away 17 to 18 rifles from us. I suffered an LMG (light machine gun) shot in my hand. They were just too many. But somehow we fired back. It was not that we were afraid and tried to run away. We fought them.         
	Rajkumar Choudhary of the BMPs 10th battalion was the most serious among the injured. I got hit in my right arm, my right ribs and right thigh. We were going down a hillock when the CRPF suddenly stopped and asked us to move while they would back us. As soon as we were down, we reached an area surrounded by hills. I somehow sensed this could be a trap. We had hardly moved a few yards when the firing began. It was hell after that, he said.         
	Choudhary said the men quickly took up whatever positions they could. We fought back. We should have had back-up fire. We were ordered to surrender and get down on our knees. They gave us a choice to surrender or die, he said.        
	Choudhary did not specifically say so but the loss of a large number of weapons suggests that the injured personnel did as they were told at gunpoint.        
	Another jawan said the personnel did obey the Maoists.        
	Kapil Sah, an SAP jawan, said: The bullets were coming from all sides. We fought with whatever we had. But they were up on the surrounding hills and had an upper hand. We needed cover fire, but the CRPF team did not help. I was hit by two bullets. Once we knew that we couldnt overcome them, the firing stopped. One of the Maoists shouted, Surrender karo, varna maar denge (surrender or you will be killed). We obeyed him. They took our arms, including my SLR (self-loading rifle).

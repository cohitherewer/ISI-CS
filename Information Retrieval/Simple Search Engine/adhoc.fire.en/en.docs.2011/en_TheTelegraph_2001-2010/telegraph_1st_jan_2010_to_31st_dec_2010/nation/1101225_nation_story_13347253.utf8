          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Dec. 24: The BJP today demanded Manmohan Singhs resignation over the 2G scam on moral grounds, alleging that he directly or indirectly gave his approval to the spectrum allocations for which A. Raja is being probed.        
	The Prime Minister in a way directly or indirectly gave his approval. Therefore, he should take the moral responsibility and quit, BJP president Nitin Gadkari said in Jammu in response to questions about the scam and raids on tainted Commonwealth Games boss Suresh Kalmadi today. L.K. Advani claimed there were seven tainted ministers in the Singh government.        
	Gadkari wondered how the pricing of the spectrum allocation  which was allegedly sold cheap at a huge loss to the national exchequer  was not decided by the ministerial group on telecom.         
	Rajas letter, which has appeared in the media, says it all. Therefore, the Prime Minister has no moral right to continue, he said.        
	Raja had written to the Prime Minister saying there should be no difference in the treatment of existing and new firms on spectrum allocation .

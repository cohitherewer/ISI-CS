The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Yeddy edge after court bars rivals
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Yeddy edge after court bars rivals
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Yeddyurappa                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 13: Chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa appeared headed for victory in tomorrows trial of strength after Karnataka High Court today gave the go-ahead for the floor test and rejected a plea from the disqualified Independents to be allowed to vote.        
	The order came on a day a BJP delegation led by L.K. Advani met the Prime Minister to demand governor H.R. Bharadwajs recall.        
	The five Independents had also pleaded that their votes be put in a sealed envelope and counted later in case the court stayed their disqualification by Speaker K.G. Bopaiah.        
	But the bench threw out their plea. The court, however, added that the confidence vote would be subject to the decision it gives on Monday on the writ petitions filed by all the 16 disqualified MLAs  11 from the BJP and the five Independents.        
	We are satisfied that the ends of justice will be met if the proceedings that will happen in the Assembly are ordered to be subject to the decision of the writ petitions before the high court, Chief Justice J.S. Khehar said.        
	The decision means it is advantage Yeddyurappa in a House whose effective strength is now 208. The BJP, which needs 105 votes to stay on in power, claims the support of 106 MLAs.        
	Observers said it could be status quo unless the court overturned the Speakers decision to disqualify the MLAs on October 18.         
	Political sources in Bangalore, however, said it was unlikely the court would come out with a ruling on the case because of a technical glitch in the petition, which the petitioners wanted to be amended. The court is expected to first hear the amendment plea before taking up the main case.        
	In a sign that the balance of power was tilting in Yeddyurappas favour, an Independent MLA, who had not been disqualified as he had not withdrawn support to the government in writing, returned to the ruling camp. In the interest of the state and stability of the government, I have decided to vote for the BJP government, PTI quoted Varthur Prakash as saying.        
	The BJP, not wanting to leave anything to chance, has issued a whip to its MLAs to be present and vote.        
	In the afternoon, Advani, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and M. Venkaiah Naidu called on the Prime Minister to demand Bharadwajs recall.         
	Jaitley told reporters that Bharadwaj had failed to detach himself from his political past. Notwithstanding the ministerial offices he held in the past, he was never perceived to be a respecter of democratic and constitutional institutions, he said.        
	Jaitley also questioned the governors volte-face. If the recommendation for imposing Presidents rule under Article 356 was based on good and cogent grounds, how did he implicitly overrule himself within a day? he asked.        
	Jaitley said there should not have been a second (trust) vote because the Speakers ruling on the first one was conclusive. But to avoid a constitutional confrontation, we agreed to face it.        
	Asked what the Prime Ministers response was, he said: He heard us, thats all.        
	In Bangalore, Bopaiah told marshals not to allow non-members, including disqualified MLAs into the House tomorrow for the sake of smooth proceedings, PTI quoted him telling reporters.

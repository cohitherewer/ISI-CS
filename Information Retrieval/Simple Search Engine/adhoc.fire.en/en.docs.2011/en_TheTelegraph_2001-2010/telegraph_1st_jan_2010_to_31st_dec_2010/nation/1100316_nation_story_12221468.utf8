	Mumbai, March 15 (PTI): A court today rejected the bail plea of encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma, arrested for alleged involvement in a fake encounter.        
	The court observed that it was a serious offence and there was evidence against Sharma.        
	On November 11, 2006, Ramnarayan Gupta, an aide of gangster Chhota Rajan, was killed in an encounter at Versova.        
	Sharma said in his plea that he had been falsely implicated in the case and that police were fabricating evidence against him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi wont let China overshadow PM trip

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	Tokyo, Oct. 24: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is unlikely to let China dog his visit to East and Southeast Asia that started as he landed in the Haneda airport here on Sunday night.        
	He is also not expected to allow himself to be drawn into a debate on whether India should be sucked into an anti-China front that could balance equations of power in the wide swathe of the Asia-Pacific region.        
	An early indication of Singhs intent came when word was out that India will not sunder military links with China, despite provocations and irritants like expansionist designs in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), denial of regular visas to prospective travellers from Jammu and Kashmir and a senior army official serving in the state and flawed maps of the Northeast.        
	It is learnt that India and China will carry on holding flag meetings, interactions between their border security forces and high-level defence exchanges. But there was no hint that joint military exchanges will be held.        
	Indias position was that while both sides were committed to the full resumption of military exchanges  suspended after Lt Gen. B.S. Jaswals visa was stamped on a loose sheet  it would not speculate on whether a resolution was in sight or not.        
	That the India-China relations were far more complex than made out to be by casual geo-political power theories was also evident in Delhis reluctance to outline what was likely to be on the table when Singh met Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on the sidelines of the East Asia and Asean summits in Hanoi on October 29.        
	The only information was that regional and global issues of mutual concern would be discussed. There was no commitment on whether the visa problem or the discourse over the revaluation of the yuan after the grossly under-valued currency allowed China to flood international markets with its goods would figure at the talks.        
	India, it was learnt, was still in the process of assessing how far Chinas ambitions in PoK had got. The signal was that neither Indias foreign office nor the Prime Ministers Office was willing to predict Chinese behaviour.        
	India is unprepared to accept the suggestion that the idea to get Russia and US on board the East Asia summit at Hanoi was part of an agenda to use it as a counterweight to checkmate the dragon.        
	Its contention is that since the US and Russia hogged a huge portion of the trade with most Asean and East Asia coalition countries and since two-thirds of Russia was as good as in Asia, it was a logical extension that Asia-Pacific should be part of such enterprises. The strategy, it was underlined, was fundamental for the economic integration of the regions.        
	It was also said that China was not the regions only rising power. Indonesia and South Korea were equal contenders.        
	Indias equation with Japan  Singhs first port of call  or its expectation of the equation seemed straighter, focused and unmeshed in geo-political power play, now that India has decided it wants to opt out of an anti-China coalition.        
	There was a recognition from India that its relationship was strategic in more than one sense and that it transcended a defence engagement.        
	First, economics arising out of the perception that Japans ageing population forced it look farther to sell its raw materials and technology. Excellent political conversations over Afghanistan and the Indian Ocean. Last, the civil nuclear co-operation pact that has run aground because of local resistance in Japan.        
	But the fact that entrepreneurial prod and the Japan governments keenness to facilitate nuclear trade with India lit up the faces of South Blocks policy makers. Something that divided us (India is not an NPT signatory) is uniting us was how an official put it.

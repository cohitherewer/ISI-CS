The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RSS leader quizzed on blast
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      RSS leader quizzed on blast
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          Indresh Kumar at the CBI headquarters in New Delhi on Thursday. (Prem Singh)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: RSS leader Indresh Kumar, who was named in the Ajmer blast case of October 2007, was today questioned by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) over the Mecca Masjid explosion in Hyderabad in May that year.         
	A CBI officer said Kumar had been summoned as his name had cropped up during the grilling of some suspects in the Hyderabad attack that killed nine people.         
	Kumar allegedly organised a meeting where the terror plot was hatched. We are questioning him to crosscheck the evidence we have got, the officer said.         
	But the RSS leader alleged a political conspiracy.         
	I have been called here for no rhyme or reason. Its a political conspiracy to implicate me in the case, he said outside the CBIs headquarters. The grilling lasted four hours.        
	Kumar, who was named by the Rajasthan anti-terror squad in the Ajmer chargesheet two months back, arrived with his supporters, who shouted slogans against the government, around 1.30pm.        
	I have been living a transparent life ever since my birth and association with RSS. I have devoted my entire life to the nation, he told reporters.        
	His questioning comes days after a controversy over a WikiLeaks cable that claimed Rahul Gandhi had told a US envoy that Hindu radicals posed a greater security threat in India than the likes of Lashkar-e-Toiba.        
	A notice for Kumars questioning was served on the RSS headquarters in Delhi under Section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code.        
	The section empowers an investigating agency to summon any person who is witness to or acquainted with circumstances or facts of a case under probe.

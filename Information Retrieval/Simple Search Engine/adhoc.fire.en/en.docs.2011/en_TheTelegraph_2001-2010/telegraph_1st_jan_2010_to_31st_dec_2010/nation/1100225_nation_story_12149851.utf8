          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 24: Railway minister Mamata Banerjees intention to invite the private sector to set up businesses spanning from auto hubs to bottling units for water and simultaneously establishing healthcare and educational facilities on a massive scale could well serve as a case study in unrelated diversification.        
	The minister dedicated a significant portion of her budget speech to welcoming industry to utilise land, air and other assets owned by the railway ministry.         
	She also announced several social initiatives such as the setting up of 522 hospitals and diagnostic centres as well as educational institutions including 50 Kendriya Vidyalayas, management institutions and even five sports academies.        
	Mamatas attempts to expand into new areas, some of which highlighted the human face of the ministry, seem to have raised a few questions.        
	The minister extended some initiatives that have already been undertaken by the railways such as bottling water, setting up logistic hubs and creating passenger amenities close to railway stations. While public-private participation to develop these further and other projects like auto hubs and logistic centres make sense as a philosophy, one cant help wonder why the railways would focus extensively on non-core activities like healthcare and education, said Pricewaterhouse Coopers executive director Vishwas Udgirkar, who tracks the sector.        
	Ernst amp; Youngs executive director (infrastructure) Jayesh Desai asked: Ancillary logistics and infrastructure are necessary. However, it would have been more encouraging to see more public-private participation in the railways core activities such as track laying.        
	There seem to be some doubts surrounding the implementation of the railway ministers ambitious plans for creating logistics-oriented facilities in the PPP model.        
	The intention is right but the railways have to do a lot of preliminary work to present the right framework that will encourage the private sector to come forward, Udgirkar said.        
	Fortis Hospitals CEO Vishal Bali also voiced concerns on the implementation of projects on such a large scale. If the minister is unlocking land owned by the ministry, it is indeed a positive sign. However, the difference between intention and execution is the key. Setting up 522 hospitals and diagnostic centres is a Herculean task. And co-ordinating with state governments  if that is the plan  for a national roll-out may turn out to be very cumbersome.        
	Mamata, however, seemed to be aware of industrys scepticism even as she invited the business community to join hands with the railways. Sometimes they (the business community) have problems. They are keen to invest but their proposals are unduly delayed by a typical negative approach. We need to overcome the situation, the minister said.        
	To cut out administrative and procedural delays that discourage prospective investors, she announced the setting up of a special task force that would clear proposals for investments within 100 days.        
	Our policy guidelines will be made easy, simple and investment-friendly. In creating infrastructure with private capital, we will create wealth for all and we will be benchmarked with the best, she promised.

                              Viveka Babajee                            
	Mumbai, July 4 (PTI): Viveka Babajees family today released photographs and purported Internet messages exchanged between the model and stock analyst Gautam Vora to prove they had a relationship before the woman allegedly committed suicide.        
	The family alleged that Gautam had lied to the police about the nature of his relationship and demanded that he come out with all (the) truth.        
	In the second statement issued by the family since Vivekas death on June 25, its representative Dale Bhagwagar released seven photographs that show Viveka and Gautam together and Gmail chats and Facebook messages. The printout copies of Vivekas Gmail and Facebook accounts and the photographic evidence, which signify their relationship as a couple in love, have been handed over to the police, Bhagwagar said.        
	Displaying copies of the messages, he told a news conference: On different occasions, referring to Viveka, (Gautam) wrote my love, I miss u, I love u, love u, and cant wait to be in my Vivekas arms. This strongly suggests that they were in love.        
	Viveka, 37, had been found hanging from the ceiling of her fifth-floor apartment in suburban Bandra.        
	Bhagwagar said the family was waiting for the police investigation to finish before it decided its course of action. If the police probe says there is a suspicion on Gautam, the family will do what the police ask it to do. If not, the family will fly (back) to Mauritius with no complaints.        
	The familys statement says: The Babajee family requests Gautam Vora to immediately approach the police and come out with all the truth about Viveka. Without further delay, they also want Gautam to confess to the police what exactly happened in the last meeting on the night before the incident, because, from his behaviour, it seems there is much more than what meets the eye.        
	Bhagwagar said five of the seven photographs had been clicked in Goa. He referred to Facebook messages to Vivekas friend Rachel Smith  one of which says I will be flying to Mauritius early next month for project  to prove Viveka had not been depressed, as claimed by Gautam.         
	These messages suggests that Viveka was busy with her schedule. Moreover, she was not financially weak.        
	Two days after the suicide, Gautam had approached a sessions court for anticipatory bail. The court had directed the police not to arrest Gautam without giving a 72-hour notice.

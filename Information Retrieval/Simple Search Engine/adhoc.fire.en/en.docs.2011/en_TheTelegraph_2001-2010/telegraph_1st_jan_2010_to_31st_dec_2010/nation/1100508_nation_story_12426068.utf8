          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, May 7: Governors cannot be sacked with every change of guard at the Centre, the Supreme Court has said in a ruling that may spur dismissed governors to move court if they feel they were removed for political reasons.        
	A governor cannot be removed on the ground that he is out of sync with (the) policies and ideologies of the Union government or the party in power at the Centre (or because) the Union government has lost confidence in him, said a five-judge bench headed by outgoing Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan.        
	A change in government at the Centre is not a ground for removal of governors to make way for others favoured by the new government, it added, noting the issue had gained importance at a time many states are ruled by regional parties whose policies may differ from the Centres.        
	Ruling parties do want their own men in Raj Bhavans to gain advantage during formation of the state government (the governor decides which party to invite first in case of a hung Assembly) and to keep the state government under pressure (the governor can recommend dismissal).        
	The court made three points:        
	The President (who acts on the governments recommendations) can remove governors only on a case-by-case basis        
	Can do so only for valid reasons, such as those relating to his physical/mental inability, integrity and behaviour        
	And while the President need not disclose or inform the cause for his removal to the governor, it is imperative that a cause must exist        
	The ruling, therefore, makes it nearly impossible for new governments at the Centre to attempt en bloc replacement of governors appointed by the previous administration as has happened in the past. (See chart)        
	It can also open the way for unprecedented lawsuits from recalled governors.        
	The court said if an aggrieved governor could demonstrate prima facie that his removal was arbitrary, mala fide, capricious or whimsical, the court would ask the Centre to reveal to it the material on which the President had taken the decision.        
	If the Centre failed to give any reason, or if the reasons were found to be irrelevant, arbitrary, whimsical or mala fide, the court would interfere  although it would not interfere just because the material or reasons were insufficient or lent themselves to interpretations.        
	The top court was ruling on a PIL filed by former BJP member of Parliament B.P. Singhal challenging the July 2, 2004, removal of the governors of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana and Goa by the UPA government.        
	To justify its ruling, the court cited two principal reasons:        
	Governors are not the Centres agents or employees but hold their office at the pleasure of the President. They are not expected or required to carry out the governments policies or popular mandates, and have a constitutional rather than political role.        
	Reputable elder statesmen, able administrators and eminent personalities are expected to be appointed governors, the court said. While some of them may come from a political background, once they are appointed governors, they owe their allegiance and loyalty to the Constitution and not to any political party.        
	The arrival of the coalition era in Indian politics means the ruling party at the Centre will be faced with many state governments formed by parties with rival ideologies and policies. Besides, the compulsions of coalition politics may force parties to frequently change their policies and agendas.        
	In such a scenario of myriad policies, ideologies, agendas in the shifting sands of political coalitions, there is no question of the Union government having governors who are in sync with its mandate and policies.        
	The Justice R.S. Sarkaria commission that studied Centre-State relations had said states should be consulted when governors are appointed to them  a suggestion endorsed by the Constitution Review Panel headed by former Chief Justice M.N. Venkatachalaiah. The normal tenure of a governor is five years.

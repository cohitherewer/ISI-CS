The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | State spells out mining parameters 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      State spells out mining parameters 
          AMIT GUPTA                          A mine in Lohardaga                                  
	Ranchi, Aug. 30: Local value addition, employment generation and adoption of latest techniques are the parameters that will henceforth determine which companies will be granted mining leases in the state.        
	The state-level co-ordination and monitoring committee, which is supposed to monitor and minimise delays in grant of approvals for mineral concessions to investors in the mining and industry sectors, took a decision to this effect today.        
	At todays meeting, a three-member committee comprising secretaries of mines, industry and commercial taxes departments was also constituted. The new committee was told to work on the above parameters and also assess the financial strength of a particular company applying for mining lease, prospecting licenses or reconnaissance permit in the state.        
	The committee is expected to fine tune the parameters within a fortnight so that the pending applications (if any) for mining lease proposals get disposed within three months. Only the companies following the laid down criteria would be given a go ahead, chief secretary A.K. Singh said, while speaking to The Telegraph.        
	The decisions were the outcome of the maiden meeting of the monitoring committee chaired by Singh. It was attended by secretaries of the mines, industry and revenue departments, among other senior officials.        
	Better co-ordination of different departments like mines, revenue and forest, among others, is also expected in the near future to minimise delays in grant of approvals.        
	On June 18, Union mines secretary Santha Sheela Nair, while chairing the third meeting of the Central Coordination-Cum-Empowered Committee in New Delhi, stressed on the need to set up such a committee in every mineral bearing state with the aim to monitor and minimise delays in grant of approvals.        
	Nair called upon the representatives of the states, including Jharkhand, to constitute coordination-cum-empowered committees under the chairmanship of the chief secretary or additional chief secretary/principal secretary of the mining/industries department with representation from all concerned departments/institutions. The same meeting was attended by state mines secretary N.N. Sinha.         
	The state-level coordination committee is expected to facilitate coordination between departments for better management of land, and to ensure that clearances/NOCs/approvals are given by the forest, environment and other departments in a streamlined manner.         
	It is also expected to monitor process of approval of concessions and compliance with concession conditions and to ensure a computerised database, effectively integrated with other state level databases.         
	The committee is also expected to prepare an action plan to tackle the illegal mining by incorporating central and state agencies.        
	The state has not recommended any new mining proposal for a long time, following the mining scam unearthed by different central and state agencies probing the Madhu Koda scam. Cases of undeserving players getting the mines are not uncommon here while illegal mining is rampant in West Singhbhum, Lohardaga and Gumla, among other districts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC seal on MP fund
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      SC seal on MP fund
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 6: The Supreme Court today upheld the constitutional validity of the MPs local area development fund, saying mere allegations of misuse of the funds may not be a ground for scrapping the scheme.        
	Bhim Singh, president of the Jammu and Kashmir Panthers Party, had filed a petition challenging the scheme on the ground that it violated the concept of separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. Under the scheme, each MP gets a grant of Rs 2 crore every year for the development of his or her constituency.        
	Judicial interference is permissible when action of the government is unconstitutional and not when such action is not wise or that the extent of expenditure is not for the good of the state. We are of the view that all such questions must be debated and decided in the legislature and not in court, a five-judge bench headed by outgoing Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said.

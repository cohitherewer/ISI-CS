The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MP govt divided on Uma return
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      MP govt divided on Uma return
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, July 12: The prospect of Uma Bhartis return to the BJP has divided the Madhya Pradesh government and the state party unit with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan wanting the door to stay shut on the sadhvi.         
	Chauhan, who has led the BJP state government for about four years now, as well as state BJP chief Prabhat Jha are counting on senior party leaders such as Suresh Soni, Ananth Kumar, Sushma Swaraj, Venkaiah Naidu and Arun Jaitley to block the rebel leaders return.         
	Yesterday, Chauhan and his supporters spent the entire day chalking out a strategy to counter Uma. The chief minister then reportedly conveyed to BJP and RSS top-rung leaders that her presence would prove detrimental to the BJP in Madhya Pradesh.         
	Chauhan reportedly said that Umas absence from the party had strengthened the organisation and helped it retain power in the state in 2008. He is believed to have pointed out that the Congress would use the sadhvis past criticism of senior leaders L.K. Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee to belittle the BJP.         
	But two of Chauhans senior ministers, Kailash Vijayvargiya and Babulal Gaur, have openly supported Umas return. Gaur told The Telegraph that Umas homecoming would strength the partys prospects in the Bihar Assembly polls due this year end.         
	Veteran BJP MPs Sumitra Mahajan and Kailash Joshi too have issued statements asking the central leadership to induct Uma without delay.         
	The buzz around Umas possible return gained momentum when Nitin Gadkaris aide said the BJP president would welcome back all those who had left the party.         
	Soon after, Jaswant Singh returned to the fold. Then Uma was seen with L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh at Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singhs fathers funeral rites, lending more credence to the talk of her return.         
	Generally, an expulsion order in the BJP means the functionary cannot get his membership back before six years. Uma has been out of the party for five years already.

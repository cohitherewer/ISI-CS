	New Delhi, Aug. 25: Few in the BJP were apologetic after the party helped pass the nuclear liability bill in the Lok Sabha today.        
	The picture contrasted with the fissures seen when the party had helped pass the womens reservation bill in the Rajya Sabha this March against the wishes of its OBC MPs in a rare show of bipartisan politics.        
	The good conduct had gone down well with the Congress but many BJP MPs saw the support on the womens bill as a sellout that would harm them in the long run.        
	No such misgivings appear to have surfaced this time. Reason? The BJPs strategists ensured that quite a few of their amendments were adopted by the government, some reluctantly. In the process, any insinuation that the party might have sold itself short will be convincingly answered, senior leaders suggested.        
	The most crucial change the BJP forced was in sub-clause (b) of clause 17 that legalised a nuclear plant operators right of recourse against suppliers. The change was accepted in the face of resistance from suppliers lobbies in India and abroad.        
	The government agreed to delete the word intent. In one stroke, it strengthened the operators case because they will no longer have to prove that the suppliers of equipment and plants had intentionally wanted to cause a nuclear accident.         
	It will be enough to establish that the incident resulted as a consequence of an act of supplier or his employee, which includes supply of equipment with patent or latent defects or sub-standard services.        
	The amendment was moved by Jaswant Singh  taken back by the BJP after 15 months of expulsion. But the phraseology was worked out by Rajya Sabha Opposition leader Arun Jaitley in concert with Union minister Prithviraj Chavan.         
	Sushma Swaraj, Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha, held it up as a triumph. The government accepted it without changing a comma or full stop.        
	Many in the Congress-led ruling UPA admitted that without the BJP, the bill would have fallen through. This is too important a bill to divide the country and polity, a Congress minister said.        
	He recalled the governments huge political cost for the Samajwadi Partys support after the Left pulled the plug on UPA-I over the Indo-US nuclear deal. Our time was spent meeting the Samajwadis never-ending demands, which were non-political, the minister said.        
	This time, with the BJP on its side, the government ensured the Lefts sting on the liability bill was neutralised. It also didnt have to agonise over the Yadav trio  Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh and Sharad.        
	The government is now counting on the BJP to see through the amended Enemy Property Act, which controls the fate of 2,168 properties left behind by those who renounced their Indian citizenship and migrated to Pakistan.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sharmishtha Chatterjee outside the court. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Calcutta, June 24: Lawyers have threatened to stay away from Calcutta High Court after police tonight forced them out of a courtroom they had occupied to protest inadequate seating arrangements.        
	 Some women lawyers alleged that they were assaulted and harassed by plainclothesmen but the police rubbished the charges, saying lady constables were deployed to control the situation.        
	Around 30 lawyers had occupied the courtroom (No. 20) on the third floor since Thursday afternoon, claiming that it had been given to court registrars without informing them.        
	There are over 3,000 lawyers who have no place to sit in the high court. Around 200 lawyers squeeze into a 150sqft room and we have been demanding a new place for years. However, on a directive of the registrar-general, renovations were made to courtroom No. 20 without our knowledge. The courtroom was shut for the past four months and now it has been turned into an air-conditioned room for 13-odd assistant court registrars, said Rana Mukherjee, secretary of the Calcutta High Court Bar Association.        
	The association, which has 5,500 members, had been allotted 15 registered rooms. It had also taken over two empty rooms.        
	The lawyers today spread their reach to the 1,000sqft room on the third floor, occupying it after the court hours from around 4.30pm. They also pasted a paper on which was written 16 in order to claim that the room is in addition to the 15 allotted to them.        
	When word reached the Chief Justice, M.S. Shah, he asked registrar-general Murari Shrivastava to call the police and get the room vacated. Thursday was Shrivastavas first day in office.        
	A team of policemen entered the court around 11pm and forced out the agitating lawyers.        
	We were kicked and punched by the police. They tugged at our clothes and dragged us down the stairs. We pleaded with them and sought talks but they refused to relent. Many of us have been injured. Our bags containing our cell phones and money were also left behind in the room, said Sharmishtha Chatterjee, a lawyer who claimed that a policeman had pulled her.        
	The police denied the charge and said one policeman suffered cuts in his hand.        
	The agitation continued till late in the night with the lawyers squatting outside the court. They have also threatened to widen their protest beyond Calcutta to other districts.        
	Officials said Calcutta High Courts third complex, a 10-storey building, was set for inauguration this September. Then each and every lawyer will have a place to sit and desk to write on, an official said.

	Melbourne, Feb. 17 (PTI): A Melbourne court has ordered the release of two Australian teenagers detained for attacking a group of Indians on the ground that the case was filed long after the alleged crime.          
	The judge said that though the sentence was lenient the decision was taken because of the delay in appealing against it. The brothers had in December 2008 attacked eight Indians in a store in Sunshine. One of them was in coma for 15 days and had suffered brain injuries.                   
	Dehra Dun (PTI): A five-year-old male leopard was killed after being caught in a snare at Lagha in the Kalsi forest here on Tuesday, the third such incident in the district in a week. A post mortem is being conducted to determine the exact cause of death. Fourteen leopards have died this year in Uttarakhand.                  
	Kochi (PTI): Kerala High court has stayed for three weeks the demolition of two check dams at two estates belonging to the Tata group-owned Kannan Devan Hills company at Munnar in Kerala.                   
	Srinagar (PTI): Militants attacked a police post in Pulwama in south Kashmir and took away five rifles and some ammunition, police said. No injuries have been reported. Three policemen who were not present at the picket have been suspended.                  
	Tanakpur (PTI): Three Nepali men were arrested along with arms at a bridge on the Nepal border near this Uttarakhand town, police said. A 12-bore gun, a cartridge and a khukhri have been recovered. They have been booked under the Arms Act.                  
	 Kozhikode (PTI): Six persons were injured when a bus fell into a 60-feet-deep gorge, after it tried to take a turn on the Wayanad-Kozhikode highway near Thamarassery on Wednesday.

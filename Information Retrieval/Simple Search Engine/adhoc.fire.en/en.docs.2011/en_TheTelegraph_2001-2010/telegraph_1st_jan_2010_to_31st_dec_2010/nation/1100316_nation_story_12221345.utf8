          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 15: Indian defence authorities today abandoned a ballistic missile defence test after the target misfired and fell into the Bay of Bengal.         
	The test involved the launch of two missiles  the target, simulating a hostile incoming missile, and the Pradyumna Prithvi Advanced Air Defence System (the interceptor) that is designed to knock out the adversary.         
	A Defence Research and Development Organisation officer said the interceptor was not fired because the target veered off its trajectory after it was launched from a complex in the Interim Test Range in Chandipur on the Orissa coast.         
	The interceptor was to be fired from Wheelers Island.

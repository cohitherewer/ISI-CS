	Lucknow, Jan. 23: The striking employee slapped by the Lucknow collector yesterday was today arrested before a probe into the incident, which provoked a staff backlash that crippled public services across Uttar Pradesh, could start.        
	The employee, identified as Ram Prakash, 32, has been charged with preventing staff from joining work, causing law and order problems and misbehaving with senior officials. The class four employee, remanded in judicial custody by the Lucknow chief judicial magistrate, was earlier suspended for not being in his office.        
	Prakash works in the Etawah office of the agriculture department but had come to deliver documents to the head office at Lucknows Krishi Bhavan, where district magistrate Amit Ghosh slapped him in full view of colleagues and TV cameras yesterday afternoon.         
	Ghosh, whom Prakash apparently failed to recognise, was angered by the employees refusal to show his ID card when the DM had gone along with other officers to check attendance following a strike call, dubbed illegal by the Mayavati government, given by some unions.        
	The employees were also protesting a baton-charge by police on Thursday while demonstrating over pay-related matters.         
	The Lucknow commissioner last evening ordered a probe into the incident, which sparked demands from the unions for Ghoshs suspension and intensification of the agitation, paralysing even basic services like hospitals.        
	Ghosh had admitted late last evening that he lost his cool and slapped the employee, but additional director-general of police Brij Lal denied the incident. We dont know about it, Lal had said before the probe was ordered.        
	The Opposition Congress and the Samajwadi Party backed the employees demand for the DMs suspension when they raised the matter in the Assembly today. Rita Bahuguna Joshi, the state Congress chief, dubbed Ghoshs behaviour unbecoming and said her party was behind the employees. Party leaders will hold demonstrations from tomorrow.

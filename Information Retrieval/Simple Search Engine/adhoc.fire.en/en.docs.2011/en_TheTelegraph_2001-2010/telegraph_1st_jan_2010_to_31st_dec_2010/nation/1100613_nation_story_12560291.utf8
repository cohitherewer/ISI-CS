          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Dibrugarh, June 12: Nine students had to be hospitalised after the headmaster of a school in an Assam village allegedly beat them up in an inebriated state today. He has been absconding since.         
	Local sources said Chandreswar Miri Baruah, the headmaster of Gurudev Middle English School at Bordeori village in Lakhimpur district beat up several students of Class VI around noon after they allegedly failed to reply to some of his questions.         
	One of the students said, The teacher who was supposed to take our class was not present and we were just sitting in class talking when our headmaster suddenly entered and started asking questions. When we could not answer, he started beating all of us with a big stick. As the students cried out in pain, teachers came out from other classes and took him away.        
	The student alleged that Baruah could hardly stand and also used abusive language as he beat them up indiscriminately.         
	The injured students were admitted to Narayanpur primary health centre, a source said. They were released late this afternoon.         
	Since the children are from a backward village, about 390km from Guwahati, their parents did not lodge any complaint either in the school or with police.

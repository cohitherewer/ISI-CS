The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Yatra in tense J amp;K

	Srinagar, June 29: The Omar Abdullah government, facing the worst crisis in its 18-month reign in the form of protests over alleged civilian killings, has another security challenge at hand: the Amarnath Yatra, starting tomorrow.        
	Official sources said the government was worried that militants and stone-throwers may target the yatris. This could further deteriorate the situation in the Valley and trigger a communal backlash in Hindu-dominated Jammu.        
	If the yatris are targeted, the CRPF may retaliate. This could cause more casualties and lead to further trouble. The situation is extremely volatile. Some stone-throwers may exploit the situation, one officer said.        
	Another officer added another threat perception by saying there were specific inputs that Lashkar-e-Toiba militants were planning to target the yatris on the Srinagar-Baltal route, one of the two ways, to the shrine.        
	We are taking no chances. Our men will remain deployed on both routes. We have asked our men to be extra vigilant. Security forces are already stretched thin because of the ongoing disturbances, so there may not be additional troops available but we will make our men work overtime to ensure a safe yatra, the officer said.        
	The annual pilgrimage takes place through the traditional Jammu-Pahalgam route in south Kashmir, via Anantnag. The other route, relatively new, passes through Baltal in central Kashmir as well as Srinagar.        
	Both the CRPF and state police will guard the two routes to the 3,888-metre-high shrine. The army will oversee the higher reaches.        
	The governments worries increased after street protests spread to Anantnag. Two people died in the town today which means the situation will remain tense for many days ahead. The situation in Srinagar is already bad, the officer said.        
	The first batch of yatris will leave Jammu tomorrow and the pilgrimage will conclude on August 24, coinciding with Shravan Purnima. Sources said over two lakh pilgrims had so far registered for this years yatra.        
	Shri Amarnath Shrine Board additional CEO Saugat Biswas promised adequate security. Whatever has been done in past (for the security of the yatris) will be done this time, he said.        
	Protesters in the Valley had not targeted the yatris even during the peak of the 2008 anti-Amarnath land agitation, but fears of trouble remain. The 2008 flare-up began after government allotted 100 acres to the shrine board, triggering an agitation in the Muslim-majority Valley and a pro-land agitation in the Hindu-dominated areas. The trouble lasted months and more than 50 protesters died in alleged firing by security forces.

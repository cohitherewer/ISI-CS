	 Lucknow, Aug. 21 (PTI): One of the tyres of a Delhi-bound Air India flight, with 140 passengers and six crew on board, burst when the plane was taxiing for take-off from Lucknow around 9.45am today.           
	The pilot noticed smoke from one of the engines, which possibly occurred because of overheating, and applied emergency brakes leading to the tyre burst. The take-off was aborted and the passengers were asked to get off. They were later put on another flight.

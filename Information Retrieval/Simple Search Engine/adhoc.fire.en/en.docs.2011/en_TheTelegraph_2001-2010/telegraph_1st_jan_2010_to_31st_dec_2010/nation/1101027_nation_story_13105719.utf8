The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi plays a waiting game 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi plays a waiting game 
          ARCHIS MOHAN                           Barack Obama                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: Whether Prithviraj Chavan or Salman Khursheed is ahead in the race to be the US Presidents minister-in-waiting is food for thought at Raisina Hill, while an Obama Platter cooks at the Bukhara not far away.         
	The role of a minister-in-waiting is mostly ceremonial  to wait on the visiting dignitary and accompany them to important events.         
	But being minister-in-waiting to the US President carries its own charm, at least for some. Kapil Sibal, then the minister of state for science and technology, played the role during George W. Bushs visit in 2006 and still talks fondly of the experience.         
	For Barack Obamas November 6-9 visit, the frontrunner is science and technology minister Chavan but minority and company affairs minister Khursheed is a close contender, sources said.         
	Chavan, 64, has the edge, the sources said. For one, he is well versed with the Indo-US nuclear deal. As the minister in charge of the department of atomic energy, he helped the Prime Minister to shepherd the nuclear bill through Parliament. Besides, as minister of state in the PMO in both UPA I and UPA II, he has Singhs trust.         
	The science and technology ministry will along with the defence ministry be the focus of talks between the two delegations. Chavan is an engineer who did his masters from the University of California, Berkeley, and spent time researching in the field of defence equipment.         
	But Khursheed represents a minority community and was a minister of state for external affairs in the Narasimha Rao government.         
	All 440 rooms in the Maurya Sheraton, which has hosted Bush and Bill Clinton, will be reserved for the Obama team. Obama will stay at the presidential floor, which includes a library and a 12-seater dining room.         
	Sources said the hotels Bukhara restaurant will serve an Obama Platter. During external affairs minister S.M. Krishnas visit to the US in June, Obama had told him: I intend to create an Obama Platter. I am told one of Secretary Clintons favourite restaurants in Delhi has added a new item to the menu  the Hillary Platter. Turning to Clinton, he asked: What does it have  chapati?         
	Its got all kinds of things, Clinton responded. All kinds of things it is  murgh malai kabab, seekh kabab, paneer tikka, tandoori aloo, sikandari raan, dal bukhara, tandoori jhinga, mixed raita, naan and kulfi.

          SANJAY K. JHA                                        Digvijay Singh    
	New Delhi, July 21: Looks like Rahul Gandhi may just have to check his tongue from now on or be prepared to face the music.        
	Under the latest gag order issued by the Congress, Rahul has the right to comment only about the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), the two organisations he is in charge of. Thats if the gag is meant for all persons across the board.        
	Congress media department chairperson Janardan Dwivedi has written to all party office bearers that they can interact with the media only on their allotted areas of responsibility. The written order has come about after repeated verbal warnings failed to get desired results.        
	If the gag order is implemented in letter and spirit, a lot of people would have to measure their words. Rahul would, for instance, have to avoid commenting on burning national issues as he is in charge of the Youth Congress and the NSUI only. That would take some doing because Rahul is used to speaking on anything under the sun.        
	If the Congress declares that Rahul, one of the many AIIC general secretaries, is outside the ambit of the gag order, it will be accused of imposing discipline selectively.        
	Many more people would be just as affected. Mohsina Kidwai, the senior-most general secretary and the tallest Muslim leader of the party, would not be able to speak on minority affairs. Since Imran Kidwai heads the AICC minority affairs department, he would become the sole spokesperson on Muslims. His deputy, Anees Durrani, would be able to comment too as he stands empowered by the circular. But Mohsina, who is in charge of Punjab, Himachal and Kerala, would have to observe a studied silence.        
	Motilal Vora, the oldest leader, would be the worst affected. As AICC treasurer, the 82-year-old would be free to speak only about the partys finances. He would not be able to talk politics, although he has been chief minister, governor and MP several times.        
	But since Vora has the additional responsibility of administration of 24 Akbar Road, he would be free to talk about clerks, peons, drivers, chairs, ACs and the very popular canteen on the premises!        
	The voluble Digvijay Singh would virtually have to stitch his mouth, except with regard to his assigned state Uttar Pradesh. Sources suspect the gag order is primarily directed at him as he speaks on everything and the media lap up his comments.        
	Digvijays articles on the Naxalite issue had triggered controversy, compelling Dwivedi to issue the first gag order. But Digvijay responded by reiterating on television everything that he had put in print.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | GP, the tenacious fighter for democracy
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      GP, the tenacious fighter for democracy
          SURENDRA MOHAN                           Girija Prasad Koirala                                  
	The passing away of Shri Girija Prasad Koirala, the former Prime Minister of Nepal, has removed from the political scene a courageous, but sober, public figure.         
	GP, as he was popularly known, was the last surviving brother among the Koiralas, headed by Shri B.P. Koirala, the eldest among them, who was a charismatic figure.         
	It was as if the tradition of struggle for democratic rights was part of family history. Their father, a renowned scholar, faced the wrath of the then ruler of the country for his independence of thought and was banished from the country.         
	In their childhood, all the Koirala brothers lived in hardship in Varanasi, and learnt to persist in their resolve to oppose authoritarian rule in Nepal.         
	Living in Varanasi and Patna, they came close to Indian freedom fighters and were gradually attracted to Jaya Prakash Narayan. All the Koirala brothers, and a large number of Nepalese politicians, joined the Quit India struggle launched by Mahatma Gandhi on August 8, 1942.         
	G.P. Koirala started his political activities in Nepal as a trade union organiser in Virat Nagar and Birganj. He founded the Nepal Trade Union Congress which faced repression from the employers as also from the government.         
	After King Mahendra dissolved the first fully and freely elected National Assembly and dismissed the government headed by the Nepali Congress leader B.P. Koirala, the NTUC was banned.         
	After BPs release and banishment to India in 1968, the leaders and workers of the Nepali Congress and other fighters for democracy used to call on him. I met GP during those years. I found him to be unassuming and keen to keep abreast of events.         
	GP came into his own after the premature demise of B.P. Koirala in 1981. He was elected general secretary of the Nepali Congress.         
	Running the organisation was becoming an arduous task. The Nepali Congress launched civil disobedience under the joint leadership of Ganesh Man Singh, K.P. Bhattarai and GP.         
	In 1989, the government of India headed by Shri Rajiv Gandhi refused to renew the Tariff and Transit Treaty between India and Nepal, and the common people in Nepal faced tremendous difficulties.         
	The Nepali Congress decided to hold a big protest rally for the restoration of democracy.         
	GP arrived in New Delhi, and with my assistance, was able to meet leaders of various parties and persuade them to join the conference.         
	Chandra Shekhar, H.S. Surjeet, Indrajit Gupta, Chitto Basu and Tridib Choudhury were among the leaders who addressed the conference. The tremendous response from the people compelled King Birendra to hold elections and the Nepali Congress formed the government.         
	It was then that he sought to revive the Nepal Trade Union Congress, and invited Shri Umrao Mal Purohit, general secretary of the Hindu Mazdoor Sabha, to provide support and guidance to the new leaders of the NTUC.         
	I accompanied Shri Purohit and we were able to ensure that the spadework for it would be smoothly under way.         
	During the next 10 years, GP headed the government twice.         
	However, after the assumption of power by Gyanendra, authoritarian tendencies came up again. The National Assembly was dismissed, yet all parliamentary parties, except the party headed by GP, accepted his invitation to join the government.        
	In the beginning of 2005, the Nepali Congress and the other parties decided to launch a peaceful movement for the restoration of the National Assembly.         
	Enraged, the king got an old GP manhandled, assaulted and humiliated. It was the signal for a big upsurge.         
	A delegation of Indian politicians visited Kathmandu in September 2005 when the parties were on the point of launching the second phase of their agitation.         
	In the meantime, the CPI (Maoist), a group which had broken away from the Nepal Communist Party (United Marxist-Leninist) in 1995 and had resorted to armed struggle, had become quite powerful.         
	The armed forces of the country had failed to curb their rising power. The king had been using this failure as a pretext, blaming it on political parties and their governments.         
	G.P. Koirala took the initiative to consolidate all the democratic parties in a seven-party alliance. The alliance held a big rally and in it, GP challenged the Maoists to decide whether they were with the monarchy or with the democratic forces.         
	The pressure of public opinion compelled the Maoists, headed by Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai, to join in negotiations with the alliance leaders. An agreement was reached, and the peaceful agitation of the people, buoyed by this total unity, erupted to bring half a million people on the streets of the capital. The king was forced to give up power.         
	GP was active all through, despite his ill health.         
	He was Prime Minister and was suffering from acute heart ailment when I saw him last in 2007. He could not even attend the wedding of his grand-daughter. Yet, he provided the leadership or advice to ensure that the democratic experiment worked.         
	The present deadlock must have got on his nerves. Now, a resolute and fearless public figure who fought tenaciously for democratic rule has passed away.         
	As a lover of freedom, as a fellow socialist and as a dear friend, I offer him my salutations.

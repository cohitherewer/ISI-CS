The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nuanced Maoist stand with panchayat push 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nuanced Maoist stand with panchayat push 
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Manmohan Singh at the panchayati raj conference in New Delhi. (AFP)                                   
	New Delhi, April 24: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today called for special attention to ensure effective functioning of panchayati raj institutions in remote and backward areas, saying it would help counter the Maoist challenge.        
	We should pay special attention to ensure that panchayati raj institutions function effectively in remote and backward areas, which include tribal areas, he told a conference on panchayati raj. This will help us in tackling the challenges such as the Maoist menace.        
	Singh said the government was aware of the problems faced by panchayats and was keen to ensure funds, functions and functionaries for them.        
	Some Congress leaders welcomed Singhs stress on empowering marginalised sections through panchayati raj institutions as they feel home minister P. Chidambaram had not been able to effectively articulate the partys holistic approach on the subject.         
	It is a matter of perception, said a senior leader who didnt want to be named. Somehow, a message has gone out that the home minister was pursuing a one-eyed policy.         
	During a debate in Parliament on the Dantewada tragedy, Chidambaram, too, had said development was necessary, but argued that it wouldnt be possible till the Maoists were tamed.         
	Dont think the adversary will let you do development, he had said, conceding the need for standing firm on the twin pillars of police action and development.        
	They target infrastructure, they target schools and communication towers, the home minister added.        
	Several party leaders, including Digvijay Singh, Mani Shankar Aiyar, B.K. Hariprasad, Ajit Jogi and K. Keshava Rao, disagree with this position. They argue that sincere and sustained development in neglected areas and effective implementation of provisions like the Pesa (Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act were the first steps to wean innocent tribals away from the Maoists.        
	The home minister will not have such misconceptions if only he talked to MPs from the affected states, an AICC general secretary said. We have the successful Andhra Pradesh model before us. We can learn from that experience.        
	Even during the Dantewada debate in Parliament, two Congress MPs  Charandas Mahant from Chhattisgarh and Rao from Andhra Pradesh  spoke of the complete alienation of people and the urgent need to address their problems. Digvijay and Aiyar, too, stressed the primacy of legislative and economic measures over the military option.        
	Digvijay had even written an article in a newspaper, though the Congress had warned him against airing his views in public and supported the home minister.        
	But sources said Digvijay refused to budge from his stand and claimed that leaders like him represented the correct Congress position.        
	Many leaders feel that the party should have a larger debate on the issue to minimise the confusion generated by the sparring among senior leaders.        
	These leaders contest the charge that they had fallen for a romantic version of Left-wing extremism  as Chidambaram had suggested  and assert that they never opposed use of force for maintaining law and order or clearing territories held by the Maoists.        
	They say a holistic vision does not call for surrendering to the Maoists but envisages a solution that wins over people by empowering them, not terrorising them.

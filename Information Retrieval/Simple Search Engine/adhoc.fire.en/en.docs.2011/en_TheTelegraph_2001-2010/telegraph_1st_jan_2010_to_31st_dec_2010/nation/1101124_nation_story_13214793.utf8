The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bitten once, Karat looks up secular friends
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bitten once, Karat looks up secular friends
          J.P. YADAV                            Prakash Karat (top), Chandrababu Naidu                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat today jogged memories of his third front misadventure as he tried to keep up the pressure on the Prime Minister in the spectrum scam.        
	Karat and politburo member Sitaram Yechury drove to the residence of a Telugu Desam Party MP for a meeting of secular Opposition parties to emphasise that there was no budging from the demand for a JPC probe into the scam.        
	Karats experimental third front had failed to become a convincing alternative to the Congress and the BJP during the last Lok Sabha elections. At an extended central committee meeting at Vijayawada recently, the CPM had conceded that it failed to present an effective all-India alternative before the masses and that cobbling a third alternative would be a long-term goal for the party.        
	The CPM boss today appeared desperate not to lose the chance to corner the Congress in the spectrum scam. He made time to attend the meeting, although he generally leaves it to party leaders in both Houses to handle parliamentary issues.        
	The meeting showcased the reunion of third front leaders such as H.D. Deve Gowda, Desam chief Chandrababu Naidu, BJD boss Naveen Patnaik, AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa, Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh, Asom Gana Parishad and four Left parties.        
	CPM sources said Karat stepped in after reports said the party was softening its stand on a JPC probe following a meeting between Yechury and Pranab Mukherjee. Yechury apparently asked Pranab to come up with an alternative probe if the Congress did not want a JPC.        
	Today, Karat remained silent and got Yechury to do the tough talking against the Congress. After the two-hour meeting of the parties, Yechury read out a statement blaming the Congress for the impasse in Parliament and demanded that a JPC be constituted to end it.        
	The UPA government and the leader of the coalition, Congress party, are responsible for this by their obdurate refusal to appoint a JPC to probe all facts of the 2G scam. The UPA government must end the present parliamentary impasse by constituting a JPC, the statement said.        
	Asked why a meeting had to be called when the parties stand was well known, Yechury said: To stress the political message of the secular Opposition after the government today made it clear that it will not agree to a JPC.        
	Another reason for the CPM hopping onto the secular Opposition bandwagon was the Yeddyurappa corruption taint on the BJP. The CPM had earlier got the meeting postponed because it was wary of being seen with leaders such as Deve Gowda and Jayalalithaa, who are hobnobbing with the Congress in their respective states.        
	The CPMs effort to distance itself from the BJP was evident in the statement, which attacked corruption in Karnataka and said the political leadership in the state must be made accountable.        
	But chinks in the so-called secular Opposition camp were not difficult to spot. Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party was conspicuous by its absence, as was Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party.        
	The leaders, however, claimed Mulayam was with the secular Opposition camp and had not been able to attend because of an urgent engagement. They ducked when asked why he had not sent a representative.        
	Desam chief Naidu said Mayavati had not been contacted. Karat, who had backed her for Prime Minister candidate of the third front, remained poker-faced.

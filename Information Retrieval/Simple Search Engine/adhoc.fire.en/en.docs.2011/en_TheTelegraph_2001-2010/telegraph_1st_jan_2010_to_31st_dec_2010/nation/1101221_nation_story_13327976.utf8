The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US eyes IPL clone with Indian help
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US eyes IPL clone with Indian help
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                                           Rajiv Podar		    
	Mumbai, Dec. 20: A Singapore-based Indian company is part of efforts to hold an IPL-like Twenty20 tournament in America by June 2012, with the franchises expected to buy international cricketers at an auction.        
	Podar Holdings International has signed a joint-venture agreement in Los Angeles with the national cricket bodies of New Zealand and America, Singapore-based investment and consulting company Top Bloom, and Australian sports marketing company Insite to promote cricket in the US. Insite is promoted by cricketer Brett Lees agent Neil Maxwell, who brokered the deal.        
	The new company will be called Cricket Holdings America LLC and will hold a majority of commercial rights to cricket in the US, which the International Cricket Council (ICC) has identified as one of crickets emerging global markets. The T20 league will kick off with six teams.        
	This is an initiative to commercialise cricket in the US, and has the approval of ICC full member New Zealand Cricket and associate member USACA (Americas cricket association), Rajiv Podar, director of Podar Holdings, told The Telegraph this evening.        
	Podar Holdings International and Top Bloom Corporation each hold 41 per cent shareholding in the joint venture.        
	With Cricket Australia too planning a T20 tournament to rival the Indian Premier League, will a US league get a place in the busy global cricket calendar?        
	Apart from China, the ICC has identified the US as a strategically important market for the growth of cricket, Podar said.        
	The IPL usually plays out in April and May, while the new league in Australia is likely to be held in January. So we hope to organise the league in June, July and August.        
	Podar said expatriate populations from the subcontinent and other cricket-playing nations play the game in weekends in a big way in America.        
	Im told there are 48 domestic cricket leagues (in the US) and an estimated 200,000 people play cricket, he said.        
	The agreement provides America an opportunity to develop the game from the grassroots to the elite level, a Podar Holdings release quoted USACA president Gladstone Dainty as saying.        
	It has opened doors for private investment into cricket in America.... Importantly, it will provide a sustainable revenue stream for the development of the game.... The US broadcast market has huge potential. It has historically been the second-highest rights payer behind India.        
	Podar said New Zealands national team was already committed to cricket in the US.        
	In May this year, players from New Zealand and Sri Lanka played two exhibition T20 matches at the ICC-approved ground in Florida. We are looking at organising some cricket matches in the US in June and July 2011.        
	So, is it possible to see a Sachin Tendulkar play in the American T20 league in the future? It is entirely possible... we would love that. A full member country is endorsing cricket there; we hope to get more support from other countries and players, Podar said.        
	The ICC, which discussed the development of cricket in the US and China at a meeting two months ago, has endorsed the initiative. We are extremely supportive.... We wish them all the best, chief executive Haroon Lorgat said, according to the Podar Holdings release.        
	Podar Holdings is part of the Mumbai-based Podar Enterprises group, which has interests in mining, toys, tea and garments among other businesses and runs a cricket academy in Mumbai.

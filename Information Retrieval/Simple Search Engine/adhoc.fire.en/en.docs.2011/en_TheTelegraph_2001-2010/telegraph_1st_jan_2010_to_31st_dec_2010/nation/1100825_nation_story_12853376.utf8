The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Veto on Vedanta mining project
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Veto on Vedanta mining project
                              Vedantas Lanjigarh project                             
	Answers to your questions on the Vedanta controversy              
	What has the Union environment ministry rejected?         
	It has withdrawn Stage I clearance granted for mining and rejected Stage II clearance.        
	Does it mean the entire mining project has to be shelved?         
	Yes, for all practical purposes. No mining can take place without the clearance of the Union environment and forest ministry.         
	Can Stage I continue?        
	Stage I clearance was meant for preliminary matters like prospecting which did not take place as the company was waiting for Stage II and the final clearance. So no work has taken place till now.         
	Why was Stage II crucial?        
	Stage II was most crucial as mining operations depended on it. That would have helped Vedanta to expand the capacity of its plant from one million tonnes to six million tonnes. The mined mineral, that is bauxite, would have been used as raw material for making alumina in the companys refinery at Lanjigarh.         
	What happens to the existing refinery at Lanjigarh?         
	It has been acquiring the raw material  bauxite  from outside Orissa, particularly from Jharkhand. The Saxena committee has accused the refinery of encroaching on forest land. The Union ministry has also issued notices to the plant stating that some of its bauxite suppliers do not have the necessary clearance.        
	What are the key grounds on which the clearance has been rejected?         
	Mainly on the basis of the Saxena committee report which says that mining would adversely impact Niyamgiris ecology and the life of Dongria Kondhs. It has also accused the company of violating forest and environment laws. The company is also in illegal possession of forest land, according to the report.         
	Was an in-principle clearance given earlier?         
	Yes, an in-principle clearance for forest diversion for mining was granted in December 2008 but with two committees of the Union ministry coming up with adverse reports and the ministry deciding not to accord permission for mining, that clearance is irrelevant.         
	Where is the project located?        
	The refinery is located in Lanjigarh in Kalahandi district close to Niyamgiri hills, which the Kondh tribals worship. The mining for bauxite was to take place atop the hill where the Kondhs organise ceremonies to worship Niyam Raja, their presiding deity. They consider the hill sacred.        
	Why are the tribals against the project?         
	The tribals are against the project because they fear that bauxite mining would destroy the hills and dry up about a dozen perennial streams. Besides the hills have been a part of their culture and religion. The Dongria Kondhs, who live in the hills, have a very small population of around 1,500.         
	Who spearheaded the campaign against the project?         
	The campaign against the project was launched by Green Kalahandi, an organisation floated by Kalahandi MP Bhakta Charan Das. Several campaigners, including Medha Patkar and Arundhati Roy, threw their weight behind the movement. Abroad, the issue was taken up by the Survival International and Amnesty International.         
	The campaigners made a reference to James Camerons Avatar, too, which deals with a tribe fighting to protect a sacred tree.         
	What has been Vedantas defence?        
	Vedanta maintains that it has not violated any law and that it has been following the Supreme Court guidelines. The court had asked for the creation of a special purpose vehicle to look after the periphery development in the project area, which included welfare of local tribals. The company was supposed to deposit Rs 10 crore or 5 per cent of its profit annually for this purpose. Vedanta sources say they have already deposited Rs 20 crore.        
	What will Vedanta do now?        
	Legal options are always available as any government decision can be challenged in a court of law.         
	What about the other Vedanta projects in Orissa?         
	Vedanta runs an aluminum smelter plant at Jharsuguda which is connected to the refinery project at Lanjiguda. It is planning to set up a university between Konark and Puri. It is also setting up a power plant at Jharsuguda, the first unit of which was inaugurated by the chief minister. It remains to be seen how the current controversy will affect these projects.        
	What will be the impact of the controversy on Orissas investment climate?         
	This is bound to hit the investment climate as Vedanta is a big group. Since the controversy relates to raw material, it could set many other investors like Posco and the Mittals thinking.         
	Investors faith in the state governments ability to get things done on their behalf will also be eroded.

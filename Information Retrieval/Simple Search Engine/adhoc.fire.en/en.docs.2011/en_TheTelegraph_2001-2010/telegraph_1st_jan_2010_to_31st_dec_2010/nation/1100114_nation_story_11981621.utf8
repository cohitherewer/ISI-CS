	New Delhi, Jan. 13 (PTI): The Maharashtra government has suspended the deportation order of a student who had been sent back to Nepal for indulging in anti-India activities.        
	Neetu Singh, a student of the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune, has been allowed to return to India under a set of conditions that will help her complete her studies, highly placed sources said.         
	The conditions includes a complete ban on talking to the media and a bar on approaching any local court. She has been asked not to leave the campus without the permission of the authorities, the sources said, adding that the FTII director would be held responsible for violation of any of these conditions.         
	Neetus deportation over a month ago had attracted criticism from political parties and womens organisations who demanded that the Centre should intervene and get the deportation revoked.

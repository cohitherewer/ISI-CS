	Jan. 12 (PTI): Over 20 Indians have been detained in the Shenzhen region of China for alleged diamond smuggling.        
	The detentions were made on Friday, and the Chinese authorities are moving to press charges of diamond smuggling against them, sources said.        
	The Indian embassy in Beijing has taken up the matter with the Chinese government. Indian officials have been granted access tomorrow to the 21 detained.        
	According to Chinese media reports, 50 people, including 33 foreigners, who were allegedly part of a smuggling ring have been arrested.        
	The ring procured diamonds in Hong Kong and hired Indians and local carriers to smuggle them into Shenzhen before distributing them among factories, a media report said.

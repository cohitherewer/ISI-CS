	Mumbai, Oct. 31: Several bureaucrats, believed to have cleared the Adarsh Co-operative Housing Society complex in Colaba, got flats there for themselves or relatives, the list of allottees has revealed.        
	Among the 104 flat owners is Sanjoy Shankaran, the son of former Maharashtra chief secretary D.K. Shankaran and Joyce, who was principal secretary in the revenue department when Ashok Chavan was the revenue minister. Chavan is now chief minister.        
	P.V. Deshmukh, who was the deputy secretary in the urban development department in 2003 and was responsible for getting government clearances for construction projects, is also an owner.         
	Deshmukhs flat is in his name, unlike other bureaucrats who have named family members or relatives as owners.        
	What role Deshmukh played is being probed by the CBI after the Union environment ministry said it had not cleared the project because it violated building regulations for coastal regions where construction upwards of 30 metres is disallowed.         
	Deshmukh allegedly also enabled the housing society to get more land by helping it acquire part of a municipal corporation road.        
	Former urban development secretary Ramanand Tiwaris son Omkar is also known to have a flat in the complex in Colaba, where the real estate prices in some areas could match those in Manhattan.        
	Sources in the Maharashtra bureaucracy alleged that Tiwari was rewarded for keeping under wraps the back-channel deals for several clearances.        
	Seema Vyas, the wife of former Mumbai collector Pradeep Vyas, was allotted a flat. Vyas was the city collector when the land was handed over to Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society in 2004.         
	Uttam Khobragade, the general manager of the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST), who helped the housing society secure additional building rights from the adjacent BEST bus depot, was gifted a flat that is in his daughter Devyanis name.        
	Former Mumbai municipal commissioner Jairaj Pathak, who approved the building rights, has a flat in his son Kanishks name. Ranjit Sangitrao, the son of former suburban collector C.S. Sangitrao, is also an allotee.        
	Former Mumbai collector I.A. Kundan, who scrutinised the allotments, and former Mumbai income-tax commissioner Arun Pawar are Adarsh flat owners.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, Aug. 25: The son of a senior leader of Jammu and Kashmirs ruling National Conference and the daughter of a Congress minister in the coalition allegedly used dummy candidates in an MBBS entrance exam.        
	Ram Paul quit as the chairman of the National Conferences (NC) Scheduled Caste and backward classes cell, while minister G.M. Saroori was said to have been asked by the Congress high command to step down from her post in the wake of the scandal.        
	The Omar Abdullah government today ordered a CBI probe into the scam exam, which came to light after invigilators caught two proxy candidates allegedly impersonating for Pauls son Lovish and Sarooris daughter Huma Tabasum.         
	The two proxies were among seven such dummy candidates caught at the MBBS/BDS entrance test of the Jammu-based Acharya Sri Chander College of Medical Sciences. The invigilators smelt a rat when the proxy candidates signatures did not match those on the original forms submitted while applying for the test.        
	Most of the impersonators were hired from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and had been brought by Kunj Bihari, said to be the kingpin of the racket. Bihari, police sources say, had promised Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 to each impersonator and assured them they would not be caught as he had made all arrangements. Bihari is yet to be arrested.         
	State Congress chief Saif-ud-din Soz refused to speak on the row. I am not feeling well, he said.        
	A spokesperson for the NC  chief minister Omars party  said Pauls resignation had been accepted.

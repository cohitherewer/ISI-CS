The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rally against Maya, rail against others
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rally against Maya, rail against others
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: Ajit Singhs rally in Delhi today against land acquisition in western Uttar Pradesh was not a patch on another show he had held in November 2009 that brought the Left, BJP, RJD, Samajwadi Party and the Janata Dal (United) together to protest low payments for sugarcane farmers.        
	The Left and the BJP loaned their support to todays show as well, but it did not hold out the promise of Opposition solidarity against the UPA.        
	When nearly 20,000 farmers from Ghaziabad, Aligarh, Hathras, Mathura and Agra gathered at Jantar Mantar for a Sansad ghero, zameen bachao (lay siege to Parliament to save our land) rally, it looked as though every speaker was out only to serve his political ends.        
	The agitation against land acquisition by the Mayavati government to construct the Yamuna Expressway, which will connect Delhi with Agra, has been so leaderless that squatters in Zikarpur, Aligarh  the hub of farmers protests  had invoked the success of Nandigram and Singur and implored Mamata Banerjee to be in their midst.        
	Ajit today tried to sound aggressive as he spoke not so much about enhanced compensation as about not allowing chief minister Mayavati to touch the land that belongs mainly to Jat farmers, his principal constituency. I will not allow the state government to acquire even an inch of farmers land, he said.        
	Out to reclaim his status as the only kisan neta in the region, he accused Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of remaining unresponsive to his repeated appeals to table the land acquisition act in Parliament. But one request from Rahul Gandhi was enough for the Prime Minister to assure that it would be tabled in the winter session, Ajit said.        
	Yesterday, the Prime Minister announced such a law will be introduced after meeting Rahul Gandhi. He should understand that he is not the Prime Minister for just Rahul Gandhi. He is my Prime Minister, your Prime Minister, he told a cheering crowd.         
	CPM MP Brinda Karat and CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan accused the Centre of being anti-farmer and demanded that the 1894 law, which allows land takeover for development with low payoffs, be scrapped.        
	The odd tableaux in Jantar Mantar had an unexpected player from the BJP: Arun Jaitley, not Rajnath Singh who is its rural India face. The Congress is in a minority in the Rajya Sabha. We will not allow it to pass legislation that are anti-people, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: Mamata Banerjees party today did not join the Congress in opposing the demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe into the Commonwealth Games, Adarsh society and 2G spectrum scams.        
	Sources said the Trinamul Congress chief whip in the Lok Sabha, Sudip Bandopadhyay, took a nuanced position on the Opposition demand for a JPC probe at the all-party meeting called by Pranab Mukherjee. After the lunch meeting, Bandopadhyay said the floor of the House was the best place to decide whether a JPC probe was the only way out of the impasse over the 2G spectrum and other scams.         
	We are against continued stalling of Parliament, he said. The Trinamul MP iterated his partys zero tolerance of corruption and said it should be tackled firmly and boldly. Trinamul is against the politics of corruption, he said.        
	Even the governments closest ally is not opposing the demand for a JPC probe, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury sniggered. When contacted, Bandopadhyay denied that his party was not backing the Congress.         
	We are firmly with whatever decision the Prime Minister takes. At the same time, we feel that instead of closed-door meetings like the one held today, the matter should be discussed on the floor of the House and resolved, he said.        
	Asked for his reaction to the Supreme Courts observation against the Prime Minister, the Trinamul leader said that like Mamata Banerjee, Manmohan Singhs personal integrity was unquestionable.        
	Other allies, such as Sharad Pawars NCP, are in sync with the Congress and feel a JPC would not serve any purpose.

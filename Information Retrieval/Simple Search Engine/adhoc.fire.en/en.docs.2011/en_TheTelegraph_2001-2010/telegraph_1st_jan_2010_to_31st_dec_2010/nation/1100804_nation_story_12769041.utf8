The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Malaysia pulls visa plug on Indians
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Malaysia pulls visa plug on Indians
                            
	Kuala Lumpur, Aug. 3 (PTI): Malaysia has permanently scrapped the visa-on-arrival (VOA) facility offered to visitors from India and seven other countries, saying it was open to abuse after 40,000 Indian tourists went missing.         
	The decision to scrap the facility was taken at a meeting of the cabinet committee on foreign workers and illegal immigrants yesterday, deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said.         
	The Malaysian government, however, said it would make application for visa easier for genuine tourists, especially from India and China. Indians account for a huge chunk of foreign tourists who visit Malaysia.        
	Tourism minister Datuk Seri Dr Ng Yen Yen said people who wished to visit Malaysia could go to locally appointed representatives, instead of consulates, to apply for visas.        
	This means we now have a wider coverage to attract more tourists. People living in cities without Malaysian consulates will be able get visas without hassle, she said before launching the 1Malaysia Contemporary Arts Tourism Festival here yesterday.         
	Applicants will need to pay a small fee to the appointed tour agents for their visas but they still can apply directly to a Malaysian consulate.         
	The VOA facility had been temporarily withdrawn for Indians a couple of years ago after Malaysia complained that many visitors had stayed on illegally after their tourist visas expired.         
	Deputy Prime Minister Yassin said despite calls from several quarters for continuing the facility, the cabinet committee felt it needed to be revoked as it brought certain problems to the country.         
	In the past, we gave flexibility to several nations. If their citizens came to this country and they didnt have a visa, one could be issued at the entry point. We have noticed that this was being abused. We agreed that the VOA facility (should) be revoked or discontinued, he said.         
	During an interaction with a group of journalists from India in January, Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak said that almost 40,000 Indians had gone missing after entering the country through the VOA facility.         
	The premier had then felt that the only problematic exit point in India was Chennai and that there was not any problem with tourists from Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.         
	Besides visitors from India, the VOA facility has been revoked for tourists from China, Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Taiwan and the Comoros.         
	Local media reports say thousands of tourists had abused the VOA, which was introduced in 2006. The government had then suspended the facility for visitors from India following reports that the highest number of VOA abuse involved Indian citizens.

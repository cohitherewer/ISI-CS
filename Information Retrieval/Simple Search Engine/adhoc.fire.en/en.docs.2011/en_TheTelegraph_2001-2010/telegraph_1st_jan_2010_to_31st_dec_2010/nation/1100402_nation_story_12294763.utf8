          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 1: The Left Front today decided to tone down its planned anti-Centre agitation in front of central government offices on April 8, apparently worried about the embarrassment it could cause to the state government.         
	The CPM unit in Bengal has dropped plans of courting arrest by violating the law during the nationwide agitation called to protest price rise and unemployment.         
	It could be embarrassing and difficult for the state government to arrest front leaders.         
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose said the Left Front would organise sit-in demonstrations and picketing from 9am to 3.30pm. Post and telegraph offices would be the protest venues in most places, Bose said.        
	We have to ensure that post and telegraph services are not disrupted and common people, particularly the examinees, are not inconvenienced, Bose said.        
	He also asked the organisers of the agitation not to use microphone because their use is prohibited in the exam season.

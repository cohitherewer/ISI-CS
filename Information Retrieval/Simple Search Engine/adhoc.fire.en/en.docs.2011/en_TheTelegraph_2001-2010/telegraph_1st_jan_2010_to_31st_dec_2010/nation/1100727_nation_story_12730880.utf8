The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kabul shockers in leaked war papers
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Kabul shockers in leaked war papers
          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                          A grab of the July 8, 2008, edition of The Telegraph                                  
	July 26: Polish intelligence warned of a possible Taliban strike on the Indian embassy in Kabul a week before the July 2008 bombing, according to leaked US military documents that say Pakistans ISI has direct links with the banned Afghan group.        
	The leaked documents, titled The War Logs, also say the ISI has set up a semi-autonomous S-wing to run operations against India and Afghanistan and an official of the powerful spy agency is in charge of planning suicide attacks in Kabul.        
	Reuters, however, quoted US national security adviser Jim Jones as saying the leaks, posted by online whistleblower WikiLeaks on Sunday, would not affect our ongoing commitment to deepen our partnerships with Afghanistan and Pakistan.        
	The documents, the biggest leak in intelligence history, say the attack on the Indian embassy led then CIA deputy director Stephen R. Kappes to go to Islamabad to confront the ISI with evidence that it had helped organise the attack.        
	The leaks gave no clue whether India was tipped off about the impending attack.        
	A suicide bomber rammed a car packed with explosives into the heavily fortified Indian embassy gates on July 7, 2008, killing 58 people and wounding more than 140.        
	Defence attache Brigadier R.D. Mehta and counsellor Venkateswara Rao were among those killed in the morning attack.        
	Taliban are planning to carry out an attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul. TB (Taliban) designated an engineer to take this action, WikiLeaks said, quoting the Polish intelligence warning on June 30, 2008.        
	INS (Insurgents) are planning to divide into two groups: first will attack Indian embassy building, whilst the second group will engage security posts in front of MOI (ministry of interior), IOT (in order to) give possibility to escape attackers from the first group, said the warning, part of the massive leak of 92,000 documents, posted by WikiLeaks on Sunday.        
	Budget for this action is about USD 1,20,000. The main goal of this operation is to show TBs (Taliban) abilities to carry out attack on every object in Kabul.        
	The leaks said Pakistans ISI was allowing its representatives to meet directly with the Taliban and fuelling insurgency against the US-led forces.        
	The document dealing with the Indian embassy is titled Threat Report... Threat to Indian Embassy.        
	Other documents strongly indicate that Pakistans ISI is supporting the insurgency in Afghanistan, as well as plotting with Taliban leaders to assassinate Afghan leaders.        
	The report also suggests that the militants are getting help from the Afghan police.        
	The reports, while written by soldiers and intelligence officers mainly describing lethal military actions involving the US military, also include intelligence information, reports of meetings with political figures and related detail, WikiLeaks said.        
	Pakistans ambassador in the US, Hussain Haqqani, denied the ISIs role in helping Afghan insurgents.        
	These reports reflect nothing more than single-source comments and rumours, which abound on both sides of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and are often proved wrong after deeper examination, Husain was quoted as saying.         
	The documents also detail multiple reports of co-operation between retired Lt Gen. Hamid Gul, who ran the spy agency in the late 1980s, and Afghan insurgents battling US forces in the mountainous eastern region of the country.        
	Gul, who says he is retired, dismissed the allegations as absolute nonsense.        
	I have had no hand in it, he said from his home in Rawalpindi. American intelligence is pulling cotton wool over your eyes.        
	Senior Pakistani officials deny Gul still works at the ISIs behest, though mounting American complaints had forced former President Pervez Musharraf to publicly acknowledge the possibility that former ISI officials were assisting the Afghan insurgency.         
	When a reporter visited Gul this spring for an interview at his home, the former spy master cancelled the appointment. According to his son, he had to attend meetings at army headquarters.        
	The NYT said according to reports, the Pakistani military has played a double game  appeasing certain American demands for co-operation while angling to exert influence in Afghanistan through many of the same insurgent networks that the Americans are fighting to eliminate.        
	Notably, the man the US has depended on for co-operation in fighting militants, Pakistan army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, ran the ISI from 2004 to 2007, the period from which many of the reports are drawn.                     WITH INPUTS FROM NEW YORK TIMES

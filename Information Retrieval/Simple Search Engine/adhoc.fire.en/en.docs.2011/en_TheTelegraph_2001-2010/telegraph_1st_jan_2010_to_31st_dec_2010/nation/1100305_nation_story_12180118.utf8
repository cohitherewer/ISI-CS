          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A man looks at a part of the Indian Navy plane jutting out of the house it had crashed into in Hyderabad on Wednesday. (AP)                                  
	Hyderabad, March 4: A nondescript water tank helped save the lives of several people when the navy plane came crashing down yesterday.        
	The tank, which has a capacity to store 35,000 litres of water, was full at the time of the disaster.        
	The Kiran Mark-II plane went into a spiral during an aerobatics show yesterday morning and crashed into the three-storied house of Ramesh Kumar Gowd at New Bowenpally, a congested area 3km from the Begumpet airport in the heart of Hyderabad.        
	The plane hit a 10-foot high mobile phone tower perched on the roof of the house and also hit the tank before exploding into flames. Both aviators, Commander S.K. Maurya and his co-pilot, Lt Commander Rahul Nair, were charred to death.        
	This was when the tank came in handy. It cracked under the impact of the hit and 35,000 litres of water came cascading down.        
	Residents of adjacent houses said the great ball of fire could have rapidly gobbled up other buildings as the crashing plane was leaking and aviation fuel had sprayed all over.        
	The tank was full and hence the fire from the explosion was quelled to a great extent. The water fell on the roads sprayed with the green aviation fuel, said Saraswati, who lives a few houses away down the same lane in which the damaged building stands.        
	The building had a borewell from which water was pumped up to the tank for use by residents.         
	Gowd, the house owner, said they were fortunate the air show was on a weekday when most residents were at work. Had there been no water tank and if the crash had happened at night, the casualties could have been more. The fuel had drenched the entire street below, he said.         
	Gowd said the penthouse on the top floor of the house and the second floor had been extensively damaged. Cracks have appeared on the first and ground floors as well. It is my fathers foresight that he went for column construction instead of wall-bearing, which has paid off now, he said.         
	Had it been wall-bearing construction without the support of concrete columns, the entire building could have collapsed.         
	Gowd said he would approach chief minister K. Rosaiah and seek assistance to rebuild his home. We dont know how much the government would give, but some local councillors and ministers who visited us yesterday have assured assistance, at least for repairs and removal of debris from the top of the building, he said.         
	Gowd said all his eight tenants had vacated the place after police and defence authorities quarantined the building and asked them to live elsewhere till investigations were complete.         
	I have also been directed not to live in the building, said Gowd, who has checked in to his brothers house.        
	He was sour that neither the government nor the defence officials had bothered to enquire nor offered any compensation.        
	The Greater Hyderabad municipal authorities said they planned to inspect the damaged house tomorrow. We have been advised by the government to assess the extent of damage, said a city planner of Secunderabad.

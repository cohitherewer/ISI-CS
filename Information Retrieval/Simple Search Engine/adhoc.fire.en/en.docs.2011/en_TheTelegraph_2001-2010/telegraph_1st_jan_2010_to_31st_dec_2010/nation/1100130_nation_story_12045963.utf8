The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Theft ghost haunts BJP
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Theft ghost haunts BJP
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 29: A year-old theft of Rs 2.6 crore from the BJP headquarters has returned to haunt the party with a mans attempt to snoop on the bank account of the functionary in charge of the BJP office, Shyam Jaju.        
	Chandan Kumar Jha, 32, was allegedly thrashed at the BJP headquarters for his snoop bid and handed over to police last evening, bringing under the glare the December 26, 2008, theft that an embarrassed party had then tried to hush up.        
	Jha is a student of the Sadhna Academy of Media Studies, owned by BJP investors cell member Dinesh Gupta and patronised by Sadhvi Rithambara and other VHP leaders.         
	The snoop bid has raised the question whether Jha was put up to the job.        
	It looks like someone is determined to get to the bottom of the (theft) and see where the money went, a party source said.        
	Yesterday afternoon, Jha had gone to an Andhra Bank branch 200 metres from the BJP office with a photocopy of Jajus PAN card, the police said.         
	He allegedly pretended to be Jaju and asked for an account statement for 2008-09.        
	The manager got suspicious, called Jaju to cross-check and then detained the impostor.         
	Some BJP workers arrived and took Jha to the party office where he was allegedly beaten up.         
	Jha has been charged with forgery and cheating.        
	He has told the police he lives in Arjun Nagar, south Delhi, but party insiders said he lived with Jaju in a house adjacent to the BJP headquarters that had been allotted to Rajya Sabha member B.S. Koshiyari.        
	How else could Jha have accessed Jajus PAN card? a source asked.         
	Jaju has been ticked off for taking the law into his own hands and instigating violence at the office.

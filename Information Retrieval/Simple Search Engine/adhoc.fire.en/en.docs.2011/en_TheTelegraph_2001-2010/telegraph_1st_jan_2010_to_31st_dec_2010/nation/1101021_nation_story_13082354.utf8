          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Sudhanshu Mittal holds the news conference on Wednesday in his Delhi office against the backdrop of a portrait of the late Pramod Mahajan whose patronage gave the businessman clout in the capital once. Picture by Prem Singh                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: The BJP today disowned Sudhanshu Mittal, saying he was out of its national council. Many new nominations are to be made but theres no likelihood of Mittal coming in, a political source close to Nitin Gadkari said.         
	As party president, Gadkari can nominate 40 members to the 1,800-member council that is reconstituted every three years. Mittal was a member of the previous body.         
	After his exclusion from the council, Mittals membership of the BJP would be meaningless because it would imply that the once-powerful functionary has no place in the partys formal structures.         
	Sources said Gadkari was advised by senior members not to comment on Mittal whose offices were searched by income tax officials yesterday for alleged tax evasion in Commonwealth Games contracts awarded to a company he owns.         
	Asked about Mittal at a news conference yesterday, the BJP president had said: I do not know anything about him.         
	Gadkaris predecessor Rajnath Singh, who had tried to resurrect Mittal when he was down and out, was not available for comment.         
	The partys assessment was that while Mittals alleged culpability might be peanuts in the mega Games scam and might not even be established eventually, it was impolitic to have anything to do with him now.         
	The mildest whiff of corruption can be dangerous at a juncture when we are demanding action against Suresh Kalmadi and Sheila Dikshit, a functionary said.         
	Other BJP functionaries took their cue from Gadkaris response yesterday and refused to utter a word about Mittal. Reminded that he was a BJP member, spokesperson Prakash Javadekar retorted: Kalmadi is an MP of the Congress.         
	Mittal protested his innocence, claiming he was being made a scapegoat as part of a project to create a new hate icon. It seems as if I own half of India, he said.         
	He maintained that his company, Delhi Tents and Decorators, was awarded a Rs 29-lakh contract out of the total Rs 77,000 crore spent on the Games. Rs 77,000 crore versus Rs 29 lakh, yet I have been painted the fountainhead of corruption. What is the agenda behind this campaign? It raises questions on the credibility of the probe, Mittal told a media conference.         
	He rejected the contention that he had a stake in Deepali Designs and Exhibits, a company owned by his nephew that had bagged a Rs 200-crore contract. For the last 30 years my company and this one were competitors. I swear that neither me nor my family members own even a rupees share in Deepali, he said.         
	Asked what he thought of his isolation in the BJP, Mittal said: Today I saw Kirit Somaiya defending me.         
	Somaiya, a national secretary based in Mumbai, is said to be close to Gadkari. He was reportedly privy to information Mittal had gathered about the alleged involvement of Congress leaders in the Games scam and had spread it in the BJP. A section of the BJP had hoped to use the ammunition while launching an offensive against the Congress until it backfired.         
	Asked if he had defended Mittal, Somaiya said: All I said is whoever is guilty should be punished.         
	Mittal said he would co-operate with investigators.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, April 29: Suspected Maoists have killed three villagers, including two activists of the rebel-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, in separate attacks at Lalgarh and Salboni since last night.        
	Police said Maoists shot dead Ranjit Mahato, 39, who was a Peoples Committee supporter, and blackened his face. Mahato, a resident of Changsole village in Salboni, had been skipping committee meetings of late. Posters left near his body claimed that Mahato had been killed because he had turned a police informer.         
	The police said suspected Maoists also shot dead Subodh Mondal, 27, a farmer and Peoples Committee member, this morning while he was working in a field in Lalgarhs Gohomidanga village. The police are yet to establish the motive behind the murder.        
	Another unidentified body was found in Salboni this morning with its throat slit.        
	West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said five Peoples Committee activists have been murdered since April 19.         
	It appears that the Maoists have fallen out with the Peoples Committee. During our investigations, we have found that Maoists have not got the money they have been demanding from the Peoples Committee. The murders could be a result of this, Verma said.        
	A police officer said committee activists regularly extorted money from villagers. But we have learnt that the Maoists are not getting their share, the officer said.

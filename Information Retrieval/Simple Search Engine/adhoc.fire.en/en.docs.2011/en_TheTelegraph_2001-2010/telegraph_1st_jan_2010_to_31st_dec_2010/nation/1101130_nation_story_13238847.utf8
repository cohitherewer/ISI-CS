          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Nov. 29: Three motorcycle-borne militants killed a policeman in a busy Srinagar market this afternoon before being shot in the first big gunfight in the city in a year, the number of the attackers matching an alert issued ahead of Barack Obamas visit.        
	The gun battle took place as security forces killed two Pakistani commanders of the Lashkar-e-Toiba after busting their hideout at the Moldari Wadder forest in the border district of Kupwara.        
	Police chief S.M. Sahai said the three unidentified militants were intercepted by a patrol at Qamarwari market.        
	We had got the information about the militants movement in Srinagar. When the motorcycle-borne militants were asked to stop at Qamarwari this afternoon, they opened fire and killed our head constable, Sahai said.         
	The IGP said the police chased the militants and cornered them in an adjoining locality.        
	They were killed during a 20-minute-long encounter. We found two pistols and some grenades. The identity and the outfit of the militants are yet to be ascertained. The slain cop has been identified as Mohammed Ashraf Shah of Lar-Ganderbal, the Assembly constituency of chief minister Omar Abdullah, Sahai said.        
	Early this month, the police had sounded an alert during the visit of President Obama to the country.        
	Two to three militants were suspected to have been trying to infiltrate Srinagars civil lines to carry out suicide attacks on police camps and vital installations.        
	It could not be ascertained whether the trio killed today belonged to the same group.        
	From the hideout of the slain Lashkar commanders, security forces found a stash of provisions.         
	The items included seven to eight quintals of rice, 6.5 quintals of wheat flour and 20 litres of kerosene. This clearly shows that they had made preparation for staying in the hideout the whole winter, Sahai said.

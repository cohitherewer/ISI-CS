The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Refresher class for comrades
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Refresher class for comrades
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Bhattacharjee (top) and Achuthanandan                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: The CPM top leadership went back to school today, but Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and V.S. Achuthanandan were not part of the classes.        
	On a prod from boss Prakash Karat, the CPM has organised refresher courses in history, science, philosophy, economics and party ideology from December 14 to 19 in Hyderabad. This is the first time lessons are being organised for central committee members, although the party holds regular classes for its cadres.        
	The Bengal and Kerala chief ministers have, however, cited preoccupation to excuse themselves from attending the classes. The chief ministers will not be able to attend the classes, CPM leader Nilotpal Basu said.        
	But party sources said attendance was mandatory and permission to skip the lessons would be given only under exceptional circumstances.        
	General secretary Karat is believed to have said education should begin from the top. Not only would the leaders be brought abreast with the changing times in the classes, their ideological moorings would also be strengthened.        
	Party insiders said it was imperative for leaders to better understand the changing face of capitalism in a globalised world if they were to counter it effectively.        
	Most of our leaders still understand capitalism the way Marx, Lenin and other communist stalwarts explained it. Things, however, have changed a lot and continue to change very fast. Unless we get educated about the latest developments, we will not be able to demolish it, a CPM leader said.        
	A second round of classes will be held in Chennai in January.        
	Unlike classes for cadres, where senior leaders deliver lectures, the Hyderabad lessons will be taught by experts like historian Irfan Habib, economists Prabhat Patnaik and C.P. Chandrasekhar, scientist V.K. Ramchandran and others.        
	The classes are likely to be more interactive than the experts simply delivering lectures from prepared notes. Based on the discussions, the papers prepared by experts would be updated, a CPM leader said.

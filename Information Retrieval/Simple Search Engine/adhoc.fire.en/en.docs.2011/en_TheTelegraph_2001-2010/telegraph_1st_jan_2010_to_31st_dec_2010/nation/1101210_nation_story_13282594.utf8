	New Delhi, Dec. 9: If the Supreme Court is wondering how a graft accused can lead the fight against corruption without embarrassment, it should have been at a seminar organised by the Central Vigilance Commission at Vigyan Bhavan today.        
	There, central vigilance commissioner (CVC) P.J. Thomas held forth on the dangers of corruption and the need to weed it out, not letting the matter of having himself been chargesheeted in a graft case cramp his eloquence.        
	He urged citizens to be more watchful against graft as he helped N. Vittal, Indias first CVC, launch a website called Vig-Eye (short for vigilance eye) where people can upload videos and audios and lodge complaints exposing corruption in government.        
	Thomass speech came at a time the Supreme Court has questioned his appointment as CVC, asking how a graft accused could function as head of the countrys corruption watchdog.        
	It will be an embarrassment for him, the court had said last month at the hearing of a public interest litigation that seeks Thomass removal. The court will resume hearing on January 27.        
	But today, Thomas received staunch backing from his peers. First, the Kerala IAS lobby issued an unsigned letter in his support and then Vittal gave him a certificate of character, saying Thomas neednt step down from his post.        
	P.J. Thomas need not resign as individually there is no complaint against him. (His) integrity is not at all an issue. Thomas has an excellent record. I think it will be largely wrong to cast any aspersions on the integrity or the personality of Thomas, Vittal said.        
	The Kerala government, though, played spoilsport by requesting the apex court to allow trial of a corruption case in which Thomas, a former state food secretary, has been chargesheeted.        
	Thomas told reporters he would not react to the allegations because these things are sub judice. The BJP, which wants him sacked, called his lecture on corruption a joke.        
	At the seminar, titled Empowering citizens to combat corruption and organised on International Anti-Corruption Day, Thomas spoke of the watchdogs campaign to spread awareness about corruption.        
	The commission has also recommended to the government to include ethics education in the school curriculum, he said.        
	He added: The advantage of Vig-Eye includes a simplified process of filing complaints and it will provide authentic identity of the complainant. Vig-Eye would be completely digitised and it will give online access to vigilance information.        
	Vigilance commissioner Srikumar said citizens could lodge complaints with Vig-Eye even through their cellphones. People can visit the CVC website (www.cvc.nic.in) to access or get more information on Vig-Eye.

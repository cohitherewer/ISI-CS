The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left minister stuck in own hartal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Left minister stuck in own hartal
          JOHN MARY                                             
	June 26: A CPI minister today chose to taste his own alliances medicine rather than getting beamed on television breaking a Left hartal in Kerala, cooling his heels in an airport for as many as eight hours.        
	Revenue minister K.P. Rajendran was on his way back from Saudi Arabia and supposedly had a busy day ahead in hometown Thrissur. His flight landed at the Nedumbassery airport near Kochi around 10.30am.         
	While Rajendran was in the oil kingdom, the Indian government had raised fuel prices, angering his ruling alliance that called a 12-hour hartal  a euphemism for bandh.        
	 At the airport this morning, Rajendran started marching towards the exit and froze when he saw a television crew covering scenes of the supporters of his alliance enforcing the hartal.        
	The minister suddenly took an about-turn and dashed to the VIP lounge, presumably to avoid being filmed travelling on a day ordinary people were not allowed to do so.        
	The panic may seem unusual for communists who do not care much about what appears in the media syndicate  a term used by Big Brother CPM to deride critical newspapers and channels.        
	But, like in Bengal, the Left is going through a rough patch in Kerala and no minister wants to take a chance.        
	 Besides, Kerala ministers returning from the Gulf are extremely sensitive to suggestions of privileged treatment  a fallout of a hit movie titled Arabikkatha (Arabian Tale) whose plot revolved around the double standard of communists at home and abroad.        
	The hartal, called by the ruling Left Democratic Front to protest the petro price hike, went on till 6pm.        
	 Till then, Rajendran sat in the air-conditioned lounge, read newspapers and watched TV. Had the minister been in Bengal, he would have had to wait much longer as Citu had called a 24-hour transport strike in the eastern state.        
	The media crew waited for some time but left after the ministers chauffeur told them that he would leave only after 6pm.         
	Rajendrans official vehicle, along with the police escort, stayed parked in front of the airport all the while.        
	Before he left around 6.10 pm, Rajendran also gave some bites to journalists who were patient enough to hang around. The people had co-operated with the protest wholeheartedly and the Centre should heed their sentiments, he told them.         
	Unlike the minister, who decided to kill time in the AC lounge to avoid possible embarrassment before television cameras, normal passengers had no option but to remain in the airport.         
	Among them, there were wage earners returning from the Gulf with not enough money to hire a taxi on a hartal day.         
	Jhansi, a nurse from Ranni, near Kottayam, reached the airport around 3.30am to catch her evening flight to Delhi en route to Saudi Arabia. She wanted to be at the airport well before the agitators settled down.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Chavan no to Naidu
                            
	Hyderabad/Mumbai, July 18 (PTI): Andhra Pradesh chief minister K. Rosaiah today requested his Maharashtra counterpart Ashok Chavan to let Telugu Desam Party chief N. Chandrababu Naidu visit the Babhli barrage but was turned down.        
	Naidu and 74 partymen were detained on Friday night in Dharmabad, Maharashtra, during a protest over the barrage project. They refused to take bail and were remanded in two days judicial custody.        
	Chavan appealed to Naidu to return to Andhra. Chandrababu is trying to politicise the situation, keeping an eye on by-elections in Andhra Pradesh. He should take bail and return to his state, he said.        
	The dispute relates to a 2.74TMC barrage project over the Godavari that aims to bring over 8,000 hectares in Nanded, Maharashtra, under irrigation. Andhra claimed that if the barrage was completed, it would deny the state its share of waters awarded under the Godavari water disputes tribunal.

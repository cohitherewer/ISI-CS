          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 6: Nowadays you can just log into Amar Singhs mind.        
	It was his blogs that had provided the first hint that the Samajwadi Party general secretary may have been mulling resignation; its his blogs again that have set off a buzz about his eyeing a re-entry into the Congress, where he had begun his political career.        
	In a blog titled Rivals or enemies, Amar has heaped praise on Sonia Gandhi, whom he had earlier riddled with barbs.        
	Mrs Sonia Gandhis benevolent attitude towards late (Prime Minister) Chandra Shekhar during his last critical years of ailment is also adorable.... So why should we be petty and prejudiced for nothing? he wrote.        
	In another posting, hailing Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the last Moghul, he rued the personal remarks he had made about Sonia.        
	An influential Congress MP from Uttar Pradesh rejected the suggestion that Amar might rejoin the Congress. The question doesnt arise.         
	Earlier, in a blog posted on December 31, Amar had written: Of late, my level of sensibility and sense of political responsibility have taken a back seat. I have learnt to take personal criticism in my stride and for the first time in my political career I am giving more preference to my family.        
	In his first blog (December 20), he had said his kidney transplant in Singapore last year had opened his eyes to who were his friends who merely favour-seekers.        
	His true friends were: wife Pankaja, his daughters, Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, Abhishek and Aishwarya and Anil and Tina Ambani.        
	 A Samajwadi source said that while party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and son Akhilesh had visited Amar in Singapore, he wished they had spent more than just 48 hours with him.        
	Amar highlighted the Samajwadis neglect by alluding to how BJP and National Conference leaders Arun Jaitley and Farooq Abdullah had travelled to Singapore to wish him well.

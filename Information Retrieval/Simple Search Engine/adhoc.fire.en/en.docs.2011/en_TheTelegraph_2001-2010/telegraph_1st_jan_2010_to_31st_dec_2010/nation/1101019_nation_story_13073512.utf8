	New Delhi, Oct. 18: The government will have to invest around Rs 5 lakh crore to achieve its target of increasing the higher education enrolment rate from the current 14 per cent to 30 per cent by 2020, a think tank has estimated.        
	The National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA) has prepared a concept paper projecting the expected number of youths to be enrolled in higher and technical education by 2020 and the investment required to increase facilities.         
	The concept paper says there has to be a continuous and steady rise in the enrolment rate in the 18-24 age group over the 11th and 12th plan periods and the first four years of the 13th Plan to achieve the 30 per cent Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) by 2020.        
	Nearly 2.06 crore students now pursue higher education in the country, accounting for 14 per cent enrolment of youths in the 18-24 age group.        
	HRD minister Kapil Sibal has already announced that the enrolment rate has to be increased to 30 per cent by 2020 to help the country continue its economic growth. An estimated 4.15 crore youths in the 18-24 age group have to be enrolled in higher educational institutions by 2020 to achieve the 30 per cent GER target, the NUEPA estimate says.         
	We have made a projection in terms of enrolment that has to happen from 2007 to 2020 to achieve the 30 per cent GER. The enrolment of youths in higher education should reach 2.92 crore in 2015 and 4.15 crore in 2020, NUEPA vice-chancellor R. Govinda told The Telegraph.         
	Of the estimated 4.15 crore, 1.45 crore would be in technical and professional education while 2.7 crore would be in general higher education. An expansion of 20 per cent in technical education and 50 per cent in general higher education have been projected to happen in the government sector.        
	Given the trend of involvement of the private sector in education, the remaining 80 per cent expansion in technical education and 50 per cent expansion in general education could be done by private players, NUEPA sources said.         
	According to the concept paper, the cost of creating facilities in technical education for every student is estimated to be Rs 2 lakh a year, while expenses towards salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff and maintenance of facilities have been pegged at Rs 1 lakh.        
	On this projection, the government will have to mobilise Rs 1.7 lakh crore for expansion of technical education over a period of 14 years (from 2007 to 2020).         
	The corresponding yearly capital cost per student in general education is estimated to be Rs 60,000 and the revenue cost Rs 75,000. Going by this estimate, the government will have to spend Rs 3.3 lakh crore for expansion of the general education system by 2020.        
	The estimated investment in technical and genera education thus works out to over Rs 5 lakh crore over the 14-year period. This period includes four years of the 11th Plan for which the government has allocated about Rs 40,000 crore for higher and technical education.         
	Now we will work out details on the expansion of institutions in terms of how many would be required in technical education, how many should be set up for skill development and how many general educational facilities like colleges and universities would be needed by 2020, Govinda said.         
	The majority of students, he added, preferred university education to courses on skill development.

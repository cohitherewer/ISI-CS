The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Panchayat OBC push
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Panchayat OBC push
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 10: The Bengal government is going to introduce reservation for Other Backward Classes, including the disadvantaged among Muslims, in the three-tier panchayat system in a renewed attempt to retrieve its support base.        
	The West Bengal Panchayat (second amendment) Bill will be placed in the Assemblys winter session that commenced today.        
	The bill also proposes to institutionalise 50 per cent reservation for women from the general category as well as assorted backward backgrounds in rural local government bodies.        
	This is first time in India efforts are being made to ensure reservation for the OBCs in panchayat system, state panchayat minister Anisur Rahman told The Telegraph. The existing law allows reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, he added.         
	The bill makes room for reservation for backward classes in the posts ranging from pradhans in gram panchayats to sabhadhipatis in zilla parishads.        
	The state has already announced 10 per cent reservation for Muslim OBCs in government jobs, earmarking 17 per cent of the posts for all backward classes.        
	Commenting on the panchayat plan, state minority affairs and madrasa education minister Abdus Sattar said: Its a good beginning and a welcome move for minorities. The 2.2-crore OBC Muslims represent roughly 85 per cent of the community in the state.        
	Muslims already enjoy 22 per cent representation in panchayat bodies, which nearly corresponds to the communitys size of 25 per cent of the state population, he added.        
	The bill, however, does not offer any outer limit for the OBC reservation as the authentic percentage of such population in the state is yet to be ascertained by the government. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes account for around 22 and 6 per cent, respectively, of the state population.         
	The identification of such groups is still going on. So the OBC reservation in panchayats will be proportionate to the percentage of their population from village to district, Rahman said. The bill makes room for rotational reservation for office bearers not less than half of the proportion of SC/ST/OBC population in all three panchayat tiers.         
	But some in the government and the CPM are keeping their fingers crossed. We may try to extract political mileage. But it will be difficult to implement it if there is ambiguity, a CPM MLA said.         
	Rahman said an earlier bill that proposed a panchayat education board, a body to regulate primary and secondary schools in rural areas, had been cleared by a standing committee and would be moved in the current session.         
	But CPM sources said the party was divided over the controversial bill as academics, ministers and state secretariat members were apprehensive about the fallout of running parallel schools under panchayats and school education departments.

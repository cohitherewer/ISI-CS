The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | New Year gift: Cars for cabinet
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      New Year gift: Cars for cabinet
  -Kiran orders suvs for Rs 36 crore          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                    
	Hyderabad, Dec. 30: Chief minister Kiran Kumar Reddy has given himself and his Andhra cabinet colleagues a New Year gift of fancy cars, some at Rs 50 lakh apiece, even as he struggles to steer the state out of its troubles.        
	The Rs 36-crore order for 25 Scorpios and 15 Toyota Fortuners, some for top officers too, has been placed as political uncertainty and violent Telangana protests loom on a state groaning under a deficit of Rs 18,000 crore. The auto splurge also appears to sit uneasily with the cult of austerity the ruling Congress often swears by.        
	Two of the Fortuners have been delivered and are being made bullet-proof. They will join the fleet of the chief minister, who will upgrade himself to the Rs 50-lakh SUV from the Mahindra Scorpios brought in by Y.S.R. Reddy in 2007. Fortuners come at around Rs 23 lakh but the cost more than doubles if they are fortified.        
	Officials said Reddys new caravan could withstand attacks, including Maoists bombs and protesters stones. YSR had himself graduated from Tata Safari to Scorpio. Now Reddy has promoted himself to Fortuners.        
	YSR, though, had rejected proposals to upgrade Opposition leader Chandrababu Naidu to Safari from Ambassadors, an old favourite of officialdom, despite a rebel attack on the Telugu Desam boss when he was chief minister.        
	It was K. Rosaiah, Reddys immediate predecessor who stepped down last month, who approved Safaris for Naidu last year. Desam sources say Naidu would have to had make do with Ambassadors had Reddy been chief minister then.        
	Reddy has the governor much to thank for. E.S.L. Narasimhan had stalled the purchase of new vehicles during the Rosaiah regime saying there was no need for the splurge particularly when the states finances were in poor shape. But, in near U-turn, he promptly cleared the file when it was sent by the Reddy government.        
	Officials handling protocol denied suggestions of a bias against Naidu, claming that the Safari provided to the Desam leader cost Rs 60 lakh, Rs 10 lakh less than the chief ministers Fortuner, after bullet-proof plating.        
	The two Toyota Fortuners being readied now will join the chief ministers convoy comprising six vehicles  in a week. The remaining four vehicles in the cavalcade, including a jammer, will not be bullet-proof.        
	Reddy isnt behind in the numbers game either. The transport department has earmarked 414 and 423  adding up to the magic 9 the chief minister believes brings him luck  for the vehicles set to join his convoy. The existing vehicles are marked 1818. Rosaiahs convoy had 5555, and YSRs 2345. Naidus fleet is hooked on 393.        
	A senior official said with changing times, ministers and bureaucrats had been spending a lot on vehicles. When Brahmananda Reddy (also of the Congress) was chief minister in the 60s, he used a single Ambassador for seven years. He had not asked for a change of car or his driver till he gave up the post, the official said.

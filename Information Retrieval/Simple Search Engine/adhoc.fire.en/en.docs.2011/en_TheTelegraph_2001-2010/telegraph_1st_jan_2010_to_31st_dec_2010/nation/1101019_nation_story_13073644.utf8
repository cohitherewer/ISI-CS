	New Delhi, Oct. 18 (PTI): The Supreme Court today asked the government what action it had taken against officials responsible for the food grains rotting in its godowns.        
	Additional solicitor-general Mohan Parasaran drew flak for saying that only 7,000 tonnes of grains had gone rotten in Food Corporation of India godowns. Even if it is 7,000 tonnes, how can it happen. What action you have taken against the officials? the court asked.

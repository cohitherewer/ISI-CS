	Midnapore, Oct. 21: Trinamul Congress leaders today said the party would send an open letter to central forces personnel explaining how they were being misused by the ruling CPM and the police in Jungle Mahal.         
	At a rally held in front of a CRPF camp in Maoist-infested Nayagram village, about 120km from Lalgarh, Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikary said: We will provide them with instances how the central force jawans are being misused and how they are being made to do things according to the diktats of the CPM.

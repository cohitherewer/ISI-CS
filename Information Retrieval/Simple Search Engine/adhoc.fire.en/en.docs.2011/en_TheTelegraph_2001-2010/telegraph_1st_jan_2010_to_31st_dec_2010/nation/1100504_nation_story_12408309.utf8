	Patna, May 3: Maoists ambushed a police patrol vehicle and gunned down four Bihar Military Police jawans at a bazaar in Aurangabad district, 185km from here, today.        
	The incident, which took place around 1pm, also left a jawan grievously injured.        
	The rebels looted four SLRs, a carbine, hand grenades and ammunition before escaping towards Palamau in Jharkhand, police said.        
	Aurangabad superintendent of police Sanjay Singh said at least six guerrillas had come out from an SUV and fired indiscriminately on the police patrol party near a bazaar under the Tandawa police station area, located in the jungle and hilly riverine area bordering Jharkhand.        
	The jawans, who died on the spot, were identified as havildar Rajendra Gurung, constables Roman Gurung, B.P. Adhikari and Vishnu Bahadur. Kamod Rai, who has sustained bullet injury in his arms and shoulders, has been admitted to Aurangabad Sadar hospital.        
	Singh said the jawans had gone on their scheduled duty to check banks operating in the area.         
	Aurangabad has been the traditional stronghold of the Maoists. In Dalelchak and Baghaura villages, the Maoists had carried out their first arms raid, killing over 40 people from the landowning Rajput community in the 1970s. Police said that the Maoists had blown up at least 30 school buildings in the district in the past four months.

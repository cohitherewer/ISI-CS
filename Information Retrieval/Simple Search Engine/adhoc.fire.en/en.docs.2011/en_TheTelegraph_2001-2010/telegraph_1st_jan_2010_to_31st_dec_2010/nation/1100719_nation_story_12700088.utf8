  - Visva-bharati FEE hike row          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray leaves his office after 2.30am on Sunday following the police action. A Telegraph picture                                              
	Santiniketan, July 18: Police today wielded batons on agitating Visva-Bharati students to free the vice-chancellor and 20 others who had been confined inside a varsity hall since yesterday, the pre-dawn action sparking an indefinite strike.        
	Twenty of the 150 undergraduate, postgraduate and research students who had confined Rajat Kanta Ray and his colleagues to protest a fee hike suffered minor injuries in the 2.30am action to end the 14-hour siege that began at 12.30pm yesterday. Later this morning, students did not attend classes. Teachers didnt arrive, either. Sunday is a working day at the varsity.        
	Asked about the action, Ray claimed the protesters had attacked two of his colleagues after they were rescued. I had asked the police to exert minimal force. But I have heard Kumkum Bhattacharya (director, publication division) and Amitabha Choudhury (PRO) were attacked (by students) in their cars after the police action.        
	Sub-divisional officer of Bolpur Ashok Das said there was no option. We had to resort to the lathicharge as it was our responsibility to rescue the VC and other university officials. We had no other option.        
	The students sat on a dharna for five hours in front of the central office where Ray and the others, including a doctor who had to come to see the vice-chancellor during the siege, were confined.         
	The protesters claimed they had requested the police to allow them to carry on their agitation peacefully. They resorted to the lathicharge and drove us out. No student will attend classes, said Mithun Sinha Roy, the convener of the students forum, which claims to be an apolitical pressure group formed to protest the fee hike.        
	Ray declared that meetings with the students would continue but contended there was little scope for a total rollback. It will not be possible to roll back the hike totally. If we do, Visva-Bharati will be in distress.

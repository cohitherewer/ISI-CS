The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM sniffs a winner 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CPM sniffs a winner 
          J.P. YADAV                                           Sitaram Yechury		    
	New Delhi, Oct. 4: The CPM politburo is likely to slam the Ayodhya title suit verdict, spying in it a blessing in disguise for the battered Left Front in Bengal.         
	In 1995, the Supreme Court had ruled that the title suit cannot be adjudicated on matters of faith. The high court verdict is based on faith and thereby violates the Supreme Court ruling, politburo member Sitaram Yechury said today, indicating the partys position.         
	Sources in the CPM said they had reports that Muslims by and large were feeling betrayed by the judgment and hold the Congress responsible for it. In such a scenario, slamming the verdict could help us in winning back their (Muslims) support, a CPM leader said.         
	Yechury said the politburo, which began its two-day meeting today, would go into the details of the lengthy Allahabad High Court judgment before taking a final view which will be articulated tomorrow. The meeting is being held to finalise the partys stand on the judgment and take stock of preparations for the Bengal Assembly elections next year.         
	After Jammu and Kashmir and Assam, Bengal has the largest percentage of Muslims  26 per cent  among all the states in the country. The Left believes that the desertion of Muslim voters is the biggest reason for the series of electoral debacles it has suffered in the state.         
	The state government has already launched efforts to win back the support of the community by being the first to announce 10 per cent job reservation for backward Muslims in line with the recommendations of the Ranganath Mishra Commission. The politburo meeting will take stock of the progress made in this direction.         
	Underlining that substantial progress had been made, Yechury said categorisation names of beneficiary castes had been completed and would be announced soon.         
	Setting the tone for the CPM, some 50 prominent Left intellectuals under the umbrella of SAHMAT (Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust) held that the Ayodhya verdict was yet another blow to the secular fabric of our country and the repute of our judiciary. The group has attacked the verdict for accepting belief and faith in deciding property entitlement and said it was against all principles of law and equity.         
	The CPM is likely to pick holes in the judgment on technical grounds, taking care to avoid any communal reference.         
	Politburo members from Bengal are already claiming a turn in fortunes. State secretary Biman Bose spoke of a mammoth crowd at chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees rally in West Midnapore and claimed it was an expression of peoples distaste for the politics of violence being pursued by the Trinamul Congress and the Maoists.         
	The situation in Bengal is changing for the better. The chief ministers rally was one of the biggest ever in the district, Yechury said.

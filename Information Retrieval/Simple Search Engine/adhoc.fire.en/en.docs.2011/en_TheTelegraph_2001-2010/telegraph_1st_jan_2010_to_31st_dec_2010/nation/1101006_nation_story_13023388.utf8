	London/New Delhi, Oct. 5: Britain, America and Australia sent intelligence teams to India to help pre-empt terror attacks by Pakistan-based groups during the Commonwealth Games amid fears that another 26/11-type assault could trigger war between the neighbours, the Daily Telegraph reported today.        
	The London daily said western and Indian security sources had revealed that the three countries sent about two dozen senior intelligence agents to Delhi last year as Indias preparations for the Games intensified.        
	Its not clear if the agents are still in India but co-operation between Indian and western security agencies have been growing since the November 2008 attack killed 166 people.        
	Americas FBI is said to have helped a lot with the Mumbai probe.        
	The Daily Telegraph report came on a day an anonymous call claiming that a bomb had been placed inside the Commonwealth Games Village prompted a two-hour search at the complex, which hosts about 7,000 athletes.         
	The call was later declared a hoax. A minor boy, who police said wanted to get some of his friends into trouble, was detained.        
	Last week, CIA director Leon Panetta visited both Islamabad and India. According to Indian sources, he warned Pakistan President Asif Zardari and army chief Ashfaq Kayani that Washington expected their co-operation in preventing any terrorist attacks on the Games.        
	Panetta later visited Delhi where he met home minister P. Chidambaram. Following the meeting, sources said, security was stepped up wherever Mumbai attack suspect David Coleman Headley visited. The areas which Headley mapped here could be targets for terrorists who have seen videos of Headley while being trained in Pakistan, a government official said today.        
	The sources said British and Australian intelligence officials visited Delhi this May, too. Uncorroborated reports suggest help has also come from Israels Mossad.        
	The focus of the intelligence agencies of Britain, US and Australia has been on the Lashkar-e-Toiba, the Pakistan-based group accused of plotting the Mumbai strike. They are also concerned by the Indian Mujahideen, which has links with the Lashkar.        
	In recent weeks, reports from Pakistan have suggested that Brigade 313, an al-Qaida affiliate, was also planning attacks on the Games, where 71 countries are taking part.        
	According to diplomats, the results of the three countries intelligence work in Delhi were seen in May, when each warned of an imminent attack on the Indian capital. Each changed travel advice and told visitors to avoid government buildings and markets.        
	Spy chiefs, as they are still called in London, have been visiting Delhi with regularity this year. In March, it was US director for national intelligence Dennis C. Blair. The previous week it was Sir John Sawers, the chief of the British secret service MI6.        
	Britains contribution is understood to be part of the growing security co-operation with India. The Prince of Wales, his youngest brother, Prince Edward, and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, have been in India, so it can be taken for granted British intelligence has been working closely with its Indian counterpart to protect the royals. On top of that, hundreds of British athletes are participating in the Games.        
	The British foreign office is not asking its nationals to stay away from Delhi, though its travel advice warned of a high threat from terrorism throughout India and a particular risk that terrorists would attempt attacks in the run-up to and during the Games. We are in close touch with the Indian authorities and the Commonwealth Games Federation about these concerns, said a line from the foreign office.

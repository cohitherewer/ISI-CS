The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Thackeray U-turn on Aussies in IPL
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Thackeray U-turn on Aussies in IPL
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Shilpa Shetty, the co-owner of Rajasthan Royals which has four Australian players, refused to be drawn into the Sena controversy on Tuesday. Before Bal Thackeray lifted the threat, she said in Jaipur: One has to either play cricket or play politics. (PTI picture)                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 16: Bal Thackeray today said his party wouldnt oppose Australian cricketers playing in the Indian Premier League anywhere in Maharashtra, as the once-bitten Shiv Sena boss sang a different tune from a video-taped threat he made yesterday.        
	The U-turn came days after Mumbaikars thumbed their nose at the Senas ominous threats and queued up in thousands to watch the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer My Name is Khan.        
	Balasaheb has said that preventing Australian cricketers from playing in Mumbai or Maharashtra is not the Shiv Senas personal political agenda. He said someone had to raise a voice against racist attacks on Indians in Australia, and the Shiv Sena was doing that on behalf of the country, Thackerays close aide Sanjay Raut told The Telegraph this evening.        
	But if people cannot understand what the Shiv Senas agitation is about, let the Australians come and play, Balasaheb has said, Raut, the executive editor of Sena mouthpiece Saamna, added.        
	The comment came a day after Thackeray said the Sena wouldnt allow Australian cricketers to enter Maharashtra until racist attacks on Indians stopped in Australia.        
	Since the attacks on Indians are continuing in Australia, there is no question of withdrawing our opposition to the Australian cricketers. We will not allow them to play IPL games either in Mumbai or other venues in Maharashtra till such time that the racist attacks on Indians settled in Australia continue, he had said in the video-taped message to party workers.        
	The message appeared to be a snub to Union minister Sharad Pawar, who had last week dropped in at Thackerays Bandra home to plead with him to allow the Australians to take part in the IPL.        
	But if NCP chief Pawar, a former cricket board chief, handed the Sena boss a face-saver, observers said todays U-turn might have been prompted by the overwhelming response to My Name is Khan.        
	The Sena was forced to cut short its agitation after the film was released across theatres last Friday.        
	Asked about the sudden about-turns in Thackerays stand, Raut insisted it was not a U-turn.        
	(BCCI chief) Shashank Manohar and Sharad Pawar had met Balasaheb and told him that Pakistani players are not playing in the IPL. The Australian cricket team is not playing either. Only a handful of Australian cricketers across teams are playing. The BCCI had later made a detailed presentation stating the same.        
	He refused to elaborate but said a formal statement from Thackeray was expected later in the evening.

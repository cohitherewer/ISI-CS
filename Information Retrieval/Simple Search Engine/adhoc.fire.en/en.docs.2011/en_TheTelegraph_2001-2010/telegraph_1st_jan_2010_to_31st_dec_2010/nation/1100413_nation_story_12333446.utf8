The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Challenge to government minus firepower
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Challenge to government minus firepower
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Karat arrives for the Delhi meeting. (Rajesh Kumar)                                  
	New Delhi, April 12: A 13-party, non-NDA Opposition group today decided to move cut motions in Parliament on the fuel and fertiliser price hike and announced a nation-wide general strike on April 27, but Congress leaders brushed aside any threat to the government.        
	We have the numbers. But we want to ask these parties who will gain if the government is pulled down in 10 months? a senior Congress leader said, adding that it was clear the plank of anti-Congressism had never been buried after all.        
	Without the BJP-led NDA, the 13-party grouping, which includes the Left, has just 87 MPs, hardly enough to threaten the Centres survival in a House of 543.        
	The decision to move the cut motions came at a meeting attended by the leaders of the 13 parties who slammed the anti-people policies of the Congress.        
	The BSP stayed away despite being invited to the meeting. There has been speculation in political circles that Mulayam Singh Yadavs patch-up with the Left after their rift over the nuke deal would drive Mayavati away.        
	Mulayams Samajwadi Party had dumped the Left to support the nuclear deal in 2008, forcing the Marxists to embrace the BSP.        
	Among those who attended the meeting were Mulayam, Lalu Prasad, N. Chandrababu Naidu, H.D. Deve Gowda, Prakash Karat, A.B. Bardhan, Sitaram Yechury, Ajit Singh and Om Prakash Chautala.         
	We shall unitedly move a cut motion (on demands for grants) and amendment to the Finance Bill demanding rollback in the relentless hike in prices of petroleum products and fertilisers, PTI quoted CPI general secretary Bardhan as telling a joint news conference.        
	We have also decided to organise a countrywide hartal (strike) on April 27, Bardhan added.        
	While the cut motions are likely to prove futile without the BJPs support, the Opposition parties are also aware that they dont have the strength to enforce a Bharat bandh. This is perhaps why they used the phrase countrywide hartal, which effectively means a shutdown in their areas of influence.        
	Aware of the inner contradictions of the Opposition grouping, the Congress raised the bogey of a revival of communal forces to confront the new wave of anti-Congressism.        
	We want to ask the secular parties if they are willing to do business with the BJP at a time when the Supreme Court-appointed SIT is investigating its leader Narendra Modi for his complicity in the Gujarat riots, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said. Is secularism a dead issue for these parties?        
	Asked how the government would manage with a wafer-thin majority if the RJD and the Samajwadi, which support it from outside, switch sides, a Congress leader indicated that the government had a strategy. The cushion, he said, comes from various sides. Things are not uni- dimensional.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 18: The human resource development ministry is seeking a relaxation of qualification norms to attract more aspirants to the post of the head of the National Council for Educational Research and Training, unable to find a suitable candidate.         
	The ministry has asked the department of personnel and training to allow a relaxation of qualification norms that require the NCERT director to have at least 10 years experience as a professor. Eligible candidates now need at least five years of experience.        
	The position of the director fell vacant with the end of the term of Krishna Kumar.         
	The struggle to find a NCERT head is the latest instance of the ministry being unable to find good quality candidates to head institutions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dantewada action against CRPF
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Dantewada action against CRPF
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, May 21: Three CRPF officers, including a DIG, were today transferred over last months Dantewada ambush in which 75 jawans died, and a separate inquiry ordered against an inspector-general who retired weeks after the massacre.        
	The action was based on the findings of the E.N. Rammohan committee, which probed the massacre, and the forces own preliminary inquiry.         
	The announcement followed a meeting this afternoon between the CRPF top brass led by director-general Vikram Srivastava and home minister P. Chidambaram  who had offered to quit taking responsibility for the attack.        
	The officers have been transferred for acts of commission and omission. The action was taken after considering the Rammohan committee report and the (CRPFs own) court of inquiry, Srivastava told The Telegraph.        
	Asked if the officers could be suspended, Srivastava said a separate court of inquiry was being constituted to look into specific lapses of these officers in detail and fix responsibility.         
	Rammohans report is yet to be made public, as Chidambaram had promised in Parliament, although sources said it was not mandatory to divulge the findings of such an inquiry.         
	The role of IG Ramesh Chandra, who retired on April 30, 24 days after the April 6 massacre, will be questioned separately as he is not a serving officer anymore.        
	Among those transferred, DIG Nalin Prabhat has been sent back to Chandigarh. Vimal Kumar Bisht, a commandant of the 62 battalion targeted by the rebels, has been transferred to a CRPF training centre in Tamil Nadus Avadi. The third, inspector Sanjeev Bagre of the same battalion, has been transferred to the 93 battalion.        
	A Chhattisgarh police constable had also died in the ambush. There have been allegations from a section of the state cops that the three officers may have not followed the polices directions on troop movement.        
	Sources in Raipur said the Chhattisgarh government was wary of taking action against any of its officers fearing it demoralise the force.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 16: The Supreme Court today stayed till March 29 the court of inquiry (CoI) against former military secretary Lt Gen Avadesh Prakash in connection with the Sukna land scam case.         
	Prakash was to appear before the court of inquiry in Calcutta today.         
	I have been asked to comply (with the order to appear before the CoI and cross-examine witnesses) in Calcutta today. My daughter got married just a day earlier, Prakash told the bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, through his counsel Mukul Rohatgi in a bid to get more time.         
	Additional solicitor-general Indira Jaisingh, the Centres counsel, then made an open offer to Prakash to come at any time or date before the court of inquiry and cross-examine witnesses.         
	On March 29, the top court will hear a plea by the former military secretary to quash all proceedings against him. Prakash was slated to cross-examine six witnesses today.         
	The Armed Forces Tribunal had on February 22 quashed the court of inquiry against Prakash and had ordered the army to carry out the probe afresh.         
	Disallowing him an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses would be against the principles of natural justice, the tribunal had held.         
	Today, Prakashs counsel said the former military secretarys court of inquiry was a mockery of justice. The trial is bad in law, he said.         
	Pleading that Prakash be given a fair opportunity, Rohatgi said all witnesses should be examined in his presence before cognisance was taken of the charges against him.         
	He did not even know what he was being charged with. He was the 19th witness and he suddenly became an accused, Rohatgi said.         
	He contended that Prakash should have got an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses before the charges were pressed against him.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 26: The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to quash the criminal cases against M.F. Husain and direct the government to take steps to ensure the return of the self-exiled painter, now living in Qatar.        
	A bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) K.G. Balakrishnan dubbed him a world-class citizen who could live anywhere with dignity.         
	The judges were responding to a PIL which wanted the court to issue orders for withdrawing the cases so the 95-year-old could return to India and live here with dignity.         
	Who says he doesnt have the right to live with dignity. They (such painters) are world-class citizens. They can live anywhere, Balakrishnan said. The CJI, however, expressed his inability to close the cases against Husain, most of them for his controversial paintings of Hindu goddesses. All these are private complaints. We cannot just close them, the CJI said.        
	The court urged the petitioner, Panthers Party chief and former parliamentarian Bhim Singh, to approach the government for relief. He is 95 and he deserves to live with dignity at this age. Right to live is part of the fundamental Right to Life (guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution), Singh had argued in his petition.        
	Singh alleged that the cases were politically motivated with malafide intentions of blackmail and electoral gains. This (the targeting of Husain) is an attack on the credibility of our secular democracy.         
	Some of the nearly 100 cases against Husain are related to obscenity, the others to hurting religious feelings of other communities.                    
	Some of the cases have been disposed of, while others have been clubbed together for hearing in a Delhi court, the bench pointed out. On September 8, 2008, it had refused to launch criminal proceedings against Husain in one case.        
	At one stage, the CJI wondered what the Prime Minister could do to help Husain. Singh had annexed in his petition a letter written to the Prime Minister to intervene in Husains favour. What can the PM do, the CJI wondered aloud.        
	Husain recently accepted Qatars citizenship. At this age, he does not find it convenient to shuttle from one corner of India to another, seek bail, get harassed and even physically threatened. This was the reason for his self-exile, Singh said.

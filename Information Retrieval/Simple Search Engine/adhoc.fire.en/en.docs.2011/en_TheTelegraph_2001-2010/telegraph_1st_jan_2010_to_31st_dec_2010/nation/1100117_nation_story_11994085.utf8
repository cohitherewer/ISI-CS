          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 16: Goaded by the high court, Pune police have arrested three men for Wednesdays murder of right-to-information activist Satish Shetty but the victims family fears a frame-up.        
	The day after Shetty was stabbed to death in Talegaon near Pune, Bombay High Court had asked the state government to take measures to protect all social activists who face threats from criminals.        
	Last night, Talegaon police arrested local lawyer Vijay Dabhade, his assistant Pramod Waghmare, and Parshuram Telugu alias Digu Jakkal. This evening, a court remanded them in police custody till January 25.        
	Police sources said the enmity between Shetty and Dabhade dated back to 1994 when the activist had exposed how three buildings had been constructed illegally in Talegaon by Dabhades client Kanu Padwal, a builder.        
	Shetty also exposed several other cases, including a bungalow built illegally by Dabhade on railway land in 2002, an officer said.        
	Over the years, Shetty had lodged nine complaints against Dabhade while the lawyer had filed five counter-complaints. Dabhade had twice tried to attack Shetty, and an attempt-to-murder case was lodged against him, a police source said.        
	Shettys brother Sandeep, however, questioned the police investigation and repeated his demand for a CBI probe.        
	My brother and Dabhade had bad blood between them, but a year ago he had apologised and promised not to engage in illegal activities. His name was there in the FIR we lodged, but the brutality of the killing indicates this could be beyond such small enmities, Sandeep said.

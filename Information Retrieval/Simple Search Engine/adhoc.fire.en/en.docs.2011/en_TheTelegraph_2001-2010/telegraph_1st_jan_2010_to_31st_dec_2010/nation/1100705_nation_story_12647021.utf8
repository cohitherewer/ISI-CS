The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left in the dark, Ranchi feels sad
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Left in the dark, Ranchi feels sad
          AMIT GUPTA                           Relatives of Sakshi Singh Rawat arrive to attend her wedding with Dhoni. (PTI)                                  
	Ranchi, July 4: His new house is shut, his family isnt here, and his closest friends are unreachable. Mahi had logged off hometown Ranchi even before word got out that the wedding bells were ringing for him.        
	The local cricket fraternity, his fans and his mentors, who knew Dhoni as the boy next door who played great khep (on-hire) cricket, are all disappointed at the India captains cloak-and-dagger approach to the most important event of his life.        
	Ranchi deputy mayor Ajay Nath Shahdeo, known as a close friend of the cricketers, said he didnt know about Dhonis plans to marry Sakshi Singh Rawat, who is said to have spent her school days in Ranchi when her father was with Mecon.        
	Is Dhoni marrying today? Is that true? I dont know why he is keeping things so private and secret, Shahdeo said.        
	Among the few lucky ones to be invited to the Dehra Dun party is former deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto. The two are known to be very close  Mahtos daughter Sejal was named by Mahi.        
	I couldnt tell you yesterday, but I am driving down to Dehra Dun. Should be there by 9pm, Mahto told The Telegraph.        
	Dhonis mentors Chanchal Bhattacharya and Jai Kumar Sinha, who had coached him when he was a teenager, remained busy with todays inauguration of an indoor cricket facility of the Jharkhand State Cricket Association.        
	My best wishes to Dhoni for his second innings (in life), said Sinha on the sidelines of the event, attended by the BCCI top brass.        
	Sinha, the senior cricket coach of Ranchi University, admitted he hadnt been invited. He said he had spoken to Dhonis brother-in-law Gautam Gupta to have the good news confirmed.        
	Dhonis plush home at Harmu Colony was locked. His parents and elder brother Narendra who live there, werent in. The last time Dhoni was seen here was on May 27, when he was felicitated by Central Coalfields Limited.                    
	Today, there were no lights, no celebrations at the house, built on land gifted by the state.         
	On the plot next to the Dhonis is a bank that is open on Sundays. It was busy through the day because of tomorrows countrywide strike against the fuel price hike.        
	Yes, we have read that Dhoni is getting married today. It would have been better had the marriage been solemnised in his hometown, said D.N. Singh, who had come to the bank with daughter Anjali to withdraw money.        
	In the afternoon, a group of fans led by a local Congressman, Ajay Rai, celebrated Dhonis engagement by bursting crackers on the state capitals busiest street, Albert Ekka Chowk.        
	Surely, Ranchi could have done better for its most famous son. If only it had known.

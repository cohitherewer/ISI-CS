The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Food pot boils in House, Centre cries blackmail   Rail and general budgets spared
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Food pot boils in House, Centre cries blackmail     Rail and general budgets spared
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Mamata, Pranab				                                       
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: Protests over rising food prices shut down Parliament today amid fears of a deadlock as an unrelenting Opposition pressed for a debate and a vote and the government held firm against what it called was blackmail.        
	The Opposition, however, said it would allow trouble-free presentation of tomorrows rail budget and Fridays finance bill.        
	Both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha were adjourned after slogan-shouting Opposition members demanded a debate on the price spiral under rules 167 and 168 that call for a vote.        
	While the Opposition pressed for an adjournment motion in the Lower House, it changed its stand in the Rajya Sabha after agreeing to a short duration discussion at the Business Advisory Committee yesterday.        
	The stand-off came even as analysts warned that food prices, up nearly 18 per cent, could further drive up overall inflation from the already high 8.5 per cent.        
	Efforts to break the deadlock failed as the BJP-led Opposition stuck to its guns, openly declaring its intent to disrupt Parliament till the government agreed to a vote.         
	Backing the BJP in both Houses were the Left, the RJD, Samajwadi Party, BSP, Telugu Desam, BJD and the Janata Dal (United).        
	In the Lok Sabha, Speaker Meira Kumar said the parties were quibbling on rules when the government was ready for an exhaustive debate.        
	Kumar later told reporters she was concerned that no deliberations could take place on an issue that had put people in distress.        
	The BJP, however, indicated it would allow both Mamata Banerjee and Pranab Mukherjee to present the rail and Union budgets as it was a constitutional obligation. But the party said no other work would be allowed as nothing was more important than providing relief to the common man.        
	The government held firm, saying a vote was not on its agenda. We cannot bow to blackmail. The Opposition is using peoples miseries to gain political mileage, a senior cabinet minister said.        
	In the Lok Sabha, leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj insisted on an adjournment motion.         
	She said eight debates on price rise in the last six years had yielded nothing, so a stronger parliamentary device was needed to wake up the government.                    
	When parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal asked why the Opposition was not accepting a nine-hour debate instead of the less than three hours that adjournment motions ideally allow, BJP leader S.S. Ahluwalia said Parliament was not a talking or debating club. Discussions on an issue should be put to vote, he added.        
	Bansal said accepting an adjournment motion would mean the Centre had conceded its full responsibility when controlling prices was primarily the job of states.        
	Opposition members responded with slogans. Mehgai ko samapt karo, mehgai mantri ko barkhast karo (Check price rise, sack the minister responsible for price rise), they shouted.        
	Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee watched silently.        
	In the Rajya Sabha, leader of Opposition Arun Jaitley and CPM veteran Sitaram Yechury sought a debate under rules 167 and 168.        
	This government has completely failed to check rising prices, Jaitley said.        
	Rajya Sabha chairman Hamid Ansari said there was a consensus on the need for a debate but not on the rules.        
	With Opposition members on their feet and insisting on a vote, Ansari said: I am afraid we cant conduct business like this.        
	The government is in a minority in the Upper House and though a defeat means little in terms of its health, it would amount to an embarrassing censure.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 12: The Supreme Court will decide whether a fatal drink-driving accident should invite the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder rather than that of causing death by negligence, a milder section often used now.        
	A bench today agreed to examine the matter in July while hearing a Delhi police appeal favouring the tougher provision, which can send a convict to jail for up to 10 years.        
	The police were appealing a Delhi High Court order convicting the 1999 BMW hit-and-run accused, Sanjeev Nanda, under the milder section that carries a maximum jail term of two years.        
	Salman Khan and Alistair Perreira, both accused of running over people in Mumbai, too faced the more lenient provision.        
	The high court had last July reduced Nandas sentence from five years to two, and he was released since he had served that term. His lawyers contested the police appeal today.

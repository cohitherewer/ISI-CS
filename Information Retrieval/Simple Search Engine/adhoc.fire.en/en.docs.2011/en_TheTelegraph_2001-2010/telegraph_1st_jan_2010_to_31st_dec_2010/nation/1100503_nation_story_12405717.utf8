The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Son amp; Raja take DMK chief to Delhi
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Son amp; Raja take DMK chief to Delhi
          G.C. SHEKHAR                             From top: Karunanidhi, Sonia                                 
	Chennai, May 2: The spoken and the unspoken are likely to dominate M. Karunanidhis talks with Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh in Delhi.        
	The DMK minister at the Centre who has spoken most in his own defence  communications minister A. Raja  and the one who has not spoken even once  chemicals and fertilisers minister M.K. Alagiri  have proved an embarrassment for the DMK and a strain on the partys working relationship with ally Congress.        
	The DMK chief reached Delhi today for holding discussions with the Prime Minister and the Congress president. He will be in the capital for two days.        
	Raja has been at the centre of a storm over the allocation of 2G licences. Unlike the 3G licence, which is being bid online over weeks in a transparent manner, the 2G initiative drew charges that licences were handed over to a chosen few.        
	Karunanidhi backed Raja. I have not come here with any good news to be conveyed to you people, the Tamil Nadu chief minister told reporters when asked on the Oppositions demand that Raja quit.        
	He also parried a query on whether the issue would figure in his talks with Prime Minister Singh and Congress chief Sonia.        
	Moving Raja out of the ministry will amount to admission of guilt and make those involved in the deal vulnerable to investigation. Karunanidhi can ill-afford such a crisis when a succession storm is brewing in his home.        
	Alagiris non-performance has upset Karunanidhis plans of keeping his eldest son in Delhi and his younger son M.K. Stalin in charge of the state.        
	Alagiri has been unable to adjust to Delhi politics and has been demanding a return to state with a juicy party post. Stalin, now deputy chief minister and party treasurer, has openly resisted any such move which will pose a direct challenge to his position as Karunanidhis political heir apparent.        
	Asked to stay put in Delhi, Alagiri has expressed his opposition to the arrangement by staying away from Parliament and also from his ministry by camping either in Madurai or Chennai. When Parliament was in session, Alagiri holidayed in the Maldives.        
	Asked about his sons continued absence from Parliament and office in Delhi, Karunanidhi said: You ask him.        
	Although speculation is rife that Karunanidhis daughter Kanimozhi could step into her brothers shoes, moving Alagiri out of Delhi will only cause more problems for Karunanidhi on the home front. So, till a peace plan is worked out, Alagiris tenure at Delhi may not be disturbed.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 7: The fear of a Maoist attack on forest guards has cast a shadow on the tiger census slated to start tomorrow in two tiger reserves and other forests across the state.        
	At least 9,000 forest guards of the Orissa Non-gazetted Forest Service Association has boycotted the counting process, as they want better security in Naxalite-hit forests.         
	Maoists gunned down a forest guard at Sunabeda sanctuary in Nuapada district on April 29. They attacked the check gate inside the Bharuamunda forest area and killed forest guard Sangram Swain, triggering protest from fellow staff across the state.        
	We are not going on mass leave but will not venture into the jungles to count tigers, said association general secretary J.B. Patnaik.        
	Our demands are just. We need more security, Patnaik said, adding: We will join the operation only after the government fulfils our demands.        
	Government officials said counting would be done as per schedule. No information of dislocation has reached me so far, additional principal conservator of forests (wildlife) Dinesh Singh said.         
	The disgruntled members of the association had been here and there was a long meeting and we have assured them that we will solve their problems, said Singh.         
	Sources said 550-odd foresters  not members of the association  had been pressed into conducting the census, which will be conducted till May 13.        
	The association has been demanding introduction of group patrolling in forests in place of the beat system. Its also demanded firearms besides more compensation and incentives for those working in Maoist-affected regions. Our lives too are valuable. We have communicated our demands to the forest department, said Jagabandhu Patra, another association member.

	New Delhi, Aug. 10: The Congress today stood by Mamata Banerjee despite an uproar in Parliament over her remarks on slain Maoist leader Azad.        
	This is a manifestation of Congress leaders misgivings on Azads death in a controversial encounter with Andhra Police on July 2. It also indicates the partys desire to send a reminder to the extremists that certain mistakes should not cloud the Centres genuine desire to engage in meaningful dialogue.        
	At the Lalgarh rally yesterday, Mamata had broached the Azad issue towards the end of her speech after requesting the Maoists to shun violence and come to the talks table. Azads death was a sad incident We demand a probe to know how he died, she had said. May his soul rest in peace.        
	The Opposition, however, claimed in Parliament today that the railway minister had termed his death a murder.        
	Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said: The Congress has never supported fake encounters. If somebody has genuine doubts about an encounter, there are democratic institutions in our country to seek redress from. Specific agencies have been created to deal with such situations. He was possibly hinting at the options of moving court or the human rights commission.        
	To repeated queries on Mamatas views apparently contradicting the Union home ministrys position, Tiwari said: There is nothing wrong if a cabinet minister raises an issue about which there are doubts in the peoples minds.        
	Asked if the Congress believed Azad died in a fake encounter, Tiwari said: We are not in the business of issuing certificates on a police or administrative action. It is not our job to decide whether an encounter was fake or genuine. There are institutions to look into this.        
	It is exceptional for a ruling party not to endorse its governments stand. But the Congress is not in a position to haul up Mamata because senior Congress leaders had expressed doubts about the 2008 Batla House encounter in Delhi and approached the Prime Minister for a judicial probe. Even on Azads death, many Congress leaders have privately expressed doubt. A leader said: Ask Swami Agnivesh and he will tell you the real story. There are reasons to nurture doubts.        
	With such differences among senior leaders on how to deal with the Naxalite issue, the Congress cannot denounce Mamatas approach, especially when she talks peace, development and dialogue. Tiwari said: Mamata has clearly said she does not support Naxalite violence and wants them to hold a dialogue. She wants restoration of peace in the disturbed area. What is the problem with this? Even the Congress supports this policy.        
	As soon as the Lok Sabha assembled today, the BJP and the Left kicked up a ruckus on the Lalgarh rally. They were asked to raise the issue during Zero Hour after BJPs Gopinath Munde termed Mamatas demand for stopping the joint operation against Maoists a very serious development. Munde also asked if the home ministry concurred with her views on the Azad encounter. Home minister P. Chidambaram kept mum.        
	Pranab Mukherjee, the leader of the House, said it was difficult to respond without checking out the matter with Mamata.        
	Trinamul leader Sudip Bandopadhyay said: We are opposed to the politics of violence and killing and committed to peace. The House should explain whats wrong with that position. Mamata went to the backward area where people are dying of hunger and violence and gave a call for giving up arms and talk.        
	CPMs Bansa Gopal Choudhury said Mamata should not play with the common mans interests if she was genuinely interested in peace. Her rally has given a fresh impetus to the Maoists. The operation was being carried out jointly by the central and state forces and Mamata wants to stop it. We want a clear-cut reply from the Prime Minister.

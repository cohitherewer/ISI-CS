	New Delhi, Dec. 15: Jamia Millia Islamia today presented documents to boost its demand for minority-institution status before a commission, showing that the university was set up by Muslims and mandated to prepare a roadmap for the community.        
	Its registrar, S.M. Sajid, submitted an affidavit and presented documents running into 660 pages before a three-member bench of the National Commission Minority Educational Institutions, a quasi-judicial body.         
	The HRD ministry, however, does not share the view that Jamia should be made a minority institution.        
	The documents included a decision of executive councils of Jamia Millia Society from 1920 onwards, memorandum of association of the Jamia Millia Society and speeches delivered in Parliament about the university in 1988 when the Jamia Millia Islamia Act was passed.        
	Jamia was founded by Maulana Mahmud Ali, Hakim Ajmal Khan, M.A. Ansari, Abdul Majid Khwaja and Zakir Husain. It became a central university through the Jamia Millia Islamia Act, 1988.         
	Jamias petition for minority status has been pending before the commission since 2006. A petition challenging the minority status of Aligarh Muslim University too is pending in the Supreme Court. The commission has been unable to decide as the AMU judgment may have a bearing in the Jamia case.         
	Registrar Sajid said: Freedom fighters like Maulana Mahmud Ali, the Khilafat leader and the first vice-chancellor, and Hakim Ajmal Khan wanted to build an educational institution which would serve to inculcate modern education and nationalist ideas among students, particularly Muslims.

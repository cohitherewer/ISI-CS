	May 5: Bengal wants all stakeholders in Darjeeling and the Dooras and Terai to participate in the next political-level talks to bring an end to the hill impasse, sources said today.        
	The demand is likely to delay the resolution of the problem and the setting up of an interim authority as the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, which is leading the agitation for a Gorkhaland state, is opposed to the inclusion of other outfits in the talks.        
	The next round of political-level talks is scheduled for this month-end. In the last round held in March, the state and central governments and the Morcha were involved.        
	The Gorkha National Liberation Front and the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad as well as Left Front partner RSP have been demanding that they, too, be included in the talks as they have a stake in the areas the Morcha wants to be brought under the interim set-up.        
	The Morcha has been demanding that not only the entire Darjeeling district  including Siliguri, with a predominantly Bengali population  but also the Dooars areas where Gorkhas are in a majority be included in the interim arrangement.

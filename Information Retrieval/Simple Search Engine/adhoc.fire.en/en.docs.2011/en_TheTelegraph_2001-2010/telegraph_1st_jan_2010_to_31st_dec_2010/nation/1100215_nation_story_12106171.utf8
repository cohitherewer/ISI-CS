	Feb. 14: A day after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee warned the Trinamul Congress that Left supporters would strike back if attacked, two Trinamul and two CPM activists were killed in clashes in Hooghly and Birbhum districts.        
	Three of them may have died in police firing, though officers said whose bullets hit them could not be confirmed immediately.         
	Trouble broke out in Birbhums Nanoor this morning after a Trinamul panchayat member was shot dead.        
	Munshi Nurul Islam, 38, was going to Bolpur for a party meet when a gang stopped his bike and shot him. His co-lleague, Bharat Majhi, 36, who was riding pillion, was also shot at. He is in hospital.        
	After police picked up a CPM supporter in connection with the attack, 200 partymen pounced on them and snatched him. They hurled bombs and fired, prompting the police to hit back.        
	Kalu Sheikh and Basudeb Majhi, in their late 30s, were killed. Kadar Sheikh, sustained bomb splinter injuries.        
	The police were forced to open fire. But we have to find out whether Kalu and Basudeb were killed in police firing, said Birbhum police chief Rabindranath Mukherjee.         
	At Jangipara in Hooghly, a Trinamul supporter was killed and 15 people were injured over elections to a school managing committee.         
	After the police opened fire to disperse the warring groups, Rabin Ghosh, 50, was found dead. The police were partisan. When we hit back after a CPM attack, they chased us and fired at us. Rabin was shot in the back, a Trinamul leader said. The party has lodged an FIR against the Jangipara officer-in-charge.        
	Trinamul accused the chief minister of trying to foment tension. The party has planned a black-badge protest tomorrow.

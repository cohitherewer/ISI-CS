	New Delhi, Dec. 14: Media, Northeast and Tibetans are the three unmentionables of Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabaos three-day state visit to India that starts tomorrow.         
	New Delhi has already accepted their guests first demand, so Wen and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will not address a joint news conference after their talks on Thursday morning and there will be no joint declaration. The only concession is to allow cameramen to take pictures of the two shaking hands and signing agreements.         
	On the Northeast, no request has come from the Chinese side but India does not want contentious issues, like that of Arunachal Pradesh, to cloud the visit. So there will be no cultural troupes from the region performing at the celebration of 60 years of diplomatic ties between the two countries. Wen and Singh will attend the event at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Thursday evening.         
	It is the Tibetan protesters that the Chinese fear the most and want banished from Lutyens Delhi for the duration of Wens visit. India has conveyed that the demand is unrealistic. However, Delhi police will try to keep the protesters away and an undeclared curfew might be clamped down in the Tibetan neighbourhoods, sources said.         
	That is no guarantee though that a small band of Tibetan Youth Congress (TYC) activists will not jump in the way of Wens cavalcade as it travels from the airport to the hotel tomorrow afternoon.         
	Sources in TYC said their aim is to protest outside every venue that Wen visits. They also plan to do something spectacular like climbing a tower or a tall building, especially on Thursday afternoon when Wen delivers a lecture on India-China relations at Sapru House near Connaught Place.         
	Tenzing Tsundue, a Tibetan poet who had protested against the then Premier Zhu Rongjis visit to Mumbai in 2002 and during Wens visit to Bangalore in 2005, said: Yes there would be protest this time too.         
	In a traffic advisory issued today, the police asked commuters to keep 15 minutes extra to reach their destinations on time during the duration of the visit.         
	Security has been stepped up around the Chinese embassy in Chanakyapuri. Traffic on both the carriageways will be closed during the movement of the visiting dignitary, said Satyendra Garg, the joint commissioner of police (traffic).         
	The highlight of Wens stay will be a visit to Tagore International School in Vasant Vihar tomorrow to interact with the students.

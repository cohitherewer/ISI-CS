The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Time to turn to tonga
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Time to turn to tonga
                                          
	If Britain cant help, maybe Vanuatu or Tonga can. The Lok Sabha Speaker is turning to foreign expertise to solve the problem of how to stop MPs from paralysing her House on flimsy grounds.        
	Meira Kumar will seize her chance at the four-day Conference of Speakers and Presiding Officers of the Commonwealth, which began here on Monday but will be formally inaugurated on Tuesday by the Prime Minister.        
	Meira today hoped the exchange of ideas among the delegates from 42 countries would enlighten her on how other democracies had solved such problems. Pakistan is attending the conference; so are Indias Assembly Speakers.        
	This is the third time India is hosting the conference  the 20th overall  after 1971 and 1986. It will have three workshops: on the Speakers role as a mediator, on the use of technology in the parliamentary context, and on the role of the Speaker in the administration of Parliament. The workshops will not be open to the media.        
	There will be around 250 delegates, including the presiding officers spouses and supporting staff, who are all being put up in five-star hotels. They will be taken on sight-seeing trips.        
	Meiras eloquent espousal of parliamentary democracy was, however, marred by an allegation about an attempt by her office to browbeat the media.        
	A journalist said the Lok Sabha secretary-generals office had sent him a letter asking him to reveal the source of a report he had filed recently. The Speaker promptly ordered an inquiry and asserted: No obstacle can be created in the medias work.        
	The secretary-general later claimed he had not written to any journalist.

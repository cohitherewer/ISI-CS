	Mumbai, June 7 (PTI): A father not allowing his children to watch television at a stretch and forcing them to go to bed early cannot be termed as cruelty, Bombay High Court has held, while dismissing an appeal of a Pune housewife who had sought divorce.        
	The 37-year-old woman, who had been married for 19 years and had a daughter and a son, alleged that her husband wanted their two children to watch Marathi programmes and not Hindi serials. She also claimed that the children were asked to go to bed early.        
	Dismissing her appeal against a courts order refusing to grant her divorce, the high court observed that such conduct could not amount to mental toture.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, March 19: Senior police officers from Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa met today to exchange inputs for a joint anti-Maoist operation that sources said would last a fortnight and cover a 120-200km stretch.        
	The officers, who met at the Midnapore police lines, discussed the extent of Maoist presence on the three states borders.        
	A senior officer from West Midnapore who attended the meeting said that since last weeks four-day joint exercise against the Maoists on the Bengal-Jharkhand border, the forces had been interacting with local people.        
	We have gathered some intelligence on specific Maoist presence in the border areas. At todays meeting, we shared our information with officials from Jharkhand and Orissa, he said.        
	Among those at the meeting were Bengal director-general of police (DGP) Bhupinder Singh, inspector-general of police (western range) Zulfikar Hasan, the police chiefs of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia, as well as inspectors-general from Jharkhand, Orissa and the CRPF.        
	We discussed the information we have gathered as the (upcoming) joint operation is expected to be specific and intensive and would be carried out across a stretch of 120km to 200km, an officer said.        
	If necessary, we might even go to the areas on the border of West Midnapore and Orissa. A joint exercise with Orissa was held near the West Midnapore border in January.        
	Officers said the first phase of the operation had been more exploratory in nature, and neither were Maoists arrested nor shots fired.        
	DGP Singh had expressed satisfaction over Jharkhand polices participation in the four-day joint operation.         
	The operation will be resumed after getting specific inputs, he had said.

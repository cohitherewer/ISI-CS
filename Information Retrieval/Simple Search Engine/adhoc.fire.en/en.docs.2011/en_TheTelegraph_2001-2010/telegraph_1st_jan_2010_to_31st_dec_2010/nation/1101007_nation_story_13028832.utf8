                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BPO driver guilty of assault amp; kill
                            
	Bangalore, Oct. 6 (PTI): A cab driver was today convicted of raping and murdering BPO executive Pratibha Srikanthamurthy in a five-year-old case that had forced IT firms to change womens work hours and tighten safety measures.        
	The punishment for Shiva Kumar, 27, will be announced on Friday. The maximum sentence for the crime is death.        
	The fast-track court held Kumar guilty of kidnapping, raping and murdering the married Pratibha, who was 28 then and working for HP Globalsofts call centre.        
	Pratibha, who had joined the company in 2005, could not be traced after leaving home for night shift on December 13 that year. Her body was found on Bangalores outskirts the next day.        
	Kumar, engaged by the BPO to ferry staff to office and back home in his hired vehicle, had called Pratibha that night. After his arrest, he confessed to police that he had sexually assaulted and killed the woman.        
	Pratibhas mother Gowramma, waging a lone battle for justice, broke down after the conviction and demanded death sentence for the killer of her only daughter. He (Kumar) should be hanged, should be given death sentence. It (judgment) should act as a deterrent for others not to commit such cold-blooded crime. If such criminals go scot-free, crimes will only increase, Gowramma said, breaking down.        
	The mother, in her 60s, dismissed Kumars plea in court for leniency on the ground that he had a wife and parents to look after. The accused is pleading for consideration as he has a wife and aged parents. What about me? I am all alone, my only daughter is gone. Let us wait till October 8 and then I will talk.        
	Gowramma made it clear she was ready to take the battle further. In case justice is not done, I will not keep quiet. I will fight the case in the high court, she said when asked about her future course of action.        
	The case took five years despite being handled by 11 fast-track courts. Eighty witnesses, including Pratibhas colleagues, were examined.        
	The incident saw several IT firms bring in new safety measures for women on night shifts, including security guards and GPS systems in office vehicles.

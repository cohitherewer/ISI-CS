	New Delhi, Feb. 26 (PTI): The government has raised the defence budget by about four per cent, compared to a 34 per cent rise last year.        
	In figures, the hike would be from Rs 1,41,703 crore to Rs 1,47,344 crore  a difference of Rs 5,641 crore. Secure borders and security of life and property fosters development. I propose to increase the allocation for defence to Rs 1,47,344 crore. This would include Rs 60,000 crore for capital expenditure, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said.

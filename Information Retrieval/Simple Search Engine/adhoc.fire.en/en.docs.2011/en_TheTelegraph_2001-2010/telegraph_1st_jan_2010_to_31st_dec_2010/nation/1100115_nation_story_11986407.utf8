	New Delhi, Jan. 14 (PTI): The Supreme Court has asked the Centre to grant daily allowances to the wife of the Chief Justice of India, who had accompanied him during two visits abroad last year.           
	The government provides only air tickets to the spouses of the CJI and other judges of the Supreme Court and no other allowances have been sanctioned by the department of justice, the ministry of law and justice said. The issue has come to light after RTI activist Subhash Chandra Agrawal filed a series of applications. The ministry said the matter was under examination.                   
	Jaipur (PTI): A Briton who had arrived from Pakistan was arrested for carrying a satellite phone without valid documents in Pushkar on Thursday.                  
	Ahmednagar (PTI): Two 17-year-old girls, both national-level players, committed suicide together by jumping before a train on Wednesday. One was a kabaddi player, the other a fencer. The Class XII girls had left home in college uniform, apparently to sit for exams, but headed for a railway crossing. The reason for the suicides is unknown.                  
	New Delhi (PTI): A woman member of Mumbais Boss School of Music, sentenced to three months in jail for throwing footwear at a Supreme Court judge, has gone to London, the court was told. Pavitra Murali flew to London on September 29 last year.                  
	Bangalore (PTI): The Supreme Court should refrain from filing an appeal against the Delhi High Court judgment that the office of the Chief Justice of India comes within the ambit of the Right to Information Act, MP and former Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court M. Rama Jois has said.                  
	London (PTI): A Black councillor in Bristol has been charged with racial abuse and may face jail for calling an Indian-origin Conservative colleague a coconut, after she favoured a motion to cut funding of an anti-slavery body. Shirley Brown, a Liberal Democrat, used the term to describe Jay Jethwa at a budget debate last year.

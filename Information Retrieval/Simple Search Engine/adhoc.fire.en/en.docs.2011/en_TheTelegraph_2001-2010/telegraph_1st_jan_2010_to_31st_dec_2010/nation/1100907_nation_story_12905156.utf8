          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: Bihar will have a new Assembly  perhaps also a chief minister  on November 24 after winding through a month-long six phase poll that begins on October 21 and ends on November 20.         
	Forced into a last minute review by the eruption of Naxalite activity, the Election Commission today announced its extended schedule dictated in the main by concerns over adequate security deployment in sensitive areas.        
	Hours before the dates were announced by chief election commissioner S.Y. Qureishi, chief minister Nitish Kumar had pointedly demanded optimum security presence at each polling station so people can cast their votes free of fear. Sources said the Maoist hostage crisis in Lakhisarai, which ended this morning with the unconditional release of the remaining three policemen held captive, had not merely delayed the commissions announcement, it had also necessitated a redrafting of the schedule.         
	The commission was earlier considering a four-phase polls starting after Dussehra and concluding before the Chhath festival on November 11.        
	The dates on which polling will be held for the 243-member Assembly are October 21 (47 seats), October 24 (45 seats), October 28 (48 seats), November 1 (42 seats), November 9 (35 seats) and November 20 (26 seats). The Banka Lok Sabha by-election, necessitated by the passing away of Independent member Digvijay Singh this summer, will be held on November 1. The model code of conduct came into effect even as Qureishi made his announcement.        
	Qureishi did not specifically refer to the Naxalite issue while laying out the poll schedule, saying that the factors taken into account by the commission included climate conditions, festivals, the academic calendar and security arrangements. Answering questions, he said the commission had convinced itself adequate security forces were available.         
	Although sections of the Congress are known to have favoured a much more compact poll  in two phases, some were suggesting  the Nitish government has maintained free and fair polls cannot be ensured unless the process is broken up into four phases.

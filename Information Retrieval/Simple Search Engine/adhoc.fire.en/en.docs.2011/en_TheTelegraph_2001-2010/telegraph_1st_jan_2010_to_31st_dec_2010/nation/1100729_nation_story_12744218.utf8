          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          People at Ayodhya                                  
	Ayodhya, July 28: Allahabad High Court has given Ayodhyas litigants one last chance to reconcile before it delivers its verdict in the dispute over ownership of the Babri Masjid-Ram temple land, but the offer is unlikely to find any takers.        
	The court, which on Monday concluded hearing in the 60-year-old case but reserved its judgment, yesterday invited the Sunni Central Waqf Board, Uttar Pradesh, and four Hindu trusts to find an out-of-court settlement to the dispute that divided the nation. It gave them time till August 8 to come up with proposals for reconciliation.         
	Who will take the responsibility? It is an issue relating to the entire community. We will stick to the court verdict. We understand that the Allahabad High Court initiative is just a constitutional procedure and it cannot go any further, said Zafaryab Jilani, convener of the Babri Action Committee and a well-known lawyer.         
	The courts suggestion, made under Section 89 of the Civil Procedure Code, is unusual because it comes after the case has been heard. Suggestions of out-of-court settlements are usually made at the start of a case or during hearing, not at the end.         
	Jilani, who is representing the waqf board in court, knows it would not be easy to build consensus. Besides, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, which is monitoring the issue, had said in a statement earlier it would go by the court verdict.         
	On the other side, Ramvilas Vedanti of the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas, one of the leaders of the temple movement, said: We would like to have a verdict and we know that excavations carried out on this land in 2003 by the Archaeological Survey of India have yielded enough evidence to tilt the verdict in our favour. A permanent temple would be built on this land soon after the judgment.         
	The ASI report is in court and its contents have not been made public.         
	Mahant Gyan Das, chairman of All India Akhara Parishad and another leader of the temple movement, said he would wait for the judgment, which would be in favour of the Hindus. The Nirmohi Akhara is one of the four trusts fighting the case.         
	All around the disputed 77 acres of land, where the Babri Masjid stood till it was demolished in 1992, are temples and Hindu households. On the southern fringe of this plot stands a makeshift Ram temple.         
	Like any other day, devotees queue up in a narrow passage that leads to the temple. Life goes on as usual but there is tension in the air as judgment day nears. Judges S.U. Khan, Sudhir Agarwal and D.V. Sharma of the Lucknow bench, hearing the case since 1989 when four suits filed in the lower court were clubbed together, will give their verdict in September if no compromise can be reached by then.         
	But there are moderate voices that would prefer reconciliation to a ruling, fearing that a court verdict will upset one side or the other and spark communal tension again after all these years.         
	Ayodhya craves for peace. Hence, we welcome dialogue. A verdict, whichever way it goes, will not create permanent peace for the city, says Haji Mehboob, a Muslim leader. The Ayodhya Muslim Welfare Society president, Sadiq Ali, concurs: The challenge is to get a settlement of peace.         
	The chief priest of Ayodhya, Satyendra Das, and World Peace Foundation leader Ramzan Tendavi, a Muslim moderate leader, have come up with a land exchange proposal.         
	Satyendra Das said: We proposed that an alternative plot of 77 acres be given to the Muslims . This plot of land can easily be carved out from a site at Bari Quan just about half-a-kilometre from the disputed site. There are Muslim populations all around this land and there is an old graveyard a small distance away. If a temple is proposed on this (disputed) land, a mosque can be built on that land. We wrote to the President of India two months ago, with details of this proposal. But we never heard from anyone.

	New Delhi, Dec. 6: With four of the eight new IITs yet to get land to build their campuses, the Centre today asked the states concerned to speed up the process.        
	Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal asked the education secretaries and other senior officials of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan to transfer the land and provide the sites with electricity, water and roads.        
	All the eight new IITs started in the past two years are functioning from temporary campuses, but land acquisition and campus construction have begun for the institutes in Ropar, Hyderabad, Bhubaneswar and Patna.        
	The Gujarat government has identified 400 acres for the Gandhinagar institute but of this, 200 acres belong to the Union agriculture ministry, which is reluctant to hand over this land.        
	Sibal has asked state officials to sort out the issue with the agriculture ministry or provide land at an alternative site, sources said.        
	The Madhya Pradesh government has allotted 500 acres for IIT Indore but of this, nearly 200 acres is forestland. Since this land cannot be used for the institute without its status being changed, the state government has written to the environment and forest ministry.        
	In Himachal, too, the 370 acres proposed for IIT Mandi are forestland, and the state has approached the environment and forest ministry.        
	Although Rajasthan has identified 900 acres in Jodhpur for its IIT, the land has not been transferred to the institute. Sibal has asked the state to transfer the land by the end of this month and ensure adequate electricity and water supply.        
	Sibal had held a meeting of the directors of the new IITs in September where the issue of land acquisition came up. All the new IITs have been asked to have their campuses ready by 2014.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Joshi backs JPC, just
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Joshi backs JPC, just
          J.P. YADAV                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: BJP veteran Murli Manohar Joshi today finally said what his party wanted him to on the telecom probe but held his ground that the parliamentary panel he heads had vast powers, not a limited mandate as his colleagues claim.        
	The public accounts committee chairperson, who had been told by the BJP to go slow on the spectrum scam lest it weakened its case for a joint parliamentary committee investigation, said he was fully committed to his partys demand for a JPC.        
	The septuagenarian leader issued a statement, as the BJP had wanted, but devoted only a small paragraph at the end to back the party line. Most of the statement was devoted to the role of the PAC under his chairmanship.        
	Joshi also refrained from commenting on Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs offer to appear before the PAC.         
	The BJP had wanted Joshi to clarify that there was no precedent of a Prime Minister appearing before the PAC and, therefore, the offer was meaningless.         
	As the chairman of the PAC, I believe in the committees vast powers in bringing greater accountability to public spending. I commit myself to playing this role effectively, Joshi wrote before going on to say that as a member of the BJP, I stand fully committed to the demand for the formation of a JPC to look into broader questions related to corruption facing the country.         
	The BJP has repeatedly stressed that the PAC has a limited mandate and deals with accounts and not accountability.        
	Joshi sought to counter this by pointing out that the PAC had vast powers to bring greater accountability.         
	Joshi also said the PAC had a constitutional jurisdiction and its function was well laid-out. It shall function within its purview and within the rules and procedure of Parliament. It shall make sure that every paisa of public money is well accounted for, he said.        
	The BJP leader had earlier said the PAC could go beyond the comptroller and auditor-general report and conduct its own probe into the 2G scam.        
	It could even go back to the time of the NDA regime and look into the spectrum issue from 2001, he had said.        
	His party appeared relieved after todays statement, claiming it was a big achievement to get Joshi to put in writing that he was fully committed to the demand for a JPC.         
	Sources said the party had to strive hard to secure the clarification, which came after BJP president Nitin Gadkari called on Joshi last night. Gadkari is learnt to have met Joshi on the advice of the RSS leadership.         
	When pointed out that Joshi had stressed on the PACs vast powers, BJP spokesperson Nirmala Seetharaman chose to focus on the last paragraph.        
	Please focus on the last paragraph where he has made it clear that he stands fully committed to the partys demand for a JPC probe, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Telangana CM in bandh-free pledge
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Telangana CM in bandh-free pledge
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Sept. 23: Telangana may have been delayed, not the agenda of the man who sees himself as its chief minister.        
	K. Chandrasekhar Rao has taken a leaf out of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees book, pledging a bandh-free environment in the yet-to-be-born state, much like the promise the Bengal chief minister once made but couldnt keep.        
	We will ensure an agitation-free, bandh-free environment conducive to the agricultural, industrial and educational growth of the region, the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) chief told a forum of CEOs here last evening.        
	The comments are being seen as yet another attempt by Rao to project himself and his party  which has fewer MLAs from the Telangana region than some of its rivals  as the fulcrum of the statehood movement.        
	Of the 117 members in the Andhra Assembly from Telangana, the Congress has 52, the Desam 39 and the TRS 10. The BJP (2), the MIM (7), CPI, CPM and the Lok Satta party account for the remaining MLAs.        
	I assure you that the circumstances (the agitation) of December (2009) will not be repeated once Telangana is announced, Rao, a former minister in UPA-I, told the meet, organised by the International Market Assessment, a market research body. Around 150 business leaders, including executives of companies such as DuPont, Bank of America and Apollo Hospitals, were present at the session.        
	The TRS chief  whose nine-day fast had fanned the Telangana agitation  claimed that the disruptions last winter were caused not by his party but by the counter movement against statehood. Rao said if his party came to power in a new Telangana state, business would thrive. The comment was seen as an attempt to allay apprehensions that bandhs would force firms to move out of the region.        
	Raos move to address the CEOs followed remarks by the chief minister, the Congresss K. Rosaiah, at a recent business meeting that statehood movements such as the one for Telangana hurt production, taxes and investment.         
	The TRS chief suggested there was no uncertainty over the new state, saying the process of its formation would begin once the Srikrishna panel, appointed by the Centre to examine the demand, submitted its report.

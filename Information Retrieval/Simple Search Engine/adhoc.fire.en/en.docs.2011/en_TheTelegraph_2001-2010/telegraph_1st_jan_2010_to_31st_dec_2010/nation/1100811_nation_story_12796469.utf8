          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                               
	Vijayawada, Aug. 10: The CPMs central leadership will launch a national campaign highlighting what it calls the Trinamul-Maoist nexus in Bengal, fulfilling a long-standing request by the Left partys state unit.        
	The decision was taken today at the concluding session of the CPMs four-day extended central committee meeting. The issue dominated the proceedings.        
	Party general secretary Prakash Karat said after the session that the systematic attacks by the Trinamul-Maoist gangs in Bengal is a cause of concern for all of us. We decided that the all-India party will stand by the Bengal unit by creating a national campaign against the Trinamul-Maoist nexus. Our party will be observing a solidarity week for the Bengal unit from September 12 across the country. During this period, we will campaign against the Trinamul-Maoist operations and the killings they have resorted to. We have already adopted a resolution on Bengal in this regard.        
	Sources said the state unit had been seeking the central leaderships help ever since Maoists started targeting cadres and leaders. The state leaders wanted the attacks to be given a national dimension. However, top CPM leaders in Delhi did not pay much heed over the past two years, during which over 200 cadres were killed by Maoists, the sources added.         
	A Bengal leader who raised the issue today was quoted as saying: Our central leadership should have realised the extent of the Maoist menace when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy was attacked (in a mine blast in November 2008). Merely a statement condemning the attack was issued from Delhi. The party should have rallied behind the Bengal unit from then but it didnt. Anyway, its better late than never.         
	Asked about Karats announcement on a solidarity week, a central committee leader said: All these months, the Bengal party was left to fend for itself. (But now) the politburo has understood the need to rally behind the Bengal unit in this hour of crisis.

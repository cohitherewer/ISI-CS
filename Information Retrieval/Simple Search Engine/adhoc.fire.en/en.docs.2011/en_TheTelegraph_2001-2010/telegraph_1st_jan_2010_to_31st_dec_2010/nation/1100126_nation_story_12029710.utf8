          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Chidambaram                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: P. Chidambaram today described the cold shoulder to Pakistani cricketers at the Indian Premier League auction as a disservice to cricket and distanced the government from it.        
	The Union home minister said there was no hint or nudge from the government to ignore the Pakistanis, saying some of them were among the best Twenty20 players.        
	These players were coming as individuals, it was not a Pakistan team, he said. I dont know why the IPL teams acted in (this) manner. But certainly to suggest that there was a hint or nudge from the government is completely untrue.        
	Foreign minister S.M. Krishna had earlier said the government had nothing to do with the IPL franchise owners decision to ignore the Pakistanis.

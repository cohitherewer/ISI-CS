          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Aug. 28: Osmania University students chased and beat up teachers from outside Telangana to stop them from marking BEd answer scripts, as violence flared again today at the nerve centre of the struggle for statehood.        
	Pro-Telangana students of the university in Hyderabad have earlier heckled teachers from outside the region over evaluation of papers, but this is the first time they have assaulted them.        
	Police stepped in to save the teachers, who ran with their books and laptops. Some teachers have been beaten up the situation is under control now. We are waiting for complaints to initiate further action, a senior police officer told PTI.        
	The police later set up barricades around the university.        
	Vice-chancellor Tirupathi Rao condemned the attack and said action would be taken against the guilty students.        
	At the root of todays flare-up were allegations of injustice to students from Telangana and a demand that only teachers from the region should evaluate their papers. These non-Telangana teachers will always fail Telangana students, the students of the Telangana Joint Action Committee screamed as university teachers sat down to evaluate the answer papers.        
	Leaders of the joint committee also asked teachers from Andhra and Rayalaseema regions to leave the campus. When some teachers ignored their warning, the students entered the university hall and chased them out. The students thrashed two lecturers, while the others, including women, fled.        
	The joint action committee leaders later denied they had beaten up any teachers but demanded that all evaluators from outside Telangana should leave the campus by August 30.        
	Vice-chancellor Rao said such discrimination would ruin the universitys academic spirit. Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan, the universitys chancellor, has sought details of the incident.        
	The university has emerged as the nerve centre of the statehood struggle. Four students have committed suicide to press for the creation of Telangana.

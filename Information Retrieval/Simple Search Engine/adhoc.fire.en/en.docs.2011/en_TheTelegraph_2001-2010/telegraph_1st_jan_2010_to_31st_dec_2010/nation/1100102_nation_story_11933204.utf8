	New Delhi, Jan. 1: I drink, you drive.        
	Call it playing safe or just fear of prosecution, but people in Delhi who had a peg too many this New Years Eve chose to be driven home.        
	Kamal Sirohi, a software executive who went pubbing with his girlfriend he is going to marry on January 16, did just that. He took a cab.         
	Why risk being caught and embarrassed in front of others? I knew that if I called a cab I could still enjoy myself, he said. Its better to pay Rs 400 for a cab service than to be hauled to court and pay a fine of Rs 2,000 or land up in jail.        
	Kamal wasnt the only partygoer who preferred to be driven home. Many booked cabs well in advance, lest the lawmen spoil their 31st night. The result: 189 drink-driving cases compared with 274 on December 31, 2008.        
	Police officials said the credit should go to the vigil the cops kept on the streets of the capital. Police teams were present across the capital to check people driving under the influence of alcohol. We had set up pickets everywhere in the city, Delhi police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat said.        
	Many officials said the fine slapped on drunken drivers also acted as a deterrent. Under the law, such drivers have to be sent to court which decides the punishment. The Motor Vehicles Act lays down a fine of Rs 2,000 or six months in jail or both for first-time offenders.        
	A repeat offence within three years could lighten the pocket by Rs 3,000 or bring two years in jail, or both. According to new guidelines approved by the Delhi government, the police can also seize the licence of a person caught driving under the influence of alcohol.        
	Recently, a court made a 21-year-old write 50 times that he wouldnt mix drink and drive before letting him off.        
	The young man left the court sober and mortified, but his peers in Mumbai didnt appear to have read of his chastening experience.         
	A PTI report from Mumbai said 720 motorists, most of them between 21 and 25, were caught for drunken driving during New Year celebrations.        
	Under a special drive, traffic police armed with breathalysers had fanned out across the financial capital last night. Today, 170 of the 720 offenders were produced before a court, which sentenced 141 to simple imprisonment of one to 10 days.        
	The spirits were no less high in the capital, but revellers were cautious, booking cabs months in advance. Several cab services had also tied up with pubs and bars spreading the message: You drink, I drive.        
	A poster in one restaurant read: If you find this hard to read  book a cab!        
	Among those who did was Anjali Suri.        
	We heard magistrates and policemen were checking for drunken driving. Since all of us drink, we approached the pub manager and told him to arrange for a cab, said the student. It was a lot more fun because we, an all-girl group, could go out and not think of how to get home.

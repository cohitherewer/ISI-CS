	Islampur, May 14: Mohammed Tazuddin had hoped to see his son freed from a Pakistan prison, but before his wish could be fulfilled the home guard died of a heart attack on May 6.         
	Tazuddin and wife Gulshan Begum said they had been told by the home ministry that their son Abdul Karim would be freed in May, but there have been no talks between India and Pakistan on prisoners release after the 26/11 attacks.         
	Karim, 22, used to teach in a madrasah at Patiala, Punjab. The family claims he was caught by Pakistani border guards in 2005 when he strayed into the no mans land. Since then he has been lodged in a Rawalpindi prison.         
	Tazuddin had initially thought his son was dead as Karim had not written to him for a long time. But he was spotted in the Rawalpindi jail by the International Red Cross that also delivered his first letter to his parents on December 14, 2007. Abba, I am well. Please look after mother. I am lodged in a jail in Pakistan. Pray to Allah that I get freedom and, if you can, try and get me released, he had written in Urdu.         
	We recognised his handwriting and wrote back, telling him not to worry, said Gulshan Begum at her home at Goalpokhor, 50km from Islampur in North Dinajpur.        
	Nagesh Singh, a foreign ministry director dealing with Pakistan affairs, said over the phone from Delhi: There were talks between India and Pakistan at the recent Saarc conference in Bhutan. But we are not sure if and when Karim would be released.

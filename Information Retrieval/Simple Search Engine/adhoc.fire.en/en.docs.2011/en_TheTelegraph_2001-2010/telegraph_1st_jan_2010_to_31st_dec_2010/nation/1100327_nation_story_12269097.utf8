	New Delhi, March 26: Army chief General Deepak Kapoor today asked human resource development minister Kapil Sibal to introduce lessons on the armed forces in high school curricula to encourage more youths to join the defence forces.         
	The lessons could focus on the history and the ethos of the armed forces, Kapoor told Sibal during a programme to launch books on the army. HRD ministry sources said they would consider the proposal.         
	Kapoors request comes at a time the army has been struggling with a shortage of officers.

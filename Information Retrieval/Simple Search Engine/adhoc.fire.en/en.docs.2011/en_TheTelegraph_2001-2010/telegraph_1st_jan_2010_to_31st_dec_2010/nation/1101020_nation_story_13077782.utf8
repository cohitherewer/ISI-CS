  - In vacant Commonwealth village, workers who built it taste the fruits of their labour        IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          A worker takes a dip in the pool at the Commonwealth Games Village in New Delhi on Monday.

	New Delhi, Oct. 19: Krishan Kumar, 25, a sweeper at the Commonwealth Games Village, does not know how to swim. But he didnt think twice before taking the plunge at one of the two swimming pools at the Village yesterday.         
	I just wanted to experience how it felt like bathing in a swimming pool. During the Games, I used to see the athletes having a great time in the pools and I did not want to miss this opportunity of a lifetime, Krishan, who belongs to Bihar, said as a group of workers looked on.        
	Paani bahut thanda hai (The water is cold), he shouted. The other workers, who had already taken a dip, broke into laughter.         
	After 15 minutes, he came out and wrapped himself in a gamchha. Its unbelievable, he said, taking out some sunscreen lotion from his trouser pocket and dabbing it on his face and body.        
	Among a lot of other leftovers, Krishan got more than 20 sunscreen lotion tubes while cleaning one of the flats where the athletes had stayed.         
	This is how the athletes, especially the women, used to apply it before basking in the sun outside the swimming pools. Even I have to work under the sun now, so lets try it, he chuckled.         
	Over 500 workers, who have been working at the Village for two to three months, have over the past three days been living a different life at work  wearing sunscreen, getting into the pool, working out at the gymn and getting their meals from the kitchen which served the nearly 6,000 athletes.         
	We are in a different world altogether. Many of us had never seen swimming pools, said Ajay Kumar, a driver, who is attached to the Delhi Development Authority.         
	DDA had hired the workers, mostly housekeeping staff, on contract for the Games. Working in shifts, they looked after the residential complex, the sports complex, the bar and the discotheque. Since Saturday, when the athletes left, they have been living at the Village, cleaning and scrubbing the flats and getting them ready for sale. Of the 1,100-odd flats, about 700 belong to the DDA, which took them over along with the sports complex yesterday, and the rest to builders Emaar MGF. The flats will be sold but we are yet to finalise the mode of sale, a DDA official said.                    Workers sit by the pool. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha    
	Today was the last day at work for the housekeeping staff. Most have got goodies to take back home  T-shirts, shoes, perfumes, sunscreen lotions, shampoos, towels, Bermudas and blankets left behind by the athletes and their families in the flats. We will use sunscreen lotion as we work under the blazing sun during summer. Some of us have already started using it, smiled Anju Devi, a cleaner. Co-worker Naresh Kumar said he would gift one to his girlfriend.         
	Rishi Raj Jainth, another worker, was happy with the mutton and rice lunch dished out for the workforce from the kitchen that has made 5.5 lakh meals through the Games. We are getting good food and also doing some exercise at the gym that the players used to go to. What more could we ask for? he said.         
	Anju recounted how the athletes drank and danced through the night on October 13, the day before the closing ceremony. Most of them came down from their flats and danced outside. It was a great scene. Before leaving, some of them gifted a few dollars to the liftmen, she said, her face clouding, suddenly aware the partys over.

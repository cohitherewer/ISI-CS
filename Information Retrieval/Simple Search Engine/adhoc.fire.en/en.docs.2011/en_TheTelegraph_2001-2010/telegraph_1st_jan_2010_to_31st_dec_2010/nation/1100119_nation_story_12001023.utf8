The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tough time for Rahul
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tough time for Rahul
          NALIN VERMA                          Sharma (left) and Tytler: In line of fire?                                  
	Patna, Jan. 18: Senior Congress leaders in the state are yet to breathe easy with dissidents in the party having started to boycott meetings and raising their voice against the controversial executive committee list ahead of Rahul Gandhis visit.        
	The dissidents  who include almost all legislators and even those who had found place as office-bearers in the old list  did not attend the meeting convened by Congress general secretary in charge of Bihar, Jagdish Tytler, a couple of days ago. Tytler also threatened that the dissidents would be dealt sternly if they started anti-party activities.        
	However, unruffled at Tytlers tough word, Sikta MLA Khurshid Alam turned the heat back on him. Tytler failed to save his own symbol as the party asked him to withdraw it during the last Lok Sabha polls because of his alleged involvement in the 1984 riots, Alam said, adding: How can the man who is accused of fomenting riots can revamp the party in Bihar?        
	Alam demanded immediate dismissal of Anil Sharma as the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief. He alleged that Sharma and Tytler were weakening the party from inside and accused them of indulging in anti-party activities.         
	Most of the legislators, MPs and senior party leaders who have been gunning for the heads of Tytler and Sharma continue to boycott meetings convened by the duo.                          
	In defence, Tytler, however, clarified that the controversial list has been declared un-authoritative.        
	The party is working on a fresh list, which will suitably accommodate all the sections of society, he said, refusing to comment on the MLAs rebellion.        
	BPCC general secretary Premchand Mishra exuded confidence that the difference would be sorted out within four-five days and all the Congressmen would work together to ensure a successful trip of Rahul later this month.        
	Another senior dissident leader, Umakant Singh, said: We have nothing against Tytler, who has been doing the work assigned by the party high command. But we will not settle on anything less than the removal of Sharma as BPCC chief and scrapping of the controversial list.

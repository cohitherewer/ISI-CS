          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: The Election Commission has admitted that it misplaced two complaints drawing the panels attention to the use of child labour in elections and Dalits being denied entry in some Rajasthan booths.        
	Acting on one of the complaints by advocate Radhakant Tripathy, the commission had issued an order on May 1, 2009, to all state chief secretaries and chief electoral officers to desist from employing child labour in the election process.         
	However, in a reply to an RTI application filed by Tripathy, the panel admitted that a letter written by the advocate on May 1, 2009, drawing the commissions attention to the problem, was not traceable.         
	Another letter written by Tripathy on May 12, 2009, alleging that upper castes were not allowing Dalits to enter several poll booths in Rajasthan, was also not available with the commission, the principal information officer had told the advocate. The panel, however, said it had forwarded Tripathys complaint about the Dalits to the Rajasthan chief electoral officer.         
	Tripathy has now filed another application asking the panel whether it has a system of making diary notings of all complaints received. The fact that my complaint was not traceable remains a matter of regret, Tripathy said. Tripathy urged the commission to make diary entry of letters and complaints

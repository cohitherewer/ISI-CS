          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: The Centre appears willing to devise an amnesty policy for Kashmiri youths who had crossed over to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir for terror training but now want to return.        
	Many of these youths had crossed over for training in terror camps. Some now want to return home. There were others who went to PoK for emotional, social and economic reasons. We are conscious of the human aspect of the problem, a senior home ministry official said.        
	Omar Abdullah had raised the issue at chief ministers conference on internal security yesterday. Officials put the number of such youths at 800, but unofficial sources believe it could be twice as much.         
	The policy will be drawn up by the state government and the ministry, which may soon call a meeting of state officials to discuss the proposal.

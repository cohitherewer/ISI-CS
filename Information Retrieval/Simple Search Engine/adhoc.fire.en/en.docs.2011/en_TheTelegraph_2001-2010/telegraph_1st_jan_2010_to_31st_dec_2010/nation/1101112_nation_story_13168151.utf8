          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: The Centre today informed the Supreme Court it has set up a 10-member committee to monitor creation of foodgrain storage capacity and prudently manage stocks but sidestepped the matter of releasing more to the public distribution system (PDS).        
	The committee will be headed by the secretary, food and public distribution.        
	The court has repeatedly asked for more grain for ration shops so that it reaches the poor. The government has been resisting, citing the heavy subsidies involved in transport and distribution.         
	It has released an additional 2.5 million tonnes but is still sitting on 55 million tonnes, which is in excess of storage capacity.        
	In an affidavit filed today, the Centre said it has been allotting 35kg foodgrain to each of the 6.5 crore below poverty line (BPL) families. The revised population figures of 2010 have added 1.7 crore families and the additional allocation of 2.5 million tonnes is enough to meet their requirements, it said.         
	An NGO had filed an application demanding that the government release at least an extra 25 million tonnes, claiming that not every family was getting 35kg foodgrain.         
	The court has kept up pressure on the government, asking why it could not shift to one ration card per person and what it was doing to check corruption and leakage. It sought a response on fully computerising the PDS system and handing ration shops to state warehousing corporations to run. The government will have to respond by November 29.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: The railway ministry is planning to introduce a draft bill in Parliaments next session to ensure more benefits to its employees who have been excelling in sports.        
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee today announced the proposal while felicitating 25 Commonwealth Games medal winners at Rail Bhavan.        
	I have asked my officials to prepare a draft with a focus on sportspersons in the railways to ensure more benefits such as timely promotions, better increments and postings of their choice, she announced to applause from the audience.        
	They are our pride and we need to do everything possible to take care of them and their families. Their promotions should not be delayed on flimsy technical grounds. I do not want all this, she said, with a glance at railway board members sitting beside her.        
	Mamata then recounted what P.T. Usha and Shiny Abraham had told her when she was Union minister for youth and sports in 1992. Shiny told me how she was having problems at home and could not concentrate on her training. Usha complained to me how she was being denied promotion. I felt really bad.        
	The 13 gold medal winners, including Bengals Dola Banerjee, got a cash prize of Rs 10 lakh each. Those who won silver got Rs 6 lakh each. The bronze medallists got Rs 4 lakh each.        
	The cash prize was in addition to the railway sports promotion board awards of Rs 5 lakh for gold medal winners, Rs 3 lakh for silver winners and Rs 2 lakh for bronze winners.        
	Banerjee said her ministry was preparing a list of players who would represent the country in the Olympics. We will select the best of the lot and provide all the help and infrastructure (required) so that they can win more medals for the country.

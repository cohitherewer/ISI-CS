          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 22: The Bengal government today put to work austerity measures announced by the state finance minister to tide over the ongoing financial crisis and help save around Rs 1,200 crore a year.         
	On November 12, Asim Dasgupta had announced a 10 per cent cut in non-planned expenditure besides increasing the value added tax (VAT) from 12.5 per cent to 13.5 per cent.        
	The cuts in expenses include money spent on luxurious dcor in offices, unnecessary travel, lavish menus during meetings and other government programmes and needless use of government vehicles.         
	We have sent a circular to all government offices across Bengal detailing where costs will have to be cut. The order comes into effect from today, said an official of the finance department.        
	This kind of austerity drive is nothing new in the state. We have on earlier occasions imposed restrictions on expenditure. For example, the circular we are issuing today is just a repeat of a 2008 order, the official said.        
	The circular, however, has kept salary, pensions and hospital medicines outside the purview of the cost curtailment.         
	Among other things, the circular said allotment of fuel per vehicle in government offices would not exceed eight litres a day. No hiring of cars shall be allowed without specific approval of the finance department.         
	Also, no government-funded foreign trips will be allowed. Visits outside the state, except for meetings formally convened by the Centre, are to be undertaken with the prior permission of the state chief secretary.        
	Utmost economy must be observed in organising conferences/ seminars/ workshops, etc. The practice of holding meetings and conferences at hotels and other private premises should be discouraged as far as possible. Participation in fairs and exhibitions should be kept to the minimum, the circular said.        
	The circular also spelt out the rules of air travel. Utmost efforts (should) be made to take advantage of the increasing competition among airlines and schemes offering discounts, it said, adding, No expenditure on furnishing of office rooms shall be incurred during the current financial year. Also, no new vehicles will be purchased.        
	In June 2008, the Bengal government had launched an austerity drive to rein in avoidable non-planned expenditure with projected savings of around Rs 800-850 crore for the period to March 2009, sources in the state finance department said.         
	However, in the eight-nine months following the announcement of the austerity measures, the government was way behind the target because it could save only about Rs 300-350 crore. The government had then tried to cut down on non-planned expenses, because it was preparing itself for implementing the Fifth Pay Commission recommendations from April 2009 that had huge financial implications. So, it had thought of saving some money but eventually couldnt achieve much, a source said.        
	This time, with the state government having become dependent on ways and means advances as well as overdrafts to tide over its financial crisis, the administration expects to rake in around Rs 1,000-1,200 crore in the four-odd months remaining in the ongoing fiscal through similar measures.        
	This figure also appears to be of a tall order. The government has already created more than one lakh jobs and hence the salary bill has shot up significantly. So, how much can the government additionally save by cutting down on transport expenses and with a freeze on recruitment is a big question, said a finance department official.

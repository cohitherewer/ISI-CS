The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jamia VC inherits funds crunch
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Jamia VC inherits funds crunch
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, June 21: The human resource development ministry is struggling to rescue Jamia Millia Islamia from a funds crunch after the university used up money allocated for five years within three under former vice-chancellor Mushirul Hasan.         
	HRD minister Kapil Sibal has assured current vice-chancellor Najeeb Jung that the ministry will help with additional funds without which university expansion plans may be put on hold, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	Jung, who took over as vice-chancellor from Hasan in September, has told the ministry he would be unable to deliver on his promise to transform Jamia into one of the countrys best universities without the additional funds.         
	It is rare for universities and other higher educational institutions to use up allocated funds even by the end of the allotted time for utilisation, often because of bureaucratic red tape over the release of funds.         
	Sources said Jung discovered that Jamia had by the time he took over already used up almost all of the funds it was allocated under the XIth Five-Year Plan that runs up to 2012. These plan funds are meant for projects a university wants to start over the five-year period. Apart from the Rs 185 crore Jamia was allocated under the plan by the UGC, the university also used up an additional Rs 22 crore it was awarded for special projects.         
	Jung approached Sibal, pleading for additional funds of about Rs 50 crore to overcome the crunch, the sources said. Every new vice-chancellor has his own plans and wants to do something new. Jung was desperate, a source said.         
	The ministry has itself frequently complained about a shortage of funds, but Sibal agreed to Jungs request at a time Jamia was at the centre of an inter-ministerial tussle.         
	Sibal and minority affairs minister Salman Khursheed are at loggerheads over whether Jamia should be awarded minority institution status. The HRD minister is opposed to the move but Khursheed has argued in favour of converting Jamia into a minority varsity.         
	The HRD minister has argued that the university was created on the basis of secular principles and must not change its character.         
	But the stand Jamia itself takes on the debate could swing the governments decision on whether or not to convert the varsity to a minority institution.         
	Sibal is keen not to displease Jamia,which has not taken a position either for or against minority status  at present, sources said.

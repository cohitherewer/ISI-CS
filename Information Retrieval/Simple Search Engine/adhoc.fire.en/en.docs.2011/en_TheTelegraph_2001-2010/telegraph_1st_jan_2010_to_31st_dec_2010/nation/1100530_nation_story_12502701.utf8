	Giridih, May 29: The body of a five-year-old boy, who was abducted from Kodadih last evening, was recovered this morning from a well in the same locality in Jamua, around 35km from the district headquarters.        
	According to Jamua police, Aman Kumar, son of Mukesh Mandal of Kodadih, was apparently killed as his father refused to pay the ransom of Rs 5 lakh.        
	Tension ran high in the area as the news spread. Villagers got hold of the alleged abductors  Raju Mandal, Choa Mandal and Sukar Mandal, all residents of Kodadih.        
	According to sources, some villagers had seen Raju and his aides throwing something into the well last night, but Jamua police was allegedly reluctant to arrest the trio.        
	The furious crowd would have lynched the trio had the superintendent of police, A. V. Homkar, not intervened and arrested them, said an eyewitness.        
	Six more persons were made accused in the FIR after the deceaseds father alleged that they were hand in glove with Raju and his aides.        
	The SP could not be contact for comment on the issue.

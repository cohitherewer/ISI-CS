The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | More fun to be fan than owner
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      More fun to be fan than owner

	Calcutta, April 17: In this season of the Kochi curse, it makes sense to be a fan rather than an owner.        
	Shah Rukh Khan didnt just stand when the Kolkata Knight Riders crushed the Rajasthan Royals at the Eden tonight. He cheered. He clapped. He tried the Mexican wave. He even head-banged to Baranday roddur!        
	When the winning runs were scored, Shah Rukh stood atop his chair and waved the KKR flag.        
	Was it merely a gesture to crush rumours that he is selling off his stake in KKR? Did it have something to do with the presence  at the other end of the 32K gallery  of his Baazigar co-star Shilpa Shetty?         
	The Bollywood superstar who came to Calcutta on Saturday was a fan first, the owner later.         
	If Shah Rukh was scripting a superhit in the stands, Sourav Ganguly was starring in his own blockbuster in the middle. After a brilliant catch to dismiss Yusuf Pathan in the first innings, the Knight Riders captain scored a 50-ball 75 to guide his team to an eight-wicket victory.         
	As Ganguly took what was clearly the catch of his life, SRK stood up, clenched his fist and pumped the air three times.         
	Theres one word to describe Dada and thats Dada, he said later. Detractors may say what they want I have faith in him. Once a hero, always a hero he is one of our greatest cricketing legends.         
	There was a question mark over whether Shah Rukh would at all attend the Saturday match. He wasnt here during the last Eden match, choosing to be beside his friend and colleague Bobby Chawla who suffered a brain haemorrhage.        
	With KKR virtually out of the tournament after their loss to Chennai Super Kings on Tuesday, few would have put their money on SRK flying in to Calcutta today.         
	But Shah Rukh the fan reached Eden early. For the first time this IPL, the King was on his throne seven minutes before the match began. Surely, he wasnt responding to a Calcutta police request to spectators to reach the stadium early following the Chinnaswamy Stadium blasts earlier in the day. He wanted to be there for KKR from Ball One.        
	Shah Rukh wasnt alone. Arjun Rampal and Sanjay Kapoor, Anil Kapoors younger brother, made the unlikely troika of Bolly men supporting the Calcutta team. They were joined by their wives a few overs into the match.        
	Hrithik Roshans wife Sussanne, actress Neelam and Sherlyn Chopra added glamour to the KKR corner in the 32K stand. At the other end of the makeshift gallery, Rajasthan Royals owner Shilpa was flanked by husband Raj Kundra and sister Shamita Shetty.         
	Unlike other days, there was no smoke break for Shah Rukh today. With son Aryan on one side and daughter Suhana on the other, he stayed put in his chair throughout the Rajasthan innings and then was back from the AC lounge in the very first over of the KKR innings.

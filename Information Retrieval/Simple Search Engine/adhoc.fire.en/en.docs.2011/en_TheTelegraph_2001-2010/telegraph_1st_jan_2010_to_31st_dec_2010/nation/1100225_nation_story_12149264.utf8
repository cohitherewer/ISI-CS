                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Train heist on day of budget
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, Feb. 24: Miscreants stole Rs 4.3 lakh in cash and jewellery worth Rs 40,000 from a family on the Sealdah-Balia Express this afternoon, not long after Mamata Banerjee promised greater safety in the railway budget.        
	The incident occurred between Naihati and Garifa stations, 47km from Calcutta, around 2.20pm, an hour after the train had left Sealdah. One of the miscreants was caught and handed over to police, but his accomplices escaped with the valuables.        
	Transporter Inderjeet Rai, 34, and his family noticed that two suitcases were missing from their upper berth in the S8 sleeper coach just after the train pulled out of Naihati, police said.        
	The Rais had seen around seven men standing near their seats. When they found the suitcases missing after the train pulled out of Naihati, Rais friend Shailendra spotted one of the men trying to leave the compartment through the vestibule and alerted Inderjeet, who chased him. Bibek jumped off the train but Inderjeet grabbed him after a chase, said a GRP official in Bandel, the next stop where the Rais lodged a complaint.        
	Bibek told the cops his brother-in-law, Montu Sarkar, an alleged criminal from Nadias Ranaghat, was involved in the heist.

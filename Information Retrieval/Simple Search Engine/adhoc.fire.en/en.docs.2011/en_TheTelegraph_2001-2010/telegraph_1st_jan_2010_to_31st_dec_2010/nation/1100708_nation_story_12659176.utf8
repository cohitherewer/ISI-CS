          SUJAN DUTTA                          Hemchandra Pandeys wife Babita cries over his coffin in New Delhi on Wednesday. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                                  
	New Delhi, July 7: His bullet-riddled and cut-up body beside her as she sat listening to speech after speech, Hemchandra Pandeys widow Babita whispered into the ears of a friend and her husbands former classmate in journalism school: They have taken away his life; I dont want them to take away his identity.        
	Hem, as he was known among friends and colleagues who assembled here under a white shamiana in Swami Agniveshs quarters, was killed with Maoist leader Azad on the night of July 1-2.        
	The Andhra police alleged he was a Maoist. Hem Pandeys wife and friends insist he was a journalist. But here, as the mourners gathered to take his body for the last rites at Nigambodh Ghat, Hems friends justified his life as both activist and journalist.        
	Strangely, the debate being foisted on us is whether Hem was a journalist or a Maoist, said AP Civil Liberties Committee leader Raghu Nath who accompanied Babita and the body from Hyderabad last night. The question really should be: does the state have the right to kill in either event?        
	On Monday, Babita had met Andhra home minister P. Sabita Indra Reddy and showed her husbands payslips as evidence of Hems employment with the Delhi-Assam Roadways Corporation Limited for which he ran a house journal. He was always helping me out in designing the journal, his DARCL colleague Rajneesh Jha said.        
	I was Hems classmate in the journalism course of 2007 in Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, said Renu Sharma, the friend into whose ears Babita had whispered. Hem became commodities editor with Vyapar Khabar, a Hindi paper in Uttarakhand. He gave up the job, moved to Delhi and free-lanced.        
	He wrote under two names: Hem Pandey and Hemant Pandey. He even filed an affidavit that he uses those two names, said Hems younger brother Rajeev.Agnivesh, the Centres interlocutor for Maoist talks, has demanded a judicial probe into Azads killing. I will meet home minister P. Chidambaram tomorrow and place the demand, he said in Calcutta.

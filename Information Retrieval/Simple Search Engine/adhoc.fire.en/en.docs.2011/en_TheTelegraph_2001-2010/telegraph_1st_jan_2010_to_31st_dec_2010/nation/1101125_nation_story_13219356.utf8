The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Too heady? Learn from Buddhas mistakes 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Too heady? Learn from Buddhas mistakes 
          ASHIS CHAKRABARTI                              Nitish Kumar (top), Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee				                                 
	If Nitish Kumar thought he had nothing to learn from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, he would do well to think again. The large Bihari population in Calcutta could actually vouch for Kumars need to take a leaf out of the Bengal leaders book.         
	Bengals beleaguered chief minister knows all about whopping election victories  and damning defeats. Bihars new messiah on Wednesday looked like what Bhattacharjee did four years ago  the new-age leader in whom the people overwhelmingly reposed their hope and trust a second time.        
	There have been other leaders who won successive popular mandates. In Kumars Bihar itself, Lalu Prasad won three consecutive elections. Elsewhere in the country, Sheila Dikshit, Narendra Modi, Naveen Patnaik and Raman Singh beat anti-incumbency to win successive elections.         
	So did N. Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra Pradesh not so long ago. And all of them rode the wave of the peoples hope for good governance and development.         
	So did Bhattacharjee in 2006, when the Left Front won 235 out of the 294 seats in the state Assembly. Then came the shock waves  in the 2008 rural polls, the 2009 Lok Sabha polls and finally in the civic elections in May this year.         
	Barring a miracle, the exit of the long-ruling Left from Writers Buildings in next years Assembly polls is believed to be as certain as death and taxes.        
	The point is not about once-popular leaders biting the dust; that happens to leaders all the time everywhere. The message that Kumar can take from Bengal is how peoples hope from a leader can turn to utter frustration, and even anger, if he does not deliver. In his hour of triumph, Kumar may read the danger signals from Bhattacharjees example.         
	It is generally agreed that Kumars first term was hugely successful in lifting the dark clouds from Bihars horizon. Bihar was no longer the archetypal badlands of India that it had become both in popular imagination and in reality. Its girls were going to school on bicycles donated by the government. Its women tasted empowerment the way they had never known it since Independence. For the first time, its police and bureaucrats were behaving like real lawkeepers and administrators, rather than henchmen of political bosses and mafia leaders.         
	Bhattacharjee, too, began on a note new to Bengal. He seemed to be genuinely trying to woo investment and capital and, more important, denounce his own partys old rhetoric on class and capital. Investors responded positively. Domestic and foreign media saw Calcutta on a roll and portrayed Bhattacharjee as Indias Deng Xiaoping.         
	The change that Kumar brought to Bihar has also been noted favourably in the media at home and abroad, although none had actually gone so far as to see Bihar being on a roll. But everyone saw in Kumars government a new hope for Bihar. Wednesdays poll results gave a convincing picture of that hope.         
	So what went wrong for Bhattacharjee? Two things, Kumar could tell himself, if he cared to look for the answers. Bengals chief minister failed to deliver on the promises of development that prompted the people to give him a massive second win. Mamata Banerjee did what she had done earlier too  oppose the government in her own ways. But, from the start of his second term, Bhattacharjee gave the impression that the second mandate swept him off his feet and made him lose touch with the reality. His government began to falter and then to fail on the governments delivery mechanism.         
	The other problem for Bhattacharjee was his inability to keep his party away from the administration. It was not entirely his fault that the CPM saw the party and the government as one and the same thing. But Bhattacharjee had raised a hope that he would dismantle the partys control of the government but failed to do anything about it. In fact, the massive victory in 2006 made the party even more all-pervasive.        
	If Kumar is to avoid Bhattacharjees fate, he could learn from the latters mistakes.

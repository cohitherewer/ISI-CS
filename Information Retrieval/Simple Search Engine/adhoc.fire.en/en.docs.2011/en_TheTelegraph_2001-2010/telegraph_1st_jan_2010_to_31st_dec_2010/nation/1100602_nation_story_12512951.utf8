	Patna, June 1: Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and Pilibhit MP Varun Gandhi will be the highlights of the BJPs two-day national executive meeting beginning here from June 12 after 16 years.        
	Varun and Modi have never been a part of any major political campaign of the NDA in the state for the simple reason that Nitish Kumar did not like their presence for fear of losing his governments popularity among the minority community.        
	In fact, the chief minister criticised the two leaders at every available opportunity. Very conscious of his pro-Muslim and socialist image, Nitish maintained distance from the two hardline faces of his right wing Hindu partner.        
	Modi and Varun are part of our national executive and they will join the meet along with L.K. Advani, Nitin Gadkari, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jeitley besides all the chief ministers, deputy chief ministers and state party chiefs, said BJP general secretary and in-charge of Bihar affairs, Ananth Kumar, here today.        
	Kumar, along with other senior BJP leaders, was here to supervise the arrangements for the meet in poll-bound Bihar. Replying to a query if the two leaders will address the meeting, Kumar said: Yes. They are our party leaders and they will speak.        
	For Kumar, success of the meet, as the BJP could not stake claim for the chief ministers chair in neighbouring Jharkhand last month despite week-long efforts by him and Rajnath Singh.        
	The meeting will culminate with a rally at the Gandhi Maidan. Sources revealed that the party top brass would like Nitish to address the rally as the NDA chief minister.         
	The sources also revealed that the BJP had decided to bring in Modi and Varun in Nitishs Bihar and let them speak only after securing the sanction from the Bihar chief minister.                           
	Nitish apparently has communicated to the BJP leadership that he had no objection in the BJP leaders speaking at their party meet provided they keep their speeches free from anti-Muslim rhetoric.        
	In fact, Gadkari, too, appears to have read Nitishs mantra of how to tread in Bihar to stay in power. Ensuring the return of the NDA is top priority of the BJP, Gadkari had said, soon after taking over as the BJP chief.        
	There is nothing wrong in stooping to conquer. If Varun and Modi, maintaining a low-profile, help the NDA gain more votes in Bihar, the two leaders will happily do that, a senior BJP leader said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Bhubaneswar, March 14: With the mercury already crossing the 40C-mark, the state health department has directed all government-run hospitals to create special wards for sunstroke patients and keep ambulances ready.        
	Earlier, the district administration had directed all educational institutions to finish examinations by March 15 and begin morning classes.        
	The hospitals have been also been directed to keep air-coolers, cold water, ice and sufficient ORS packets in the health community centre. About 32,85,583 ORS packets; 11,70,558 saline bottles; 95,68,100 paracetamol tablets; and 31,31,800 halogen tablets have already been kept ready in the central medicine centre at Bhubaneswar.         
	All district headquarter hospitals have been provided medicines and ORS packets, health minister Prasanna Acharya said after a high-level meeting here.        
	Control rooms have already been opened in all district and block hospitals to report sunstroke cases from the ground level and tehsildars have been asked to report casualties within 24 hours.        
	To stay prepared for any eventuality, the department will soon be launching a massive awareness drive through print and electronic media to ask people to take precautions.        
	In 1998, 2,042 persons died of sunstroke in the state.         
	At least 91 were killed in 1999 while 29 died of sunstroke in 2000. There were 25 casualties in 2001; 41 in 2002; 68 in 2003; 45 in 2004; 236 in 2005; 21 in 2006; 47 in 2007; and 28 in 2008. At least 81 died in 2009.         
	The department has therefore decided to opt for prevention of sunstrokes and educate residents about the dos and donts of stepping out in the heat.

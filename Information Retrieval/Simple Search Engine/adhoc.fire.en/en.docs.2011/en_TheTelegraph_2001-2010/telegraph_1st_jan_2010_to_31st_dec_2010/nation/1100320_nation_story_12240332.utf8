	 Bangalore, March 19: The Karnataka Legislative Assembly today passed a revised cattle protection law that prohibits the sale and possession of beef in the BJP-ruled southern state and enhances the punishment for slaughter of cows to seven years.           
	The Opposition parties, the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular), called the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2010, draconian and accused the government of pursuing a hidden agenda of harassing certain section of society. The present bill is anti-secular and anti-constitutional, said Siddaramaiah, the Congress leader of Opposition.           
	However, chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa said the legislation was not intended to hurt any community. Since there is clearly support for this (protection of cattle) in the Constitution, this is not something new we are doing.                   
	 New Delhi: The Supreme Court has asked the Madhya Pradesh government to explain a directive asking all Christian-run educational institutions for property details.           
	The Catholic Bishops Council has challenged the move, saying the government can request, not force us, to give the information.                  
	 New Delhi: The Supreme Court has turned down a plea by a dyslexic student who wanted to use a calculator in his Class XII mathematics exam. We cannot give this benefit to only one student, a bench said. Under the rules, calculators are allowed till Class X.                   
	 Aurangabad (PTI): A man allegedly sold his wife for Rs 40,000 after taking her to Mumbai on the pretext of providing her a job. Her parents rescued her and lodged a complaint against the man who is absconding.                  
	 Panaji (PTI): British teenager Scarlett Eden Keelings murder trial in Goa will begin from April 5, a local court said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dont club new and old cases: CJI
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Dont club new and old cases: CJI
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 31: The countrys top judge today said new cases couldnt be clubbed with old ones and called for fresh parameters to define backlog as he sought to dispel the impression of a system plagued by delays.        
	Chief Justice S.H. Kapadias comments came at a seminar on judicial reforms and prompted President Pratibha Patil, who was present, to concede that the government needed to review the existing figure of three-crore-plus arrears.        
	How can a case that has just been filed be referred to as arrears? Justice Kapadia said, questioning the logic behind the practice of clubbing new cases with old ones.        
	Filing today is not arrears, he said. How do you calculate it as arrears? At best, he added, these cases can be referred to as pending cases.        
	Kapadia, who recently took over as Chief Justice of India, said 40 per cent of cases pending in courts were less than a year old. The parameters for pendency and arrears must be looked into, he said. No one has gone into the statistical data. We need to dissect the data.        
	The judge said he didnt think enough weightage was being given to the efforts of judges in disposing of cases and insisted the arrears would, at the most, be over one crore.         
	The existing figure of three crore clubs all cases pending before all courts  trial courts, high courts and the Supreme Court.         
	Kapadia, who recently unveiled plans to send email notices to parties in a case, took pains to dispel the impression that the justice delivery system was plagued by delays. He said 30 per cent of cases filed under the penal code were disposed of within a year, and 66 per cent in three years.        
	The President, who inaugurated the seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Bar, responded to Kapadias comments in her speech shortly after.        
	Now, as the Chief Justice of India has talked about the difference between arrears and pendency in cases, I think we will have to review these figures, Patil, a lawyer herself, said.        
	Kapadia criticised the government for not consulting high court and sessions court judges while appointing public prosecutors to handle criminal cases in trial courts. Why has this been done away with? he asked.        
	He said he would appoint a team of statistical experts to deal with the arrears and hinted at a three-track system. One for complex cases, another for subverted cases where a party is trying to delay the process, and the third for cases where serving notices to all parties concerned takes time.         
	The CJI also called for amending rules so that modern technology could be used to dispose of cases fast.         
	The judge called for bar reforms, too, and rued the lack of a settlement culture, except in family cases.         
	Patil said delays plaguing the system do not allow ordinary people to lead normal lives and called for reforms in back-office support systems to speed up justice.        
	She also appealed to governments to exercise restraint in approaching courts. Government agencies being one of the biggest litigants must exercise restraint from routinely instituting litigation and clogging the system, she said.

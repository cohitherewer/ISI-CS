          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: Interpol today issued red-corner notices against five Pakistanis linked by India to the 26/11 attacks, including two alleged army officers, and incorporating in them a dossier New Delhi had handed Islamabad.        
	On top of the list is Ilyas Kashmiri, a Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (Huji) commander and said to be a leader of the now-infamous 313 Brigade, believed to be an arm of al Qaida.        
	The others include Syed Abdur Rehman Hashim, 39, Major Iqbal, 45, Major Sameer Ali, 44, and Sajid Majid, 32, who is said to be an English-speaker.        
	Iqbal and Ali are alleged to be part of Pakistans military intelligence wing, the ISI. Both had figured in a dossier relating to the 26/11 attacks that was handed over by home minister P. Chidambaram to Islamabad.        
	From now on, the five suspects movements will be limited since the chances of them being arrested by Interpol are high if they move out of Pakistan, Indian security officials said.        
	Interpol has 188 nations as members and although the importance attached to the red-corner notices varies from country to country, the national police forces are expected to act.        
	Some of the five came under suspicion after the arrest and interrogation of Pakistani American terrorist David Coleman Headley, sources said. Four of them belong to Lahore, while Ilyas was born in Kotli in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.        
	Red-corner notices are published by the general secretariat of Interpol at the request of a member countrys national central bureau (NCB), in this case by the CBI which is Indias NCB for Interpol. The warrants against these five suspects were issued by a Delhi judge.        
	The notices come within days of CIA chief Leon Panettas visit to India and Pakistan. The Americans have warned that the Lashkar-e-Toiba may be planning attacks during the Commonwealth Games to gain media attention.        
	Ilyas was indicted in absentia in January last year by a federal grand jury in the US for a failed terrorist plot against a Danish newspaper. Officials said Ilyas had left his footprints in many places in India, and was also wanted for terror attacks in Pakistan.         
	Although India has been circumspect about linking Lashkar or Huji to Osama bin Laden, US intelligence reports now describe Pakistans Haqqani network, Huji and Lashkar as al Qaida allies.        
	The Americans are getting increasingly wary about the threat to South Asia from Lashkar.        
	Pakistan-based Sunni extremist group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LT) poses a threat to a range of interests in South Asia. Its attacks in Kashmir and India have had a destabilising effect on the region, increasing tensions and brinkmanship between New Delhi and Islamabad, a recent intelligence report by a US counter-terrorism agency said.

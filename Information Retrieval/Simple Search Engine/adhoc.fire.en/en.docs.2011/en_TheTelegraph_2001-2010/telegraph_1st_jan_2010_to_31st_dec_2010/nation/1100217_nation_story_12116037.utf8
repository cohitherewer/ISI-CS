  - Sleuth hints at far more sinister plot        SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Osho followers embrace at a meditation service in Ahmedabad on Tuesday to mourn the Pune blast victims (AFP)                                        
	Pune, Feb. 16: Investigators hunting for leads on Saturdays blast are veering around to the view that German Bakery was not the original target of the terrorists who may planned something far more sinister.        
	A top investigator told The Telegraph the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) had stumbled upon leads that indicate the caf was targeted in a last-ditch attempt.        
	We are probing whether the original target was to bomb the Jewish Chabad House or the Osho ashram close to the bakery, he said.        
	Local residents said security at both places had been significantly increased a few days before the explosion, which claimed its 10th victim today. Abhishek Kumar Saxena, a 24-year-old from Lucknow, succumbed to injuries this morning in Punes Jehangir Hospital.        
	If they had surveyed the bakery closely before the attack, they would have known that by 7pm the crowd at the caf starts thinning as most foreigners from the Osho ashram leave for evening prayers. Saturdays bomb went off at 6.52pm. Some clues have led us to believe that it was a last-minute hurried attempt, the investigator said.        
	The revelation coincided with the first claim of responsibility for the blast. A man who claimed his name was Abu Jindal called up the Islamabad office of The Hindu newspaper, claiming that his outfit carried out the strike.        
	He said he represented the so far unknown group Lashkar-e-Toiba Al Alami. Al Alami, which means international, is a sobriquet also used by a breakaway group of the Hizb-ul Mujahideen  HuJ al Alami.        
	Jindal claimed his group had carried out the attack for two reasons: Indias refusal to discuss Kashmir in the forthcoming talks with Pakistan and its alliance with America.        
	The number that showed up on the caller identity carried an area code common to the Waziristan tribal area and Bannu, an adjoining district in the North-West Frontier Province.        
	Phone intercepts        
	Police sources said clues had emerged from intercepts between suspected terrorists before and after the blast.        
	We have been following Indian Mujahideen chatter since their name cropped up after the Delhi, Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Jaipur blasts. The chatter had suddenly died two weeks before the blast, but we have some crucial intercepts of phone communications from other parts of the country right after the explosion, the source said.        
	Four detained        
	Pune police commissioner Satyapal Singh confirmed that four people had been detained so far. Sources said the suspects were picked up following clues from CCTV footage obtained from in and around German Bakery. The daughter of the bakery owner claimed the caf had its own CCTV footage.        
	At least one among those detained was spotted on the CCTV footage of Hotel which faces German Bakery, a source said. Police said the footage had revealed the involvement of five to six suspects, two of them women.        
	Salman, Shah Rukh         
	Of the four in custody, Salman, an alias for one Subhan Qureishi, is a new Indian Mujahideen recruit. The police are on the lookout for a man called Shah Rukh, who is said to have supplied the explosives.        
	Investigators believe Shah Rukh may be an alias for Iqbal Bhatkal, the brother of Indian Mujahideen chief Riyaz Bhatkal.        
	Salman was picked up from Janwadi area of Pune and is close to Maulana Shabbir Gangawali, an operative from the area accused in the Bangalore blast. Gangawali is a close aide of Riyaz Bhatkal, the police source said.        
	Forensic report        
	Commissioner Singh said forensic reports so far indicated a combination of RDX, ammonium nitrate and hydrocarbon oils. I do not have any report about whether the device had a timer or was remote-controlled.         
	Cyber trail        
	The police are following the cyber trail of an email warning about terror strikes on the IPL, Commonwealth Games and the hockey World Cup. The email was sent on Monday morning to Hong Kong-based South Asian news portal Asia times Online  purportedly by the 313 brigade  an operational arm of al Qaida.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Halted Lavasa hits back at Jairam 
          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 29: Lavasa Corporation today claimed the environment ministry notice against its hill city project near Pune did not follow any principles of natural justice and had been issued with the oblique motive of causing financial loss to the company.        
	Last week, the ministry had showcaused Lavasa, a unit of Hindustan Construction Company, for alleged violation of environmental laws by the 25,000-hectares project.        
	The ministry had halted work, saying construction had been carried out till 1,000 metres above sea level against the permitted range of 640-900 metres. It had asked Lavasa why unauthorised structures erected without any environment clearance should not immediately be demolished.        
	Replying for Lavasa, Agarwal Law Associates today sent a 35-page letter to environment minister Jairam Ramesh saying the showcause notice was vitiated by malafide intentions, arbitrariness and breach of the principles of natural justice.        
	It claimed that critical facts relating to the project had been suppressed and accused the ministry of acting under pressure from political activists. The showcause notice was issued in haste. It is ex parte (one-sided) without following any principles of natural justice.        
	The company, which was set to hit the capital markets with an initial public offering (IPO), said the notice had come after it had been given clearance for the IPO on November 16.        
	The speed and manner in which the showcause notice has been issued and served upon our clients shows that there is an ulterior motive behind this entire exercise only to frustrate our clients bonafide efforts to bring the IPO in the market.        
	Before taking the drastic action, no verification was done in respect of the allegations of political activists though these allegations were on the table of the minister for seven months.        
	Nor was the company given a chance to rebut the charges before the ministry took the step to halt construction, the letter alleged.        
	Lavasa said it had started developing the project after receiving clearance from the state government in March 2004. Over the past six years, it had invested Rs 3,000 crore in the project, including Rs 2,000 crore in loans from public sector banks and financial institutions.        
	Thousands of employees will be forced to exit and their livelihood would be affected. Students studying would lose valuable years, it said.        
	Reacting to Lavasas reply, Ramesh said in a statement: There are some loopholes in Lavasa Corporations reply. The ministry is studying it further and a response will be given within the stipulated time.        
	Last week, he had said that when Lavasa replied to the notice, the ministry would proceed according to the law. No decision will be taken arbitrarily. Lavasa will be given a chance to put forth their point.

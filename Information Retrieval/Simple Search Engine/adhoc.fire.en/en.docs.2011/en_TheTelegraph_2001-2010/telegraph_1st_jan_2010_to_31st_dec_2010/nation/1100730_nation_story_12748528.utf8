The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | For Jaya, a hand from dark MGR
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      For Jaya, a hand from dark MGR
          G.C. SHEKHAR                                              Jayalalithaa , Vijayakanth      
	Chennai, July 29: Actor Vijayakanths party, the DMDK, has hinted that it wants to fight next years Assembly elections with Jayalalithaa, a move that will bring the main anti-DMK forces together in Tamil Nadu.         
	The rank and file of the ADMK and DMDK want the two parties to fight the elections jointly and their sentiments will be kept in mind, Panruti S. Ramachandran, the DMDK chairman, told a local English channel today.         
	Ramachandran added that it was also the wish of the two Communist parties, the CPI and CPM, that the ADMK and DMDK should forge an alliance. The Left parties are ADMK allies.        
	Although the DMDK has been chipping away the anti-DMK votes since the 2006 Assembly elections, Ramachandran accepted that the ADMK was the true inheritor of M.G. Ramachandrans legacy. True, people call Vijayakanth the dark MGR but MGRs political legacy is still largely with the ADMK, he said.         
	The ADMK greeted the news of a possible alliance as a positive development. Although Amma has to take the final decision, the fact that the DMDK is ready to join hands with us is a positive development and will send shivers down Karunanidhis spine, an ADMK MP said.         
	Jayalalithaa had told a massive rally in Coimbatore on July 13: You do not worry about the alliance. I will take care of it. You will get the alliance that you wish.        
	Observers had said she had either the Congress or the DMDK or both in mind. But the chances of her striking a workable alliance with Vijayakanths party were more realistic because the Congress is firmly allied with the DMK whose 18 MPs are crucial for the UPA governments survival in the Lok Sabha.         
	The DMDK polled around 11 per cent votes in the 2006 Assembly elections but since then its vote share has fluctuated between 7 and 10 per cent. One advantage the party has is its widespread support base across the state which could prove crucial in a close contest.

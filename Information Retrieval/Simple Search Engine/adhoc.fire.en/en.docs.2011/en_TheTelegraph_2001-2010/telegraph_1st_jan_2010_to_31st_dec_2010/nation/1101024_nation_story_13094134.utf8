The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chargesheet timing leaves BJP stunned
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Chargesheet timing leaves BJP stunned
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN      
	New Delhi, Oct. 23: The mention of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Indresh Kumar in the Ajmer blast chargesheet could not have come at a worse time for the Sangh and the BJP, sources in both organisations admitted.        
	The BJP fears that the Congress and the Lalu Prasad-Ram Vilas Paswan combine will use Indreshs name in the Bihar poll campaign to play on Muslims fears about the Sangh.        
	A party MP from the state suggested the chargesheet had been strategically timed just when the BJP had succeeded in keeping Narendra Modi and Varun Gandhi away from Bihar to please ally Janata Dal (United).        
	We managed to keep Modi and Varun out. We did not utter the name of Ayodhya. We avoided a joint campaign by Nitish and L.K. Advani. Now we have to think of a response to this one, the MP said.        
	The compulsion to keep the Bihar alliance intact saw the BJP scurrying to distance itself from Indresh without disowning him.        
	The BJP will react only if there is credible evidence. It is more appropriate for the RSS to react. Indreshji will defend his case as a citizen of the country in the court. The substantial and credible evidence can only be presented in court, BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said.        
	Sources said there was no love lost between the BJP and Indresh. Party officials who were in charge of the 2002 Jammu and Kashmir elections recalled that as the local Sangh leader, Indresh had floated a rival party, the Jammu Mukti Morcha.        
	The Morcha flagged the states trifurcation as its plank and put up candidates in every Jammu seat against the BJP, costing the latter heavily. Although the Morcha has wound up, the BJP has failed to recover the lost ground in its former bastion.        
	For the Sangh, the supreme irony is that Indresh heads its Rashtriya Muslim Morcha, a front floated a couple of years ago to talk to Muslim organisations. Its aim was to reduce minority opposition to the Sanghs demands for a cow slaughter ban, abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir, and a common civil code.        
	Last week, Indresh joined a dialogue with the Muslim personal law board to seek an out-of-court settlement to the Ayodhya dispute. So when some Sangh officials scanned the chargesheet and spotted Indreshs name, they immediately knew he might not be able to continue with his minority outreach.        
	Sangh sources claimed that thanks to his long stint in Jammu and Kashmir and his extrovert nature, Indresh had succeeded in breaching Muslims mental block against the Sangh more successfully than anyone else.        
	In a statement issued tonight, Indresh said: I am ready to face the law. God is my witness.        
	Sangh sources said that although Indresh had not categorically denied his presence at the meeting that planned the bombing, all he may have done was deliver an ideological speech. They refused to comment whether it might have amounted to incitement.        
	Cong targets Sangh        
	The Congress argued the chargesheet was clear evidence of the Sangh parivars role in disturbing communal harmony.        
	The RSS has been consistently working to undermine and upset the pluralistic ethos of India and disturb communal amity.... The latest chargesheet is just a manifestation of its direction right from the beginning, spokesperson Manish Tiwari said.        
	Rahul Gandhi too had recently compared the Sangh to the Students Islamic Movement of India saying both believed in communal ideologies.        
	Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said: The truth has come out and the RSS should accept it. Later, the background of its leaders whose names have appeared and their links will come out. One should trust the judiciary that the truth will come out and those guilty will be punished.

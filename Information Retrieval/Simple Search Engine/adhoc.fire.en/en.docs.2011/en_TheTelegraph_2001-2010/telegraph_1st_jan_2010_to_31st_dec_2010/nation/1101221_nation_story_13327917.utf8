The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP scoffs at Caesars wife 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP scoffs at Caesars wife 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Arun Jaitley    
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: The BJP today dismissed the Prime Ministers offer to appear before the public accounts committee (PAC) that is looking into the spectrum scandal, and stuck to its demand for a joint parliamentary committee.         
	Well, Caesars wife did not choose her form of inquiry, Arun Jaitley said, reacting to Manmohan Singhs remark today that he had nothing to hide and was ready to appear before the PAC as Caesars wife should always be above suspicion.        
	If he (the Prime Minister) has nothing to hide, then whether he goes and speaks the truth before a PAC or a JPC should not matter, the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha said.        
	The point is, the PACs jurisdiction is limited to only scrutinising the CAGs (Comptroller and Auditor Generals) report. The issues are much larger. They relate to why a particular party (the DMK) was selected for the telecom portfolio (in the Union cabinet), why a particular person (A. Raja) from a particular party was selected for it and the formulation of the telecom policy.        
	Jaitley then alluded to the leaked conversations of Niira Radia, saying the CAG was not empowered to inquire into who played a role in ministry-making, corporates, lobbyists or the PM.        
	In 2004, you (the Prime Minister) inducted tainted ministers on the principle that they were presumed to be innocent till proved guilty. You did nothing to stop (then telecom minister) Raja for three years despite everyone alleging that he was guilty. And now you say that Caesars wife must be above suspicion, he said.        
	The BJP also held the Prime Minister liable for the subversion of the CBI and the controversial appointment of the new central vigilance commissioner who faces a corruption case.        
	The attack comes a day after Sonia Gandhi praised the Prime Ministers integrity at the Congress plenary and said the BJPs personal attack on him was despicable.        
	Jaitley claimed that although the Congress plenary was ostensibly about celebrating the partys 125th anniversary, it had been overcome by a sense of BJP phobia.

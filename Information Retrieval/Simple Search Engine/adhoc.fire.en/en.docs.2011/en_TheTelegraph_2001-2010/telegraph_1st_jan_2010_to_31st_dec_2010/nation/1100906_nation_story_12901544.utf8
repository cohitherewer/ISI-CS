          SUBHASHISH MOHANTY                               
	Lanjigarh, Sept. 5: Budu Majhis meagre income of Rs 1,500 would have more than doubled last month but the tractor driver at the Vedanta Alumina site was told after 15 days that he was not wanted any more.        
	Where do I go now? I have a wife, two children and parents to support? the 26-year-old asked.         
	Budu, who would have taken home Rs 4,000 at the end of August, was not the only one to be told by his contractor to quit. In all, 7,183 people employed by 28 contractors, among them Larsen and Toubro, have become jobless after the Union environment and forests ministry refused to give clearance to Vedantas bauxite mining project in Orissas Niyamgiri hills.        
	Vedanta, which had farmed out construction jobs to the contractors, was expanding its 1-million-tonne alumina refinery at Lanjigarh in Kalahandi district to 6 million tonnes when the ministry move struck the blow.        
	Of the 7,183 contract workers, 3,681 are from Orissa, the rest have come from Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar. Since the company has decided to scale down its operations, not more than 1,800 people would be needed, a source close to the contractors said.         
	A senior official of Vedanta admitted that paying the workers would become difficult for the contractors who are suddenly without work now. When there is no work, how can they pay the labourers? They have begun the process of retrenchment, the official said.         
	Some of the sacked labourers had turned violent on August 31. The men engaged by L amp;T went to the companys local office and smashed windowpanes and computers.        
	Kalahandi district labour officer Duryodhan Sethi said: Dues of all the retrenched workers will be settled by September 10. The process has already begun. We will go to the labour colonies and hand over their salaries as well as a compensation amount. He added that their provident fund amount would be disbursed later. The dues would be paid in the presence of Vedanta officials and government representatives.         
	The pro-Vedanta Lanjigarh Anchalik Vikash Parishad president, Sridhar Pesnia, said an exodus had begun from Lanjigarh. If the company does not function normally, the entire area will be deserted soon, he said.

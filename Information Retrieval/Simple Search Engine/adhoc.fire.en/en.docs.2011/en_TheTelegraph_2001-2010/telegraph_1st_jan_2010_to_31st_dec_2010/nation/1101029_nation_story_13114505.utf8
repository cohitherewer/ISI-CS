	Mumbai, Oct. 28: Ashok Chavan seems peeved the Americans havent kept him in the loop on Barack Obamas Mumbai plans.         
	The US Secret Service, it appears, isnt giving away secrets, not even to the Maharashtra chief minister.        
	It is a private visit to Mumbai by Barack Obama. I have not received any official communication on the exact date and time of his arrival in the city, Chavan said at the Tirupati shrine today.        
	The chief minister cant be blamed. So closely guarded are the details that it led to some confusion initially on the exact dates of Obamas visit, with many under the impression it will begin on November 5. Now, top government sources have confirmed that the trip officially begins on November 6.        
	The sources said the security arrangements were being put in place in consultation with US officials.        
	But the drill could leave some Mumbaikars fretting: hotspots Mumbai Harbour, the Gateway of India and Radio Club will be out of bounds on November 6 and 7 while the Obamas stay at the Taj Palace, on the citys most popular waterfront.         
	No fishing boats or private yachts either. Trips to Elephanta, the world heritage site off the Gateway coast, will be stopped those two days. Large ships at the nearby Mumbai Port Trust are being counted and scanned.        
	The skies could change, too. Two US Air Force aircraft have landed with tonnes of security equipment and dozens of officials. A dozen more such planes are expected over the next eight days. Sources at Mumbai airport confirmed the Presidents advance security team has already flown in.        
	Lined up for arrival next week are six armoured cars, including the presidential carriage Cadillac One, and Beast, Obamas personal James Bond-style limousine.

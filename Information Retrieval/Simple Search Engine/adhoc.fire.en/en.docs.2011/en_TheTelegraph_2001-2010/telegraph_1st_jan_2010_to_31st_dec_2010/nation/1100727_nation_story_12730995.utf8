	Kokrajhar/Guwahati, July 26: Four Sashastra Seema Bal personnel were killed when suspected militants of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) anti-talks faction ambushed them in lower Assams Chirang district today.        
	According to police, a group of 25 NDFB militants was in the area near Manas National Park, around 230km from Guwahati, when the border guards went there on a routine patrol in a Maruti Gypsy around 12.30pm.        
	Seven security personnel were in the car that was moving towards Sikrajhar, near the India-Bhutan border, when they were fired at.        
	Bhanu Upadhyay, the deputy inspector-general of the SSBs Bongaigaon sector said over phone that the personnel tried to retaliate and fired many rounds but were overwhelmed by a barrage of gunfire from the other side. Sources in the SSB said the force was trained for border patrol, not counter-insurgency operations, and its personnel were sitting ducks for the militants.         
	The slain personnel have been identified as assistant commandant Kishore Kunal, sub-inspector Pratap Singh, constable Amit Kumar and driver Gelchu Sherpa. Kunal, 26, from Bihar, had joined the force last year.         
	Three others who were injured were identified as Giriraj Singh Bir, Balwant Singh Yadav and Amit Kumar.        
	They have been admitted to a nursing home in Bongaigaon, about 65km from the encounter site. Two of them are in a critical condition.

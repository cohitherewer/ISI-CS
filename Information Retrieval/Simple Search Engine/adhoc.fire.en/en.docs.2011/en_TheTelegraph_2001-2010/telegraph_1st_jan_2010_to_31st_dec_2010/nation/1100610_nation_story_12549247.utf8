The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress sniffs Pawar effect on Jagan   Distrust deepens amid rumours 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Congress sniffs Pawar effect on Jagan     Distrust deepens amid rumours 
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Sharad Pawar                                        
	New Delhi, June 9: The Congress and Sharad Pawar have often been uneasy allies, and the distrust seems to have deepened.        
	Many in the Congress have gained an impression that Pawar tried to fuel Jaganmohan Reddys discontent and perhaps tried to lure him into joining the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).        
	Congress sources say Pawar has been in regular touch with Jagan, whose later father, former Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajashekhar Reddy, was believed to be close to the Maharashtra leader.        
	The Congress had succeeded in containing the revolt-like situation in Andhra following YSRs death when the majority of MLAs wanted Jagan to be made chief minister. But the fresh eruption of Jagans dissent has surprised the party.        
	Many are convinced that the impatient young scion is prepared to look beyond the confines of his fathers party. We know Jagan has been exploring possibilities and has been in touch with Pawar, a Congress leader said.        
	Pawar has played this game in the past too. He gave a platform to Congress rebels like K. Karunakaran in Kerala and V.C. Shukla in Chhattisgarh. But Jagan has not yet left the party and instigating him to defect would hurt the Congress immensely.        
	Leaders from Andhra, however, feel Jagan needs no instigation and has himself shown a tendency to treat party discipline with disdain. They said Jagans decision to go ahead with his yatra was in complete defiance of the high commands directives, and even now his demand for permission by July 8 smacked of blackmail.        
	Jagan had started his yatra in Telangana on May 28, bringing violence to the troubled region. The rallies were ostensibly meant to console the families of those who had committed suicide or died of shock after YSRs death, but were seen as an attempt to bully the party into handing him the chief ministers post.        
	Later, after a visit to Delhi, Jagan had claimed that the party leadership had green-lighted the yatra, only to be confronted with a denial. Jagan has suspended the programme but says he expects permission by July 8 to resume it.                        Jaganmohan Reddy and Mamata Banerjee      
	A large section in the Congress believes Jagan will not make the mistake of leaving the party since he does not have too many MLAs with him as of now, but there are a few who are not so sure.        
	Many Congress leaders, who said they were not aware of Pawars alleged designs on Jagan, too agreed that the NCP leader was capable of such machinations. This has been Pawarsahebs politics. The irony is that he survives politically despite doing all this, a senior leader said.        
	Some in the Congress also believe that Pawar is trying to build a separate bloc within UPA II on the lines of the pressure group formed by him, Lalu Prasad and M. Karunanidhi in UPA I. They claim that Pawar tried to cosy up to Mamata Banerjee whenever she locked horns with the Congress.        
	He would definitely like to have an understanding with Mamata, Mulayam, Lalu Prasad and other like-minded parties to set up a pressure group, a Union minister said.        
	But we doubt he will attempt any major political misadventure to destabilise the ruling combine. We know Pawar is not comfortable with the unchallenged Congress might in UPA II.        
	A section in the Congress believes that Pawar will attempt to launch a third front after the Assembly polls in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Bengal to try and confront the Congress before the 2014 general election.        
	They argue the party should think of a counter-strategy and even try to break the NCP. But the party leadership is moving cautiously, its first priority being to protect its Andhra bastion.        
	NCP leaders counter that the Congress has constantly been trying to corner Pawar. The Congress laid the entire blame for the price rise at the agriculture ministers door, and has made no attempt to defend him in the row over his alleged links with an IPL bid.        
	NCP sources suspect a Congress hand in the investment details of City Corp, where the Pawar family holds stakes, making their way to the media.

	Dec. 17: The abduction of Kakdwip teenager Yasmin Khatun, who was rescued from Delhi yesterday, was allegedly plotted by the family of her sister-in-law and Kalam, a suspected trafficker arrested in Calcutta in November.        
	Bengal police today said Kalam had confessed that Kashmira Bibi, elder sister of Yasmins sister-in-law Jasmina, had contacted him and offered to help him kidnap and sell Yasmin (name changed).        
	Officers said Kalam had admitted to selling the girl to another trafficker in Delhi, Azhar, for Rs 5,000 last year. He had helped the police arrest Azhar and rescue Yasmin yesterday.        
	This is the police version of the alleged confession by Kalam, a 32-year-old resident of Calcuttas Elliot Road:        
	Kashmira had links with traffickers and Kalam had known her for several years. About a month before Yasmin was abducted on April 15 last year, Kashmira had contacted Kalam and told him about a 15-year-old girl in Kakdwip.        
	She said Yasmins family was poor, her mother was mentally unstable, and there was no one in the family who would be in a position to pursue the case if she were kidnapped. She added that her (Kashmiras) father Kaush Mir and her mother would help in the abduction.        
	Shortly after Yasmin was kidnapped near her home in Balikhali, South 24-Parganas, her stepmother had filed a police complaint accusing Kaush Mir, Kashmira and her mother of the crime. She said villagers had told her they had seen the trio push Yasmin into a car and drive off.        
	The local police arrested the three accused but they received bail soon after. According to the police, Kashmira had told them Yasmin was tired of village life and wanted to leave home, and she had merely tried to help her by getting her a comfortable job.        
	Kashmira seized the opportunity to have the girl kidnapped and sold outside the state, said Nishat Pervez, special superintendent of police, CID. Officers said the traffickers paid Kashmiras family an undisclosed sum.        
	Kalam himself spoke to The Telegraph this afternoon at Delhis Banga Bhavan, where he is in Bengal police custody.        
	A relative of Yasmin got in touch with me and promised to hand her over. I was to find a job for the girl and I agreed after seeing her, he said. She was so young; her prospects of getting a job in Delhi were certain.        
	Officers explained that in traffickers parlance, getting a girl a job meant selling her. However, Kalam denied selling Yasmin. The girls relatives were behind the kidnapping. I was only a facilitator, he claimed.        
	But Bengal police said Kalam had admitted to them he had sold Yasmin to Azhar for Rs 5,000. He told us he had sold many other girls too, Pervez said.        
	To this newspaper, Kalam said he had known Azhar for 10 years and that a day after getting hold of Yasmin, he had boarded the Kalka Mail to Delhi along with her.        
	I spoke to Azhar and he promised to pay me, Kalam said. Yasmin was at first unwilling to go with Kalam but I promised her a job in Delhi and said she would have a comfortable life.        
	Kalam said that in Delhi, he handed Yasmin over to Azhar who was waiting with a bag of clothes for her. Azhar paid me Rs 5,000 as travel expenses and promised to pay more after a month.        
	He again denied having sold Yasmin to Azhar. I did not sell her. I did her a favour by bringing her comforts, he insisted.

          SUBRAT DAS                               
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 22: Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik will complain to the Prime Minister about an irrigation-cum-power project in Andhra Pradesh that could submerge 11 villages in the eastern state.        
	The controversy comes at a time the Union environment ministry has red-flagged two big projects in Orissa  one by Posco and another by Vedanta  by citing violation of forest rules.        
	Naveen, who left for Delhi today, is expected to tell Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that Andhra Pradeshs Rs 10,150-crore project on river Godavari will affect 11 villages in Orissas Malkangiri district.        
	Besides, Naveen is expected to complain that Andhras unilateral execution of the project violated the Scheduled Tribes and Other Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, commonly referred to as FRA.        
	The FRA had been cited by committees set up by the Union environment ministry to stall the Orissa projects. The ruling Biju Janata Dal will accuse the Union ministry of ignoring FRA violations by the Polavaram project while raising a hue and cry in the cases of Posco and Niyamgiri.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi cold to Munda bid
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                           A file picture of Arjun Munda in Jamshedpur                                  
	Ranchi, Sept. 6: Jharkhand BJP appears confident that ongoing efforts at forming a government with JMM help will prove fruitful soon with a section claiming that the party was likely to stake claim in a day or two.        
	The BJP central leadership, however, has clearly stayed away from the move, understood to have been launched at the behest of the partys Jamshedpur MP Arjun Munda.        
	Jharkhand BJP in-charge Harendra Pratap claimed the partys central leadership had, however, authorised Munda to go ahead if he thought that the JMM could prove to be a reliable partner.         
	Maintaining that there were no differences within the party on the question of government formation, Pratap told The Telegraph that Munda would apprise the leadership after exploring possibilities of forming a government in association with the JMM, JD(U) and Ajsu.         
	However, BJP state president Raghuvar Das and senior party leader Yashwant Sinha were still said to be opposed to forming a government.        
	Mahto said that everything depended on the BJP. JMM chief Shibu Soren held a meeting of the party legislators on Saturday and decided to keep his options open.        
	But JMM legislator Mathura Mahto claimed today that a government would be in place in Jharkhand in the next three days.        
	Munda refused to come out with time-frame.But he did not deny efforts at government formation. We are making a final attempt to form a government, he said.        
	In New Delhi, however, leaders steered clear of his efforts, saying it was only an initiative by the state party. We have asked the state party to get its own house in order first, before taking a decision on government formation, said a source close to party president Nitin Gadkari.        
	Munda, however, appeared confident. He ruled out the possibility of the governor dissolving the Assembly to pre-empt the BJPs move, particularly after the Election Commission declared the poll schedule for Bihar today.        
	Claiming that the JMM and Ajsu were on the same page, Munda said no MLA wanted fresh elections. Fresh elections will mean imposition of the model code of conduct which, in turn, will stall all development programmes at a time when the state has been declared drought-hit.        
	Both BJP and JMM have 18 MLAs each in the Assembly.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 4: The crime branch has taken over investigations of an alleged rape by a police inspector in Bhadrak district.        
	The probe was ordered following protests from local people after the case surfaced. The woman went to Narayan Nayak, the inspector in charge of Dhusuri police station, yesterday in connection with a divorce case.         
	Nayak, who was not at the police station then, had asked the woman to reach his official residence adjacent to the police station to settle the dues.         
	The woman thought that the officer was asking for money as bribe and did not wish to take it inside the office, said State Commission for Women chairperson Jyoti Panigrahi after talking to the victim today.        
	There was no one at the inspectors residence and as soon as she entered, Nayak asked her for sexual favours instead of money. The accused also reportedly increased the volume of the TV so that her call for help could not be heard outside, alleged the victim in her FIR handed over to superintendent of police J.N. Pankaj. Nayak also offered money to the victim to suppress the matter.         
	Nayak has been arrested and in judicial custody now. His bail was rejected, said sub-divisional police officer Suresh Das.        
	Hundreds of villagers gheraoed the police station demanding a high-level probe into the incident and stringent action against the guilty officer. A case of rape under Section 376 of the IPC has been registered, Pankaj said.

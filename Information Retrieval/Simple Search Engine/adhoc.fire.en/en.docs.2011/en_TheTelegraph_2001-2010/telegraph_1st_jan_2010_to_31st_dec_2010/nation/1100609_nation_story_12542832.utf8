	Bhubaneswar, June 8: An unprecedented chaos prevailed at the Jagannath temple in Puri today following the entry of a British national to the shrine, which is off limits to non-Hindus.        
	The foreigner was identified as Stephen Gillard (26), a police officer said.        
	Hoodwinking a posse of policemen at the entrance gate (Singhadwar), Gillard gained entry into the 12th century shrine around 11am today, but found his luck running out, as he was caught by some alert sevayats (priests) near Baisipahacha (22 steps), about 200m from the sanctum sanctorum.        
	We are verifying his visa and passport. The foreigner claimed he was ignorant of the temple rules that do not allow non-Hindus to enter. Even he said the stricture written on wall at the entrance skipped his attention, Singhadwar police station inspector-in-charge M.K. Senapati said.        
	Gillard was wearing only shorts and T-shirt, he said.        
	Priests trained their guns on the police manning the entrance point. This is gross negligence on the part of the men in uniform. How could the police fail to trace him, who was clearly looking like a foreigner? asked Bimbadhar Khuntia, a priest.        
	Defending his colleagues, Senapati said: Our men failed to identify the foreigner as he looked like an Indian.        
	Nearly 25 police personnel, including some armed guards, man the entrance gate of the temple in three shifts everyday, sources said.        
	Entry of foreigners at Jagannath temple had created flutter many times in the past, bringing police frisking under scanner.         
	On November 19, 2009, two Iskcon devotees from Singapore and Australia managed to enter the temple and were later thrown out of the shrine precinct by some priests. On January 16, 2009, a Chilean national entered the temple in the guise of a sadhu.

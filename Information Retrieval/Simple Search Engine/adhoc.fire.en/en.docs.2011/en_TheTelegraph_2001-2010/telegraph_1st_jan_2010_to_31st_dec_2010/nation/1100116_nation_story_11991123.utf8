	Melbourne, Jan. 15 (PTI): A drunken Australian was put behind bars today hours after he had verbally and physically abused an Indian taxi driver in western Victoria.        
	Paul John Brogden, 48, assaulted the cabbie around 2am (local time) today.         
	His three-month sentence  he pleaded guilty  has come amid a string of attacks on Indians in Australia. The magistrate cited general deterrence as one of the reasons for awarding Brogden the three-month jail term.        
	Brogden abused and assaulted Satheesh Thatipamula, 24, and damaged his vehicle because he thought the cabbie had taken him the wrong way. When you drop me off I will kill you, you mother f**king Indian, I will kill you, you f**king Indian b*****d, he said.         
	After he became abusive, the driver pulled into a service station to take refuge but Brogden followed him and assaulted him, police said.        
	Magistrate Michelle Hodgson said: Regardless of race, violence toward people in vulnerable positions, performing valuable services to the community, valuable jobs like driving taxis or working in 7/11s, violence towards these people will not be tolerated,         
	Brogden had gulped 24 Victoria Bitter stubbies (375ml bottles) on top of Valium tablets he was taking for an injury.

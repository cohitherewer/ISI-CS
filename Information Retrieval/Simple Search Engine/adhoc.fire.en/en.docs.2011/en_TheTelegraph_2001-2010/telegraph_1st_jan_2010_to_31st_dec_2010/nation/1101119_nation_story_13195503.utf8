          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa with two girls at an event on Wednesday in Mangalore where he distributed saris under a welfare scheme. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: The BJP is unlikely to immediately ask the land scandal-singed B.S. Yeddyurappa to resign, though some believe his continuance as Karnataka chief minister has given the Congress a weapon to undermine the partys anti-corruption campaign against the Centre.        
	Weighed against this is the view that Yeddyurappas exit would spell the end of the BJP government in Bangalore  the partys first in south India  and weaken its claim to being the Congresss only alternative in Delhi.        
	Yeddyurappa, Karnataka BJP president K.S. Ishwarappa, and minister Jagdish Shettar (mentioned as a probable replacement if it came to that) have been summoned to Delhi within 48 hours. The chief minister is accused of freeing government land to favour his two sons, daughters-in-law and a son-in-law.        
	When the party core committee met at L.K. Advanis home tonight, differences surfaced over Yeddyurappa. Summing them up, a committee member told The Telegraph: If morality is a criterion, he should go immediately. But the risk is that Yeddyurappa might project his ouster as a conspiracy by the Delhi Brahmins against a Lingayat (the powerful intermediate caste to which he belongs).        
	The leaders at tonights meeting included Nitin Gadkari, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Murli Manohar Joshi, Ananth Kumar, Rajnath Singh and M. Venkaiah Naidu. The first five are Brahmins.        
	Even the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has asked Ishwarappa and Bangalore MP Ananth to hold their horses. The duo are said to be behind the latest rebellion against Yeddyurappa, and are suspected to have leaked the disclosures on his land deals to the media.        
	The meeting also discussed the Parliament deadlock. Lok Sabha leader Pranab Mukherjee is still to get back to the leaders of the Opposition, Sushma and Jaitley, with the governments proposals, but there is a feeling in the BJP that its insistence on a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe on the 2G spectrum scandal could backfire.        
	Officially, the BJP still wants a JPC but its first problem is the sustained disclosures by the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) on the Karnataka land scandal that sources admit are becoming too hot to handle. Some Congress MPs staged a sit-in outside Parliament today to demand Yeddyurappas resignation.        
	Two, theres a fear that if the Centre agrees to a JPC, it would come with a rider to enlarge its ambit to include the Karnataka dealings, a source said.        
	The BJP cannot then argue that Parliament has no jurisdiction over the states, because it has consistently said that the JPC inquiry must extend to the Adarsh housing scandal, which is Maharashtra-centered.        
	While government strategists do not think a JPC would be over-arching, they indicate that it should at least probe the telecom ministrys functioning from 1998, when a BJP-led government came to power and initiated telecom reforms.        
	Three of that governments telecom ministers lost their jobs for one reason or another: Ram Vilas Paswan because his socialist sensibility militated against leaps in liberalisation, Jagmohan for opposing the de-freezing of licences, and Pramod Mahajan for allegedly favouring one corporate group.        
	Theres no way we can prevent the skeletons from the NDAs cupboard tumbling out, a source said.        
	Theres a view in the BJP that if the Centre offers a mechanism other than the JPC  a Congress source has mentioned a commission of inquiry  the party should consider it with an open mind.        
	Also, there are those who recall how the BJPs continued stalling of Parliament, often over trivial matters, had cost the party its precious urban upper and middle-class votes in the 2009 elections.        
	Yeddyurappa has sought to partially douse the land-scandal fires in Bangalore by announcing a judicial probe into the denotification of land over the past 10 years. This period covers the tenure of the Congress-Dal (Secular) coalition government and might help the chief minister buttress his contention that denotifying government land is nothing new.

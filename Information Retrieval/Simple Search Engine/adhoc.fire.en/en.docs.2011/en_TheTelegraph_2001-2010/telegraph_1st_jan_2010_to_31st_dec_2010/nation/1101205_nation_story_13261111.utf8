The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Airlines dig in heels on fares 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Airlines dig in heels on fares 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Praful Patel                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: The standoff over airfares continued today, with aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation rejecting the current structure and the airlines not committing to offer new fares.         
	However, civil aviation minister Praful Patel assured fliers there would be corrective action within a week.         
	The DGCA told private airlines at a meeting that steep airfares have to come down, a day after the ministry warned against predatory pricing or deliberate lowering of fares below cost to undercut other airlines. Patel had earlier said neither exorbitant fares nor predatory fares would be allowed.         
	Top executives of low-cost airlines Spicejet, Indigo and GoAir were called for discussions by director-general of civil aviation E.K. Bharat Bhushan. The whole purpose is to ensure that there is some reasonableness about the fares, Bhushan, who was appointed yesterday, told reporters.         
	Representatives of full service airlines have been called for discussions on Monday, he said. We have told them we want some predictability and fairness in the fares which they charge, which we are trying to enforce, Bhushan said.         
	The DGCA has suggested that the airlines come up with a reasonable fare structure.         
	Airline operators, however, dug in their heels.         
	Vijay Mallya, the promoter of Kingfisher Airlines, said in Bangalore: There has been no unjust increase in airfares An airline seat is a perishable commodity. It is dictated by demand and supply. Dynamic pricing is practised all over the world by every airline without exception. I do not understand why we are making a song and dance of it in India.         
	Why should government regulate anything in an era of deregulation and competition?         
	However, the minister said in Mumbai the government would take action to cool down prices.         
	In case the airlines failed to take remedial action, the DGCA was empowered to take decisions that would benefit air travellers, Patel said. The regulator is not helpless. It should not be presumed that the regulator cannot take action. I am sure they can and they will when the situation warrants, he said.         
	Bhushan said the DGCA was trying to bring some reasonableness in the pricing and wanted the process to be transparent to enable the consumer to make an informed choice.         
	We would like to have these bucket fares and are trying to understand what the problems are, he said.         
	Bucket fares refers to a certain number of seats on each flight being available at low fares well in advance of the travel date. As soon as these seats are filled, the fares grow progressively to a higher bucket closer to the date of travel.         
	According to the airlines proposal, the peak fare that would be charged the day before the travel date would range between Rs 10,500 and Rs 40,000 for four different distance bands: up to 750km; 750-1,000km; 1,000-1,400km and above 1,400km.         
	The ministry earlier this week rejected the proposal, saying there was no justification for an arbitrary fare hike.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 2: Three Pakistani militants about to be deported after serving time in India escaped in Delhi where security forces are supposed to be on their toes in the run-up to Republic Day.        
	The escape triggered a blame game between police and another agency. The police also somersaulted on the name of the hospital to which the three were being taken when they escaped.        
	The trio were arrested in the capital in 2000 on the charge of planning to plant a bomb near Delhi airport. Around 17kg of RDX and 50kg of heroin were found on them.        
	Abdul Razzak, Mohammed Sadiq and Rafaqat Ali completed their prison terms three months ago and were being taken yesterday for a medical check-up, mandatory before deportation, when they escaped.        
	The police initially said they were being taken to the capitals GB Pant Hospital, in front of which the three escaped. But challenged by the hospital which denied any such incident, the police later said the hospital was Guru Nanak Eye Hospital.        
	It is not clear how the men, supposed to be handcuffed, managed to flee from a van being guarded by Meghalaya police on deputation in Delhi. The police have a history of nabbing high-profile terrorists ahead of Republic Day.        
	They were not in the custody of the police. They were under the restraint of the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO), joint commissioner Karnal Singh said.         
	But the FRRO denied it had anything to do with the three Pakistanis, saying the custody of such prisoners was always with the special branch of the Delhi police.        
	The police are now preparing a fresh case against the trio for violating the restraint order issued under the Foreigners Act, in which case they could be in jail for 10 years.        
	Pakistan usually denies such captured militants are its citizens. Many Pakistani prisoners prefer to stay in Tihar jail rather than go home. This is because they know they will be stuck in no-mans-land with Pakistan denying their origins, said a police officer.

	New Delhi, Feb. 25: Former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar, wanted in the 1984 Sikh riots case, is missing, according to the cop who is supposed to provide him protection round the clock.        
	The claim, however, should come as a breather for the CBI, which came under fire from Delhi High Court for being unable to arrest Kumar and produce him in court. A missing persons report filed by the personal security officer (PSO) of Kumar claimed that the Congress leader, who has been staying away from court proceedings despite regular summons, has been missing for the past one week.                    
	The PSO, constable Ram Niroha, approached the security wing of Delhi police on February 19, saying he hadnt been able to locate Kumar. Niroha was suspended for dereliction of duty, two days after a lower court had issued a non-bailable warrant against Kumar.        
	What is surprising is that it is almost impossible for Delhi police not to know where Kumar is because, according to protocol, all VIPs who enjoy Z+ security cover are monitored round the clock by Delhi police and have at least seven to eight men guarding them all the time.        
	The CBI has, however, told the lower court that agency sleuths raided Kumars house at least two-three times but could not arrest him as he couldnt be located.        
	The court said it was a lame excuse and severely reprimanded the agency a couple of days back.        
	Sources said Kumar was very much in town and had been spotted at high-profile parties accompanied by his guards.        
	Kumars lawyer had earlier told the lower court his client was not running away and was just exploring all statutory remedies available to him before approaching a higher court.

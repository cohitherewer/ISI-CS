	Srinagar, Aug. 1: Eight people were killed in curfew-bound Kashmir in the bloodiest day since street protests began in June, five of them when explosives stored in a police post blew up after a mob set it on fire.        
	A 17-year-old girl and three young men were killed in firing by security forces earlier in the day.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security today to discuss the Kashmir situation after the first of the deaths was reported.         
	Thirty-one people have died in clashes with security forces that began seven weeks ago after the death of a teenager in police firing. The unrest, which is showing no sign of abating, threatens to unravel the political process in the state.        
	A mob tried to storm Khrew police station, 20km from Srinagar, during the day. The police opened fire and dispersed the crowd, but not before they had burnt down the mess. Afroza, a 17-year-old, was injured in the firing and died in hospital.        
	When the mob returned in the evening after the girls burial, the policemen gave a stiff resistance but were rescued by the army later, an officer said. The police station was left unmanned.        
	The officer said the mob set the post on fire and then approached the storeroom at the back of the complex, unaware it contained explosives. The room stored explosives meant for stone quarries, which are plenty in the area. Under the rules, explosives meant for the quarries are deposited with the local police station which regulates their supply to stop misuse. It was the same dump that was set on fire, the officer said.        
	The explosion shook the entire neighbourhood and damaged several houses.         
	Five people are dead and 20 to 25 men are injured. These are only the preliminary details. Thousands of people thronged the streets after the blast, making the rescue difficult, the officer said.        
	Protests in Khrew township began today after youths died in firing at Pampore, 13km from Srinagar. Police sources said hundreds took to the streets in Pampore, blocking the Srinagar-Jammu national highway and raising pro-freedom slogans.        
	Pampore, like Khrew, is part of Pulwama district where a curfew was in place. Police and CRPF men fired tear gas shells to disperse the protesters, but they hurled back stones. When the protesters persisted, the forces opened fire, killing Nayeem Ahmad Shah, Muzaffar Ganai and Rayees Ahmad Mir.         
	Nayeem had a bullet wound in his chest and was declared dead in the hospital, said Dr Waseem Qureshi, medical superintendent of Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital, Srinagar.        
	Rayees, a teenager, died on the way to hospital. Muzaffar was admitted with a wound in his abdomen.         
	A police spokesman said mobs set on fire the office-cum-residence of the tehsildar, the roads and buildings office, some other infrastructure and a police vehicle. Miscreants snatched weapons from the local court guard. They also resorted to heavy pelting on the police station and the deployments. Some unidentified militant fired upon the security forces from among them, he said.        
	The killings led to protests in adjoining Khrew and in Srinagar, with thousands defying curfew.        
	Dr Syed Amin Tabish, medical superintendent of the Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), said his hospital received four injured, of whom Afroza later died.        
	The police spokesman said 45 police and CRPF personnel were injured in the violence in Pulwama, mostly in it Pampore town, including the district police chief, a commanding officer of CRPF, one deputy superintendent, one station house officer, 15 CRPF jawans and 22 police personnel.        
	Chief minister Omar Abdullah, facing the worst crisis of his term, made a fervent appeal to civil society, the media, mainstream political leaders and separatists to rise to the occasion and help the government restore peace to the Valley.         
	The prevailing situation in the Valley is worrisome. Some anti-social elements are hell bent to foment trouble, mayhem and bloodshed in the Valley to satiate their political designs. We should not provide any excuse or opportunity to the anti-social elements who want to build their castles on the blood of innocent youth, Omar said.

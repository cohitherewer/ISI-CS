	Mumbai, Aug. 30 (PTI): An Indian Navy officer died of head injuries while saving other sailors who had fallen into the sea from a submarine off the coast of Mumbai this morning.        
	The submarine, Shankush, was on a planned exercise in the sea when it developed a defect which necessitated maintenance crew to come out on the casing to repair it, navy officials said.        
	While coming out for repairs, the maintenance team was washed overboard as the state of the sea was very rough and rescue operations led by Lt Commander Firdaus were launched to recover them, an officer said.

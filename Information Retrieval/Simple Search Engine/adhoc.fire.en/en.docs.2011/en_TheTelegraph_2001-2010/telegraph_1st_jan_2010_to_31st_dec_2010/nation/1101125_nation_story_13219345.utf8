                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Court to ensure honest and fast 2G probe 
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          The Supreme Court                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: The Supreme Court today promised not to allow justice to be derailed and said it would ensure the CBI conducted an honest and speedy probe into allegations of corruption against former telecom minister A. Raja in the 2G spectrum case.        
	The court also said it had difficulty accepting the governments argument that the Prime Ministers sanction was not required to file a complaint against a minister under the Prevention of Corruption Act.        
	Spectrum is allotted in 2007-2008 at 2001 prices. You (government) invent a policy that profits a chosen few. You keep changing the rules mid-way, Justice A.K. Ganguly observed at one point.         
	A two-judge bench of Justice Ganguly and Justice G.S. Singhvi is hearing two petitions on the 2G spectrum issue filed by Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy and the NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL).         
	The CPIL wants either the court to monitor the CBI probe or a Special Investigation Team to inquire into the allegations.         
	CBI counsel K.K. Venugopal offered to submit reports every eight weeks, but Justice Singhvi indicated the court was not keen on that.         
	The investigating agency said it was doing all that was required under the law and would complete the probe latest by March 2011.        
	There is no attempt at a cover-up, solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium insisted.        
	However, the judges seemed to prima facie agree with CPIL counsel Prashant Bhushans submission that the CBI was lax and had just speeded up things a little after the court intervened.        
	We would be supervising the probe. There will be no derailment of justice. We shall see that the CBI probe is done in an honest, expeditious manner, Justice Ganguly said, without clarifying if the court would set up an SIT as it has done in the Gujarat riot cases.        
	Bhushan pointed out that V.J. Thomas, the then telecom secretary, had sought legal opinion to keep the Comptroller and Auditor General out of the case. The opinion was given the day it was sought, he said.        
	Even we cant do that. Must be a very talented officer, the bench said acerbically.        
	Santokh Singh, the joint secretary in the law and justice ministry who gave the opinion that the CAG cannot audit government policy, was today recalled as adviser to the telecom department.        
	On Swamys petition, the attorney-general representing the Prime Minister argued that sanction was not required at the stage of filing a complaint. The court could refer a complaint to the CBI and would look for sanction only at the time of taking cognisance, he said.         
	But when the judges refused to accept his argument, he changed tack. The attorney-general said the information supplied in a complaint should be comprehensive and include all evidence. Dr Swamys letter is a letter, not a complaint. There are no complaints, only letters, he said, implying that the Prime Minister was not bound to take a decision within four months as mandated in the Vineet Narain judgment.        
	The bench then asked if Swamys complaint was a worthless piece of paper. The attorney-general refuted this, saying the government was looking into the letters.        
	Whatever it contained, the PM did not take it lightly. He was obviously concerned, Justice Singhvi observed.        
	The court then gave the attorney-general time to submit data on other cases awaiting sanction before the Centre and reserved its verdict.

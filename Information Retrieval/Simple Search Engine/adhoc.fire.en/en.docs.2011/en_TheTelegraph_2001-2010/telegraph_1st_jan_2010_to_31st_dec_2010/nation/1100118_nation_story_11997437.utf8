	Bankura, Jan. 17: Trinamul leaders walked alongside CPM activists in a procession in Bankura town today to pay homage to Jyoti Basu.        
	The Trinamul Congress does not attend all-party meetings called by the administration, but party leaders said they walked the 6km stretch to show respect to the departed CPM patriarch.        
	It was just to show respect to Jyotibabu and nothing else, said former MLA and district Trinamul leader Kashinath Mishra, who joined the march.

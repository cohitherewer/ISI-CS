          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 23: The Sangh parivar has decried the Supreme Courts stay order on the Ayodhya title suit verdict and called it a massive blow to the country.        
	The VHP rejected the suggestion of negotiations and asked, Who will talk to whom?        
	The RSS described the order as surprising and wondered what prompted the deferment when the Supreme Court had all along directed Allahabad High Courts Lucknow bench to speed up hearings for an expeditious ruling.        
	Ashok Singhal, the VHPs international president, alleged that forces with malafide intentions were behind the move.        
	The order is a cause of worry. After the verdict, one side would have felt aggrieved and the other would have felt good. But why stop the verdict? Even today, none of the litigants, including the Sunni Central Wakf Board, wanted to negotiate. So what is the thinking? All this is the handiwork of the government, Singhal said.        
	There is a conspiracy that is steadily unravelling, he added.        
	The BJP refused to comment. We will speak when the verdict comes, said spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman.

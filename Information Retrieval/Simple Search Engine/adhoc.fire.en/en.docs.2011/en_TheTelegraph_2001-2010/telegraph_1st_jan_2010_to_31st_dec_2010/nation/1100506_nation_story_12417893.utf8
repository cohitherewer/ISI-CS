          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 5: The military road-building outfit, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), is abandoning a five-year-old project to rebuild a national highway that runs through Maoist terrain across two states.        
	The BRO, which is celebrating its golden jubilee this week, had been tasked with paving and expanding National Highway 16 through Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh precisely because it runs through the zone in which Maoists have been active for more than 15 years.        
	The original NH16 connected Nizamabad in Andhra Pradesh through Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarhs Bastar region and it runs through Dantewada district where 76 policemen were killed by Maoists last month.         
	The army-headed outfit was given the responsibility because scared civilian contractors had refused to work on the road.         
	This is the only road that the BRO was tasked with that is not a border road. It passes through the heartland of the country. It was because of the Naxalite influence in the region that the project was given to the BRO.        
	But the BRO is now winding up the Nagpur-headquartered Project Hirak just as the Centre and the states are reinforcing paramilitary troops engaged in battling the Maoists.         
	Lt General M.C. Badhani, the director-general of the outfit, said here today that the project was being wound up because of two reasons: first, strategic compulsions to build or rebuild roads on the border with China in Sikkim and second, procedural delays in acquiring land in the forests through which the road runs.        
	The decision was taken at the highest level of the government, Badhani said. We have been asked to hand over the road to the respective state governments on as is where is basis.         
	Project Hiraks original mandate was to rebuild nearly 200km of NH16. But in five years it has completed less than half (92km) of the task. The tardy progress and the abandoning of the project has angered Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh who has asked for a review of the decision.         
	Badhani said BRO engineers have been kidnapped and their vehicles burnt a few times by Maoists. He insisted that the threat from the Maoists had not forced the decision to wind up Project Hirak.         
	The Hirak project is implemented by a special task force. It is not a normal project and was raised as a truncated project to work without much manpower in the headquarters. The manpower has already been re-deployed (in Sikkim), the BRO chief said.        
	The BRO wanted to move out after building three bridges on the road. That should be over by March 2011. That would still leave about 70km incomplete, he said.         
	No doubt there is the Naxalite problem. They (Maoists) have burnt our machines a couple of times. But that is not an issue. We have been getting a lot of local support there. The issue is procedural delay like forest clearance and land acquisition, Badhani added.

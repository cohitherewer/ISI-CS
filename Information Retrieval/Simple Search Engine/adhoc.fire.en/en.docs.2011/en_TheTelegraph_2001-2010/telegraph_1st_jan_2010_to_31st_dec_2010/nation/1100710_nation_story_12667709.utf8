          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 9: Sharad Yadav today accused the Centre of developing cold feet over the caste census and said that, along with price rise, it would be the rallying point for the Opposition during Parliments monsoon session beginning July 26.        
	NDA convener and Janata Dal (United) chief Yadav has sent a letter to finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who heads the empowered group of ministers over caste census, and asked him to make the governments position clear without delay.        
	Yadav was the nodal person co-ordinating with the Left during the July 5 all-India strike over price rise. He said wider Opposition unity would be seen in Parliament as well.        
	He claimed the Congress was trying to fracture Opposition unity by accusing the CPM of joining hands with communal forces.        
	Apart from secularism, there are a host of important issues confronting the masses. Why should we cling to secularism and allow the Congress to do all kinds of dirty things? he asked.        
	Yadav claimed allegations the Left had talked to the BJP to make the strike a success were baseless. But he acknowledged that he was in touch with the Left.         
	The Congress is scared about opposition unity and the response the strike over price rise generated. Now it is conspiring to break it, he said.        
	Denying that the BJP was divided over the caste census, he said party president Nitin Gadkari had backed it despite the RSSs reservations.There was wide consensus in the Lok Sabha and everybody from Left to Right supported it. The government seems to be guided by the opinions of self-styled intellectuals who are crying hoarse over the caste census, he said.

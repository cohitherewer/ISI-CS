The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Krishna trip after trust test
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Krishna trip after trust test
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                               
	Islamabad, June 27: When external affairs minister S.M. Krishna arrives here next month, he might feel entitled to wonder whether this weeks breathless bilateral diplomacy set the stage for his visit or disrupted it.         
	Trust between the worlds most querulous siblings lies more buried than built, prospects of a breakthrough have emerged and then, typically, appeared to evaporate.         
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao departed with a happy measure of aggregates that allowed her party to promise tactile movement. Home minister P. Chidambaram left surly of mood, fogged by doubt and plumbing deficits.         
	Dissimilar, if not contrary, summations are going to reach the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) from the Islamabad dialogue and Krishna will have to tread the zigzag of that fracture in July. Its a pattern whose emboss neither neighbour seems able to erase.         
	As one Indian official put it: We are pledged to pursue peace, but it is foolish to forget it will come while the terror network in Pakistan is allowed to flourish. Hafiz Saeed remains a free man, and he is just a metaphor for an entire infrastructure that threatens our security.         
	For all the fervent anti-terror promises made to it, Chidambarams delegation has returned with its own interpretation of the code and it does not make encouraging reading for the peace constituency on either side of the fence. Movement? asked one official incredulously on the sidelines of Chidambarams news conference, and wagged his thumb negatively. He went on to suggest that, if anything, the chasm between public statement and private position remained agape.         
	Interior minister Rehman Malik announced Pakistans Federal Investigation Agency and the CBI would co-operate on the Mumbai investigations. Backstage, Indian officials laughed off the idea. Co-operate? Give them information? We have suffered for that in the past, and look what they are doing with all the dossiers we have handed them. And on this trip we have not heard anything that suggests there is a change.         
	In the run-up to the Sharm-el Sheikh agreement last summer, ISI boss Shuja Pasha was in direct touch with the Indian military attach at the high commission on a range of security issues.         
	Today, that level of exchange seems a far cry; and that could be a function of Indian frustrations over lack of action on the Mumbai front. Little, it would seem, has been altered by this weeks visits; or, as one of Pakistans leading national dailies bluntly said in an editorial this morning, there has been no movement.         
	There is, clearly, a play of patience on in the current process, but there appears very little expectation attached to it. At least to a section of Indian officialdom which continues to read devils in the bilateral script.

	Patna, Feb. 3: A day after Rahul Gandhi observed that Bihar hadnt changed, Arun Jaitley said those who had failed to see a change in the state in the past four years of NDA rule had got blinkers on their eyes.        
	Economists and social scientists have noticed how Bihar has wriggled out from its historical backwardness and has undergone a sea change in the past four years. But the change is not visible to certain people, the BJP general secretary said.        
	Though Jaitely did not name anyone, it was amply clear who he was referring to. Only yesterday Rahul had said: Bihar has not changed. The state needs transformation.         
	But Jaitley recalled how the state lagged behind under Congress and RJD which together ruled it for 55 years. Bihar was at the bottom on the scale of development, he said.        
	About his experience of visiting the state before Nitish Kumar came to power in 2005, Jaitely said: My workers usually suggested that I return to Patna from the rural areas after sunset. I remember that there were no roads in many areas I had travelled. If there were roads at all, they were too bad to drive on.        
	Quoting The Economist, the BJP leader said: The reputable magazine has picked up Bihar to tell the tale of growth in the state. But it has observed that Bihar can be on a par with Maharashtra and Gujarat if the present pace of development goes on for 18 more years. You can imagine where the Congress and the RJD had taken it to.        
	Jaitelys arrival here fuelled speculation about a change of leadership in the faction-ridden state BJP unit. BJP strategists are in search of a new state president to replace Radhamohan Singh by someone from the upper castes who have been its major support base in Bihar.        
	Of late, the BJP feels the upper castes might gravitate towards a resurgent Congress thats trying to revive itself in the state. Moreover, speculation was also rife that Jaitely might have come on a mission to rein in dissidents.        
	But Jaitely refused to comment on party affairs. I was fortunate to be in-charge of Bihar BJP when the NDA came to power. In the process of formalising ties between the BJP and JD(U) in 2005, I befriended many NDA workers. I have just come to offer my good wishes to the workers, Jaitely said.        
	NDA grapevine has it that a senior leader of national stature, Jaitely rushed to Patna to counter the Congresss efforts to cash in on the growing popularity of Rahul among youths ahead of state elections due later this year.

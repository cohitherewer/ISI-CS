The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Farewell with clenched fist
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Farewell with clenched fist
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                              
	Navi Mumbai, April 25: Lalit Modi tonight delivered what sounded like a farewell speech but packed his signature pugnacity.        
	All decisions of the IPL were taken by the governing council and approved by the general body, Modi said while addressing the spectators at the end of the IPL final here tonight.        
	The message was a reminder about collective responsibility to the rest of the governing council that was sharpening knives for his ouster.        
	Reading out from a prepared text and sometimes fumbling, Modi tried to send a political message and sought to reach out to the people. It is not the Indian Premier League. It is the Indian People League, he said.         
	He did refer to the current scandal but indirectly. The IPL is clean and transparent and, in the last few days, we have seen a lot of innuendos, half-truths and motivated leaks about the league.        
	Playing to the gallery, Modi said he would take the blame if irregularities were proved. As the leader of the team, I shall take full responsibility.        
	Seeking to clear the air on allegations of match-fixing and financial irregularities, he added: I assure millions of passionate fans of the league and the game across the globe that the IPL is clean and transparent. We should not allow this brand to be diluted and we will not.        
	All I wanted is to leave a small footprint in the glorious history of this game, Modi added. At one point, he made a reference to how trying the times were. The obstacle is the path, he said, quoting a Zen proverb. He also quoted the Bhagvad Gita.        
	Before the final got off the ground, Modis body language betrayed no signs of nervousness. He remained his flamboyant self at the stadium.        
	In a brief TV interview, a smiling Modi even predicted the next season would be bigger and more exciting, the apparent implication being he would be there to preside over it. Asked if Season IV would be much bigger, he said: Yes. Two new teams; 94 matches. All players would be available for auction. We will start from scratch.        
	Later, Modi was seen seated at the stadium flanked by his biggest supporters: wife Minal and former board chief I.S. Bindra. Actress Sushmita Sen, who brought in models from her new grooming school, sat next to Minal.        
	Rajeev Shukla was the only board official present apart from Modi.         
	Knight Riders co-owner Jay Mehta and Pune team owner Subrata Roy were on the VIP stands. So were Mumbai Indians owner Mukesh Ambani, with son Aakash and associate Nikhil Meswani.        
	The IPL brought in an innovation by deploying a Spider Cam, which can hover in the air and travel to any part of the ground to provide a 360-degree view on TV.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Yeddy govt shaky in south
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Yeddy govt shaky in south
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 6: Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa has six days to prove his majority after 19 legislators wrote to the governor withdrawing support, reducing the first BJP-led government in the south to a minority.        
	Yeddyurappa told governor H.R. Bharadwaj he would face the trial of strength on October 11, a day before the deadline.        
	In Delhi, BJP president Nitin Gadkari and two former chiefs, L.K. Advani and M. Venkaiah Naidu, went into a huddle. We are talking to our MLAs and looking into their grievances, Naidu, a Rajya Sabha MP from Karnataka, said.        
	Fourteen of the 19 MLAs who withdrew support are from the BJP; the rest are Independents. In the 224-member House, the BJPs strength has now been reduced to 104, nine short of majority. Four of the rebels, all Independents, were ministers but were sacked earlier in the day after a combative Yeddyurappa decided to accommodate some disgruntled BJP MLAs.        
	He warned the dissidents, now camping in Chennai, that if they didnt withdraw their letters to the governor, he would move to disqualify them from the Assembly under the anti-defection law. However, the Delhi leaders apparently advised him to go slow and start mollifying them.        
	Ironically, the BJPs trouble-shooter was G. Janardhana Reddy, the Bellary mining magnate and tourism minister who had instigated a revolt against the chief minister before his wings were clipped. Reddy flew to Chennai and met the rebels at the airport VIP lounge.        
	Asked if the leadership was thinking of changing the chief minister, Naidu said: That is ruled out.        
	Some in the BJP, however, say that unless Yeddyurappa changes his mode of functioning and works in a spirit of co-operation and conciliation, inner-party crises would continue to plague him.        
	The latest provocation was the alleged unilateral manner in which he dropped ministers and re-inducted his confidante Shobha Karandlaje. Shobha had been dropped against his wishes some months ago to buy peace with the Reddy brothers who were on the verge of splitting the BJP.        
	The biggest factor in Yeddyurappas favour is his caste. The chief minister is a Lingayat, a powerful intermediate caste that calls the shots in Karnataka politics with the backward caste Vokkaligas.

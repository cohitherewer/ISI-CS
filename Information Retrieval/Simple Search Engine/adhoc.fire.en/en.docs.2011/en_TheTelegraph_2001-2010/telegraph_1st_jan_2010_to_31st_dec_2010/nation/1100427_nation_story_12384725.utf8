The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Graft not privilege breach: SC
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Graft not privilege breach: SC
  - House cant expel member unless legislative work is hampered        SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                    
	New Delhi, April 26: The Supreme Court today ruled that Assemblies cannot expel members citing breach of privilege unless their conduct in any way obstructed legislative business in the House.         
	Nor can an Assembly expel a member for executive action he has taken as a member of a previous House, the court added while quashing the expulsion of former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh from the Assembly.         
	The Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP coalition is in power in Punjab. Amarinders party, the Congress, which was in power in the previous House is in the Opposition now.        
	The bench headed by Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan touched upon the matter of political rivalry when it said: If we permit the legislature to exercise privileges for acting against members for their executive acts during previous terms, the courts are likely to be flooded with cases involving political rivalries. One can conceive that whenever there is a change of regime, the fresh incumbents would readily fall back on the device of legislative privileges to expel their political opponents as well as dissidents.         
	Amarinder was expelled from the Vidhan Sabha on September 10, 2008, following a finding by a House special committee that he had indulged in criminal misconduct. Amarinder had allegedly allowed certain exemptions to some private parties during the acquisition of 32.10 acres in Amritsar.         
	The committee had concluded that Amarinder, who won the Patiala seat, had been involved in corruption, conspiracy to cause wrongful loss and abuse of public office. The House passed a resolution expelling him for the remaining three and a half years of his term in the 13th Assembly.         
	Amarinder, whose supposed abuse of public office occurred during his term in the previous Assembly, appealed to the high court which only granted him protection from custodial interrogation. Dissatisfied, he moved the Supreme Court.         
	The apex court first directed that his seat should not be treated as vacant and fresh elections should not be allowed. Today, it restored the seat to him for the remaining term.         
	If it is indeed felt that the allegations of misconduct on the part of the former CM had brought disrepute to the entire House, then the proper course is to pursue criminal investigation and prosecution before the appropriate judicial forum, the bench said.         
	The court refused to accept the Vidhan Sabhas argument that it had the power to expel a member for reasons other than those prescribed for disqualification under Article 191 of the Constitution. It rejected parallels with an earlier case in which some MPs caught on video accepting bribes (cash-for-query case) had been expelled.         
	 in that (cash-for-query) case, the misconduct which was the ground for the MPs expulsion had a direct connection with their legislative functions, namely askingquestions at the behest of vested interests and improper allocation of funds under MPLAD scheme, the court said. in this case, it is difficult to see how improper exemption of a particular plot of land from an acquisition scheme caused an obstruction to conduct legislative business.         
	The court rejected the Vidhan Sabhas argument that Amarinder had been removed as he was seen as unfit to continue as a member. Expressions such as lowering the dignity of the House, conduct unbecoming of a member of the House and unfitness of a member are openly-worded and abstract grounds which if recognised will trigger indiscriminate and disproportionate use of legislative privileges by incumbent majorities to target their political opponents as well as dissidents, the court said.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, March 10: Four key reform legislation that could fundamentally transform Indias higher education sector may this week receive the Union cabinets approval, paving the way for their introduction and passage in Parliament.         
	The legislation, borne out of the Prime Ministers vision for higher education, are scheduled for discussion by the cabinet at its meeting later this week, top government sources told The Telegraph.         
	These legislation seek to allow foreign varsities to come to India, punish all colleges that mislead or cheat students, set up dedicated tribunals to settle education disputes and create a new rating mechanism for higher educational institutions.         
	The bills, if approved by the cabinet, may be tabled in Parliament during the ongoing budget session itself, sources said.         
	While human resource development ministry officials are jittery about the cabinets decision on the foreign educational institutions (regulation of entry and operations) bill, the other bills are expected to receive a nod without much fuss.         
	The Foreign Educational Institutions (FEI) bill has been vetted by a committee of secretaries representing several ministries. The HRD ministry has altered the bill based on the panels recommendations.         
	But the legislation allowing and regulating foreign universities has over the years earned the reputation of a jinxed bill within the HRD ministry  because of the Opposition that has repeatedly sent it into cold storage.         
	While the FEI bill, if enforced could open up unprecedented access to foreign universities for Indian students, the other three legislation aim to ensure that students and teachers are no longer cheated by institutions.         
	The prohibition of unfair practices in education bill for the first time punishes administrators at higher educational institutions that cheat or mislead students with false promises, or charge capitation fees.         
	The bill follows thousands of complaints about institutions misleading students through inaccurate claims in advertisements and in their prospectus. It seeks to punish the guilty with a jail term and a hefty fine.         
	The education tribunals bill aims to set up special tribunals empowered to settle all disputes pertaining to the education sector  a teachers complaints against her employers or a students allegation against a cheat college, for instance.         
	The national authority for regulation in accreditation of higher educational institutions bill plans to restructure the countrys mechanism for rating the quality of its universities and colleges.         
	The bill plans to set up a watchdog along the lines of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India that will award licences to rating agencies that can accredit higher educational institutions.         
	The three bills have been cleared by a group of ministers that was set up by the cabinet towards the end of 2009. and which has cleared the legislation.         
	But the FEI bill, opposed by the Left when it was supporting the UPA, continues to contain sections on which the government itself is divided.         
	The HRD ministry had raised the amount foreign institutions need to set aside as a corpus, from Rs 10 crore till now to Rs 50 crore.         
	But the hike, demanded by the HRD ministry may not be supported by the Prime Minister, known to be keen on retaining few fetters for aspiring foreign institutions as possible in the bill.

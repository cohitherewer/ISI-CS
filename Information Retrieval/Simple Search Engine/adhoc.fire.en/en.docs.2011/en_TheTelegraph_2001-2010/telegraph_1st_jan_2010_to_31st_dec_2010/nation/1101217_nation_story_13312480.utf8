The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Indian knot in ashram 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Indian knot in ashram 
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                          Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in Rome on Wednesday. (AFP)                                  
	Jaipur, Dec. 16: If anyone thought the Arun Nayar-Elizabeth Hurley split might jinx Jodhpur as a venue for celebrity weddings, they need have no fear.        
	Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are planning to marry in Jodhpur next January or February, sources close to them have said.        
	But before Rajasthans wedding industry gets all too excited, the word is that the Hollywood couple may eschew the lavishness of the Nayar-Hurley wedding, held at Jodhpurs Umaid Bhavan Palace in 2007. Jolie and Pitt too had visited Jodhpur in October 2006 and stayed at Umaid Bhavan.        
	Brangelina, as the couple are known, are expected to tie the knot at a simple ceremony at the Jodhpur headquarters of their spiritual guru, Guruji Ram Lalji Siyag. An alternative site too is being discussed: the other ashram of Gurujis Adhyatma Vigyan Satsang Kendra in Bikaner.        
	Marrying in India is the latest trend among western celebrities: pop star Katy Perry and comedian Russell Brand got hitched last October at the Aman-e-Khas resort near Jaipur.        
	Jolie, 35, had earlier divorced actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton after short-lived marriages. She and Pitt, who turns 47 on Saturday, apparently fell for each other while they were shooting for Mr amp; Mrs Smith in 2005.        
	When the couple, who have several times been voted the worlds most attractive woman and man, began dating, Jolie was accused of breaking Pitts marriage with actor Jennifer Aniston.        
	The couple confirmed their relationship in February 2006 when Jolie was pregnant with Pitts first child. They now have six biological and adopted children.        
	In February 2010, Brangelina had sued British tabloid the News of the World for reporting they had split. Last September, Jolie told a TV channel that Pitt was the only one she could talk to.        
	Sources say Gurujis teachings have cemented Brangelinas relationship, which had come under strain because of the constant media spotlight. The couple have apparently decided that marriage would bring more stability to their relationship and want Guruji to solemnise the ceremony.        
	Guruji, 83, who lives in Jodhpur most of the time, is said to have agreed to do so in his centres either at the Sun City (Jodhpur) or Bikaner.        
	Many of Gurujis teachings and programmes are available online, which the Hollywood couple may have accessed and got interested in, said a disciple of Guruji who did not want to be named.        
	They probably got in touch with Guruji through friends and met him during his US visit in 2005, the disciple said. Pitt is known to have said in 2007 that he is not a Christian any more and does not believe in the afterlife.        
	Guruji is from Palana village, about 25km from Bikaner, where his family practises agriculture. His Indian adherents are mostly village folk in Rajasthan and Gujarat but he has many followers in the US and Israel, countries he has visited several times.        
	He follows the philosophy of Sri Aurobindo. His disciples believe he was Ramakrishna Paramhansa in his past life. Guruji apparently does not lay emphasis on yoga but says meditation and naamjap (taking Gods name) are the key to salvation.

	Bangalore, May 2: A Karnataka minister today quit B.S. Yeddyurappas cabinet after allegations that he raped his friends wife surfaced in news reports.        
	Food and civil supplies minister Harathalu Halappa quit after a leading Kannada daily published the front-page report. The alleged victim is the wife of a social worker.        
	Within hours of Halappas exit, the woman and her husband from chief minister Yeddyurappas home district Shimoga  Halappa is an MLA from there  lodged a complaint of rape and criminal intimidation against him with Karnataka director-general of police Ajai Kumar Singh.        
	Husband Venkatesh Murthy said the police chief had assured him that an inquiry would be conducted.        
	He (Halappa) has done a bad thing. He should be punished. It (the entire episode) should not become entertainment for the people, Murthy said while his wife alleged that Halappa had threatened to kidnap their children.        
	Murthy said they did not file the complaint in Shimoga as they feared it might be dumped because of political pressure.        
	Halappa rubbished the media reports as baseless and untrue and saw a political conspiracy by opponents, including some from his own ruling party, the BJP, in the alleged incident four months ago.        
	There is no truth in it. I am being targeted. I am quitting on moral grounds. I dont want to embarrass my party, partymen and the government. Let them come out with evidence to prove the charge, he said.        
	Chief minister Yeddyurappa said he had accepted the resignation as Halappa insisted on quitting.

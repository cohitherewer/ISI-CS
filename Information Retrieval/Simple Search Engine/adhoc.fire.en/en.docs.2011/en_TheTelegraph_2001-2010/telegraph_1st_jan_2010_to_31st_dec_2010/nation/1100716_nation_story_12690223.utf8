	New Delhi, July 15 (PTI): Filmmaker Rahul Dholakias forthcoming movie Lamhaa, which is based on Kashmir, faces a ban in the Gulf except Oman.          
	The film, starring Bipasha Basu, Sanjay Dutt, Anupam Kher and Kunal Kapoor, was banned because censors in the UAE reportedly found the content highly objectionable and controversial.                   
	New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has held that minority educational institutions cannot be compelled to appoint SC/ST teachers even if they were drawing grant-in-aid from the government. The court said minorities enjoyed special status under the Constitution to set up and operate schools with their own set of rules.                  
	New Delhi: Santosh Kumar Singh, who was awarded death sentence by a high court for the 1996 rape and murder of fellow student Priyadarshini Mattoo, has questioned the veracity of the DNA tests that had proved his involvement in the crime.                   
	New Delhi: The Supreme Court has dismissed a contempt of court petition filed in 1995 against HRD minister Kapil Sibal over a speech in which he had said there was corruption in the judiciary. The court said there was no case of contempt.                   
	Patna: A CBI investigation has been ordered by Patna High Court into alleged irregularities in the expenditure of Rs 11,412 crore drawn from state treasuries between April 1, 2002, and March 31, 2008. The development can have wider political ramifications as a large part of Nitish Kumars tenure has apparently witnessed the withdrawal.

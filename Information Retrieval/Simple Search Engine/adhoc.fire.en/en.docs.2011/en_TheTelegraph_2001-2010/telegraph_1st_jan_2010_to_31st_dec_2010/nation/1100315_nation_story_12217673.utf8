          OUR BUREAU                              
	Imphal/Siliguri, March 14: The self-styled chief of an insurgent outfit that claims its final objective is the sovereignty of Manipur was arrested in north Bengals Siliguri this evening, Imphal police said.        
	Ningthoujam Tomba alias Koireng, 57, the commander-in-chief of the Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup (KYKL), was picked up along with some others, officers said.        
	But Darjeeling superintendent of police D.P. Singh declined to specify whether the person held was Tomba and merely said a person from Manipur had been arrested in Siliguri.        
	We are not sure whether he belongs to any militant outfit. We have sent word to the Manipur police and are interrogating the person, Singh said. He did not specify the site of the arrest, either.        
	But Radheshyam Singh, the superintendent of police (SP), Imphal East, said: We have arrested the commander-in-chief, Tomba, of the KYKL from Khaprail Bazaar (on Siliguris outskirts). Only a few details have been received here.        
	Sources said the arrests were made by Manipur police commandos along with Siliguri cops, but the Darjeeling SP did not specify the extent of the local forces role.        
	Tomba is a native of Nambol Kongkham Leikai in Manipurs Bishnupur district and is wanted in several cases, including attacks on the security forces.        
	In Imphal, SP Radheshyam Singh said Tomba was picked up with some others around 6.30pm. He did not say whether the others were KYKL cadres but claimed some women were with the rebel leader.        
	Other details remained sketchy, too, such as whether the arrests were made from a hotel or a rented house.        
	Imphal police only said a satellite phone was seized from Tomba. Sources in Imphal said the rebel leader may have just come out of Nepal  or else was about to enter the Himalayan country  when he was held. Siliguri is close to the Nepal border.        
	According to the army in Manipur, the KYKL was formed in January 1994. But a group broke away from it last year to form a military wing, which is known as Miyamgi Yawol Lanmee (KYKL military defence force).         
	Initially, the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) provided weapons to the Manipur group. But the KYKL severed ties with it after the Naga outfit raised the demand that Naga-inhabited areas of Manipur be included in its proposed homeland.        
	Army sources said the KYKL was a strong force before the division. Some cadres of the military wing have been killed or have surrendered. The KYKL has not responded to the offers for peace talks from the Centre and the Manipur government.        
	The KYKL had launched a campaign, code-named Operation New Kangleipak, to cleanse what it called the rot in the states education system. It had punished teachers for helping students in exams.

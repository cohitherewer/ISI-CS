The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India falls behind in Pak aid race

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A flood-affected child eats bread at a relief camp in Nowshera, in north-west Pakistan, on Thursday. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: India may have missed a golden opportunity to impart tangential impetus to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs dogged bid for lasting peace with Pakistan by not extending a helping hand in the neighbours flood relief effort.        
	Flash floods in Pakistans north-west have left more than 1,100 dead and hundreds of thousands injured and homeless; the scale of the devastation has been such that relief has become a global effort spearheaded by the United Nations (UN).         
	New Delhi, though, has been conspicuous by its absence among those queuing up to become part of what has become a humongous humanitarian effort. Much less a formal offer for aid and assistance, the Indian government has not even sent out a message of anguish and solidarity to the neighbour, usually a routine first step to offering assistance in the face of natural calamity.        
	New Delhis silence on the flood devastation in the neighbourhood has not only been noted by influential sections in Pakistan but also rankled sections of the Indian establishment. Some, in fact, have begun to rue missing what they call a great opportunity to reach out to the Pakistan people in their hour of need. The Prime Minister has repeatedly spoken of walking more than half the way to negotiate peaceful ties with Pakistan and Indias neutral response on the recent floods has left many perplexed.         
	We should have made a public offer whether bilaterally or through the UN. It would have been a great way of exhibiting our intentions at a humanitarian level and would have sent the right kind of message to the Pakistani people, particularly since we support democracy, said retired diplomat Arundhati Ghose.         
	She said New Delhis helping hand would have also countered Jamaat-ud-Dawas anti-India propaganda. With the civilian government in Pakistan failing to provide succour in time to the victims, the Jamaat has managed to exploit the situation, as it had done during the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK). It has alleged that the floods have been occurred because India released excess water.        
	However, sources in the ministry of external affairs suggested that the government had yet to make up its mind. An offer for aid, though belated, may yet come but no decision has eventually been taken.         
	India has in the past been quick to respond in times of natural disasters and has dispatched aid on a number of occasions to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and even Pakistan  at the time of the 2005 quake. One planeload of relief material was sent to the quake victims in PoK. Pakistan had at the time refused the aid, possibly because relief was meant for PoK.        
	The government should still think of doing something about it because at times of such crisis, it is odd for neighbours to remain silent, said another retired diplomat.

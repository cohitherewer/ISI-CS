          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Naveen: Tough action                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 7: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today expressed his displeasure over poor implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in four districts and asked the respective collectors to improve their performance.        
	The achievements of districts like Puri, Kendrapara, Nuapada and Jagatsinghpur have been dismal. I expect the collectors of the low-performing districts to improve their performance in the months to come, said the chief minister during a video-conferencing with the collectors.        
	On the other hand, Naveen complimented the collectors of Ganjam, Kandhamal, Mayurbhanj and Nawrangpur for their good performance, while observing that the success of the scheme depended to a large extent on the initiative taken by the collectors concerned.        
	He advised the collectors to pay special attention to effective implementation of the MGNREGS since it plays a vital role in rural development. As MGNREGS is a demand-driven programme, its advisable to build up a shelf of projects for every village based on the demand of the villagers concerned. This will not only ensure participation of the villagers in the programme, but also create durable assets, Naveen said.        
	Naveen advised the officials of agriculture, horticulture, water resources, forest and fisheries departments to work in tandem to make the MGNREGS a success.        
	He asked the collectors to monitor implementation of the MGNREGS daily and instructed the revenue divisional commissioners to review the progress weekly and report to the state panchayati raj department.        
	Naveen stressed on payment of wages through banks and post-offices within a week to ensure transparency in transaction. Social audit mechanism should be firmly put in place in order to promote awareness and in order to prevent any malpractice in the entire transaction, he said.        
	Focusing on the much-hyped farm pond programme, Naveen said: If properly executed, it will greatly contribute to drought mitigation through protective irrigation.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                            
	Srinagar, June 6: The army has removed a colonel from his command and suspended a major for their alleged role in gunning down three youths, weeks after their unit was rewarded for killing the victims who had been branded militants.        
	The action comes a day before Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs two-day visit to Kashmir amid calls to probe the death of some three dozen militants in border encounters in the past five months.        
	The colonel has been removed from his command. His second officer has been suspended, Northern Command chief Lt Gen B.S. Jaiswal said today after a unified headquarters meeting chaired by chief minister Omar Abdullah.        
	The army had said that troops from the 4 Rajputana Rifles had killed the three infiltrators in an April 30 encounter near the Line of Control in Machil, Kupwara. The three, buried in a graveyard earmarked for unidentified militants, turned out to be innocent young men, prompting police to register a murder case.        
	Army sources said Colonel D.K. Pathania, the units commanding officer, had been relieved of his command while Major Bhupinder Singh had been suspended. Colonel Pathania has been asked not to leave the Valley till the inquiry is over. Major Singh, who is in Meerut, will be asked to face investigation here, an official said.        
	The unit was shifted to Meerut after the alleged encounter, for which it had received Rs 6 lakh under the governments policy of awarding Rs 2 lakh for each militant killed on the border.        
	This is not the first time the army has acted against a serving officer over a fake encounter, but such punishments have been rare. In 2006, a colonel of 33 Rashtriya Rifles was removed for allegedly killing three boys who were playing cricket.         
	An angry Omar, under pressure after a series of allegations of rights violations in recent weeks, told the unified command that the violators of human rights would not be allowed to go scot-free.        
	The chief minister will take up the Machil encounter with the Prime Minister tomorrow, an official said.        
	Official figures show Omars first year in office  2009  was the most peaceful in the last 20 years despite the public uproar over the alleged Shopian rape-and-murder case, dismissed as a case of drowning by the CBI. But 2010 has seen a spurt in violence, including deaths of civilians in firing by security forces.        
	One case involved BSF commandant R.K. Birdi, who is accused of ordering his men to fire at a 17-year-old. Birdi is now in police custody.

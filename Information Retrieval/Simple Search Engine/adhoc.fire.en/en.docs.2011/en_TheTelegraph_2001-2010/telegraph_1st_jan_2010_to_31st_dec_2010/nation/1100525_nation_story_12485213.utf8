The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tyre burst at Delhi airport
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tyre burst at Delhi airport
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	New Delhi, May 24: A Srinagar-bound SpiceJet aircraft with 186 passengers made an emergency landing here after it suffered a tyre burst during takeoff and was asked to return by air traffic controllers.         
	The Boeing 737-800 aircraft landed safely at 2.50pm, about 20 minutes after takeoff. The pilots of another aircraft had noticed pieces of tyres on the runway soon after the Srinagar-bound plane had taken off.         
	The airport authorities declared a full emergency, and fire brigade vehicles and ambulances stood by while the aircraft made a low pass over the runway during which ground engineers spotted a burst tyre on the right side of the aircraft.         
	The aircraft returned to Delhi, as a precaution, keeping the safety of passengers in mind, an airline spokesperson said. We followed all procedures for landing in such situations, the spokesperson said.         
	Aircraft tyre bursts in general may be the outcome of either operational factors or poor maintenance, according to aircraft engineers familiar with stresses that aircraft tyres experience during landings and takeoffs.         
	Operational tyre bursts are typically the result of excessive friction between the surface of the tyre itself and the runway, or between the disc brake and the drum, said a senior instructor at an aviation engineering school in Lucknow. Excessive friction may occur during heavy landings and abrupt application of brakes. Friction produces heat that could lead to a tyre burst, quot; the instructor said.         
	But aircraft tyres have been known to burst during take-offs. About 10 years ago, aviation investigators concluded that a single tyre burst had caused the crash of a Concorde near Paris, killing all 113 aboard.         
	Aircraft engineers however say tyre bursts are still rare compared to the number of uneventful landings and takeoffs every day. A single airport might well have over 700 takeoffs and landings a day, a maintenance engineer in Delhi said. Pilots are trained to land with a tyre burst  there are special techniques they use to ease the landing in such conditions, the engineer said.               
	Aircraft tyres  like many other components in an aircraft  have to undergo rigorous maintenance checks and schedules that require replacing tyres after specified periods of time.

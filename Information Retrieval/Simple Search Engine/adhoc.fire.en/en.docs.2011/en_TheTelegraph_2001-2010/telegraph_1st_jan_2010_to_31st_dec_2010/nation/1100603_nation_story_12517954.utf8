The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Eye on 2011, Congress expects Trinamul thaw

          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, June 2: The Congress central leadership feels the civic poll results will smoothen the frayed relations with the Trinamul Congress, now that Mamata Banerjee has demonstrated her supremacy in Bengal politics.        
	The party is confident that the two UPA allies will contest the 2011 Assembly elections together. Senior leaders today dismissed all speculation about a tacit Congress-Left understanding.        
	These local elections have been a blessing in disguise. We now know our strength and will take a more realistic position in the future. Both of us now understand that our alliance is vital for the final ouster of the Left from Bengal, a senior minister told The Telegraph.        
	He said that Mamatas struggle against the Left was appreciated by at least three leaders at the top: Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.        
	These leaders dont want a very strong Left in the country, whatever their reservations about Mamatas attitude are, the minister said.        
	The courtesy and civility shown to the Left does not mean we are going to dilute our political struggle against them, particularly in Kerala and Bengal.        
	Party functionaries said that whatever reservations some in the Congress had about Mamata would get diluted in the coming days since she had displayed her mettle and shown the reason why the Congress should play second fiddle to Trinamul in Bengal.        
	Sources said Pranab Mukherjee, who decides Congress policy on Bengal and is perceived by some to be anti-Mamata, favoured fighting the Assembly elections together. Mukherjee was prompt in congratulating Mamata today and conceded that the Congress had done badly.        
	The sources said Mukherjee had always wanted an alliance for the civic elections, and it was the partys district leaders who threw a spanner in the works with their unreasonable demands.        
	The Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs, K. Keshava Rao, played down the strains in Congress-Trinamul ties. The ultimate aim is to fight the Left. We are together at the national level and will fight the Left together in the Assembly polls, he said.        
	The partys official reaction was in tune with this sentiment. Spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said: Local factors override civic polls and not much should be read into the failure to fight these elections together. Our fight is against Left misrule and we will fight the Assembly elections together.        
	Asked whether seat-sharing talks for the Assembly elections could get similarly derailed, he said: That is far away. Our senior leaders will sort it out when the time comes. But we are together now and will remain together.        
	The Congress, however, expects Mamata to tone down her rhetoric now and begin to show greater respect to coalition compulsions at both the state and national levels.

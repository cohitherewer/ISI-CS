The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gujarat poet in cash-back row
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Gujarat poet in cash-back row
          BASANT RAWAT                             The cover of the book (top) and poet Aqeel Shatir Ansari                                 
	Ahmedabad, Dec. 20: Two years after his collection of poems was released, the Gujarat Urdu Sahitya Academy has asked poet Aqeel Shatir Ansari to return the money it had spent on publishing the book.         
	The academy slapped a notice on Ansari in November after it discovered an offensive remark about chief minister Narendra Modi in the book which is not only unacceptable but also violates the norms, registrar Harshad Trivedi said.         
	It had given Ansari Rs 10,000 to bring out Zinda Hoon Main (Im still alive), which was released in 2008.        
	We have asked him to return the amount with interest because he kept us in the dark. The manuscript which he submitted to us did not contain the objectionable remark which was added later. It is breach of contract, Trivedi said. A poet-writer is not supposed to modify the manuscripts after the approval.        
	The sentence, which talks of the chief ministers naked game of communal riots and the pathetic state of the Urdu language in Gujarat, appears in the foreword written by Bhiwandi poet Raunaq Afroz.         
	Ansari, 49, claims the academy is getting back at him because he has asked for information about its use of funds through applications under the Right to Information Act.         
	The poet filed the first RTI application in April this year and has since filed an appeal because he was not satisfied with the information he got. By October, he had filed a second RTI application.        
	I did not get satisfactory answers from the academy, so I filed another RTI application, Ansari said.        
	The academy registrar denies any link between Ansaris quest for information and the decision to ask him to return the money within a month of the second RTI application. There is no correlation; it is only a figment of his imagination, Trivedi said.        
	In his reply to the notice, Ansari has pointed out that he had not written the offending sentence and that it had anyway been deleted.         
	A former academy official had asked him to delete the sentence the day the book was released and that he had done so immediately and got pages 13 and 14 reprinted, the poet said.        
	Out of the 500 copies published, only the 80 given away at the launch carried the sentence, he added.         
	Not a single copy is available in the market and if the Academy can find one, I will happily return the amount, Ansari said.         
	The academy registrar claimed that he got the copy with the offending sentence from the market.

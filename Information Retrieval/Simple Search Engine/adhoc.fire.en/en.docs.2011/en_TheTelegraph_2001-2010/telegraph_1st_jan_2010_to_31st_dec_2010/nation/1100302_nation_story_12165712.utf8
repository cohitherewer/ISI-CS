          CITHARA PAUL                                            
	 New Delhi, March 1: The government is planning to bring in a drug policy that has a slew of measures to counter the threat after being warned by the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) that India had become a major source for illegal online drug trade.        
	The World Drug Report 2009, released by the Vienna-based INCB, had said India had as many as 72.2 million drug addicts, a figure much higher than the government estimate of 30 million.         
	The report had pointed out that the country had of late become a hub of drugs sold through illegal Internet pharmacies.        
	According to the report, traffickers were increasingly using social networking sites to recruit youngsters to work as mules or peddlers in their countries. The report also underlined the link between drug abuse and HIV.        
	In India the prevalence of HIV infection among injecting drug users in 2006 was estimated at a national average of 8.71 per cent, compared with 0.36 per cent in the general adult population, the survey said.        
	We have decided to bring in a new national policy on prevention of alcoholism and substance abuse. It will deal with all problems related to drug abuse and also include a provision for rehabilitation of victims, said an official with the social justice ministry.         
	According to the official, the policy has been in the making for quite some time. But the INCB report speeded up the process, the official added.         
	To prevent the younger generation from falling prey to drugs, sources said the ministry was working on an awareness programme with a focus on adolescents and youths in schools and colleges.        
	Initiatives were also being taken to include topics related to drug abuse in school curricula and to work out modules for sensitisation of teachers and parents, the sources said.         
	The government has decided to carry out a national survey to get more insights on various types of drug abuse.         
	The sources said the ministry would set up more drug de-addiction centres across the country. We hope these centres, which would offer both treatment and counselling, could play a key role in dealing with drug abuse, the official said.        
	The ministry at present supports around 400 de-addiction centres across the country.         
	The ministry has also decided to ask the home ministry to ensure more stringent monitoring of the Internet to tackle the threat, the official said.         
	The INCB report had said that pharmaceutical preparations diverted from illicit manufacture in India continued to be widely abused in South Asia.         
	Drugs smuggled into neighbouring countries include pethidine and codeine-based cough syrups. While Nepal is the most important producer of cannabis resin in South Asia, the amount originating in India is also noteworthy, the report said.         
	According to the report, traffickers target single unemployed women aged 20-30 who do not have a criminal record. It said the peddlers targeted those in clerical or sales jobs to avoid suspicion.         
	The report also said orders placed with illegal Internet pharmacies were often dispatched to buyers abroad using courier or postal services and that such services had become a common means of smuggling drugs out of India.        
	In recent years, heroin and diazepam have been most frequently found in seized parcels sent from India, while morphine, cannabis herb, cannabis resin, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine have been seized occasionally, the report said.

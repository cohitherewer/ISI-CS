The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Religion referendum dare to Karat
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Religion referendum dare to Karat
          ARCHIS MOHAN                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: A former CPM MP who quit the godless party last month over lack of religious freedom has dared general secretary Prakash Karat to hold an internal referendum to find out the number of believers.        
	K.S. Manoj, in a open letter to Karat, has claimed that 90 per cent of CPM members are believers. He dubbed Karat and the CPMs attitude towards religion hypocritical, opportunistic, duplicitous and feudal. He claimed the CPMs instructions to party members on religion  as put forth by Karat in a recent article  were against the Constitution and a crime under the Indian Penal Code.         
	He requested Karat to allow religious freedom, as has been done by communist parties in Russia, China, Vietnam and Cuba. The party, Manoj said, can never become a prominent force in Indian politics if it does not revise its position on religion.        
	Manoj, a former MP from Alappuzha in Kerala, quit the primary membership on January 8 citing conflict in my conscience in protest against the partys rectification document which prohibits leading party members from conducting religious ceremonies.        
	My faith requires me to participate in functions and contradicts with the ideology the party is trying to enforce. Since I have put faith above such ideology, I had to resign, he had said in his quit letter.        
	Manojs stance is a critique of Karats article published in CPM mouthpiece Peoples Democracy on January 17. The CPM leader said there was duplicity and confusion over the position taken by the party (as explained by Karat).         
	In the write-up, Karat, clarifying the position in response to Manojs resignation, had said the CPM did not bar believers from joining the party. However, at the same time, leading party members were expected to be atheists.        
	Manoj termed the stand a double standard. This duplicity in attitude towards religious believers cannot be acceptable. The party wants believers to stick posters, shout slogans, hold dharnas and hartals and become martyrs but will not allow them to become leaders and participate in the decision-making forum of the party. This is sheer feudalistic attitude. By stating that (position), the general secretary has created a class structure in the party which is trying hard to establish a classless order in society, he said.         
	Manoj said the CPMs stand was against Article 25 of the Constitution and a crime under IPCs Section 153 (B).        
	In his open letter yesterday, Manoj said he hoped the issue would be discussed at the February 3-4 central committee meeting in Calcutta when the rectification document is to be ratified before its planned implementation in June.         
	I think that without a radical revision of dialectical materialism, the CPM cannot honestly and sincerely participate in parliamentary democracy. If the CPM continues to follow hypocritical ways, without being transparent and straightforward, the party cannot attract followers in contemporary Indian society, he said.

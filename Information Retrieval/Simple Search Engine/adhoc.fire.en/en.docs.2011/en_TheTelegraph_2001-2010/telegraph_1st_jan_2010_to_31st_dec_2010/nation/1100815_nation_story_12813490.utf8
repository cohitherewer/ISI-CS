	London, Aug. 14: An Indian doctor who allegedly fondled the breasts of six of his patients was struck off the medical register by a disciplinary panel that found guilty of serious professional misconduct.        
	Dr Parag Bhatt, 46, a general physician in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, was sexually motivated and in all but one case had no clinical need to examine his patients chests, the General Medical Council heard.        
	A disciplinary hearing, sitting in Manchester, was told that one victim was a 16-year-old girl who was visiting Bhatt for the first time on her own, while another had only gone to see him with a broken finger. The panel found that in at least one practice that Bhatt had worked in following the accusations, his use of chaperones was not formally monitored.        
	He had also been undertaking home visits that the panel said concerned them because it considers his sexually motivated actions in the past to have been opportunistic in nature.

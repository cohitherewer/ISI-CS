The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Divorce scrapped for proof gap
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Divorce scrapped for proof gap
  - Husband cries cruelty, court finds him insensitive         SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                    
	New Delhi, July 11: A rare case of a man seeking divorce on grounds of cruelty has come unstuck in the Supreme Court, which ruled he had failed to prove his charges.        
	Earlier, Gujarat High Court had observed that the facts showed the husbands insensitivity rather than the wifes cruelty.        
	The apex court on July 6 upheld the high court ruling that a divorce could not be granted just because the wife had failed to produce witnesses, and that the husband needed to prove his case.        
	The trial court had granted a divorce to Neelam Kumar of Vadodara seven years ago after he produced his sister and two neighbours as witnesses whereas wife Dayarani had failed to produce any. The high court later overturned that order citing insufficient evidence.        
	Kumar had alleged that Dayarani had begun treating him and his family in a cruel manner barely eight to nine months after their marriage in 1986. Some of his allegations:        
	Dayarani objected to Kumar giving money to his family, especially for his sisters marriage, and always quarrelled with him over it. At the time of his sisters marriage, she falsely claimed her ornaments were missing and cast suspicion on the grooms mother.        
	Such incidents and her behaviour made him the laughing stock in hometown Ankleshwar, forcing him to shift to Vadodara but that did not help.        
	In 1989, she went to her brothers marriage despite his advice not to because she was pregnant. When she had a miscarriage, she blamed Kumars family.        
	In 1994, Kumar was injured in an accident but Dayarani, who was posted in a different town, did not come to nurse him despite being informed. Nor did she visit his mother when she was admitted to hospital for eye surgery.        
	Dayarani denied all the allegations. Her version:        
	She had married Kumar on the understanding she could keep her job. But soon after the marriage, Kumar began pressuring her to stop working, and her refusal seemed to hurt his pride. Also, he wanted to get rid of her for failing to produce a child.        
	The high court chided Kumar for blaming Dayarani for her miscarriage instead of sympathising. This showed not her cruelty but his complete insensitivity, it said.        
	The court observed that if Dayarani had failed to go to her brothers marriage, she would have been criticised. It noted that the charge that she did not tend to her injured husband had been added as an afterthought and that Kumar had not produced medical records.        
	As for her not visiting his mother in hospital, the court noted that neither the mother nor the attending doctor was examined, nor was there documentary evidence to prove the mothers surgery.

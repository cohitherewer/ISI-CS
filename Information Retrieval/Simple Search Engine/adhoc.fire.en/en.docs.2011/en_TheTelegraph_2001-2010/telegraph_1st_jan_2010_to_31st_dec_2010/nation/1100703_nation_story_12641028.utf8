          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 2: The CPM politburo begins a two-day meeting here tomorrow where Prakash Karats critics, mainly from Bengal, will lay the groundwork to pin the blame on him for the partys recent poll reverses.        
	The meeting will finalise a contentious resolution on the way the CPM general secretary had altered the political line adopted by the 1998 Coimbatore party congress by withdrawing support to UPA I in July 2008.         
	The 1998 congress had advocated defeating the communal forces while standing by the Congress and pressuring the UPA into adopting pro-people measures.        
	The Bengal lobbys plan is to prevent Karat from blaming the civic poll rout  which, too, the politburo will discuss  exclusively on local factors, as he has been trying to do.         
	The meeting will be attended by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who had skipped the June politburo meeting that had touched on the civic polls.        
	The resolution on the alteration of the 1998 line will be adopted at the CPMs extended central committee meeting in August  dubbed a mini-congress  which is likely to be a stormy one amid attempts to corner Karat.

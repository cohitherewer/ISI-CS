The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Womens bill talks with monsoon session goal

          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          M Veerappa Moily                                  
	New Delhi, May 27: The government is in talks with political parties opposed to the womens reservation bill to iron out differences before it is introduced in the Lok Sabha, law minister M. Veerappa Moily has said.         
	The first round of talks (being overseen by Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee) are over, we are in the second round, Moily said in an interview with The Telegraph.         
	He, however, refused to share more details, saying we dont want to scuttle the talks.         
	He discounted a suggestion that the bill had been stalled despite the government claiming that it had reached a consensus in the Lower House. Even if the majority agrees on the bill, the minority view has to be considered, the law minister said.         
	He indicated that a solution might be found soon, paving the way for the bill to be tabled in the monsoon session of Parliament.        
	On the Maoist problem, Moily said the Centre was only a facilitator in the anti-Naxalite operations under way in several states, indicating that the key responsibility for tackling the menace lay with the state governments.        
	Law and order is a state subject, the law minister said. However, the central government realises that it is a serious issue. It is not for the state governments to handle the problem alone, he said.         
	The Centre is ready and willing to offer them (the states) all the support in terms of forces, funds, packages etc that they need to tackle the problem, Moily said.        
	Items 1 and 2 of List II of the Seventh Schedule identifies police and public order as state subjects. On the other hand, the defence of India and the deployment of armed forces are subjects under the control of the Union government.         
	Moily also denied allegations that the Centre was treating the recent spurt in Maoist attacks in several states as only a law and order issue. We do not see it as purely a law and order problem. We are aware that the socio-economic aspect of the problem also has to be addressed, he said.         
	In this context, he referred to the policy the Centre had formulated in 2006 to counter the rebel problem. The law minister said the government would fall back on the same policy to fight the Maoist menace.         
	The policy identifies a two-fold solution to the Naxalite problem  focusing on social development and strengthening the law and order machinery in the states.         
	The same prescription was also suggested in the report of the second administrative reforms commission that Moily had headed.         
	We have also been assisting states in strengthening their law and order machinery, the minister said. Strengthening law and order was a significant part of any anti-Maoist strategy, he added.

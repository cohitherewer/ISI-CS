	Lucknow, May 10: Expelled Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh today paraded his loyalists to prove they were firmly behind him as he charts his new political journey: winning statehood for eastern Uttar Pradesh.        
	People had begun to think Jaya Prada, Sanjay Dutt and (Bhojpuri actor) Manoj Tiwari had left me, but they are here, Amar said on his first visit to Lucknow since being expelled by the Samajwadis in January. The three stars sat next to him.        
	But there was a notable absence in his entourage: Jaya Bachchan, still a Samajwadi Rajya Sabha MP.        
	Todays move is being seen as an attempt to remove the impression that Jaya Prada, Sanjay and Manoj  none of whom are in the Samajwadi Party now  were distancing themselves from him. The three had not showed up in recent rallies of an apolitical forum that Amar floated after his expulsion.        
	Amars close aides say he has not officially turned the forum, Lok Manch, into a full-fledged political party as he is waiting for Jaya Bachchan  her term as an Upper House MP ends next month  to decide whether she will join him.        
	Asked which way he thought she would go, Amar said: I dont want to comment on Jaya Bachchans stand. She has already made her stand clear on this sometime before.        
	Amar presented Lok Manch, a loose grouping of small eastern Uttar Pradesh outfits, as the statehood campaign spearhead ahead of the 2012 state polls. The leaders, he said, will hit the streets to achieve the objective.        
	The region has been on sale politically but economically, the political masters have done nothing for it, Amar said, alluding to Samajwadi boss Mulayam Singh Yadavs stint in power and current chief minister Mayavatis reign now.        
	Amar dubbed eastern Uttar Pradesh his political laboratory. In a bid to woo extremely backward castes such as the Rajbhars, Amar declared that Anil Rajbhar  a former Samajwadi leader from eastern Uttar Pradesh  would be the Manchs state president. Another leader from the caste, Om Prakash Rajbhar, is also part of the forum, as are some Muslim leaders.

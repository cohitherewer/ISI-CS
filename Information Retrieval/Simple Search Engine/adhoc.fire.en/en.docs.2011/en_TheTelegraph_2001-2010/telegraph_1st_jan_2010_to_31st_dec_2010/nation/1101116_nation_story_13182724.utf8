The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Antony puts CBI on Adarsh scam trail
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CBI on Adarsh scam trail
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Nov. 15: Builders of the Adarsh high-rise in Colaba violated the law on five counts and the CBI has been asked to probe the matter and fix responsibilities, defence minister A.K. Antony told Parliament today.        
	Hours later, the anti-corruption wing of the CBI, Mumbai, formally registered a preliminary inquiry into the scam. This means the CBI will not be able to make arrests, seize documents or mount raids but will have to do a fact-finding enquiry that could be the basis for lodging an FIR later.        
	In a written reply in Parliament, Antony said initial findings had concluded that the army flouted rules in giving a no-objection certificate to free the land and give it to the Adarsh Co-operative Housing Society. The 3837.57sqm plot was originally in the possession of the defence estates department.        
	Two former army chiefs, Generals (retired) N.C. Vij and Deepak Kapoor, and a former navy chief, Admiral (retired) Madhvendra Singh, are among those allotted flats in the building.        
	The defence ministry also found that the high-rise by-passed coastal regulation zone clearance. The society included civilians as its members, although the building was originally intended as a welfare measure for soldiers and their families. Of the societys 102 allottees, 37 are officers in the armed forces.        
	The builders also added floors violating floor space index (FSI) rules. The building was cleared for six storeys but now has 31.        
	Rishi Raj Singh, the joint director of the CBI, Mumbai, said: We are in the process of collecting all the documents. We will decide about the FIR at a later stage. We will also question people involved.        
	A CBI spokesperson said the preliminary enquiry would look into the issuance of the NOC, allotment of land to Adarsh society and the assurances by society promoters to provide for welfare of defence personnel while obtaining clearances from the ministry of environment and forests.        
	Adarsh society promoters have appointed lawyer Satish Mane-Shinde to represent them. We have handed over certain documents to the CBI and asked for more time to submit more papers, Mane-Shinde, who defended actor Sanjay Dutt in the Mumbai serial blasts case, said.        
	Former IPS officer and lawyer Y.P. Singh said it was appropriate that the CBI had lodged a preliminary inquiry because the investigative agency had no jurisdiction over state issues.

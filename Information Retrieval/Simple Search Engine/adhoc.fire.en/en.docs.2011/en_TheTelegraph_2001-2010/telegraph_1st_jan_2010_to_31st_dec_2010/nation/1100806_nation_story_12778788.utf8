          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       TV footage of P Chidambaram in the Lok Sabha   on Thursday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: The Centre was today accused in Parliament of not cracking down hard enough on honour killings for fear of offending khap panchayats, particularly those in Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, and losing votes.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram denied the allegations, made by several members in the Lok Sabha, and asserted that a legislation being brought by the government would address all the concerns.        
	Chidambaram did not name khap panchayats but said such killings were bringing dishonour to the families, the community and the country. The proposed law, he said, would identify the crimes and award punishment with more severity.        
	Whoever is the cause of the crime, an individual or a collective (body), must be punished. My duty is to ensure that laws adopted by Parliament are obeyed and enforced. Once the law is made, it must be enforced. Those involved must be punished.         
	While some members felt such killings were a gender issue, others argued the crime was born out of caste biases in society.        
	The Congresss Girija Vyas, who is also the chairperson of the National Commission for Women, said the incidents were not restricted to some states or castes and the entire country was witnessing the trend. We get at least eight to 10 cases daily of young couples seeking protection from their families. These people belong to different castes and different states. Vyas said the maximum number of cases involved inter-caste marriages.        
	The CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta did not believe such crimes were a gender issue and pointed out that even boys were mercilessly murdered. He suggested tough action against khap panchayats but some MPs resisted the calls saying laws could not be insulated from social customs and traditions.         
	Dasgupta hoped the proposed legislation would define honour killings and even include cases where women are forced to strip in public and couples are banished people from villages.         
	RJD leader Lalu Yadav opposed the khap panchayats ban on same-gotra marriages and said many people married within their group.        
	Most members hailed the right to live and love and asked the Centre to ensure khap panchayats do not take the law into their hands. They sought separate laws and a campaign to educate people not to indulge in violence in the name of antiquated customs and false egos.

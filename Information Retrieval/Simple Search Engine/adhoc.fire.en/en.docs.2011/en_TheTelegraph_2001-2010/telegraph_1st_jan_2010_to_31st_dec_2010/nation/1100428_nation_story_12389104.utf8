The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM vs CPM: industry down, bandh up 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CPM vs CPM: industry down, bandh up 
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee                                  
	Calcutta, April 27: Tuesdays bandh proved yet again that the minority view in the CPM opposed to bandhs is losing out to a majority section in the party which wants to use such old tactics in order to try and get it out of the present predicament.        
	The minority view in the ruling party has repeatedly pointed out the contradictions in the old politics of bandhs. One, that it doesnt have public credibility as bandhs are known to be government-sponsored in Left-ruled states and that takes away whatever little effectiveness a shutdown has as a political strategy.        
	Problems arise when a bandh is called by the ruling party. We may give our explanation at public meetings or to the media to justify a bandh. But when the ruling party gives a bandh call, it is perceived as a government-sponsored protest. So, a bandh called by us may not be politically credible in the eyes of the people, said a CPM leader.        
	Two, that the minority view also points out that the CPM has to constantly juggle with different strategies even with regard to bandhs and agitation in different states, making the shutdown one thing in a Left-ruled state and another in other states.        
	This is exactly what had happened on April 8 when the CPM announced a jail bharo programme for the whole country but had to subsequently revise it for Bengal, Kerala and Tripura by asking its workers not to court arrest.        
	It would have looked silly and lacked political credibility if CPM activists had to participate in a jail bharo agitation in states where there are Left governments. Thats why, our partys national leaders courted arrest in Delhi. But we simply stuck to our programme of picketing in front of Central government offices and establishments, the CPM leader added.        
	This minority view in the CPM against bandhs was increasingly becoming vocal with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees industrialisation campaign and his efforts to create an investor-friendly image for the state. According to CPM insiders, the old politics of bandhs is now taking centre stage as the industrialisation campaign is losing steam and the minority voice is becoming feeble.        
	The dominant view in the party now is not to consider whether a shutdown is an effective form of protest but to look at the immediate political context as a means of justifying it, CPM sources said.        
	After the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the party was under attack and was looking for ways to protect its workers when the CPM state committee met in January this year and decided to go in for mass resistance despite being in the government.        
	The state committee meeting, attended by party general secretary Prakash Karat and politburo member Sitaram Yechury, laid down the strategy of aggression as the party couldnt any longer depend on the government for its protection.        
	After the Lok Sabha debacle, we have our backs to the wall. CPM workers are demoralised. Theres a need to mobilise our men ahead of the 2011 Assembly polls. So, we need a revival and that justifies our bandh and the call for mass resistance. Offence is the best form of defence. The bandh has to be seen in the light of the immediate political context that is to boost the morale of the cadres given that our party is losing elections. Today, our men were united in making the bandh a success and thats what our intention was, said a CPM state secretariat member.         
	A Citu leader and CPM central committee member was more forthcoming, saying: We have to use these forms of protest because of political reasons. After all, demoralised party workers will have to be enthused and brought back to the streets. We have got to prove that the CPM isnt simply gone.

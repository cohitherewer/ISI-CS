The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Land of milk, honey and Obama prose
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Land of milk, honey and Obama prose
          MANINI CHATTERJEE                          Barack Obama speaks in the Central Hall on Monday. (Reuters)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: With his wife not by his side this time, he did not break into an impromptu jig.         
	And the audience before him, haunted by memories of their unseemly conduct at the same venue nearly 10 years ago, did not mob him for handshakes and autographs. There was no overt we are like this only exuberance at the high-domed, freshly white-washed Central Hall of Parliament this evening.        
	But there was music all right  music to the ears of all those present  as they were treated to a rendition of what seemed like a combination of Sare Jahan Se Achcha, Mera Desh Mahaan and Jai Ho.        
	Except the singer was not some ultra-patriotic desi or nostalgic NRI. He was Barack Hussein Obama aka the most powerful man in the world.        
	Foreign policy wonks will analyse the subtext of every take that was attached to all his fulsome gives and sceptics will scoff at a besieged USs new-found love for India.                     
	But for ordinary Indians  including the majority of those present at Central Hall  who love nothing more than praise from an outsider, Obamas speech was probably the most erudite and evocative paean to India and her nationalist icons than any heard in a long, long time.        
	His 45-minute oration not even the keenest eye could tell he was reading from a prepared text and a discreet teleprompter was there somewhere  was punctuated by 35 rounds of applause. The most thunderous was not when he did a bit of much-awaited Pakistan-bashing or even when he gave a roundabout promise of a permanent UN seat.        
	It came when he spoke about how much Mahatma Gandhi meant to him, adding without flourish: And I am mindful that I might not be standing before you today, as President of the United States, had it not been for Gandhi and the message he shared with America and the world.        
	He did not confine himself to just Gandhi. There were references, both explicit and oblique, to Rabindranath Tagore and Swami Vivekananda, Jawaharlal Nehru and Bhimrao Ambedkar, to the tales of the Panchatantra and to a dictum from the Gita.        
	He did not utter Tagores name but, much to the evident delight of his audience, quoted one of his most famous lines when he said: India not only opened out minds, she expanded our moral imagination. With religious texts that still summon the faithful to lives of dignity and discipline. With poets who imagine a future where the mind is without fear and the head is held high.         
	Although Mamata Banerjee could not be spotted from the galleries, one could imagine her gleaming when Obama chose to quote yet another Bengali hero soon after.         
	Slipping into the eloquence that comes so naturally to him, but without the flashy flamboyance of a Clinton or a Kennedy, the US President said: Instead of succumbing to division, you have shown that the strength of India  the very idea of India  is its embrace of all colours, castes and creeds. Its the diversity represented in this chamber today. Its the richness of faiths, celebrated by a visitor to my hometown of Chicago more than a century ago  the renowned Swami Vivekananda. He said that, holiness, purity and charity are not the exclusive possessions of any church in the world, and that every system has produced men and women of the most exalted character.        
	Nehru was not quoted and neither was his daughter. But their contributions in the making of modern India did not go unnoticed.        
	He referred to the sturdy foundation upon which you have built ever since that stroke of midnight when the tricolour was raised over a free and independent India, borrowing the midnight bit from Indias first Prime Ministers first speech in the same hall over six decades ago.         
	Then, doffing his hat as it were to the post-Independence generation of leaders, he said: And despite the sceptics who said that this country was simply too poor, too vast, too diverse to succeed, you surmounted overwhelming odds and became a model to the world. Instead of slipping into starvation, you launched a Green Revolution that fed millions. Instead of becoming dependent on commodities and exports, you invested in science and technology and in your greatest resource  the Indian people.        
	Much of what he said  knowing that he was being heard by a nationwide audience  was aimed at the Indian people more than at their leaders.        
	Towards the end of his speech, after all the substantive give-and-take points had been made, he returned to the theme of the unique friendship waiting to unfold between the two great democracies whose Constitutions begin with the same revolutionary words  We, the people.        
	Addressing the Indian people, he said: In your lives, you have overcome odds that might have overwhelmed a lesser country. Your parents and grandparents imagined this. Your children and grandchildren will look back on this. But only you  this generation of Indians  can seize the possibility of this moment.        
	He added: As you carry on with the hard work ahead, I want every Indian citizen to know: The United States of America will not simply cheer you from the sidelines. We will be right there with you, shoulder to shoulder.        
	Before the rapturous applause could die down, there was occasion for some more when he invoked another icon: We believe that no matter who you are and where you come from, every person can fulfil their God-given potential, just as a Dalit like Dr Ambedkar could lift himself up and pen the words of the Constitution that protects the rights of all Indians.        
	Stressing on the common humanity that we all share, Obama referred to the lessons from the Panchatantra. And showing that he had done his homework really well, he said, Its the spirit of the inscription seen by all who enter this Great Hall That one is mine and the other a stranger is the concept of little minds. But to the large-hearted, the world itself is their family. He did not attempt the Sanskrit original Vasudeva kutumbakam but everyone smiled at his reference to the Gita.        
	There were a few titters when he tripped on words like Bahoot dhanyavad, Vivekananda, panchayat and panchatantra. But a bit of Chicago twang to our rashtra bhasha did not bother anyone  not after Barack Obama had bewitched us into believing that we were the greatest people on earth.

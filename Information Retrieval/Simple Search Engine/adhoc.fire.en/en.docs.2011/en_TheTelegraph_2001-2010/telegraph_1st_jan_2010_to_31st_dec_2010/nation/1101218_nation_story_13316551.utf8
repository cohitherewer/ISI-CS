The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | A gift and a threat as Telangana clock ticks 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      A gift and a threat as Telangana clock ticks 
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Warangal, Dec. 17: Justice B.N. Srikrishna gifted clocks and K. Chandrasekhar Rao issued a deadline as Andhra Pradesh counts days to December 31 when the committee set up to examine the demand for Telangana state submits its report.        
	After December 31, it will be January 1, governor E.S.L. Narasimhan had said some time ago, trying to calm fears of violence but in the process angering Rao.        
	Dont we know that? the Telangana Rashtra Samiti leader thundered yesterday at a rally in Warangal, 150km from here. It is not correct on the part of the governor to speak like that. It is both arrogance and belittling our sentiments.        
	At the Telangana Mahagarjana rally, Rao issued an ultimatum to the Centre to bring a bill for the formation of the state in the budget session irrespective of what the Justice Srikrishna Committee report says.        
	I am warning the Centre to not test our patience. It will not be good. If the Centre fails to do so, we will launch an indefinite agitation and bring the administration to a standstill, Rao warned.         
	We do not care what the Srikrishna Committee has to say, you must abide by your promise of December 9, 2009.         
	 Justice Srikrishna, who was in Hyderabad yesterday for his last round of meetings with the chief minister, governor and top officials before he submits his report, also met journalists and gifted each one a clock as a memento.         
	 Peace is above party and state, he said, appealing to political parties, students, businesses and employees to give priority to peace.         
	At Warangal a little while later, Rao was threatening an agitation of non-cooperation with the administration in all the 10 Telangana districts if the budget session deadline was not met.         
	Swami Agnivesh and the Jamaat-e-Islami leaders from Delhi attended the Mahagarjana rally that brought normal life to a halt in the town known for his history and its educational institutions. Traffic jams on the highway to Hyderabad were 10km long.         
	The rally was earlier proposed on December 9 to mark the completion of one year of the Centres announcement on Telangana but was put off because of a cyclone threat.         
	Rao, who hit out at the governor for trying to make light of the fears of violence after December 31, was also angry with police chief K. Aravinda Rao.         
	The DGP says he will bring additional forces. Even the city police commissioner has issued orders of no revelry on December 31 night at hotels and roads. All these are aimed to cause panic that heavens will fall if Telangana is given, he said.        
	Fear of violence and disturbances has already brought down real estate prices in Hyderabad by 30 per cent and migrant labour from the non-Telangana regions have gone home well ahead of their annual Sankranti holidays in January. Most films scheduled for a Sankranti release have been brought forward to December. A stuntmens strike ended today and the industry is working three shifts now.        
	The December fever has also hit the Kiran Kumar Reddy government, which wound up the House session in six days.

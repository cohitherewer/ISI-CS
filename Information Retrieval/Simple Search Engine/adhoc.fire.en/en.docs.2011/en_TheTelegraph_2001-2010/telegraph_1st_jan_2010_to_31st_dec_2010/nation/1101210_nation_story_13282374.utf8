The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Question in stone for govt: Is thrower a hero?
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Question in stone for govt: Is thrower a hero?

	Srinagar, Dec. 9: Some of the questions in the ongoing first-year examinations at Kashmir University have betrayed separatist overtones, surprising university officials and students alike.        
	The question paper at yesterdays English examination for commerce students asked candidates to write their opinion on whether a stone-thrower was a hero. Is a stone-pelter a hero? the question went.        
	Another question in todays English paper for arts students, who were asked to translate an Urdu passage, was more forthright.        
	Roughly translated, the passage reads: Kashmir is again up in flames. The red-hot blood of our youth is being spilled like water. Small children are being beaten to death by the police and the army. Bullets are being pumped into the chests of girls and women.        
	People in the cities and villages are shedding tears. But the government is in deep slumber; it seems to have turned deaf, dumb and blind. There is no shortage of leaders but they seem confused. Their programmes are not proving people-friendly. Even our prayers are not being answered.        
	University sources said such questions had never been set in examinations before. It is not that these things are not discussed in classrooms, but setting questions  that too ones so explosive  is altogether different, a teacher said.        
	The questions may prove a major embarrassment for the state government, and officials said chief minister Omar Abdullah had taken note of the matter.        
	The controller of examinations, A.M. Shah, said the university had received a complaint and the matter would be taken up with those who had set the papers. It wasnt clear if the same person had set both papers.        
	In our system, we ask approved paper setters to set a paper. Nobody else can go through these papers so that confidentiality is maintained, Shah said.        
	The question paper is printed outside (the university) and despatched to the examination centres in a sealed cover. But since we have received the complaint, we will refer it to experts and action will be taken if anybody is found guilty (of foul play).        
	Sources said about 25,000 students were appearing in the examinations and that many of them were surprised at the questions. Some were surprised pleasantly.        
	A student of Gandhi Memorial College said: I rushed to answer this question (the translation) because it was close to my heart. It reflected the situation on the ground. I think such questions should be asked not only in our classrooms but everywhere.

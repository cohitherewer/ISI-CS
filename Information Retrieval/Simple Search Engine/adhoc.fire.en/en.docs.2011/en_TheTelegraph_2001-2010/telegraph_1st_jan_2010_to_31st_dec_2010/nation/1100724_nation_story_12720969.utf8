          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ayub being produced in a Hyderabad court on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Hyderabad, July 23: The principal of a private boarding school was arrested today after six students, including a Korean girl, and two women teachers accused him of raping them after clicking them in the nude.        
	The 16-year-old Korean girl, a Class VIII student, is the latest to bring rape charges against the Parkwood International School principal, Mohd Salahuddin Ayub, officers said. The scandal had broken yesterday with a rape complaint from a Class XI girl, and had prompted a mob attack on the school.        
	An officer alleged the principal would find some fault with the students and summon them to his chamber for counselling, serve them spiked drinks, take their nude photos, and then blackmail them into having sex.        
	A police team today arrived at the school, questioned Ayub and took him into custody. He has been charged with rape, criminal intimidation and removal of evidence. The police spoke to the teachers and students for nearly five hours.        
	Yesterday, a mob of over 200 people, including agitated parents and womens activists, had barged into the 10-acre school compound and partially damaged the school building. Several parents took their children home.        
	Assistant commissioner of police K. Sudhakar said one of the students had alleged being victimised by Ayub since March. We have some evidence she terminated her pregnancy because of Ayub. However, we are waiting for medical reports, he said.        
	State school education minister Manikya Varaprasada Rao has ordered a probe. The state government is planning to request the CBSE to cancel the schools affiliation, the minister said.

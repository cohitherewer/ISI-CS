The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Scam-bitten BJP stays off Bangalore

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AND J.P. YADAV                                          Sushma Swaraj, LK Advani and Sharad Yadav at the joint media conference in New Delhi on Tuesday.   Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha       
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: The BJP has dropped Bangalore from a long list of venues for the NDAs Bhrastachar Virodhi Mahasangram rallies that will start from the capital on December 22.        
	Sources said the exclusion of the Karnataka capital from the anti-corruption crusade itinerary was because of the embarrassment the BJP continues to suffer on account of the alleged land scams that have implicated chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, his family and some cabinet colleagues.        
	Although Yeddyurappa has tried to embroider his moves as serious action taken, the Lokayukta objected to the parallel probe he instituted into the dealings because the ombudsman was already looking into them and saw the decision as undermining his authority.        
	Today, the Janata Dal (Secular) moved Karnataka High Court to order the government to quash the appointment of the inquiry commission.        
	Asked why Bangalore had been excluded, a BJP source said: We were unable to find a suitable date.         
	Sources in its ally, the Janata Dal (United), however, had a different explanation. I also asked the leaders for the absence of the city, a source said. They admitted they were scared because the crowds might boo the speakers when they waxed moralistic on corruption.        
	Sources in Dal (United) said party president Sharad Yadav had recently told BJP leaders to act against Yeddyurappa.        
	Yeddyurappa issue is turning out to be a big thorn in our campaign against corruption. The BJP should take some credible steps in Karnataka otherwise we will lose the moral right to attack the Congress, said a Dal (U) leader after a media conference jointly addressed by BJP and NDA representatives.        
	Dal (U) leaders said persisting with Yeddyurappa was a key reason behind the NDAs failure to attract more allies to join them in their bid to take on the UPA in a big way.        
	Asked about the alleged land scam, BJP veteran L.K. Advani said: The party has taken cognisance of the matter and will deal with it effectively.         
	Pressed on whether Yeddyurappas continuance had impacted the BJPs credibility to fight corruption, he retorted: I am concerned with our credibility more than you are.        
	Admitting that Karnataka was still a monkey on our backs, a leader said a final call on the chief minister would depend on how the BJP fared in the panchayat polls that get going this month.         
	If we win them, it will reinforce Yeddyurappas claim that hes the best poll manager we have in Karnataka. If we lose, the script will have to be redone, the leader said.        
	Karnataka apart, the BJP had to contend with the reality that there were no takers for the NDA as of now. Queried on why the NDA was unable to expand on the corruption plank, Advani said: We are in touch with Jayalalithaa. I can tell you from experience that so many factors affect so many parties. But on corruption we hope to get the maximum support. That might take time.        
	A source close to NDA convener and Dal (United) president Sharad Yadav said the non-UPA parties he had approached politely declined to share space with the BJP. He was told if it was only his party, theyd have no problems. But thats not possible because the Dals alliance with the BJP is pukka, the source said.        
	Also, Yadavs belief that it was for the BJP to broach and seal new political alliances because the Dal (United) had little or no stake in those states where prospective partners were strong: the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) in Assam, the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in Orissa and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) in Haryana.        
	The INLD was ready to team up with us in our rallies. But Yadav told them, first deal with the BJP and have a rapprochement. Otherwise you will look like a fair-weather friend and the NDAs credibility will come under a cloud, a Dal (United) source said.

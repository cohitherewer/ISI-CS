          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, June 23: The Mumbai Railway Recruitment Board chairman, suspended over the job scam, has said he is only a small fry in a claim made to CBI sleuths who formally arrested him and another official today.        
	I am only a small fry. There were bigger fishes, S.M. Sharma is said to have told the sleuths during a 36-hour grilling at Hyderabad since Monday, when he was brought from Mumbai after being detained there last week.         
	The other officer held was G. Sethi, senior divisional personnel officer of the Raipur-headquartered South East Central Railway. The duo have been brought to Hyderabad as the scams arrested kingpin, A.K. Jagannatham, is from the city.        
	Sharma, picked by railway minister Mamata Banerjee last year to help clean up the recruitment system, said he had thought Jagannatham was powerful. I was given to understand by Jagannatham that several Union ministers and MPs were supporting him and that nothing could go wrong, a CBI source quoted Sharma as saying.        
	During the interrogation, Sharma, whose son Vivek is also in custody for having sold question papers, was given medical assistance twice because of his blood-pressure and heart problems. A CBI team of six started the grilling on Monday after the Railway Board cleared his arrest.        
	CBI sources said that Sharma had confessed to his crime and told the sleuths he was lured by the easy money promised by Jagannatham and his associates. He (Sharma) has also agreed to reveal the names of the accomplices who are in railway service now and those who have retired or left, the source said.        
	V.V. Lakshmi Narayana, the DIG of the CBIs Hyderabad zone, said the agency would seek the custody of Sharma and Sethi from the court tomorrow. The DIG said the other eight accused  including Jagannatham, his son Srujan and Sharmas son Vivek  were remanded in the agencys custody for three days this morning.        
	The sleuths now believe the scam had spread its tentacles to nearly 14 of the 21 railway recruitment boards (RRBs) in the country. We initially thought only four or five RRBs were involved. We are now looking into the recruitments by all these RRBs over the past decade or so, said another officer.        
	Recruitment affected        
	Railway Board chairman Vivek Sahay said today the scam had hit recruitment all over the country. We have two lakh vacancies, of which the recruitment process is now on for 40,000 jobs, Sahay said.        
	He added that if the vacancies werent filled, it would affect the movement of food grain in the country.        
	According to a board spokesperson, the scandal could affect nearly 5,000 job aspirants.

	Hyderabad, June 11: His stint with films didnt take him very far. And his stunts in real life have landed him in jail with broken limbs.        
	V. Venkata Narayana alias Raghunath Reddy, a failed film director, is now in judicial rem and after a burglary attempt went wrong. Caught in the act, he jumped from a second-floor balcony and broke his legs.        
	Bitten by the film bug, the 36-year-old from Kadapa district had come to Hyderabad in the hope of making name and some easy money. He rose fast. In just four years, he worked his way up from a production assistant to an assistant director. He also got to direct a film, which was released in February. But Jallu (Drops) bombed.        
	Subhas Chandra Bose, sub-inspector of Kukatpally police station, said the financially broken director took to thefts and burgling houses, targeting mostly working couples.        
	For a few months he had an easy run. But his luck didnt last long.        
	A few weeks ago, the couple whose apartment he had targeted surprised him. The couple hadnt gone to office as he had thought. They had gone to attend a programme in another apartment in the same complex.        
	A desperate Reddy jumped from the second-floor balcony and suffered five fractures  three in the right leg and two in the left. Police later shifted him to hospital.               
	Discharged after a months treatment, he was sent to judicial remand.        
	Police said Reddy had admitted to burgling several houses. He has confessed to breaking into 22 houses in different parts of Hyderabad, sub-inspector Bose said.

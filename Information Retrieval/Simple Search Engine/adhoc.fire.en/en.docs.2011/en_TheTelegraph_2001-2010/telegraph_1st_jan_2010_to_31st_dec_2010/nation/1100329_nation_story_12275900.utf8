	Cuttack, March 28: Utkal Vidyarthi Abhijan, a city-based socio-cultural organisation, has sought the Orissa High Courts intervention in preserving the Abhada Bhog, the prasad at Jagannath Temple in Puri, huge quantities of which is wasted in case of disruption of rituals.        
	The petition, perhaps the first of its kind, is expected to be admitted as a public interest litigation and taken up for hearing only after receipt of responses from the chief administrator of the Puri temple.         
	The petition was filed by Nishikanta Mishra, the secretary of Utkal Vidyarthi Abhijan, on Friday.        
	The petitioner has approached the court, seeking directions to the temple administration to not throw away the bhog in case of disturbance in rituals and instead made available for the people as usual.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jairam gifts Cong a chance for manoeuvres

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Chidambaram, Jairam                          
	New Delhi, May 12: A chastened Jairam Ramesh today called on P. Chidambaram to explain his controversial China comments, prompting some in the Congress to wonder if the environment minister was in real trouble.         
	Although Jairam refused to speak to reporters after the 15-minute meeting at the home ministers North Block office, sources said he neither offered an apology, nor expressed regret.        
	He only explained that he hadnt criticised the governments policies and the remarks had been made in an off-the-record informal conversation and were presented out of context, the sources said.        
	Jairam had said the home ministrys policy on Chinese companies was paranoid and alarmist, referring to the ministrys reservations about allowing import and installation of equipment from Huawei and other telecom companies on the ground that it could pose a security threat.        
	The meeting took place after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh asked Jairam to meet Chidambaram, who had written a strong letter to the Prime Minister in protest. Home secretary G.K. Pillai, too, had confronted suggestions that the ministrys attitude to China was alarmist.         
	The Congress, too, was quick to rebuke Jairam as many in the party felt he had breached protocol by making such an observation while on a foreign trip, fully aware that relations with China were delicate.        
	But the partys response was restrained as Jairam is said to be close to party chief Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.         
	However, the minister has made many enemies with his brusque ways and independent views and his detractors in the party have started murmuring about his Rajya Sabha membership, which ends on June 21.        
	Many Congress leaders also feel that his political stature does not justify his sudden rise and even see merit in the outcry against his re-nomination to the Rajya Sabha from Andhra Pradesh.         
	Although even his opponents believe Sonia would ultimately retain him in Parliament and protect his ministerial berth, too, they are not averse to adding fuel to the fire by talking about the opposition to his candidature among Andhra Congress leaders.        
	Five Congress members from Andhra are retiring in June but the party is in a position to win only four this time, intensifying the competition among aspirants.         
	Some MLAs and leaders have written letters and sent fax messages to the high command demanding all four seats for local leaders.        
	The emotional divide over Telangana between leaders from the region and those from the rest of the state has thrown up a new factor: the two groups from the state now ask for distributing tickets equally among the two.        
	Big players and moneybags are getting involved and they want to send their representatives to the Rajya Sabha. They have engineered this campaign against Jairam, said a leader.         
	Accommodating Jairam from any other state would be equally difficult as there are too many contenders, including commerce minister Anand Sharma.        
	Most senior leaders believe Jairam will have to be brought from Andhra itself as the campaign against him is artificial.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sandalwood trail to China
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sandalwood trail to China
          MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR amp; PTI                          Sandalwood seized near the China-Himachal border                                  
	Shimla, Sept. 9: Two ITBP officers have been arrested for alleged collusion with smugglers of red sandalwood in a Himachal Pradesh pocket along the China border fast becoming a safe haven for such crimes.        
	Assistant commander Sukhdev Singh Rana and inspector Manmohan Singh were picked up on Tuesday after police in Lahaul and Spiti district grilled two persons caught with a sandalwood consignment headed to China on August 24.        
	So far, we have arrested six people in the case. Two of them are Sukhdev Singh Rana (posted at the ITBP Samdo post) and Manmohan Singh, an inspector, Lahaul and Spiti superintendent of police S.R. Rana said. The officer duo had allegedly allowed two trucks loaded with the rare wood to roll across the border.        
	The ITBP top brass in Delhi have taken a serious view of the incident as it is the first time that its officers have been arrested on such criminal charges. The force has decided to take strict disciplinary action against the duo.        
	The headquarters is keeping track of the case. Strict action will be taken after both the police investigation and an inquiry by the force are completed, ITBP spokesperson Deepak Pandey said in Delhi yesterday. The officers have been booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act and for forgery under the CrPC.        
	The gang is also suspected to have spirited out leopard skin, the demand for which is high in China, the misgivings stoked by the fact that one of the accused is a known smuggler of such hides. The police claim not to have found proof of that but Wildlife Crime Control Bureau sources said they were gathering proof.        
	So far, we have not found any evidence of leopard skin smuggling but the investigation is still on, police chief Rana said. A hunt is on for the kingpins  identified as local resident Narender and Raju from Haryana.

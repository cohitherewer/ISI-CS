          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Jan. 12: A Hizb-ul Mujahideen commander allegedly involved in the murder of a 20-year-old girl that had led to massive protests was gunned down by security forces today even as the defence minister arrived in the state on a stock-taking trip.        
	A.K. Antony, army chief Deepak Kapoor and defence secretary Pradeep Kumar landed in Jammu, a day after a BSF jawan died in firing by Pakistani troops along the Line of Control in Poonch and an infiltration bid was foiled along the border.        
	Police sources said Riyaz Ahmad Dedwa, Hizb district commander for Pulwama, was killed in an encounter at Abhama village in south Kashmir.        
	It is a big achievement. He was involved in the killing of Sheeraza and other civilians like Nazir Ahmad Chopan, Mohammad Yousuf Wagay and a two-year-old boy in the Shopian-Pulwama belt last year, Pulwama police chief Kifayat Hyder said.        
	Sheeraza was killed at Kellar, Shopian, and her death had led to a public uproar.        
	The police said they launched a cordon-and-search operation after a tip-off about the presence of a militant in Abhama. We evacuated the residents and then asked the militant to surrender. He refused and at 5.30am he came out firing at us. In the retaliatory action, he was gunned down, Hyder said.        
	Antony, Kapoor and Kumar flew in from Delhi in an IAF plane this morning and straightaway left for the Unified Command headquarters for a meeting at chief minister Omar Abdullahs residence.        
	Sources said Antony blamed Pakistan for the spurt in infiltration attempts and said it was aimed at stoking trouble in the state after months of relative peace.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ayodhya worry for Games
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ayodhya worry for Games
  - Verdict spillover fears prompt put-off plea to Lucknow bench        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Sadhus on an Ayodhya street. (File picture)                                
	Lucknow, Sept. 14: Three petitions were today handed over to the officer on special duty in Allahabad High Court, pleading for postponement of the Ayodhya title suit verdict ten days before it is due on September 24.        
	The petitioners have cited possible communal and social unrest ahead of next months Commonwealth Games as the reason for their plea to put off the verdict and urged the Lucknow bench to initiate a fresh reconciliation process or have the dispute settled out of court.        
	The three-judge bench of Justice D.V. Sharma, Justice Sudhir Agarwal and Justice S.U. Khan will decide on the admissibility of the petitions on Friday. Security has been stepped up outside courtroom No. 21, with 10 gun-toting personnel standing guard, metal detectors and scanners.        
	Advocates involved with the case said the petitions did not have the legal teeth to make a case for deferment. Neither did they make concrete suggestions on how to start a new mediation process, nor did they adequately explain why the Games should be given precedence over the verdict, they said.        
	Ajai Pandey, a senior advocate appearing for the Ayodhya Nyas, said the court had already asked for reconciliation initiatives under Section 89 of Civil Procedure Code and exhausted the process on July 27.        
	The first petition, filed by Ramesh Chandra Tripathi, a defendant in the case, said: Thousands of foreign visitors are expected in the country in October. The law and order situation may become volatile once the verdict is passed and this may spill over to the Games.        
	Co-petitioner Prashant Chandra, an advocate not connected with the case, said the fallout of the judgment could jeopardise the image of the country during the Games.        
	However, an advocate said the petitioners should have moved earlier if they sensed such a scare. Besides, law and order is not the concern of the court. It is the responsibility of the state.        
	The second petitioner, Sunderlal Jain, pleaded that a fresh move be made to initiate a reconciliatory process. It should be started again, the senior citizen said. But most advocates said his petition was too lame to be admitted in court.        
	The third petitioner, Sudesh Gupta, and six other civilians urged the court to depute two judges for an out-of-court mediation on the dispute.        
	Mediation on what? Who is willing to accept this mediation formula? It was tried way back in the nineties but there were no takers. It was tried recently also, argued senior advocate Jaffar Yub Jilani, who appears for the Sunni Central Waqf Board.

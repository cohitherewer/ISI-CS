The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Progress but not enough

	New Delhi, May 10: India has reduced childhood deaths significantly over the past decade but the current pace of progress is unlikely to achieve its goal set for 2015, World Health Organisation statistics released today indicate.        
	The World Health Statistics 2010 has also captured the health inequities that plague the nation  in births, in immunisation, in childhood mortality  despite more public investment in health and a burgeoning health care industry.         
	Indias under five child-mortality figures declined from 116 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 94 in 2000, to 69 in 2008. But under the millennium development goals (MDG) adopted by the 192 member countries of the UN, Indias target is below 40 by 2015.         
	The pace has accelerated after 2000, but India needs to do even more, said Ties Moerma, director of WHOs department of health statistics.         
	The new report has shown that worldwide deaths among children under five has dropped by 30 per cent, from 12.5 million in 1990 to 8.8 million in 2008. But this progress masks inequalities between countries and regions.         
	Nine countries in Africa and 29 outside Africa are on course to meet the MDG target for reducing malaria, but in 2008, an estimated 243 million cases of malaria caused 863,000 deaths, mostly in children below five years, the report said.        
	The MDG goal on malaria involves halting and reversing the incidence of this parasitic infection by 2015.         
	India is among countries that has experienced a decline (in malaria), but it is not sufficient to be in (this) group of 29 (non-African) countries on course to meet the MDG goals, Moerma told The Telegraph in an interview.         
	Indias health inequities are also quite substantial, Moerma said.         
	The childhood mortality is 34 per 1,000 live births among the best-off, or the wealthiest, 20 per cent of Indias population. This group is already past the MDG goal, Moerma said. But childhood mortality is 101 among the poorest 20 per cent.         
	While 85 per cent of the best-off 20 per cent children have been immunised against measles at one year of age, only 40 per cent of the poorest 20 per cent children get the vaccine.         
	But the report has revealed some striking improvements in some health-related MDG goals worldwide  the proportion of underweight children has declined from 25 per cent in 1990 to 16 per cent in 2008. HIV infections have dropped by 16 per cent from 2001 to 2008. The worlds population with access to safe drinking water has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.         
	Sections of health activists have pointed out that health inequities have increased in India despite the increased public spending on health and a growing private health care sector.

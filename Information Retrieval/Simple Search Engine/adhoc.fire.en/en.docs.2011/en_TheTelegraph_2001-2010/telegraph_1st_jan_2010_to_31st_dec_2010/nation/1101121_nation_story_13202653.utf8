The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong regrets, BJP rants
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong regrets, BJP rants
          OUR BUREAU                          A Raja                                  
	Nov. 20: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said his offer to discuss in Parliament the CAG report on the telecom scam was rejected by the Opposition and ruled out a joint parliamentary committee probe into it.        
	I offered that the CAG report be discussed on the floor of Parliament before going to public accounts committee. But it has not been accepted. Parliament is for debate and discussion and not disruption, he said.         
	Its very unfortunate that not a single session of the 14th and 15th Lok Sabha has gone without disruption. I hope Parliament will be allowed to function next week, he told an Indian Tea Association meeting in Calcutta.        
	In New Delhi, though, the BJP said it would not rest until former telecom minister A. Raja was interrogated, arrested and prosecuted, but the party sought to justify the continuance of Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, who heads the partys first government down south.        
	The party said Yeddyurappa, accused of freeing government land to favour his kin, had begun his clean-up act by ordering a judicial probe into the allegations and getting his family to surrender the land they had acquired.        
	BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said the Congresss orchestrated praise of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh could not wash away the stain of inaction and indifference and that the nation was entitled to draw its own conclusion.        
	It is a glaring case where the PM is patently involved in the conspiracy of silence, culpability of inaction and guilt of gross indifference when the nations wealth was being plundered right under his nose by massive abuse of the system... Prasad said. Yet, the head of the government looked the other way.         
	Responding to Singhs appeal to the Opposition to allow Parliament to function, Prasad said: Mr PM, you want debate, the BJP wants action.        
	A joint parliamentary committee, he insisted, was the only instrument to ensure that the alleged beneficiaries of the 2G spectrum controversy are brought to book.        
	Yesterday, Mukherjee had appealed to the Opposition parties to return to the House as the public accounts committee that will study the CAG report was akin to a joint parliamentary committee.         
	Today, the finance minister spoke on other scandals that has rocked the Congress in recent months. On the Commonwealth Games probe, he said number of investigating agencies were at work. He brushed aside the possibility of a debate in Parliament on the Adarsh housing society scam.

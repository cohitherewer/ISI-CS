          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Nov. 9: Bodo militants have shot dead 22 people across Assam since yesterday to avenge the killing of a suspected cadre, and threatened to target more and more Indians if the security forces continued murdering innocent Bodos.        
	Dispur has reacted by shuffling the police brass and speaking of a possible joint operation in the forests of Arunachal Pradesh from where the rebels are believed to be operating.        
	The National Democratic Front of Borolands anti-talks faction, which last week threatened to kill 20 Indians for every member slain in fake encounters, gunned down 16 people by last evening, four in the night and two today in stray attacks.        
	The killings stretched across six districts  Sonitpur, Baksa, Karbi Anglong, Udalguri, Chirang and Kokrajhar  with many of yesterdays victims being Bihari migrants.        
	The Hindustani Purbottor Sammelan, an association of Hindi-speaking migrants with offices across Assam, has called a state-wide bandh tomorrow, supported by the Opposition Asom Gana Parishad and the BJP.        
	State cabinet minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said: They (the rebels) sneak into the dense forests of Arunachal after (killing) in Assam. We are thinking of an integrated operation in Arunachal jointly with that states government.        
	This evening, the Assam government replaced the inspector-general (northern range) and the police chiefs of Sonitpur and Udalguri, and appointed a new additional director-general (law and order).        
	Brutality        
	The killings have been marked by brutality, the police said. Schoolteacher J.K. Mishra, who lost a leg a few years ago, was dragged out of a bus at Boimara yesterday and lined up with six other passengers before being shot.        
	His crutch lying somewhere in the bus, the 40-year-old Mishra balanced himself precariously on one leg while the militants pumped five bullets into him, officers said.        
	Vegetable seller Mali Mondal, mother of a five-year-old, was answering natures call near her home in Dhekiajuli when she heard motorcycles. She shone her torch on the riders, who riddled her with bullets, the police said.        
	Senior rebel leader B. Fotpangsa today claimed that Maheswar Basumatary  the man whose killing by the security forces in Mondays early hours has provoked the revenge spree  was a simple farmer and not a cadre. He alleged a fake encounter.        
	An army officer insisted that Basumatary was very much a rebel and that the outfit would not have gone berserk if he was not one of their own.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 24: Prakash Karat today told a CPM state committee meeting that the agitation against the Congress-led UPA governments neo-liberal policies would have to be intensified.        
	Karats comments come at a time the Bengal unit of the party is advocating a soft approach towards the Congress to unsettle its alliance with the Trinamul Congress before next years Assembly elections.        
	Our party will have to step up its agitation against the Centre-sponsored fuel price hike and the issue of food inflation. Theres also the need to raise this issue in Parliament and demand a rollback in petro prices. These programmes will have to be doggedly implemented, a CPM leader quoted Karat as saying at todays meeting.

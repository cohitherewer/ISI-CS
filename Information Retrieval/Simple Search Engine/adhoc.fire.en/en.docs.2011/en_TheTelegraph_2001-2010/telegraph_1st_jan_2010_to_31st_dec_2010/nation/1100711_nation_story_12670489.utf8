  - Moderate Mirwaiz asks Islamabad to raise Kashmir violations in talks with Delhi         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cleric Ghulam Hassan Banday displays a relic believed to be of Prophet Mohammed on the occasion of Shab-e-Meraj at the Hazratbal shrine in Srinagar on Saturday. (PTI)                                        
	Srinagar, July 10: The separatist Hurriyat Conference today asked Pakistan to use its influence to end human rights abuses in Kashmir, in remarks likely to ruffle Delhis feathers.        
	The first thing Pakistan should take up with India during the forthcoming foreign ministers meeting in Islamabad is the recent killings in Kashmir, moderate Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq told reporters.        
	The Mirwaizs remarks will boost Pakistans position during next weeks talks when Islamabad is expected to use the rights abuses in Kashmir to counter Indias pressure on the Mumbai attacks.        
	Delhi, which opposes any intervention by Pakistan in Kashmir, will be particularly miffed because the statement came from a moderate separatist who has held three rounds of talks with the Centre.        
	Curfew was re-imposed in large parts of Kashmir today after violence broke out, leading to a lacklustre Meraj Alam festival at the Hazratbal shrine despite relaxation of restrictions in many parts of Srinagar.         
	The police used force as hundreds of protesters advanced towards Hazratbal, leading to clashes near the shrine.        
	However, the Mirwaiz was allowed to lead a several thousand-strong pro-independence procession in Srinagar and later, to stage a sit-in.                  Mirwaiz Umar Farooq      
	He asked Delhi to remove all security bunkers and camps from inhabited areas in the state. He also demanded that the Centre release all prisoners and punish the security personnel responsible for the killing of 15 youths during the past month of protests.        
	The Mirwaiz had recently launched a programme of marches to highlight the Kashmir dispute and protest against rights abuses.        
	Although the government relaxed curfew in many parts of Srinagar because of the Meraj festival, the tense situation restricted the flow of devotees to the shrine. The afternoon prayers passed peacefully but the congregation was small at the shrine, which usually attracts lakhs of devotees every year on the occasion.        
	Later, when hundreds of protesters advanced towards the shrine in a procession, the authorities stopped them around 100 metres away and used tear gas canisters when they refused to disperse.        
	The breather in the curfew allowed journalists to voice their anger at the recent curbs on their movements that has prompted local newspapers to stop publishing for the past three days. There will be no editions tomorrow, either.        
	Scores of journalists, wearing black badges, staged a sit-in at the Press Enclave.        
	Five media bodies  the Kashmir Press Association, Press Guild of Kashmir, Kashmir Journalists Corps, Kashmir Press Photographers Association and the Kashmir Video Journalists Association  met and decided not to resume publishing newspapers until concrete steps were taken to restore complete freedom of the media.        
	Issues confronting the media fraternity were discussed in detail, particularly the brazen action against a television channel, the resolution said.        
	The meeting condemned the restrictions on the media and expressed deep anguish over the unashamed approach of the government, which has not shown any respect for the media as an important institution.

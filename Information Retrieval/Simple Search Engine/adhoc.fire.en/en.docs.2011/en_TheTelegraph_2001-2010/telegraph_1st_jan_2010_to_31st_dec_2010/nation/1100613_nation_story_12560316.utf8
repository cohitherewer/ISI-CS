                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      How to tame stones: call em pro-India 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                           A man throws stones at policemen during a funeral procession in Baramulla on May 29                                  
	Srinagar, June 12: A pro-India label by the separatists is all it took to do what months of crackdown couldnt  get the stone-throwing brigade of Baramulla to declare truce.        
	The stone squads have waved the white flag in their near-daily battle with troops after Hurriyat hardliners said some of the youths creating the mischief were backed by government agencies and had been identified.         
	The remark left youths in the town fuming. The result: there was no stone throwing yesterday for the first time in months.        
	The truce in Baramulla unfolded even as Srinagar remained on the edge for the second day today over the death of a teenager in an alleged police firing yesterday.         
	Thousands defied curfew-like curbs to throng his funeral.        
	In Baramulla, the nerve centre of protests in north Kashmir, stone-throwers  a motley band of youths with faces half covered  called newspersons yesterday to inform them they wouldnt throw stones anymore.        
	We are not agents of anyone but would throw stones as it is a form of resistance. We have faced strong action from the government. But even the Hurriyat is now backing out and passing unworthy remarks against us. We will boycott all programmes of the Hurriyat. We only ask the government to release the arrested youths, one of the masked protesters said.        
	The police, who have struggled to contain the protests that have even claimed the lives of some innocent citizens, appeared relieved. Baramulla SP Sheikh Mehmood dubbed the truce a welcome development. Better sense has prevailed on these youths. We otherwise have nothing against them, he said.        
	But another officer had doubts. These youths are apparently angry with the Hurriyat now but it (stone-throwing) can return anytime. If the trend (of not creating such trouble) continues, it would be good, he said.         
	Hurriyat spokesperson Ayaz Akbar, explaining the outfits denunciation of the stone-throwers, said it was necessary to enforce discipline.        
	If the youths in Baramulla have said anything of that sort (criticising us), it is unfortunate. What we want is that there should be a hartal without a call so government agencies do not succeed in their designs (to foil the protests), Akbar said.        
	Unlike Baramulla, Srinagar remained paralysed today to protest the death of Tufail Ahmad, the 17-year-old who died after being hit by a blunt object. Residents claimed it was a police bullet but the cops denied having opened fire.         
	Thousands participated in Tufails funeral, chanting freedom slogans as they marched with the cortege. A strike had been called in Srinagar elsewhere in Kashmir to protest the death.         
	The Hurriyat spokesperson said hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani was taken into custody after he tried to lead the protests.

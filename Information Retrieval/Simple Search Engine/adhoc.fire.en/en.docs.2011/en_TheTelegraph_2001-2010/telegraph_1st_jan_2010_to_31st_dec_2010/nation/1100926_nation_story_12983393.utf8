	Jamshedpur/Rourkela, Sept. 25: Two police jawans and four Maoists were killed today in two encounters deep inside Saranda forest at West Singhbhum in Jharkhand. One CRPF officer was injured.        
	Two police teams left for Tirilposi and Ratamati, about 60km from Chaibasa, this morning following intelligence inputs about the presence of a large number of Maoists in the area. Jawans of the CRPF, special anti-Naxalite Cobra personnel and Jharkhand Jaguars and the local police were part of the teams.         
	While the men from the CRPF, district police and the Jharkhand Jaguars took position at Tirilposi, the Cobra jawans went to Ratamati, about 7km away.        
	CRPF deputy inspector-general Bhanu Pratap Singh said the raid started at 4pm at Ratamati, and an hour later at Tirilposi. The encounter was fierce and lasted over an hour at both places, he said.        
	We have found two bodies. The forces are still there in the forest and the search for more bodies is on, Singh said.         
	Two district armed police jawans  Rajiv Ranjan and Jehangir Khan  and CRPF assistant commandant Nitish Kumar were rushed to Rourkela Steel Plant Hospital with severe injuries. Ranjan and Khan, who suffered shoulder and abdominal injuries, died in hospital. Kumar, 25, who is from Jamshedpur, has taken a bullet in his head.        
	Singh, who monitored the operation from Kiriburu on the border with Orissa along with the deputy inspector-general, Kolhan, Navin Kumar Singh, said the police busted a Maoist training camp at Ratamati. Utensils, literature, tarpaulin, medicines have been found, he said.        
	The CRPF official denied initial reports that some policemen were abducted and said that they engaged a number of personnel keeping in mind the large Maoist presence in the area.

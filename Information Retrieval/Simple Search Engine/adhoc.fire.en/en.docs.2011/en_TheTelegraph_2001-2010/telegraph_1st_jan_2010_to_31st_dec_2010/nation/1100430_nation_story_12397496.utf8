The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Finance bill sails through rivals cracks
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Finance bill sails through rivals cracks
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Pranab Mukherjee speaks in the Lok Sabha on Thursday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, April 29: The BJP and the Janata Dal (United) walked out. The Left, wary of being bracketed with the communal forces, waited and went out separately. The Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal stayed back, but sheepishly proclaimed they werent voting with the government. The Biju Janata Dal remained silent.        
	On the first row of the treasury benches, Sonia Gandhi and Pranab Mukherjee chuckled to themselves.        
	The finance bill was passed easily in the Lok Sabha today, leaving the Opposition in tatters.         
	There had been doubts about its passage after the Opposition unity balloon floated on the political horizon following finance minister Mukherjees proposal to hike duties on petroleum products and raise prices.        
	Outside Parliament, not only the BJP-led NDA, but even the RJD and the Samjawadis posed for cameras, reigniting debates about the rebirth of anti-Congressism. But the events inside presented a different picture.        
	The cracks in the new-found Opposition unity had developed in the other House, the Rajya Sabha, when the womens reservation bill was bulldozed by the government with the support of the BJP and the Left.         
	The finance bill accentuated the faultlines, though it required the Congress to demonstrate its famed manipulative skills.         
	The entire exercise was done under the supervision of the veteran Mukherjee who, as the finance minister and the main trouble-shooter of the Congress, had his prestige at stake.         
	Mukherjee could have handled the job with greater ease had the IPL bomb not exploded in the midst of a muddled political scenario.         
	Sonia wanted the overburdened little master to shoulder another burden of dousing the IPL fire before he went on to address his primary financial concerns. Top Congress sources said the party was hugely impressed by Mukherjees matured handling of the crisis and his political stock has zoomed in the past two weeks.         
	The IPL had united the Opposition again and threatened to break up the ruling combine as UPA constituent NCP came under a cloud. But Mukherjee got the investigative agencies under his department to gather enough ammunition quickly to silence main rival BJP and shifted the focus away from the Congress by suggesting to Sonia that Shashi Tharoors continuance in the government would be untenable.        
	The Congress leadership then used NCP boss Sharad Pawar to push through a regime change in the IPL. Soon after, the task of floor management for defeating cut motions began, and the first major breakthrough came when the BSP voted for the government.        
	The Congress didnt stop at that. It sprung another surprise by winning over the Samajwadis and the RJD which, much like the manipulations done at the time of the nuclear deal, left CPM boss Prakash Karat stunned.        
	Sources said the PMO wanted to put off the passage of the finance bill till Friday to ensure the Prime Minister  now at the Saarc summit in Bhutan  was present. But Mukherjee wanted to get it over quickly. He did that this evening itself  with Sonia thumping the desk at regular intervals.

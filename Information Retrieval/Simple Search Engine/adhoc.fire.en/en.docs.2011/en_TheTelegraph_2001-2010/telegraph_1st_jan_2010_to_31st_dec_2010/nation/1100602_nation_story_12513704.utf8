	Bhubaneswar, June 1: The chariots of the gods have run into mortal resentment.        
	Discontent is brewing among carpenters engaged in making the giant wooden chariots of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra for next months rath yatra in Puri over poor incentives.        
	The carpenters have threatened to stop work if the Sri Jagannath temple administration does not agree to increase their daily payment by June 4, the deadline they have set before shrine officials.         
	We are paid a meagre Rs 132 per day, hardly enough in these times of price rise. We want the incentive to be hiked to Rs 200 per day, carpenter Bijay Mohapatra told The Telegraph.        
	We have given a letter to the temple administration highlighting our demand. The carpenters will stop working from June 5 if officials ignore the demand, Mohapatra added.         
	The rath yatra is scheduled to be held on July 13 and work on the chariots for the nine-day yearly festival started on Akshaya Tritiya on May 16.         
	Every year, the shrine administration engages seventy-five carpenters to make the chariots. The carpenters toil round the clock for nearly 60 days to make the iconic chariots for the presiding sibling deities of the 12th-century Jagannath temple.         
	While the height of Jagannaths chariot is 45.6ft, the chariots of Balabhadra and Subhadra are 45ft and 44.6ft tall.        
	For 58 days, we devote ourselves to making the chariots. The rest of the year we work at different places and easily earn nearly Rs 200 a day, said Bhagaban Maharana, another carpenter.         
	The temples public relations officer, Laxmidhar Pujapanda, said the shrine administration had hiked the incentive to Rs 132 a day from Rs 120 a day. Besides, the carpenters will get more as prize money after the rath yatra this year. They will receive nearly Rs 30,000 in prize money against the Rs 24,000 last year.        
	However, Pujapanda said, the temple administration was always ready to hold discussions with the carpenters to sort out the issue.

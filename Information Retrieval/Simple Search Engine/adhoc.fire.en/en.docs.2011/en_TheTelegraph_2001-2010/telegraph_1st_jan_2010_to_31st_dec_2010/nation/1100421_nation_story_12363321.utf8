The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Krishna, Kaur on sticky wicket
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Krishna, Kaur on sticky wicket
          ARCHIS MOHAN                                                      Krishna and Kaur      
	New Delhi, April 20: The departure of Shashi Tharoor has given the Prime Minister an opportunity to consider a wider shake-up during an expected ministry shuffle in June, sources said today.        
	Unless dramatic changes set in during the intervening days, both external affairs minister S.M. Krishna and his junior Preneet Kaur are likely to be replaced, the sources said. The two ministers are expected to be allocated less sensitive portfolios.        
	The sources pointed out that axing Tharoor as junior minister was a political necessity. However, in Krishna and Kaurs case, the issue is of non-performance.        
	The Prime Minister is said to be particularly unhappy with Krishnas nearly year-long stint at the ministry. The planned overhaul will bring in a younger and efficient minister, the sources added.        
	The sources said apart from his lack of alertness on policy issues, Krishna was not in tune with the Prime Ministers foreign policy vision.        
	Krishnas failure to walk the fine line has been exposed several times, most recently at the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington. Late last month, Krishna had gone on record to oppose the US offering Pakistan a nuclear deal similar to the US-Indian deal.        
	In contrast to Krishnas statement, the Prime Minister said last week in the US that such a nuclear deal was a bilateral issue between Islamabad and Washington.        
	The former Karnataka chief minister was also perceived to have played to the media with his sharp public statements during attacks on Indians in Australia. Krishna was later made to tone down his rhetoric.        
	However, Krishnas perceived weaknesses have a flip side, too: they have helped the PMO to virtually run the foreign policy establishment.        
	The PMO and national security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon call the shots now. All important decisions like the one to restart the India-Pakistan foreign secretary talks are taken by the PMO with Krishna being made aware of the developments later, the sources said.        
	In case Krishna survives, the PMO and Menon will continue to hold the whip hand on foreign policy.        
	Krishnas lack of alertness was on display today in Parliament. BJPs Murli Manohar Joshi raised the issue of the MEA funding two educational centres in Mongolia  one in the name of Rajiv Gandhi and the other named after Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Both were started during the NDA regime        
	Joshi alleged that the UPA stopped funding the Vajpayee centre, which, as a result, has now shut, while the Rajiv Gandhi centre continues to function.         
	While home minister P. Chidambaram, sitting next to Krishna pored over clippings, the external affairs minister listened to Joshi nonplussed. Chidambaram asked Krishna to respond to Joshis allegations. Krishna sat clueless, forcing Chidambaram to rattle out to him a gist of Joshis comments. Chidambaram then proceeded to hand Krishna a piece of paper, prompting him to ask his bureaucrats about the funding status of the two centres in Mongolia.        
	In his reply, Krishna denied any halt of funding to the Vajpayee centre. He, however, failed to respond to Joshis counter-question on the amount being given to the Vajpayee centre, stating that the information would be made available later. It took Chidambaram to prod him again to read out the figures written on the piece of paper.        
	The sources said the government may wait till the June shuffle to fill the vacancy created by Tharoors exit. Tharoors work as a minister was splendid. He shored up Indias Africa policy, gave it the necessary profile, said a ministry official.        
	However, Tharoors penchant for controversies and perceived lack of gravitas alienated a large section of the ministry, too. This section is convinced that the junior minister would have been moved out to a less high-profile ministry in the next shuffle, if the IPL fiasco had not cut short his innings.

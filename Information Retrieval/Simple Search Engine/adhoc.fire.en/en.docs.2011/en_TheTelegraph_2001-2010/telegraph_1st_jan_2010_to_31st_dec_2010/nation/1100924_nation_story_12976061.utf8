The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | More blushes for appalling India
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      More blushes for appalling India
                              Indra Nooyi                            
	New York, Sept. 23 (PTI): PepsiCo chief Indra Nooyi has dubbed Indias infrastructure appalling and said even that is an understatement, although the country remains a must-invest market for global giants like her company.        
	If I use the word appalling, that would be bit of an understatement, the Chennai-born Nooyi said during a panel discussion organised by the Indian American Foundation and Yale University yesterday.        
	The main problem, she said, is that projects in India show too much slippage in execution, a business jargon that essentially means plans are not completed on time and cost more because of long delays.        
	Such comments are not new but Nooyis words come against the backdrop of the delays and problems in Indias controversy-riddled preparations for the Commonwealth Games.        
	The Pepsi boss, whose company has big investments in the beverage and food businesses in India, said that although there had been some development, a couple of highways and airports were not enough.        
	Im not saying development has not been made but its not as fast as it needs to be... unfortunately every project that starts, there is too much of slippage.         
	Nooyi also turned the focus on education, saying many professionals churned out by institutes in India are not as qualified.         
	Even if they have an MBA or an engineering degree, unless they come from a top tier of schools, they are not as qualified as they need to be. We have to retrain them inside the industry.        
	Fareed Zakaria, an international relations expert and journalist, argued that one of the reasons for the governments complacency could be the fact that Indias growth had come too easily, unlike in East Asia where a crisis quickened reforms.         
	The East Asian crisis was the moment, when all those countries did massive reforms and in India, youre getting 7 to 8 per cent growth without doing very much, Zakaria said.        
	But economist and former RBI deputy governor Rakesh Mohan, who was also on the panel, countered the assertion by saying that the argument of not much is happening right now could be offered any time. You cant have bursts of reform every year.         
	Mohan admitted that India had probably gone ahead with the easier reforms or reforms by announcement such as delicensing and removing trade barriers and was now stuck with the tougher ones. Now we have reforms which cant be done by announcement (but by passing new laws).

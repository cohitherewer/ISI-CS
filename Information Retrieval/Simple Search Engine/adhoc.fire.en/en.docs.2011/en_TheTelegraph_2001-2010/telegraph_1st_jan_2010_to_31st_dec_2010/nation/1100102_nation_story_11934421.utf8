                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ask Vidhu only if you are an Idiot
                              Aamir Khan and Vidhu Vinod Chopra in Noida on Friday. (PTI)                            
	Jan. 1 (PTI): The controversy over Aamir Khans 3 Idiots escalated today with the media caught in the crossfire between the filmmakers and novelist Chetan Bhagat, from whose Five Point Someone the movie has apparently been adapted.        
	At one point during a news conference in Noida, Aamir said Bhagat was hungry for publicity and producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra asked a journalist to shut up.         
	The author, at another media briefing, accused the star and the filmmakers of denying him due credit.        
	Aamir alleged Bhagat was trying to take away credit from the films scriptwriter, Abhijat Joshi, who the actor said had worked on the script for three years.        
	Bhagat called Aamir, Chopra and director Rajkumar Hirani uncivilised people and denied he was hankering after publicity. They are making a fool of themselves, he said.        
	The filmmakers news conference in Noida turned ugly when their reaction was sought on Bhagats allegations.        
	Chopra lost his cool when a journalist said the film was similar to the book. The producer and Aamir asked the journalist if he had read the book. When he said he hadnt, Chopra asked him to shut up.        
	When the media objected, Aamir asked Chopra to apologise but the producer refused.        
	Aamir had asked me to take the legal course before, but now after all this furore I am really angry and I might take legal action, Chopra said.         
	We have signed a very defined contract with Chetan stating his name would appear in the rolling credits of the film. We are going to upload the agreement on (my) website.        
	Hirani, who has directed Munnabhai MBBS and Lage Raho Munnabhai, tried to pacify the media. I want you to recount each and every scene with me from the beginning till the climax and tell me where is it similar to the book, he said. There are so many scenes which have nothing to do with the book. The film has only five per cent of the book and Chetan read the script and approved of it.        
	Borrowing a line from Lage Raho, Chopra said: We will send a get well soon card to Chetan. We will also send some flowers. Aamir said Chopra and Hirani had told him not to comment, but he felt hurt that Hiranis credibility is being questioned.        
	I have nothing to do with this issue. I am the non-interested party but I know Hirani and Abhijat both very closely and I have seen them slogging on the script for the last three years, Aamir said.        
	He said it was Bhagat who had approached Hirani to make a film on his book. Hirani read the book and decided to make a film. But when they started writing the script, it became completely different. Chetan read the script and he was completely satisfied with it. He even told me that the script and the book are very different, Aamir said.        
	Bhagat has accused the filmmakers of playing with him and not giving him adequate credit. From the beginning the film has been promoted on the lines that it is based on Five Point Someone but when I saw the film, I found out that my name was nowhere to be seen in the opening credits, he said.         
	For the past two years I have trusted Hirani, Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Aamir blindly and this is what I get in return. Now I am being threatened with legal action but I am ready for it.

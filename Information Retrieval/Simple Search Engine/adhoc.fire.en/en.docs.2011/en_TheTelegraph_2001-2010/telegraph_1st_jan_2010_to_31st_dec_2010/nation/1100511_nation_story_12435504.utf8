          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, May 10: The BJP was forced to put off selection of the Jharkhand chief minister today after hard bargaining by factions, either led by MLAs or patronised by certain Delhi leaders.        
	The party has announced that Rajnath Singh and Ananth Kumar will be in Ranchi tomorrow to take the discussions forward.        
	Right now, it appears a toss-up between Lok Sabha MP Arjun Munda and deputy chief minister Raghubar Das.         
	Some central leaders, though, were still rooting for former Union minister Yashwant Sinha. Their contention was that although he did not have caste equations on his side, nor a following in the legislature party, he was ideal for cleaning up the system in the state and helping the BJP make a mark in governance.        
	Munda, a former chief minister, has formidable patrons in Rajnath, Venkaiah Naidu and L.K. Advani besides his natural advantage as a tribal.         
	Das, a backward caste Vaish, is being backed by Ramlal, the general secretary (organisation) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs man in the BJP.        
	Rajnath and Ananth, the general secretary in charge of Jharkhand, will speak to each MLA separately. Their impressions will be conveyed to BJP chief Nitin Gadkari, who is expected to make up his mind by Wednesday or Thursday.

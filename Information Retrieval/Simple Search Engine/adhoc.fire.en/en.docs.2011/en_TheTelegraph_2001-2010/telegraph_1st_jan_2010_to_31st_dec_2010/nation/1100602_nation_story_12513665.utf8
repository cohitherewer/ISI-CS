          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 1: P. Chidambaram and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee agree that a CBI probe is not needed in the Jnaneswari Express tragedy, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said today in an apparent attempt to isolate Mamata Banerjee.        
	Yechury said the Union home minister and the Bengal chief minister had discussed the matter and decided that a CBI probe, as demanded by the railway minister, was not advisable at this juncture.        
	Bhattacharjee has conveyed to Chidambaram that the ongoing CID probe is in the final stages and stressed that a CBI investigation now will only lead to a delay, Yechury said. The home minister agreed and both leaders decided to wait till the CID inquiry is complete, he added.        
	Asked about Mamatas absence from todays Union cabinet meeting that decided to bring Jharkhand under central rule, Yechury said: A cabinet minister is concerned with the entire country and not only one state. To say Jharkhand was a small issue (as Mamata said while trying to explain her absence at the meeting) is insulting and irresponsible.         
	Yechury sought a clarification from Manmohan Singh, saying the Prime Minister must explain why a central minister was denigrating the collective responsibility of the cabinet. The cabinet functions on collective responsibility. The Prime Minister will have to reply why a minister in the same cabinet refuses to accept it, Yechury said.

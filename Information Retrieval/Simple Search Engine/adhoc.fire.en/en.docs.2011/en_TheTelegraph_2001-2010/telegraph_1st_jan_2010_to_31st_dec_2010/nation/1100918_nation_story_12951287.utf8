The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Games bad news a boon for TV
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Games bad news a boon for TV
  - Foreign channels with beam rights sense high viewer interest because of botch-ups         ARCHIS MOHAN                          A swimming pool that was opened on Thursday at the Games Village. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: Bad news surrounding the Commonwealth Games is good news for the television networks that have bought broadcasting rights, with public interest in the event on a high.         
	Doordarshan, with exclusive broadcasting rights in India, hopes to make a killing in advertising revenue.         
	It will allow private Indian channels only three minutes of Games footage a day. DD has contracted Europes largest outside broadcast supplier SIS (Live) to produce the October 3-14 event.         
	Fox and Sky, which have broadcasting rights for Australia and the UK, also expect high viewer interest. Unlike India, these countries have a dedicated following for track and field, swimming and diving, rugby and other sports.         
	The corruption allegations, missed deadlines and dengue scare have helped draw attention to this edition of the Games, a sporting event which in the past has struggled to generate even a shadow of the public interest of the Olympics or Asian Games.         
	As one reader uncharitably commented to an Australian newspaper report about the extensive Games coverage by TV networks Down Under: Im only going to tune in to watch the stadiums collapse.         
	Another reader said it was unbelievable that there is so much coverage on such a minor event by world terms.         
	In Australia, where the Games are being billed as an Australia versus England rivalry, the fight for television ratings between channels has started in earnest. Australians hope to beat the English in the medals tally which their sports networks hope will be a great lead into the Ashes series to be played later in October.         
	We always want to beat the motherland, so I think well do very well, Australian Olympic gold medallist Matthew Mitcham was quoted as saying by the Herald Sun about his countrys prospects. Sky Sports in Australia will have live coverage of all Games events across five dedicated channels.         
	The Games will also be an occasion for DD to launch its first high definition (HDTV) telecast.        
	The Games will be telecast in standard format on other DD channels. While DD Sports will become a 24-hour Commonwealth Games channel, DD National will broadcast all the finals live. DD Urdu will cover hockey and aquatics and DD Bharati will telecast athletics and gymnastics events, a Prasar Bharati official said.         
	Producers SIS (Live) have deployed 350 cameras to cover the event, including heli-cams or cameras fitted on helicopters, cameras under the swimming pool and deep cams to give the divers perspective.         
	Cameras have also been installed near landmarks like the Qutab Minar, India Gate, the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium and highrises in Connaught Place. The production team will have 25 mobile camera units to interview athletes.         
	Prasar Bharati officials said DD employees do not have the experience or technical knowhow to cover such a big event on HDTV, therefore the reliance on a foreign producer.        
	However, the delay in construction at the stadiums has affected the preparations of the production team as well. The producers wanted to install their equipment at the venues at least 45 days in advance and start test runs. The test runs have now been postponed to Monday.         
	SIS (Live) has hired several international sports personalities and commentators. DD will pick up the English commentary from them but will produce Hindi commentary in-house.

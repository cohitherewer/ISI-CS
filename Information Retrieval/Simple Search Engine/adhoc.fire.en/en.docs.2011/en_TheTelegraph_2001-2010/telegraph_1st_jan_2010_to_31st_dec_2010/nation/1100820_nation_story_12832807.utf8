The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | One word tests nuclear truce

  - BJP cries foul over inclusion of and in nuke liability bill, saying it may shield foreign suppliers        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      Sushma Swaraj                                
	New Delhi, Aug. 19: One word  and  appears to have clouded the consensus between the BJP and the Congress over the nuclear liability bill.        
	The BJP, which had pledged its support to the bill yesterday, cried foul today at the use of and in the report of the House committee that suggested changes in the proposed legislation.         
	The party saw it as a concession to potential foreign suppliers of nuclear plants.        
	The BJP alleged that the insertion of and to join two important clauses was done without taking it into confidence.         
	The BJP feels the and linking Clause 17 (a) with 17 (b) of the bill was an afterthought, thrown in to let foreign suppliers of nuclear equipment off the hook in case of any accident caused by their negligence.        
	Clause 17 (a) provides for a written agreement giving the operator the right to recourse against the supplier. Clause 17 (b) deals with the suppliers liability in case of defective or sub-standard equipment.        
	The draft bill, as it stands now, makes the operator of a nuclear facility solely liable for accident damages, an arrangement the BJP and even the Left parties are not satisfied with.         
	The parties have argued that this would affect only the government since such plants are to be owned only by the government and let off foreign suppliers even if an accident occurs because of their faulty equipment.        
	A note the BJP handed to Prithviraj Chavan, the science and technology minister, today contended that the word and snatched the protection planned for the operators under Clause 17 (a) by making it dependent on Clause 17 (b).         
	Clause 17 allows the operator to exercise a right of recourse under three circumstances: where it is expressly provided for in a contract in writing, where the accident results from the gross or wilful negligence of the supplier or his employees, and where an individual intentionally causes the accident.        
	The parliamentary panel had cited legal difficulties in pinning the culpability for negligence and suggested that the ambit of Clause 17 (b) should be enlarged to include accidents caused by latent or patent defect, supply of sub-standard material, defective equipment or services.         
	A recommendation, made by the BJP, carried a caveat: that there should be a written contract between the operator and supplier providing for these eventualities. The rider underscored the BJPs worries that such potentially hazardous plants could be run without any formal, legally enforceable pacts with suppliers.        
	The BJPs note to Chavan today also said: If there is a written agreement between the operator and the supplier, the agreement will operate on its own terms. No statutory support is required from Clause 17 (b). If, on the other hand, a supplier did not agree to a written covenant, Clause 17 (b) was redundant because he could not be held liable for the supply of defective parts in the absence of an official contract.         
	Then the efficacy and utility of this clause is destroyed by the supplier not agreeing to an agreement in writing.         
	Since the nuclear power plants are to be operated only by the government or government companies, it would be to our advantage to delete the word and, it added.        
	The panels recommendations were expected to be cleared by the cabinet this evening and incorporated in the draft bill so the bill could be discussed and passed in the ongoing Parliament session ending August 31.        
	But the BJPs objections forced the government to put off the cabinet meeting until Friday. We made it clear that if the government wants our support for the bill, our view will have to be accommodated, Sushma Swaraj, leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, told The Telegraph.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, keen to have the bill passed at the earliest, this afternoon met some of his cabinet colleagues, Atomic Energy Commission chairman Srikumar Banerjee and other officials to see if the demand could be met.

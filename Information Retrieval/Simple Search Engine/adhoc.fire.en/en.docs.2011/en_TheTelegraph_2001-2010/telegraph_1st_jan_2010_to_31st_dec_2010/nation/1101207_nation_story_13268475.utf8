	New Delhi, Dec. 6: Carla Bruni in sight, Diana on mind.        
	The French First Lady today met HIV-positive mothers and children at a Delhi hospital, reviving memories among many about the late British princess who was the face of a campaign to spread awareness about the disease.        
	She is so beautiful and intelligent, a doctor at the Safdarjung Hospital said, almost appearing in awe of the former model and singer.        
	Bruni, who lost her brother to AIDS, visited the hospital as part of her Healing Touch campaign for prevention of HIV/AIDS. Dressed in a blue suit and shawl, she spent 45 minutes talking to doctors and the patients while husband Nicolas Sarkozy discussed matters of the state with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	She spoke to women patients and appreciated their efforts in ensuring that their children are free from the killer disease, said the doctor, as a colleague told her friends in hushed tones over a cellphone about what seemed like the encounter of a lifetime.         
	As the brand ambassador for Global Fund to Fight AIDS, which finances campaigns to help those suffering from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, Bruni has long sought to silence those sceptical of her role as the First Lady.        
	B.B. Rewari of the National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco), who took Bruni around the wards and briefed her on the fight against the disease, said 3.8 lakh HIV-positive patients in India receive the treatment with help from Global Fund.        
	Comparisons with Diana kept popping up. A health ministry official who was at the hospital said: With her aristocratic beauty, Diana championed a number of charitable causes, including AIDS awareness, with grace. It seems Bruni wants to follow in her footsteps.        
	Some couldnt resist parallels with US First Lady, Michelle Obama, who was in India last month. The health official offered his take: Bruni is looking better than Michelle did in India as she is a model. The former model looks very chic but Michelle in her dress sense looked more approachable and that is the most important thing.        
	Brunis next stopover was the Naz Foundation, an NGO working for HIV-positive children. There, the kids welcomed her with songs and gifted her some of their paintings. But the VIP guest got requests to croon too. She didnt break into a song but left with a promise. I will send the CD of my new song to all of you, she told the children.

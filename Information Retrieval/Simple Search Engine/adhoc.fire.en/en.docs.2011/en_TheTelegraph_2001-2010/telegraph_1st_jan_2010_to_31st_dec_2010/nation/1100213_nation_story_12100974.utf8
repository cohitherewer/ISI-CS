          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 12: A consortium of doctors and health activists today urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to reject a demand from some MPs to permit the sale of tobacco products within 100 yards of educational institutions.        
	 The MPs, expressing concerns about small traders, had reportedly sought a reversal of the Indian tobacco control legislation which prohibits the sale of tobacco products within a radius of 100 yards from all educational institutions.        
	The Advocacy Forum for Tobacco Control  a non-government consortium of doctors and public health activists  today urged the Prime Minister to resist any attempts to derail tobacco control efforts.        
	Our commitment to protect young persons from the predatory marketing of tobacco and its real dangers should not be abandoned because of unfounded concerns about tobacco sellers, said K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Foundation of India, one of the signatories to the letter.        
	A survey has suggested that about 14 per cent of young people in India below the age of 18 use tobacco in some form  smoked or chewed  and the tobacco industry targets adolescents to gain new customers, the forum said.         
	Health ministry statistics suggest that about 5500 children pick up tobacco each day. The forum has pointed out that the relevant section of the 2003 legislation that prohibits tobacco sales within 100 yards of educational institutions was itself a step backwards from a parliamentary standing committee recommendation in 2001 urging a ban on tobacco sales for 500 yards from educational institutions.        
	 A survey on tobacco sales four years ago had shown that seven out of ten children who bought cigarettes in a shop were not refused purchase because of their age.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP and Left sharpen nuclear knives again
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP and Left sharpen nuclear knives again
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            D Raja, Arun Jaitley                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 22: The BJP and the Left are likely to oppose the Centres proposed nuclear liability law because they doubt if it makes the suppliers of equipment liable for punishment in the event of an accident.         
	The nuclear liability bill is likely to be presented in Parliament this week and the government has sought the support of the Opposition.        
	But within the Left and the BJP there are voices that say the bill cleared by the Union cabinet on Friday, does not accept the recommendations of a parliamentary panel in full with the result that suppliers of nuclear equipment may get off lightly if an accident is caused unless there is evidence of wilful intention to cause the damage.        
	But, though government sources claimed that the BJP was very much in the loop on the bill, leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley told PTI: We are examining all the papers. Prima facie, it appears that there is a deviation from the text which was agreed upon. The language as framed (now) substantially nullifies supplier liability.        
	In contrast, the Left has been categorical. The CPIs D. Raja said: The Left has been insisting that suppliers should be made responsible, wilful or not wilful. We do not agree with the governments view. It is time we learnt from the Bhopal experience. It is a question of public security.        
	A standing committee of Parliament on the bill had observed that wilful act or gross negligence was quite vague and that in an accident, it would be difficult to prove and establish... that it was a wilful act on (the) part of the supplier. Hence there should be clear-cut liability on the supplier....        
	The amendment to the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, 2010, that determines the responsibility of suppliers will be moved along with 17 other amendments in the Lok Sabha on August 25.         
	Jaitley said the BJP was studying the text and would decide whether it would move new amendments after the exercise. He said the government had not informed the party of the change in the text.        
	The CPIs Raja said it was naive to think that the intention of a supplier to cause wilful damage could be proven. We do not think it is a fair, valid argument. No supplier will admit that he has done it with intent, he said.         
	He said if the suppliers were not made responsible, the Left would oppose the bill and insinuated that the government had diluted the bill because it is clearly a case of pressure from the multi-national corporations. It shows how desperate the government is to get the bill passed.

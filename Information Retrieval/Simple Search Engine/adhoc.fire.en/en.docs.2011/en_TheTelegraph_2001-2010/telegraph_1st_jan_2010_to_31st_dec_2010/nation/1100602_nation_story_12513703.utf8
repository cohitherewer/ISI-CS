	New Delhi, June 1: Senior Congress leader Veerappa Moily today asserted that no permission had been given to Jaganmohan Reddy to continue his yatra, hours after the Andhra MP claimed to have got such a nod.        
	He didnt seek permission and was asked not to undertake a yatra in any part of Andhra or Telangana, Moily, the Congresss Andhra in-charge, said.         
	Congress leaders didnt explain whether the son of late chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy had lied or Moily was forced to change his position. But sources said Jagans claim that Moily allowed him to carry on with the controversial yatra stunned the party.         
	The yatra had triggered violence in Telangana, a region still tense over the statehood controversy, as Jagan is opposed to Andhras division. His yatra is seen as an attempt to bully the party into handing him the chief ministers post.        
	None other than Pranab Mukherjee, the senior-most party leader, had publicly urged Jagan to stop his yatra, and Moily couldnt have altered that position without Sonia Gandhis permission. Sonia herself was so angry that she refused to meet Jagan and, hence, couldnt have allowed Moily to pamper the MP, the sources said.         
	The party was ready to let off Jagan with a reprimand, but was also keen to send out a message that his antics would not be tolerated. Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel had conveyed this feeling to him last night. Chief minister K. Rosaiah, too, is said to have objected to the permission Jagan claimed to have received.        
	Jagan, who has said the yatra is meant to console the families of those who had committed suicide or died of shock after YSRs death, left for Hyderabad this evening. He said he would take a decision after talking to supporters.

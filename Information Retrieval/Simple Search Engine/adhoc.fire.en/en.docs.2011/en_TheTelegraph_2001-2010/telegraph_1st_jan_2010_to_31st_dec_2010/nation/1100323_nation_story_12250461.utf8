	New Delhi, March 22: (PTI) An Indian working as a labourer in Saudi Arabia was arrested today for allegedly misbehaving with an airhostess of an Air India flight to Delhi.        
	Subhash Chandra, who hails from Rajasthan, was held on a police complaint lodged by the airhostess soon after landing at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here around 6.30am, a senior police officer said.         
	The airhostess alleged that Chandra, 36, had misbehaved with her on the flight and with crew members when they intervened.        
	A case has been registered against Chandra charging him with outraging the modesty of a woman. A preliminary inquiry revealed he had been staying for the last eight years in Saudi Arabia, where he was working as a labourer.

	Police are looking into the security lapses in connection with the crude explosive material detected in the cargo hold of a Kingfisher airline flight yesterday.         
	They said the object was not of high density and it could have exploded because of air pressure.

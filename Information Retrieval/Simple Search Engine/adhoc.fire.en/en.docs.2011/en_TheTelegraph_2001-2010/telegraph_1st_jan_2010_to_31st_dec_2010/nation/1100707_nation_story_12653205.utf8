The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi effect clips Ananth wings

	Patna, July 6: Narendra Modi may be on a high, but the Modi effect may well cause many heads to roll in BJP.         
	The BJP general secretary and in-charge of Bihar affairs, Ananth Kumar, may have to pay a heavy price for inviting Modi to campaign in Bihar. Top sources in the NDA revealed that he might not be involved in the seat sharing talks with JD(U) for his unwarranted invitation to Modi at a party meeting in Ahmedabad on July 2.        
	Another party general secretary, Arun Jaitley, aided by Venkaiah Naidu might get the assignment to conduct seat sharing talks with the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar.         
	In fact, it was Jaitley who struck a seat sharing deal with Nitish in the 2005 Assembly elections, which paid off handsomely. Nitish came to power, replacing the Lalu-Rabri regime.        
	Sources revealed that by inviting Modi to campaign in Bihar, Ananth Kumar virtually added fuel to the fire that the senior leaders across both camps were desperately trying to douse keeping in mind the crucial elections ahead.        
	Modi was featured in the BJPs aggressive advertisement campaign in Bihar during the partys national executive meeting here last month, angering Nitish Kumar. He not only cancelled a dinner for the BJP leaders, but also returned flood relief funds worth Rs 5 crore to Gujarat to drive home the message that the BJP chief minister was unwelcome in Bihar.        
	Nitishs whiplash reaction caused much heartburn that found vent in a heated war of words between the 15-year-old allies. However, Sharad Yadav from JD(U) and deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, supported by his party patriarch L.K. Advani and party chief Nitin Gadkari, worked overtime to soothe ruffled feathers.         
	Eventually, Sushil Modi who had earlier refused to join Nitishs viswash yatra, went ahead to participate in it, indicating a patch-up between the two allies.         
	But the patch-up proved notoriously fragile, with Ananth Kumars public invitation to Modi snowballing into a conflict across party lines. Aggressive cadres in Bihar clashed among themselves on the Modi issue, marring the NDAs successful price rise bandh yesterday.         
	With the polls looming large, senior leaders across both camps have chosen to tread with utmost caution on this issue. Nitish Kumar chose not to react at all on Ananth Kumars statement.         
	At the same time, Ananth Kumars impromptu invitation to Modi to campaign in Bihar failed to find favour with Sushil Kumar Modi and the BJP core group trying their hard to maintain the alliance in the run-up to the polls.              
	The state BJP chief, C.P. Thakur and other senior office bearers virtually disassociated themselves from Ananth Kumars utterances.

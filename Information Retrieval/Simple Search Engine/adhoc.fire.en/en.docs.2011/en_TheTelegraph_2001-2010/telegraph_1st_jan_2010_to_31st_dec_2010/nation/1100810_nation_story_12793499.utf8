  - City boy helps devise needle-less sugar test          G.S. MUDUR                          Ishan Barman                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 9: An IIT Kharagpur-trained engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has helped devise a technique to monitor blood glucose using a beam of light that might eliminate annoying needle pricks.        
	Ishan Barman is part of a research team trying to develop a non-invasive test for blood glucose, harnessing a light scattering phenomenon first described by Indian Nobel laureate C.V. Raman in 1928.        
	The team has shown that it is possible to monitor blood glucose by shining a low-powered laser beam on the forearm and analysing the frequencies of photons that scatter, or bounce off. The photons that interact with any glucose molecules in the bloodstream return with glucose-specific frequency changes that may be used to quantify the glucose levels in the blood.        
	Were now at the proof-of-concept stage  the instrument we use is quite large, said Barman, whos pursuing a PhD at MIT. But were trying to develop a laptop-sized device that we hope to have ready within a year, he told The Telegraph.        
	Researchers at MITs Spectroscopy Laboratory have been pursuing a non-invasive test for blood glucose through Raman spectroscopy  a concept envisioned by the late MIT professor of physics Michael Feld  for nearly 15 years.        
	A major obstacle has been that a typical low-powered laser penetrates about half-a-millimetre below the skin where it can only measure the amount of glucose in the fluid that bathes the skin cells  the interstitial fluid.        
	The interstitial fluid glucose levels are always slightly different from actual blood glucose levels. Although interstitial glucose levels may be used to compute blood glucose levels through a process of calibration, this requires frequent needle pricks.        
	Barman, who studied at St Xaviers School, Calcutta, and obtained a BTech in mechanical engineering from IIT Kharagpur, joined the effort at the Spectroscopy Lab in 2007, after an MS from MIT. Working with a South Korean doctoral student Chae Ryon-Kong, Barman helped develop a mathematical technique that allows the blood glucose readings to be predicted using interstitial glucose levels.        
	The researchers combined mathematical rigour with experimental Raman spectra at different levels of blood glucose from human volunteers given sugar-laced drinks to develop the technique to predict blood glucose levels from interstitial levels.        
	The research is described in the current issue of the journal Analytical Chemistry.        
	The MIT team appears to have solved a problem that has long stymied researchers, said Michael Morris, professor of chemistry at the University of Michigan, who was not associated with this study.        
	Getting optical glucose measurements of any sort is something people have been trying to do since the 1980s, Morris said in a statement released through MIT. A non-invasive feature of Raman spectroscopy could help improve the quality of life for patients with diabetes but, he cautioned, any device would need to become more affordable and easy to use.        
	The next phase of the research, Barman said, will aim at developing a practical instrument that could be tested on a large number of human volunteers. It requires a low-powered laser of the type used in laser pointers  and a detector for the analysis of the light scattered by the tissues. Our goal is to design an instrument that might cost under $ 200, Barman said.        
	Patients with hard-to-control diabetes sometimes have to prick their fingers several times a week to monitor blood sugar levels. Although new personal-use instruments need only a pinprick blood drop, many patients find the pricks annoying.

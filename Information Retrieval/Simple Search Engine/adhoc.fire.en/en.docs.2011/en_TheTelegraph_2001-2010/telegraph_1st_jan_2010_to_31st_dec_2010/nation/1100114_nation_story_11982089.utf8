The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Officer tied to Sukna on leave 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Officer tied to Sukna on leave 
          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: The military secretary, Lt Gen. Avadhesh Prakash, who has been accused by the armys Eastern Command of influencing a transfer of land to a Siliguri-based realtor flouting security norms, has gone on leave a day after the army chief directed administrative action against him.        
	Lt Gen. Prakash is due to retire on January 31.        
	Asked if there was a difference of opinion between the Eastern Command and the army headquarters on the issue, defence minister A.K. Antony replied: The defence ministry has received a report from the army chief that he is going to take some disciplinary and administrative proceedings against some of his colleague who are involved in the inquiry. So at this stage, it is too early for me to comment. He (the army chief) has sent his decision for information to the ministry only.        
	The officer cadre of the army is fixated on the case that involves the charge that the generals broke security regulations and that the army chief and the Eastern Army commander are not seeing eye to eye.        
	The denouement would be exemplary, the officers agree, because never before have such senior generals, whose decisions impact tens of thousands of troops, been caught in a row like this.        
	The army chief, Gen. Deepak Kapoor, is scheduled to address a media conference tomorrow to mark Army Day and make his first public statements on the subject after the Court of Inquirys findings and opinions. The army chief usually talks to the media every year in the week of Army Day.        
	As military secretary, Lt Gen. Prakash is responsible for all transfers and postings of army officers and even processes the papers for the appointment of the next chief.        
	The general-officer-commanding, Eastern Command, headquartered in Fort William, Calcutta, Lt Gen. V.K. Singh, is likely to be the next army chief. His appointment is yet to be announced.         
	An army headquarters source said the military secretary, one of the eight principal staff officers to the army chief, has gone on leave for 10 days. He was issued a showcause notice on Monday.         
	Directives for administrative action against Lt Gen. Ramesh Halgali and Maj Gen. P.C. Sen have also been given. Lt Gen. P.K. Rath will face disciplinary proceedings that may lead to a court martial.        
	Administrative action could be recordable censure, non-recordable censure or termination of services.        
	The Telegraph reported yesterday that a Court of Inquiry convened by the eastern army commander has found that the generals wilfully violated security restrictions and facilitated a land transfer to Siliguri-based realtor Dilip Agarwal near the 33 Corps military station in Sukna, north Bengal.         
	Defence minister Antony, asked if he had seen the recommendations of the army chief, said: I got here (to Delhi) late night (from a tour of Jammu yesterday). I cannot comment. The ministry will have to examine it.

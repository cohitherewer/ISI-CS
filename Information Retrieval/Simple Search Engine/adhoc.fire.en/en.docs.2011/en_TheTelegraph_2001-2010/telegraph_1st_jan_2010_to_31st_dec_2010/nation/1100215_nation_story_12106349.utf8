	Bhopal, Feb. 14: Vice-President Hamid Ansaris visit to show his wife Salma a monument of love, on the crest of a hill at Mandu where Rani Rupmatis pavilion gazes down at Baz Bahadurs palace, has triggered a controversy.         
	Madhya Pradeshs urban administration and development minister Babulal Gaur is angry that farmer Umraos 20ftx40ft kutcha house had to be demolished to make room for the Vice-Presidents helipcopter to land.        
	Im pained by the incident as a pro-farmer government is ruling Madhya Pradesh and their (farmers) interests cant be ignored, Gaur said, adding that he had asked the state chief secretary to compensate Umrao and offer him a cottage free of cost under the Indira Awas Yojana for the poor.         
	The Vice-Presidents office insisted that the farmers interests had not been harmed by the visit. A senior aide in Ansaris New Delhi office told The Telegraph: First, arrangements such as construction of helipads are made by the state and (the) Vice-President has nothing to do with it. Second, I understand that (the) local administration had rented the farmers premises, (and) entered into a written agreement. There was nothing wrong or improper, the vice-presidential aide said.         
	The divisional commissioner said the Dhar district administration had provided Rs 5,000 as compensation to Umrao.         
	Gaur said he had checked up everything before criticising his own government. That poor farmer had to spend a couple of nights in the open in this winter night as a result of the demolition of his house.         
	Asked if the farmer had indeed entered into an agreement with the local authorities, Gaur, who had served as chief minister between 2004 and 2005, said: My experience in public life says the administration must have compelled him to sign on the dotted lines. He must not have been left without a choice.         
	Umrao said: Sarkar to sarkar hai. Unka man aaya to ghar tod diya (A government is a government. It was its decision to demolish my house).         
	The Ansaris had visited Bhopal, Indore, Dhar and Mandu between February 11 and 12. Ansari, a former diplomat and vice-chancellor and a scholar on west Asia, had gone to see the 15th century palace on the banks of the Narmada.         
	Legend has it that Roopmati had agreed to be with the local sultan, Baz Bahadur, on condition that she would live in a palace from where she could see the venerated Narmada. Standing at this picturesque pavilion perched on a hilltop, the Vice-President had narrated to Salma the story of Baz Bahadurs romance with a shepherdess, her enchanting beauty and mellifluous voice.         
	After spending over four hours at the palace, Ansari had observed: It is more beautiful than what I have read about this historic city in the books during my childhood.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Rajendra Pachauri                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: UN climate panel chairman Rajendra Pachauri today said the panels erroneous forecast that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035 had not hurt its credibility and that he had no intention of resigning.         
	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had earlier this week conceded that its fourth assessment report had without substantiation predicted that most of the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035 because of climate change.         
	It was a human error that should not have occurred, Pachauri told reporters today. But we had a credible fourth assessment report. The 2035 date will in no way effect the value of the report. Rational people will continue to repose faith in the IPCC, he said.         
	Pachauri said the IPCC had a set of robust procedures designed to generate credible scientific assessments of climate change and these procedures would be followed in the preparation of the fifth assessment report due in 2014.         
	I have no intention of resigning, Pachauri said, when asked if the glacier error would hurt the credibility of the IPCC. I have a task to do ahead, he said, referring to the fifth assessment report.         
	The Indian environment ministry had in November released a report that contained the views of several Indian glaciologists who questioned the IPCCs prediction.         
	Indian scientists concede that many glaciers appear to be receding, but point out that there is not enough observational data from the Himalayan region to support the forecast of widespread loss in the next few decades.         
	Glaciologists from India have argued that the studies on ice sheets or glaciers in the Arctic, Antarctica, Greenland or Europe cannot be extrapolated to Himalayan glaciers.

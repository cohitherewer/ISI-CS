                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Court denies CBI Shah custody
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Amit Shah. File picture                                  
	Ahmedabad, Aug. 4: A special court today rejected the CBIs appeal for remand of Amit Shah, Gujarats former minister of state for home jailed in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case.         
	Sources in the CBI said the investigating agency would approach the sessions court for a revision of todays order.        
	Special CBI judge A.Y. Dave rejected the application for custody, saying the agency was earlier given three days to question him in Sabarmati Jail but interrogated him for only three out of the allotted 24 hours. The agency had on Monday asked for 10 days remand.        
	The CBI, which must question Shah on how the investigation into the killing of Sohrabuddin got derailed, had appealed for custody on the ground that he had not co-operated during interrogation in jail.        
	The investigators were unable to extract any information from him in Sabarmati Jail, where he is lodged along with 20-odd policemen also accused in the case.        
	Shah, a confidant of Narendra Modi, is charged with ordering the murder of small-time criminal Sohrabuddin by police, who passed it off as encounter killing of a terrorist on a mission to assassinate the chief minister.         
	The former minister, who surrendered on July 25, will remain in judicial custody at least till August 11, when his bail application comes up for hearing.         
	Advocate Nirupam Nanavati, representing Shah, argued that once the chargesheet was filed and the accused sent to judicial custody, it would be improper to hand over him to the CBI for interrogation.         
	The CBI chargesheet, filed on July 23, accused Shah of murder, extortion, kidnapping and hatching a conspiracy to eliminate Sohrabuddin and his wife Kausar Bi.        
	On Monday, when the appeal for remand was heard, senior Supreme Court lawyer K.T.S. Tulsi, representing the CBI, had given the reasons in a sealed cover, saying the former ministers custody was required for recovery of important documents which are in his possession and which could prove to be vital evidence in the case.        
	Shah, represented by senior Supreme Court lawyer Ram Jethmalani, had argued that the CBI had no proof against him and that it did not utilise the three days time it was given to question him.        
	The judge had reserved the order until today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Peace price: empty lawyer pockets 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Peace price: empty lawyer pockets 
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                            
	Bihar Sharif (Nalanda), Nov. 5: Nitish Kumars governance has hit his livelihood, but Syed Mohammed Nasimul Haque is not complaining.        
	The 47-year-old criminal lawyer said the improved law and order in the state, which was once under the sway of gangsters, had translated into loss of business for him and his colleagues.        
	It has become difficult to get clients. People are now living in peace. This is the biggest achievement of Nitish Kumars government, said Haque, who practises at the Nalanda district court in the headquarters town of Bihar Sharif, about 70km from Patna.        
	He pointed towards the empty wooden chairs, meant for clients, in the lawyers room at the court.        
	The room used to be packed with clients during Lalu Prasads rule. I used to get five to 10 clients every month. Now the number has fallen to one or two. Kidnapping, murder and extortion have completely stopped in the past couple of years, he said.        
	Haque had begun practising at the court in 1992, two years after Lalu Prasad came to power. During those days, then Rashtriya Janata Dal MLA Pappu Khan, a mafia don, lorded over Bihar Sharif. But Pappu was sentenced to life in July this year by a fast-track court for killing a local businessman in 2005.        
	He was the RJDs muscleman and was close to Lalu Prasad. His gang members had made life difficult for businessmen and traders, said another lawyer who did not wish to be named.        
	Now many lawyers are almost jobless. We are having to think of some other business besides practising law. I have friends in other district courts, and everywhere it is the same story, chuckled Alok Kumar, another criminal lawyer.        
	His tone grew more serious. Look, nobody wants crime. Most of the criminals are behind bars now, and some others have fled the state. Bihar is now liveable.        
	Kumar said Nalanda used to be among the districts worst hit by crime. Between 1990 and 2005, during the tenures of Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi, the district had witnessed a sharp rise in kidnapping, murder, rape, molestation, robbery and extortion.        
	Of the 800 lawyers practising at Nalandas civil and criminal courts, almost 600 are criminal lawyers.        
	The number tells the story. Criminal lawyers were much sought after when criminals ruled the roost, Haque said.        
	However, despite the fall in hardcore crime, the district court is still flooded with cases of dowry torture.        
	Crimes against women are still on the rise. The government needs to take measures against it, a lawyer said.        
	Peace not enough        
	Although almost everyone in Bihar Sharif praises Nitish for bringing peace and development, the chief minister cannot be confident about his party winning too many votes here on election day: November 9.        
	The communal divide is apparent in the area, where Muslims make up 50 per cent of the population. People here have always voted on communal lines, said businessman Kaiser Bakht, 55.        
	No doubt, Nitish Kumar has done a good job and we are living in peace now. But most Muslims here will vote for the RJD. Peace and better roads alone cannot ensure the Muslim vote for Nitish as he is hand in glove with the BJP.        
	The town has witnessed communal violence in the past. A large number of Muslims here are small-time businessmen  the affluent moved to Patna and other cities after the 1981 riots. Bakht said the proportion of Muslims in government jobs was very low here, and unemployment was a major grievance.        
	There is no industry here. The good thing is that Muslim girls are now studying more than boys  this will change the face of the community in the next decade, Bakht said.        
	Pappu Khans wife Nusrat Parveen is contesting on an RJD ticket against the sitting Janata Dal (United) MLA, Sunil Kumar. The Congress too has fielded a Muslim candidate, Haider Ali.        
	I would have voted for Nitishbabu if he had snapped his ties with the BJP, said Abdul Subhan, a garment shop owner in Bihar Sharifs commercial district.        
	The RJD will get the Muslim votes because of a sympathy wave for Parveen, whose husband has been sentenced to life for political reasons. The Congress too will get some votes as its candidate is a Muslim.        
	Bakht thinks Bihars Muslims, who make up 16.5 per cent of the states population, have not voted aggresively against any party this time.        
	Unlike past elections, there has been a split in Muslim votes. Almost 50 per cent votes will go to the RJD while the rest will be divided between the Janata Dal (United) and the Congress, he said.        
	The Hindus, at least those who are not Yadavs, are full of praise for Nitish. He has brought Bihar back on track. The next five years will see development kick off in earnest, said Vijay Kumar Singh, a Kurmi railway employee.

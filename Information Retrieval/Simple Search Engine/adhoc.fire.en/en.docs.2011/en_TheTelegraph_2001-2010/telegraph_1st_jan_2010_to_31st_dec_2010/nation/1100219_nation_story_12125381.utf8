	Patna, Feb. 18: Over a hundred Maoist guerrillas swooped down on a remote Bihar village, blew up huts with dynamites and massacred nearly a dozen, including children, in an attack the rebels said was in revenge for the killing of eight comrades.        
	The midnight raid on Kosari came three days after Maoists killed 24 policemen in neighbouring Bengal and a day after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had opposed the use of force against the insurgents.        
	Police said 11 bodies had been recovered from the village in Jamui district, over 200km from Patna and near the border with Maoist-infested Jharkhand.        
	So far we have recovered 11 bodies, additional director-general, headquarters, U.S. Dutta said, adding that security forces had been deployed around the village, barely 3km from a place that has a camp of the Bihar military police.        
	Police sources said 25 people had been admitted to hospital with either burn or gunshot injuries.        
	The CPI (Maoist) has claimed responsibility for the attack.        
	Local people said the guerrillas descended on the village from the Gidheswar hill in the south and blasted thatched huts with dynamites.        
	Some of them barged into homes and picked up three children, including a 13-year-old, Chikku Tuddi, before taking the kids to the outskirts of the village.        
	The rebels then asked Chikku and the others to wake up all the members of the Koda community and ask them to get out of their homes.        
	As the petrified boys stood rooted to the spot, the commander of the guerrillas picked up a public address system and asked the members of the Koda community to come out.        
	The rebels also mentioned the name of one Lakhan Koda, calling him a prime police informer who they said had a hand in the lynching of eight Maoists in the village earlier this month.        
	Yesterday, a self-styled area commander, Avinash, had issued a communiqu that listed the names of some of the lynched rebels  Vijay Tuddu, Sushil Soren, Sonu Hembram, Virendra Soren, Akash, Sheoprasad Marandi and Paru Tuddu.        
	Deputy inspector-general, Munger range, Amit Kumar, however, said the police were not aware of the lynchings.        
	But the Maoists communiqu claimed that Lakhan Koda and other members of his community had killed the cadres in connivance with the police.        
	The Maoists had called a two-day shutdown in Bhagalpur, Munger and Jamui to protest the alleged lynching.         
	Kosari residents said security forces were aware that their village was a target of the Maoists but did not take adequate measures.        
	Last year, 14 people of the Kurmi caste were massacred at Amausi village in Khagaria district. The Maoists, however, had denied involvement in that carnage.        
	Yesterday, chief minister Nitish had voiced caution about the Centres tough posture on Maoists at a time elections in Bihar were just months away.        
	I am opposed to the use of force against Maoists. Development and democracy at the grassroots is the only way to tackle the Maoists, he said.

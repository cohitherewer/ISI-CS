The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | American in airport with knife in bag 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      American in airport with knife in bag

	New Delhi, Feb. 11: An American who once travelled by car to Dhaka from Calcutta was detained at Delhi airport last night after a knife was found hidden in his hand baggage moments before he was to board a flight to New York.        
	CISF sources said Winston Marshall Carmichael, who arrived from Pakistan a fortnight ago and like arrested terror suspect David Headley used his Christian name despite converting to Islam, had been handed over to intelligence agencies for questioning.        
	Officials said no links have been found yet between Carmichael and any militant group, though New York police had confirmed to Indian investigators that the 61-year-old had earlier been charged with drug-related offences in the US.        
	Sources also said security agencies were probing some irregularities in his visa application to India.        
	The latest blip on Indias security radar has come at a time intelligence agencies are trying to fathom how Daood Sayed Gilani, or Headley, a suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba operative on trial in America for alleged links to the 2008 Mumbai attacks, managed to criss-cross the subcontinent for nine years with impunity.        
	Officials with the CISF, which mans airport security in India, said the 4.5-inch knife Carmichael had concealed in a herbal extract was too small to fall in the category of a weapon. But it became imperative to hand him over to police as he had denied carrying any sharp object.        
	When he arrived at the check-in counter and his bag was being scanned, a CISF sub-inspector asked him if there was a knife in his baggage. He denied he was carrying any sharp object, CISF deputy inspector-general Udayan Mukherjee said.        
	Then all the contents of his bag were scanned separately and, in one pouch that weighed about 550gm, we found a sharp object which looked like a blade knife. He then claimed he bought the knife in Pakistan and that the pouch contained shilajit, a kind of aphrodisiac. The fact that he concealed knowledge of the knife made it imperative that we hand him over to investigative agencies.        
	Mukherjee said the US embassy had been informed about the detention.        
	Carmichael, who claims to be a carpenter by profession and was about to board a Qatar Airlines flight to New York via Doha, has been sent to preventive detention of the Foreigners Regional Registration Office. Sources said Delhi police and Intelligence Bureau officials were questioning him.        
	The sources said the New York resident, who had converted to Islam about 15-20 years ago, had been to India twice before and had visited madrasahs across the country and also in Pakistan and Bangladesh.        
	Like Headley, who visited Pakistan several times in 2007-2008, Carmichael visited the country via the Wagah border on October 9 last year after completing a Haj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. He stayed in Pakistan for 15 days and met religious scholars. Then he came back to India and went to Dhaka by road from Calcutta.        
	Headley, too, had visited Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia on several trips to the subcontinent that included stopovers in India where he stayed unnoticed in two central Delhi hotels.         
	Home ministry sources said Carmichael, who also claimed he was an Islamic scholar, had three wives and stayed in a dargah in central Delhi.

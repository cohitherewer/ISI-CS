	Kanpur, July 8 (PTI): IIT Kanpur has set up counselling and yoga centres on the campus to help students cope with stress.         
	Counselling and yoga centres have been set up on the premises for the students. Two psychiatrists are there to counsel those undergoing stress, institute registrar Sanjeev Kashalkar said.        
	The step was taken after seven students of the institute committed suicide in the last five years, Kashalkar said.        
	The students are stressed because of factors such as parental and peer pressure, studies and the race to get good jobs.        
	Yesterday, a 22-year-old IIT Kanpur student, undergoing treatment for mental illness, died in a hospital.

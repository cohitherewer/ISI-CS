          SANJAY MANDAL AND PRONAB MONDAL                                    
	Jhargram, May 29: Rescue operations got delayed by almost two hours yesterday because the security personnel who were to arrive on the relief train were reluctant to travel to a Maoist belt at night.        
	Unsubstantiated reports of a blast having caused the derailment compounded the fears of the Railway Protection Force personnel at Kharagpur who were to form part of the rescue team.        
	Relief staff and security personnel were reluctant to head for the accident spot after hearing there was possibly a blast, carried out by the Maoists. They feared more bombs could be planted on the tracks. The train waited almost till dawn before leaving, a senior railway official said.        
	The relief train, carrying rescue teams and volunteers led by senior divisional commercial manager Manoj Kumar, could have started from Kharagpur, 25km from the crash spot, within half an hour of the 1.25am crash.        
	But it waited almost for two hours and reached around 4am, after which rescue operations began with the help of CRPF jawans, who had already arrived from their joint forces camps.        
	The CRPF could not begin the rescue before the relief trains arrival in the absence of equipment and electric generators to help light up the area.        
	The Kharagpur divisional railway manager, Anil Handa, too had reached the spot on a special train at 2.30am with doctors and emergency medical supplies. But with most of the seriously injured trapped inside the worst-hit coaches, only those with minor injuries in the other coaches could be treated.        
	Trauma specialists said some passengers could have been saved had they been pulled out of the bogies earlier.        
	Some died from excessive bleeding. Had they been brought out earlier and the bleeding stopped and their injuries attended to, lives could have been saved, said a surgeon from Midnapore Medical College and Hospital who had treated the injured at the site.        
	An RPF jawan admitted that the force was usually reluctant to travel by train to Maoist areas at night. Maoists target security personnel. We are armed but if a bomb is planted on the tracks, that wont help, he said.        
	Railway officials said the commissioner of railway safety would start an inquiry on Monday, with enough focus on the delay in rescue operations.        
	Officials said all security and rescue personnel are reluctant to leave in the night on a relief train whenever there is an accident in the Maoist zone. Even if there is a derailment or a train is stopped by the Maoists, rescue personnel wait for daybreak, a South Eastern Railway official said.         
	Sujit Mahato (name changed) from Rajabandh heard a loud noise and figured out a blast or an accident had taken place. I wanted to go and help but didnt dare to step out. We fear the bon party (Maoists), he said.

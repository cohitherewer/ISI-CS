The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre sends a mining message to BJP
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Centre sends a mining message to BJP
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: The Centre hit the BJP hard on its Achilles heel by setting up an inquiry commission to probe into illegal mining in iron ore and manganese ore today.        
	The commission, headed by retired Supreme Court judge M.B. Shah, was asked to submit its report within 18 months and file an interim report, if required.        
	Prime among the inquirys undeclared targets is the BJP government in Karnataka, headed by B.S. Yeddyurappa. It was accused of openly patronising illegal iron ore mining on the Karnataka-Andhra border controlled by the Reddy brothers, two of who are ministers in the state government.        
	Each time the chief minister tried to crack down on their activities, his government tottered and he was forced to buy peace with the Reddys. His decision to ban iron-ore export did not go down well with the brothers, although independent analysts dismissed the curbs as hog-wash.        
	The Reddys had by then allegedly made a tidy packet by exporting the mineral to China in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics.        
	Although the Union cabinet had approved the inquiry in August, the formal constitution of the commission coincided with a high-decibel campaign launched by the BJP against corruption.        
	The BJPs drive began with a call for A. Rajas ouster from the government and culminated in an attack on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after the Supreme Courts remarks on him.        
	The Congress retaliated by focusing on revelations about dubious land deals allegedly struck by Yeddyurappa and his family. Illegal mining was another prong of the Congresss offensive against the Karnataka government.        
	The Reddys have been mentored by powerful leaders from the BJP headquarters. Some of them have tacitly instigated the Karnataka dissidents against Yeddyurappa each time he tried to get tough with the Reddys.        
	The Centres decision may come as good news to Yeddyurappa but not to his detractors in Delhi, one of who has been insisting that the BJP should not re-negotiate its demand for a joint parliamentary committee on 2G spectrum even if Parliament was held up.        
	But, for the moment, the chief minister is under the weather as the central leaders mull the merits and demerits of allowing him to stay on in office and wonder if his continuance would undermine the partys crusade against the Prime Minister.        
	Yeddyurappa, who landed in the capital tonight to explain his case to the high command, is expected to stress the following arguments:         
	In the 2008 Karnataka elections, the BJP swept the northern districts because the powerful Lingayat caste voted lock, stock and barrel in Yeddyurappas name. The last Lingayat chief minister, Veerendra Patil, was sacked ingloriously by his party, the Congress.        
	Yeddyurappa won every election thereafter: Lok Sabha, municipal and Assembly by-polls.        
	The state is holding the zilla panchayat polls in December. Party sources admitted that replacing Yeddyurappa now might adversely impact their prospects.        
	Some leaders in Delhi also felt that each time the BJP gave a regional leader the short shrift, it suffered badly because they either rebelled or formed their own party. Kalyan Singh in Uttar Pradesh and Babulal Marandi in Jharkhand were examples. If Yeddyurappa goes their way, we might lose Karnataka irretrievably, a source said.        
	Yeddyurappa and other Karnataka leaders will meet L.K. Advani and Nitin Gadkari tonight. Sources said Gadkari might dispatch a couple of central leaders to Bangalore to assess the mood among the MLAs before taking the final decision.        
	Plots surrendered        
	Yeddyurappas sons, daughter and two relatives have surrendered their plots because of mounting pressure on the chief minister over and alleged land scam. Yeddyurappa is accused of freeing government land in favour of several members of his family.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress in Rajiv thrust 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Congress in Rajiv thrust 
  - Party absolutely rules out former PMs involvement, says Anderson flight plot to be probed         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Arjun Singh, Rajiv Gandhi                                       
	New Delhi, June 11: The Congress today denied any involvement of Rajiv Gandhi in the release of Union Carbide chief Warren Anderson but said the ministerial group set up on the gas tragedy would look into who conspired to get the American freed.        
	Asked if the party was in a position to categorically deny the late Prime Ministers role in Andersons flight to freedom, Congress spokesperson Jayanthi Natrajan said: Absolutely.        
	The one-word reply was the first categorical assertion from the Congress that Rajiv Gandhi was in no way involved, since details surfaced about how Anderson was virtually escorted out of Bhopal on a government aircraft hours after his arrest.        
	Natrajan went on to say there was also no question of indicting the then central government headed by Rajiv Gandhi, hinting that any dubious role played by certain individuals did not mean the government as a whole conspired to get Anderson freed.         
	The spokesperson tried to clear the confusion created by a flurry of unauthorised remarks yesterday, particularly stressing that AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh did not make any insinuation about the Rajiv Gandhi government. She said Digvijay had already explained his statement, which was by no means aimed at Rajiv Gandhis government.        
	A text message from Digvijay, a Madhya Pradesh minister at the time of the 1984 leak, had suggested that Anderson could have been allowed to leave under US pressure. But the full text message made it clear his primary objective was to protect himself.        
	I dont know as I was not in Bhopal at the time of (the) gas leak. It could be under US pressure but I am not aware of the facts, the message said.        
	Sources close to Digvijay said the media had distorted his reluctant responses.        
	Digvijay, who is in the US with his ailing wife, sent a message today to PTI, saying: I had clarified that I was campaigning and really dont know the events which led to the bail and release of Mr Anderson. People who can answer this are Arjun Singhji, the then CM, as also Brahm Swaroop, the then chief secretary of Madhya Pradesh, Moti Singh, the then collector of Bhopal, and Swaraj Puri, the then SP of Bhopal.        
	Senior Congress leader R.K. Dhawan, who was Rajiv Gandhis private secretary at that time, said Arjun was the only person who can answer how Anderson left the country.         
	Dhawan said he did not think Rajiv Gandhi would have known about the developments or asked Arjun to provide the aircraft that flew Anderson out of Bhopal. An integral part of the Congress system since the days of Indira Gandhi, Dhawan is said to be very close to Arjun.        
	It is almost certain that Arjun, too, does not intend to cast aspersions on the Gandhi family. Although he has said he will wait for an appropriate time to break his silence on the allegations that his government colluded in Andersons escape, party sources denied any concerted effort to corner him.        
	A section of the party feels that Arjun might name a senior Congress leader who is dead and the present party set-up wouldnt mind that.         
	It was, however, not clear what role the group of ministers (GoM) would play in establishing the identity of the person as promised by the Congress spokesperson, who said all the issues that need to be examined will be looked into.         
	Jayanthi dismissed allegations of conflict of interest against some GoM members as unfair. Kamal Nath and P. Chidambaram had been accused of advocating the cause of Dow Chemicals, which has bought Union Carbide.        
	She also said the party had nothing to do with fellow spokesperson Abhishek Singhvis association as a lawyer with Dow Chemicals.

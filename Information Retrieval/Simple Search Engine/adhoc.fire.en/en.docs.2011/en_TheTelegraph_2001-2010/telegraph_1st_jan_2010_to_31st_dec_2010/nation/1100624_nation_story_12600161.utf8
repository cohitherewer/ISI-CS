          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, June 23: Bombay High Court today set aside a formula devised by the Maharashtra government to remove an alleged disadvantage faced by state board students while competing with their ICSE and CBSE counterparts for Class XI admissions.        
	The court said the Best 5 formula was unfair to the students of the other boards and violated their right to equality.        
	The judgment came on a petition filed by a group of 20 parents of ICSE students.        
	The states Secondary School Certificate (SSC) board had introduced the Best 5 system in February 2010, allowing SSC mark sheets to reflect the percentages scored in the top five of the six subjects.         
	It had cited how CBSE took into account only five of its subjects, while ICSE declared its students passed if they cleared five of the seven subjects.         
	After the 20 parents moved the court alleging discrimination, the court had last week stayed Class XI admissions till the verdict. It today lifted the stay.        
	The court said the state had failed to substantiate that ICSE and CBSE students gained an unfair advantage in admissions. It also said the state should have consulted other boards while devising the formula, and that merely inviting suggestions was not enough.        
	The court said any decision by the state should be taken months in advance, and not in February when the board exams are round the corner. It also rapped the Maharashtra government for failing to learn lessons from two previous attempts at devising similar formulas.        
	In 2009, the state board had argued that ICSE and CBSE students scored higher marks because of a different grading system, and devised a formula that reserved 90 per cent seats in city colleges for SSC students, leaving just 10 per cent for ICSE and CBSE students.        
	In 2008, the state government had devised a percentile system, which granted grace marks to SSC students on the same ground. However, both had been struck down by the high court as hasty decisions, arrived at without application of mind.

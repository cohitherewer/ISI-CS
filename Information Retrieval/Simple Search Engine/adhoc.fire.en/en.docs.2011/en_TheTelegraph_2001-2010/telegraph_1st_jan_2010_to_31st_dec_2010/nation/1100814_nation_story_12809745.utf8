          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Aug. 13: A JMM delegation led by Shibu Soren met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Delhi today and demanded that the Centre declare entire Jharkhand as famine-hit and also release a special relief package of Rs 15,000 crore.        
	It also pointed fingers at the state administration for giving misleading information to the Centre.        
	Soren said the state had received poor rainfall for the second consecutive year. Farmers are not being given crop insurance benefits and other relief items, and the public distribution system too is ineffective. Labourers are being compelled to migrate to other places in search of bread and butter, he added.        
	The JMM chief alleged the state administration of not adopting fixed yardsticks while declaring over a dozen districts as drought-hit.        
	The poor people were doomed to starve. Mass resentment prevails across the state. Last year too, farmers of Palamau were driven to seek the permission of the district administration to commit suicides, he said.        
	Soren reminded the Prime Minister of having drawn the Centres attention on the drought situation in Jharkhand last year as well. We had made demands and suggestions in the larger interests of masses. But, that too was ignored, he told the Prime Minister, urging him to take prompt action.        
	Soren was accompanied by Rajya Sabha member K.D. Singh, Hemant Soren and about a dozen senior party colleagues.

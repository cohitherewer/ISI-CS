          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 26: In order to take healthcare service to the doorsteps of students, a school health programme will be launched in 60,000 institutions across the state covering 58 lakh pupils.        
	A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the State Health Mission, chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik here today.        
	Under this programme, health check-up will be carried out in every school twice every year. If any student is detected to be suffering from any serious illness, s/he will be provided free treatment. A pilot project was launched by the chief minister in Kandhamal district in October last year.        
	Students from Classes I to X belonging to both residential and non-residential schools will be benefited under the scheme  aimed at screening all students twice annually and treating minor ailments instantly, while referring critical and chronic cases to hospitals. For implementation of the scheme, Rs 12.29 crore had been sanctioned for 2009-10, sources said.        
	The State Health Mission also decided to construct buildings for 1,069 health sub-centres in the backward Koraput-Bolangir-Kalahandi (KBK) region by 2012.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Games panel to stay: Govt
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Games panel to stay: Govt
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Suresh Kalmadi (top); MS Gill                                 
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: Suresh Kalmadi can rest easy  he will not lose his job.        
	The government today ruled out changing the Commonwealth Games management structure as that would clash with the agreement the then Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime had signed with the Games federation nearly seven years ago.         
	Sports minister M.S. Gill told the Lok Sabha the government couldnt change an international commitment, virtually making it clear that the embattled Kalmadi would remain organising committee chief for the October 3-14 showpiece event.        
	The agreement signed by the government on November 13, 2003, at Montego Bay in Jamaica said the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) will make an organising committee (OC), which will do all the arrangements for the Games the minister told the Lok Sabha while replying to a debate on the Games.        
	...The agreement was signed. We cannot change it now as it is an international commitment. We have to implement it. We cannot go back to judge whether it was right or wrong, whether the bid to host the Games should have been made or not.        
	The statement effectively scotches speculation that the government might set up an apex body to oversee the scandal-ridden preparations.        
	Yesterday, the organising committees joint director-general was sacked for financial irregularities during the Queens Baton relay in London last year.        
	In Uttar Pradesh today, Congress leader Digvijay Singh said Kalmadi should resign if his name figured in a CBI probe.        
	If his name is there prima facie in a CBI case, then on moral grounds he should resign, PTI quoted Digvijay as saying in Shahjahanpur.        
	I dont know whether there are charges... I am not demanding his resignation, he added.        
	While two sacked Games officials have been questioned by the Enforcement Directorate, there is no CBI case as of now.        
	Gill said the IOA had set up the organising committee on February 10, 2005, with 484 members, and got it registered. The government is basically a back-up, everything, including the travel plans of the players, are done by the OC. We have given the money and built the stadiums, he said, endorsing urban development minister Jaipal Reddys claim that the total expenditure was Rs 28,458 crore, not one lakh crore as alleged by the Opposition.        
	Gills reply carried a hint of disapproval of the committees style of functioning. He said the committee had tried to protect itself from the Right to Information (RTI) Act but his ministry had defeated its plans. He invited more RTI queries to expose misdeeds, if any .        
	He also voiced subtle disapproval of the clearance given by the previous NDA government for the use of the Yamuna bed  a contract given to a Dubai company  for constructing the Games Village and the delay in implementing projects.         
	The minister said the government would hide nothing and corruption allegations would be pursued even after the Games are over but avoided responding to the demand for a probe by a joint parliamentary committee, which prompted a walkout by several parties.         
	Gill said the preparations were almost over and most of the stadiums were ready and appealed to parties and the media to focus on the players, who would start arriving soon.        
	Now that the groom is waiting at the gates for exchange of vows, should the bride break the relations at this hour? he said, taking the analogy of a wedding to appeal for successful hosting of the Games.         
	Asked about Rs 961 crore being spent on renovating the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium, he said: This is a misconception that the stadiums have only been repaired. The old stadiums were knocked down and rebuilt. Cost escalation did happen but if you see the stadiums grandeur, your suspicions will go.

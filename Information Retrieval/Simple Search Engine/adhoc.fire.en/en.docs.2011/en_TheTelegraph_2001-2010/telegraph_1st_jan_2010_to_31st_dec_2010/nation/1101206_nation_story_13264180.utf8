	New Delhi, Dec. 5: Panjab University, one of pre-Independent India s leading institutions and the alma mater of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has been added to a centrally-funded list that makes it eligible for more funds from Delhi.         
	Set up in 1882, the university has been a state university. Situated in Chandigarh, the institution gets 60 per cent of funds from the Union home ministry and the rest from the Punjab government.         
	However, the university has been facing a financial crunch because of a decision by the Punjab government to limit its assistance to Rs 16 crore a year. The annual budget estimates of the university were Rs 187.81 crore for 2008-2009.         
	Even in the unlikely event of the funds requirement remaining the same, the university will be saddled with a shortfall of around Rs 60 crore a year after the Centre contributes its 60 per cent share. Besides, the university has a liability of over Rs 200 crore at present.         
	The institution then approached the Prime Minister for more central funds. A consultative committee was set up by the human resource development ministry under the supervision of the Prime Ministers Office to suggest how more funds could be given to the university, a source told The Telegraph.         
	With the reorganisation of Punjab, the university became an inter-state body corporate catering to Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Chandigarh.         
	Gradually, the colleges of Himachal and Haryana were affiliated to the universities in the respective states. Panjab University, which retained its original spelling, was left with the affiliated colleges in Chandigarh and some parts of Punjab.         
	The Prime Minister had done his graduation and MA in economics from the university in the 1950s.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ego clash, then rose for lady
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ego clash, then rose for lady
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Airport today had 2much security amp; few passengers. I hear President Obama arrives today. Im sure he will fall love with India. Preity Zinta On Twitter                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 6: Hours before Air Force Ones wheels kissed the Mumbai runway, a rash of frictions was breaking out all around between the Indians and Americans manning security at the airport and across the city.        
	Even bigger egos were ruffled, it seems, in this meeting of East and West.        
	An aide said chief minister Ashok Chavan  the first to greet President Barack Obama on the tarmac after refusing to do so yesterday  was upset at being asked to come early and made to wait.        
	American officials  from the consulate and the Secret Service, which looks after the Presidents security  apparently kept demanding last-minute changes to plans this morning.        
	It provoked a rare closing of ranks between the Indian agencies, with official after official throwing the rulebook at the Americans and boasting to the media about how they had shown the visitors their place.        
	They want to give instructions without taking responsibility. We dont need their inputs to man our airport or (handle) our media, a senior Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officer said rather patriotically at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport.        
	An hour before touchdown, tempers were running high on the scalding tarmac. As Indian officials and journalists crossed the last security point and walked the final leg in the heat, the Americans insisted on taking their cars through the no-drive area.        
	A CISF official threw a stern look at a shrugging and gesticulating US official. Then, in strong Punjabi-accented English, he said: No car, please walk. This is India, enjoy the sun.        
	But at 12.48pm, exactly two minutes before Obamas Boeing 747-200B landed, the CISF had no problem letting the welcoming band of Indian ministers drive through the no-car zone.        
	Apart from Chavan, the team included Union minority affairs minister Salman Khursheed (the minister-in-waiting for Obama) and Maharashtra protocol minister J.S. Shetty.        
	As the red carpet was laid out, Obama walked down the planes steps with Michelle. He wore a suit and she a dull grey, full-sleeved silk dress with demure neck and hemlines. In comparison, her silver shoes and the statement pearl choker seemed like indulgent after-thoughts.        
	She decided to dress conservatively keeping the sensibilities of the people of India in mind, said a consulate official as photographers and cameramen rued the letdown by the style icon.        
	But Chavan, who had thrown a huge sulk yesterday and refused to receive Obama on arrival, was already rushing forward. With a bunch of red roses for Michelle and a coffee-table book on Maharashtra for the President, the chief minister was suddenly a picture of grace.        
	He had been fuming for the past hour and a half because he was asked to come to the airport early for security reasons, an official close to Chavan said.        
	(Yesterday) he had been upset with the Americans for asking to check his passport. They apologised and he decided not to miss the opportunity of greeting Obama first. But he was very upset about being made to wait.        
	No snipers        
	The Americans had insisted that snipers be deployed on buildings around the Taj hotel and other venues Obama was to visit, but Mumbai police turned them down. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) kept vigil around the Taj.        
	The Mumbai coastline was being patrolled by the Indian Navy as well as a US fleet of 34 warships.

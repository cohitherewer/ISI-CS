The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Assets worry for   rural job scheme 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Assets worry for   rural job scheme 
          CITHARA PAUL                                    
	New Delhi, July 21: The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act may be giving jobs to lakhs of people but it has not been doing much by way of asset creation.        
	Barely 36 per cent of rural infrastructure projects begun under the scheme has been completed in the first six months of 2010, a mid-year assessment by the rural development ministry has said.        
	The annual assessment figures for 2009 and 2008 were not encouraging either: only 45 per cent of the projects were completed last year and 43 per cent the year before.        
	According to latest figures, as many as 3,43,086 projects are behind schedule. Andhra has the largest number of pending projects, followed by Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Bengal.        
	The quantum of incomplete work is worrying. If immediate steps are not taken, NREGA will end up as a scheme that spends crores of rupees to dig pits across the country, a rural development ministry official said.        
	When the job scheme was conceived, the idea was that alongside generating employment, it would work wonders for rural connectivity, flood control, minor irrigation work, renovation of traditional water sources, water conservation and water harvesting. But nothing has been happening, the official said.        
	Now NREGA seems to have a single-point agenda of creating employment. Whats forgotten is that the scheme had an equally important goal of asset creation, he added.        
	The official said his ministry would not be able to do much as NREGA was a demand-driven scheme where states were the main players. So, steps needed to be taken at the panchayat level.        
	But NREGA activists claimed the Centre was playing politics. All it wants is the goodwill that NREGA generates. It is not bothered that crores are being spent to dig pits here and there without any purpose, said Pankaj Das of the NREGA citizen forum.        
	Das said the ministry should amend the scheme to link payment to completion of projects.

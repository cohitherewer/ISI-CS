	Chennai, July 3 (PTI): The Centre has decided to write to all political parties in a bid to bring about consensus on inclusion of caste in census, Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said today.        
	The decision was taken after the group of ministers (GoM) in its July 1 meeting failed to come to a decision on including caste in the census.        
	Different opinions were expressed by the ministers. The group of ministers will meet again to take a decision, Mukherjee, who heads the GoM, said.         
	The ministers panel was set up last month after consensus eluded the Union cabinet in two meetings.         
	Parties such as Samajwadi Party, RJD and Janata Dal (U) have strongly pitched for including the caste category.        
	On the direct tax reforms, Mukherjee said that all states had been informed about tax reforms, goods and services tax and a direct tax code.         
	The states have to work in close co-ordination with the Centre in finalising and implementing the reforms.        
	Emerging from a meeting with Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi at his residence here, Mukherjee told reporters that he had apprised the DMK leader about the deliberations of the GoM meeting on the caste in census issue.         
	Mukherjee also apprised Karunanidhi on the direct tax code and about goods and services tax.

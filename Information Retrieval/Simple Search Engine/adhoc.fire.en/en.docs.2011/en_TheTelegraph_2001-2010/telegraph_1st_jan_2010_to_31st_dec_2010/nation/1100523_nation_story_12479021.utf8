          STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 22: Fliers miss flights for numerous reasons but a jaw-dropping one awaited Sayantan Roy at Mangalore airport this morning: his plane had crashed.        
	The same plane that burst into flames was supposed to take the Calcutta boy to his parents in the Gulf on its return flight nearly two hours later.        
	The 18-year-old engineering student at Karnatakas Manipal University was on his way to Abu Dhabi for a vacation. When I reached the airport, they would not let me enter. I found out that the plane I was supposed to take had crashed. However, I could not see anything, said Sayantan, whose flight was scheduled to take off at 9.25am.        
	As I made the half-an-hour journey back to my hostel, I kept thinking that I could have been on that flight, he said.        
	Sayantan, the son of aeronautical engineer Shankab Roy, 42, and Shampa, 41, was going to Abu Dhabi to spend his summer holidays with his parents, who live there.        
	Born in Calcutta, Sayantan moved with his parents to the United Arab Emirates capital where he finished school.        
	I came to India because higher education in Abu Dhabi is not that good. But once I finish my course, I will go back, said Sayantan, who wants to become an aeronautical engineer like his father.        
	Sayantan said he has been receiving calls from family and friends through the day.         
	I believe I am really lucky. I was supposed to take the same plane out of Mangalore. God knows what could have happened, said the Paikpara boy. He will take another Air India flight to Abu Dhabi on May 25.

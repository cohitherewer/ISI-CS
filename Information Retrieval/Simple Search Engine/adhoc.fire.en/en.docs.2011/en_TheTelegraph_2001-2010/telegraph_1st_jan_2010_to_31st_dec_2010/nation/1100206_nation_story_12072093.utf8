          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: Trinamul Congress ministers of state Mukul Roy, Sisir Adhikari and C.M. Jatua today complained afresh to home minister P. Chidambaram about what they said was persistent political violence in Bengal, blaming the ruling Left Front.         
	We iterated our concerns about the continuing law and order breakdown in the state. Our meeting was aimed at apprising the government about the state of affairs, , a minister of state for rural development, said after the meeting.         
	The meeting is significant because Trinamul is concerned that the newly appointed Bengal governor M.K. Narayanans feedback to the Centre on law and order has indicated satisfaction with the Left government.         
	Former governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, who had frequent differences of opinion with the Left, especially towards the end of his tenure, had publicly said he was concerned about political violence in Bengal.         
	Several dozens of supporters of both the Left and Trinamul have been allegedly killed since the Lok Sabha elections last year when the Left was trounced.

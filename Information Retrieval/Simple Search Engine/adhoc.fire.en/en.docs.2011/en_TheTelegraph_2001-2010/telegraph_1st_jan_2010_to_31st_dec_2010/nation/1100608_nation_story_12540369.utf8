          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Independent candidate B.G. Uday (left) with his supporters after filing his nomination papers for Rajya Sabha election in Patna on Monday. Picture by Deepak Kumar                                  
	Patna, June 7: B.G. Uday, a Bangalore-based businessman, stunned the states political circles by entering into the fray of the biennial polls to the Rajya Sabha on the last day of filing the nomination papers as an Independent today.        
	Udays entry as the sixth candidate against five vacant Upper House seats from Bihar is all set to fuel horse-trading and force elections, due on June 17. The observers were ruling out the possibility of the election with only five official candidates against five vacancies till Uday suddenly entered the poll arena.        
	Bihar is a part of my great country. I thought the state apt for making my political debut in electoral politics, Uday told The Telegraph, adding: I am into business. My trade activities are centred in Bangalore.        
	But the fact remains that the Independent MLAs and also those from BSP might have fallen prey to the lure of the behind the scene promise of lucre from the rich trader, ambitious to enter the political arena.        
	In fact, Dadan Pahalwan who along with nine BSP MLAs and Independents proposed Uday for the nomination was quite vocal about the businessman turned candidate. Uday is a great entrepreneur. If he is elected to the Rajya Sabha he will make investment in Bihar. We are all supporting him.        
	If Uday refuses to withdraw his nomination paper by June 10  the last date of withdrawal  he might create trouble for one of the official candidates  probably, Ramkripal Yadav of Lalu Prasads RJD.        
	The RJD-LJP combination has only 68 MLAs against the requirement of 76 to ensure the victory of its two nominees  Ram Vilas Paswan and Yadav. The combination is heavily dependent on the Congress (10 MLAs), Left and Independents to see its candidates through.        
	On the other hand, the BJP-JDU, which constitutes the ruling NDA, has 137 MLAs  23 in surplus over 114  required to send three of its official candidates to the Rajya Sabha. While the JD(U) has fielded R.C.P. Singh and Upendra Kushwaha, the BJP has fielded Rajiv Pratap Rudi.        
	MLA quits        
	Former Bihar minister in the Nitish Kumar government Jamshed Ashraf today resigned from the Assembly and primary membership of ruling JD(U) after accusing the NDA ministry of being anti-minority.         
	The NDA government has meted out a step-motherly treatment to Muslims during its four-and-a-half-year rule, he told reporters in Patna today, reports PTI.

          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: After corruption charges, the Commonwealth Games organisers now face a culture test.        
	The original plans for the opening and closing ceremonies, scheduled for October 3 and 14, apparently do not reflect the Buddhist and Islamic influences on Indian civilisation, according to the group of ministers tracking the preparations.        
	The GoM, which had on July 14 criticised the omission, will review a final presentation of the ceremonies contents on Sunday evening.        
	At the July 26 meeting, too, the GoM had re-emphasised that both Buddhist and Islamic cultural elements must form part of the presentation, the minutes say.        
	Bharat Bala, the creative head for the two ceremonies, has promised that these elements would be evident when details of the content are presented.        
	The budget for the ceremonies was enhanced from Rs 106 crore to Rs 300 crore earlier this year and last month, the government rejected the Games committees demands for another hike.         
	The two programmes will feature traditional songs, dances and martial arts, with some 11,000 participants including A.R. Rahman and Katrina Kaif, and a Rs 38-crore blimp in the sky adorned with mannequins.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | A pat from busy Modi, but no phone call
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      A pat from busy Modi, but no phone call
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Narendra Modi                                  
	Gandhinagar, Nov. 24: Narendra Modi was today left no option but to congratulate Nitish Kumar, but the Gujarat chief minister was apparently too busy to call up his Bihar bugbear to convey his good wishes.        
	At a Diwali Milan meeting, Modi, whose BJP is in alliance with Nitishs Janata Dal (United) in Bihar, said: It is a very happy day for us. The Nitish Kumar-Sushil Modi team has performed exceptionally well in Bihar. The people have reposed faith in their leadership, which is a good sign for the nation.        
	Modi then went on to praise Nitish for the development agenda that had won the coalition a resounding mandate from the people, overlooking that it was the Dal (U) leader himself who had blocked him from campaigning in Bihar.        
	Political stability and good governance are key to development, Modi said. A strong and developed Bihar will fuel development in the country.        
	Nitishs landslide, won despite Modi being blocked from electioneering for fear his anti-secular image might backfire on the Dal (U), could be seen as an embarrassment for the Gujarat leader and establishes that he is the BJPs biggest liability outside that state.        
	In June, there was an ugly spat between the two when an ad showing Modi and Nitish holding hands came out in the papers during a BJP convention in Patna. An angry Nitish had then cancelled a dinner for BJP leaders, put his foot down on Modi canvassing and returned the Rs 5 crore Gujarat had donated for Kosi flood relief.        
	In a sense, Nitish could be seen as Modis biggest bugbear, managing to do to the Gujarat Shining leader what the Congress has failed to do so far. Nitishs victory also suggests that Modi may have to rethink his national ambitions and eventually confine himself to being a state satrap.        
	Although some saw in Modis good wishes a timely softening towards Nitish, others questioned why he congratulated the Bihar victor from a public platform. Modi also declined a reply when asked after the annual Diwali Milan meeting if he would attend the Bihar swearing-in.        
	The chief minister was too busy to call up Nitish Kumar. He is coming straight from a cabinet meeting, an aide said. At this point, I cannot say whether he will go to Patna to attend the swearing-in ceremony.

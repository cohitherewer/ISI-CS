	Bhubaneswar, May 29: A three-hour meeting in Cuttack today  in spite of raising hopes  failed to resolve a five-year-old deadlock to provide land to steel behemoth Posco for its proposed plant in Jagatsinghpur district.        
	While the Jagatsinghpur district administration requested the delegation of the Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, the association leading the agitation, to vacate land for the project to make headway, the latter asked the government to relocate it. However, the administration ruled out shifting the projects location.        
	The next meeting will be held on June 5.        
	Though South Korean steel-maker Posco signed an MoU with the state government on June 22, 2005, for a greenfield 12MTPA steel plant, the project had failed to take off, as the affected villagers had put up barricades to prevent entry of government and Posco officials for land acquisition.        
	After a deadlock of five years, chief minister Naveen Patnaik convened a high-level meeting last week following Poscos apparent threat to shift its project and decided to initiate the dialogue process.         
	Todays meeting was held in a cordial atmosphere, revenue divisional commissioner (central division) P.K. Mohapatra told The Telegraph.        
	They (representatives of the samiti) put forth their viewpoints and the district administration highlighted the benefits the project-affected villagers will accrue, said Mohapatra, who chaired the meeting.        
	Jagatsinghpur district collector N.C. Jena and other officials explained how the resettlement and rehabilitation package for the project-affected villagers was lucrative and circulated copies of the package.        
	Mohapatra also told the delegation that the biggest foreign direct investment (FDI) project in India would not only bring about economic development of the region, but also create employment opportunities (both direct and indirect) for 8 lakh people, sources said. He also passed on the government decision to exclude 300 acres of private land in Dhinkia village from the project and sought support and co-operation from local villagers for the steel plant to be built exclusively on government land.        
	However, Abani Baral, the adviser to the Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, claimed that the villagers of three panchayats had been in possession since 1925 and showed copies of record of rights. We will not give up our land at any cost and the project be shifted to other location, said Sisir Mohapatra, the local sarpanch and general secretary of the samiti, who led the delegation.        
	We will support the steel plant project, if it is relocated, said Mohapatra.        
	He recalled that the villagers had opposed the oil refinery project proposed to be set up in the same location in 1994 and finally it was shifted near Paradip port.        
	On the other hand, the district administration ruled out shifting of the project. It has been decided at a high-level meeting, chaired by the chief minister, that the location will not be changed, Mohapatra clarified.        
	However, local CPI MP Bibhu Prasad Tarai, who mediated the talk, said: Im hopeful that the government will listen to the villagers plea and the impasse will be resolved soon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Daughter protest
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Daughter protest
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                                              Madhab Chandra Dey (Top) and Nirmal Kumar Mondal      
	Calcutta, July 20: Juthika Das, the eldest daughter of killed Uttar Banga Express driver Madhab Chandra Dey, today said the railways should not have blamed her father for the Sainthia crash before an inquiry was held.        
	Expressing outrage at Railway Board chairperson Vivek Sahays comment yesterday that something was definitely wrong with the driver, she said: My fathers career, spanning nearly 35 years, has been flawless. He had less than two years of service left. Now if any one tries to blame my father for the train mishap, it is an insult to our entire family.        
	Speaking from their Kaugachhi home in Barrackpore in North 24-Parganas, Juthika said her father had been an A category driver with an excellent track record. Moreover, he had always taken his job as an engine driver very seriously and taken pride in it.        
	Why should these questions arise when my father has driven trains all his life without any problem? Senior railway officials are making irresponsible statements about my father. We want a proper investigation into the mishap and those responsible to be punished, she said.        
	Other family members echoed her.        
	The family members and some neighbours of assistant driver Nirmal Kumar Mondal, of Nawpara in Barasat, expressed the same sentiment. Mondal, too, was killed when the Uttar Banga Express rammed into the Vananchal Express at Sainthia yesterday.        
	A neighbour, Asit Mondal, said: We are not happy with what senior railway officials are trying to say about the Uttar Banga Express drivers. Nirmaldas family is now in a state of shock. Such remarks are unbecoming, particularly when the mishap probe has yet to be completed.

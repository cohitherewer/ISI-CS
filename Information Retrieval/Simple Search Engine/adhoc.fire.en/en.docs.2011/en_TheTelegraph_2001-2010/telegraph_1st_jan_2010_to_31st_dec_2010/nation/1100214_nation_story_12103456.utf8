The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delay cloud on arms race
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delay cloud on arms race
          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 13: One of the most keenly contested arms contract races in the world, the Indian big guns competition is likely to be deferred after the erstwhile Bofors Singaporean rival today said its cannon was damaged in an accident and requested the Indian defence ministry for more time.        
	The winter trials for the towed 155mm/52 calibre howitzer were to begin in Kargil on February 27.        
	Last June, when ST Kinetics landed its Pegasus ultralight howitzer in Mumbai for trials, it was told it had been blacklisted by the defence ministry.        
	The howitzer competition is in focus as global arms manufacturers assemble in New Delhi for what is claimed to be Asias largest arms bazaar, Defexpo 2010, beginning Monday. The Indian Armys artillery modernisation plan could result in orders worth Rs 70,000 crore over 10 years.        
	Both BAe Land Systems, the current owners of the former Swedish firm Bofors AB, and ST Kinetics, a subsidiary of Singapore Technologies, are exhibiting their guns at Defexpo.         
	The Indian Army has not inducted a single new heavy gun since the Bofors in 1986, nearly 24 years ago. As a consequence, its artillery is outdated, rusty and largely non-functional.        
	If ST Kinetics request to defer the trials is rejected, it will mean that the upgraded Bofors gun will be the only one for consideration in a repeat of a 2004 scenario.        
	A deferment of the trials could further push back the acquisition, already delayed by a decade, because the army would want to wait for another six months for the winter to set in at the high-altitude terrain.         
	The army is also unsure if the trials should go ahead because it is snowing heavily in Kargil.        
	The iFH 2000, which is engineered to the Indian GSQR (general staff qualitative requirements), was damaged in an accident during transportation before it was shipped to India, an ST Kinetics spokesperson confirmed to The Telegraph.        
	Consequently, we have requested the army to postpone the trials. The replacement parts are being shipped in by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). We are sparing no effort to rapidly repair and air-freight the howitzer to meet the trials. The incident is beyond our control and we have expressed our regret to the Indian Army and the ministry of defence (MoD). The MoD has indicated that they have rescheduled the trials, the ST representative said.        
	But BAe Land Systems said it was ready with its gun, the FH77B05. Our gun is here since before Christmas, said the company spokesperson Guy Douglas. Our trials team is also here. We are ready (for the trials).        
	BAe Land Systems and ST Kinetics are also in the race for an order for ultra-light howitzers. But the Defence Acquisitions Council has approved an outright purchase of the BAEs M777 through the US Foreign Military Sales programme.

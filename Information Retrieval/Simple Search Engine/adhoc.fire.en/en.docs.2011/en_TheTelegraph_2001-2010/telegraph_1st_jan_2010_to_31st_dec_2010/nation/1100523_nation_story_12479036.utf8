The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Students will fly but with prayer on lips

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, May 22: Engineering student Shashank Kidiyur was planning to fly out of Mangalore on Tuesday to meet his parents who live in Dubai  but is now having second thoughts.         
	The best alternative, he says, to abandoning the trip altogether is a long road journey to Chennai or Bangalore, from where he can fly to Dubai.         
	It isnt an appealing prospect to travel to Bangalore or Chennai with luggage, said Kidiyur, who has just completed his second year at the National Institute of Technology in Suratkal, 20km up Indias picturesque western coast from Mangalore. But I would now definitely prefer to fly out of Bangalore or Chennai than from Mangalore.         
	Todays crash of an Air India Express flight from Dubai at Mangalore airport may have scarred the minds of several students who regularly fly on this route. The crash has also revived memories in their minds of unpleasant landings at the airport.         
	Mangalore and its suburbs Manipal and Suratkal are one of Indias biggest higher education hubs and receive hundreds of students from Dubai and West Asia each year, especially in engineering and medicine courses.         
	Apart from NIT Suratkal, rated one of the best NITs in India, Manipal Institute of Technology and Kasturba Medical College  where the survivors are being treated  are among the major draws for these students.         
	Mangalore airport offers two flights  the Air India Express to Dubai and an Air Arabia flight to Sharjah  to West Asia . It is unlikely that the plane which crashed today carried many students, as most major educational institutions in the Mangalore region are closed for vacations.         
	 But for those of us who have to land at Mangalore airport each time we come back from Dubai, this is a terrible shock. I know that each time I now fly in or out of the airport, I will be uttering a prayer or two, said John Jacob, in his fourth year of MBBS at KMC.         
	Students across institutions appeared unanimous that their experience with Mangalore had not been world class  as one student put it.         
	 Rohit Ramachandran, who has just completed his second year of computer engineering at NIT Suratkal, said he would probably prefer continuing to fly out of Mangalore because of the inconvenience of travelling first to Chennai or Bangalore. But my parents may not be as comfortable with me flying out of Mangalore now, said Ramachandran, who is also planning to visit his parents in Dubai.         
	Rameez Abdul Bashir, a student of mechanical engineering at NIT Suratkal, said landings were always really unstable at Mangalore airport. I think I will continue to use Mangalore airport to travel to and from Dubai. But I guess, I will at the back of my mind think about this incident each time I fly, said Bashir.

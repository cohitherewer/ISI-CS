The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naidu blast case sentence
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Naidu blast case sentence
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Oct. 31: The four persons arrested over a 2003 blast targeting N. Chandrababu Naidu and blamed on Maoists were on Friday handed seven-year terms, highlighting the shoddy handling of a case that had shaken Andhras politics.        
	The four included rebel leader Sagar alias Panduranga Reddy, a member of the CPI (Maoist) state committee and number 30 on the list of the accused on which Maoist top guns were mentioned as prime culprits. The other three  M. Ramaswami Reddy, J. Nagarjuna and K.Gangi Reddy  were all civilians and described as accomplices in the crime.        
	The sentence put the spotlight back on the flaws in the case. Of the 33 accused, 11 rebels were killed in police encounters, while nine disappeared after surrendering. The police could produce only 76 of the 96 listed witnesses.        
	After Tirupati judge D. Venkataramana read out the sentence and fined the four Rs 5,000 each, Sagar, who had been brought from jail to the courtroom, accused him of taking a bribe for delivering the verdict and punishment.        
	Naidu was injured in the blast while on his way to the Tirumala temple for the Brahmotsavam festival.               
	Former minister B. Gopalakrishna Reddy, who was with Naidu, also had a close shave.        
	Naidu had dissolved the Assembly prematurely in November 2003 and sought early polls, hoping the Maoist attack would generate enough sympathy for him to ride back to power. But the Election Commission decreed the early dissolution improper and ordered that the polls be held on schedule in April 2004. Naidus Telugu Desam was trounced and the Congress came to power.        
	The Maoists had targeted the Desam chief as they saw him trying to hold negotiations with them even as his government stepped up the offensive against the rebels and the police allegedly bumped off cadres in encounters.

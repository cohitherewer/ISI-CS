The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong ire at Sonia pulp fiction
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong ire at Sonia pulp fiction
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Javier Moro                                  
	New Delhi, June 4: The Congress is determined not to allow into India the Hindi and English versions of a Spanish authors controversial book that claims to give a fictionalised account of Sonia Gandhis life.        
	Congress leaders say Javier Moros El Sari Rojo (The Red Sari) not only contains unsubstantiated accounts of Sonias life but is pulp fiction of the worst kind. The party, however, would prefer legal action to an executive order banning the book.        
	Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi today said the party would file a defamation suit if the book is sold in India.        
	Congress leaders allege that the author has tried to justify the wrong facts he has written by arguing that the book is a fictional biography. They say a book that claims to trace Sonias life since childhood and uses real characters, names and situations cannot be dismissed as a work of fiction.        
	Fictional biography is an oxymoron. You cannot injure the reputation of a living person by using imaginary information about him or her, Singhvi said.        
	Singhvi, who sent Moro a legal notice six months ago, hit back at the author who has accused the Congress of trying to terrorise Indian firms against publishing his book.        
	Moro talking about censorship is worse than the devil quoting the scriptures. We have only sent him a legal notice. The perpetrator is behaving like the victim, Singhvi said.        
	He added that the book had numerous lines, including quotes within inverted commas, that Moro had failed to substantiate when challenged.        
	We gave him over 20 examples and challenged him to substantiate even one. He said it is a fictional account. We then asked him to carry a disclaimer in each book. The text of the disclaimer was agreed upon after months of negotiation. But he backed out at the last minute as he wanted to use this biography for other forms like films, interviews and the Internet, Singhvi said.        
	Congress leaders find Moros portrayal of Sonias thoughts on the day of Rajiv Gandhis assassination vulgar. Moro writes that Sonia simply cannot believe that the man she loves is dead, and she will no longer feel his caresses or the warmth of his kisses.        
	A Congress leader said: The media and the BJP have turned this into a debate on freedom of speech. The Congress reaction can at best be described as mild.

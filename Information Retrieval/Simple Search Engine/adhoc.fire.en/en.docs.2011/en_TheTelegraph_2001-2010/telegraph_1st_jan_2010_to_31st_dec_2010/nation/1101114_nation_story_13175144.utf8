  - Leaders feel media cell went overboard with protests        SANJAY K. JHA                          K Sudarshan                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: The countrywide protests against former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief K. Sudarshan may have acutely embarrassed the Sangh parivar, but the irony is that the way the issue was handled seems to have divided even the Congress.        
	Sudarshan had on Wednesday branded Sonia Gandhi a CIA agent who had conspired to have both Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi killed. The comments prompted Congress media department chief Janardhan Dwivedi to call for strong protests on Thursday and warn that the party could not be blamed if the reaction turned violent.        
	Yesterday, while some Congress leaders argued that Sudarshans sickening fantasies were not worth taking note of, others said the partys formal response the day before betrayed a lack of political finesse.        
	These leaders feel there was no need to read out Sudarshans remarks at Thursdays media briefing as those charges were too filthy and abusive to be repeated. They believe that irresponsible remarks by the countrys lunatic fringe should not be publicised from the official podium of the Congress headquarters.        
	There are definitely better ways of fighting these elements; why should we tell the whole country what a perverted mind feels about our leader? one senior leader said.        
	Party sources said that Dwivedis emotional outburst at the news briefing had not been appreciated by many, who felt his exhortation to Congress workers to organise protests sounded like incitement.        
	This is not the Congress culture. The party could have activated the state units silently without such loud public posturing. It gave the impression that Congress workers would have ignored Sudarshans outrageous remarks without prompting from the high command, an All India Congress Committee official said.        
	Some old-timers also referred to Dwivedis claim that he had called the working committee meeting that asked Sonia to take over the partys reins after Rajivs death. As a joint secretary at that time, Dwivedi would not have been expected to have much to do with such high-level political action.        
	Dwivedis digressions about Rajivs honesty and bike rides with Sonia too are being viewed as a projection of his personal proximity to the Gandhi family.        
	Although party leaders expressed satisfaction at the pressure mounted on the Sangh over Sudarshans remarks, they said Thursdays improper response had revealed a larger malaise afflicting the partys communication system.        
	The media department had recently got entangled in two controversies. One, when it failed to defend Rajiv over the release of Union Carbide chief Warren Anderson after the Bhopal gas leak, and two, when it heartily welcomed the Ayodhya verdict after it was passed without commenting on the Babri demolition.        
	The Congress Working Committee had to meet to do a course correction by shifting focus on the demolition and stress that the land suit would eventually be decided by the Supreme Court.        
	These mistakes have happened despite Dwivedi  a senior leader and the first media department chief who is also a general secretary having the advantage of being an insider and part of the partys think tank.        
	Except for Ambika Soni, the previous media heads such as Shivraj Patil, Jaipal Reddy and Girija Vyas  did not have this advantage and had to depend on regular briefings from general secretaries.

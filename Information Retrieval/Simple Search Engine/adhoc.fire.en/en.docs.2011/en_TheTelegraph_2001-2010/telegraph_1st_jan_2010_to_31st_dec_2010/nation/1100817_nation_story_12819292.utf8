          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 16: Karnataka today alleged that lack of co-operation from the Kerala government was delaying the arrest of cleric-turned-politician Abdul Nasser Madhany in the 2008 Bangalore blasts case.        
	The Kerala government promised co-operation but its not coming. Madhany said he would surrender but it hasnt happened. So well have to look at other options, Karnataka home minister V.S. Acharya told a TV channel.        
	Madhany is accused of taking part in the blast conspiracy at Kudagu. His party, the PDP, was the ruling Lefts ally in recent elections.        
	An imminent arrest drama has been on for several days at the Anwarssery orphanage in Keralas Kollam district, where Madhany has been camping. Officially, Kerala police are awaiting a go-ahead from a Karnataka police team that arrived in Kollam on August 10 with a non-bailable arrest warrant.        
	The warrant expires tomorrow, and Madhany developed chest pain today. Doctors are waiting for blood test results before declaring him fit to travel. The serial delays have given Madhany time to petition the apex court against the high courts rejection of his anticipatory bail plea.

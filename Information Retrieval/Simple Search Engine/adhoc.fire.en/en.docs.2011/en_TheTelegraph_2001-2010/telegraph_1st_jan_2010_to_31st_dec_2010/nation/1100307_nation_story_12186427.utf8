	Chandigarh, March 6: The parents of the three-year-old Indian boy who was found dead by a roadside during a visit to Australia were questioned for five hours by police today.         
	Tim Singh Laurence, the councillor of Darebin city in Melbourne, told The Telegraph that Harjit and his wife Harpreet were questioned to ascertain the exact time of Gurshan Singh Channas disappearance, and were asked if they suspected anyone.         
	The body of Gurshan, who was to return to India on March 12, was found by a municipal worker on a patch of grassland near Melbourne airport on Thursday, six hours after he had vanished from his home in the northern suburbs of the city.        
	Gurshan wanted to accompany his father to a local library. He had started crying after Harjit left without him. Nobody knows whether he opened the door latch and followed his father or left later or was taken away by someone, Laurence said over the phone.         
	Laurence said the area where the family was staying was considered safe and that 85 per cent of its residents were migrants.         
	The autopsy report does not mention foul play. More tests need to be conducted to determine the cause of death, Laurence said.         
	The area (where Gurshans family stayed) is a very busy one and is near the airport. Any child wandering alone can be spotted easily, he added.         
	The toddlers parents were today allowed to see the body at a coroners court in Melbourne.        
	Though Harpreet and Harjit have been avoiding the media, they have been meeting leaders and members of different communities as well as officials from the Indian consulate.

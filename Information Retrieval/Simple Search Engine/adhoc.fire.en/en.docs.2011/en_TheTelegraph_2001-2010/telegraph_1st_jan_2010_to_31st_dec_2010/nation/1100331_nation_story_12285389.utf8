          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, March 30: Students who earn ranks in this years Indian Institute of Technology entrance exam can for the first time pick their institute and course at the click of a mouse  even sitting at home.         
	The countrys top engineering colleges have decided to abandon a tense counselling session that all students till now had to attend to gain admission.         
	From now on, students will be asked to select online the IIT where they want to study as well as the course, through a facility the institutes have prepared, IIT officials told The Telegraph.         
	The decision to end counselling sessions was taken by the Joint Admission Board of the IITs  their highest decision-making body on admissions  at a meeting in Chennai on March 15.         
	There will be no more counselling sessions. Students will pick their IIT and course online based on their rank in the Joint Entrance Examination, an IIT administrator involved with the 2010 admissions said.         
	The IITs are still finalising the dates for the online sessions where students will be able to log in and pick an IIT along with the course of their choice on the basis of their ranks.         
	The IITs will offer approximately 7,500 undergraduate seats this year across myriad streams of engineering. Students are picked on the basis of the JEE.         
	 Students who appear for the IIT-JEE invariably also appear for other competitive examinations that offer a gateway to seats at other institutions like the National Institutes of Technology. Like the IIT-JEE, other competitive examinations are also followed by counselling sessions.        
	 These sessions of different competitive examinations often clash, forcing students to pick between institutions. The end of the IIT counselling sessions will help ease this tension for students.         
	IIT rankers seeking admission through quotas for the Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), Other Backward Classes (OBCs) or the physically handicapped (PH) will, however, need to physically submit certificates establishing their right to the reservation.         
	These students can either seek counselling physically when they travel to an IIT to submit documents, or can pick their institute and course online under the plan, sources said.        
	IIM fee hike        
	IIM Ahmedabad has raised the admission fee for its postgraduate programme (PGP) batch of 2010-2012 to Rs 13.7 lakh, a 9.6 per cent hike from the Rs 12.5 lakh the 2009-11 batch paid, PTI reported. The fee includes all costs other than food.

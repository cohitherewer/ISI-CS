                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Judge scoffs at claim by gay baiter
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 4: A petitioner earned Indias top judges scorn today by arguing that legalising gay sex would boost male prostitution.        
	Do you have the statistics to prove your claims? a visibly irritated Chief Justice of India (CJI) K.G. Balakrishnan asked in the Supreme Court.        
	He dubbed the claim a figment of (the petitioners) imagination and threw out the plea for a temporary stay on the recent Delhi High Court verdict decriminalising all consensual and private adult sex.        
	Can you produce any sort of data to back your claims? the CJI had asked petitioner Joint Action Committee, a Kannur-based NGO.        
	Or, can you show us some FIRs which have been registered to show that such prostitution has increased?        
	The NGOs lawyer claimed he could present email correspondence relating to male prostitution that would prove that such solicitation was on the rise.        
	The CJI refused to hear him. We cant go by email exchanges, he said. He added scathingly: We cannot go by a figment of your imagination.        
	Delhi High Court had last year rescued all consensual adult sex from the axe of Section 377 of the penal code  which bans unnatural sex  but allowed the section to be retained as a deterrent to child abuse.        
	The Kannur-based NGO had lost that case against pro-gay rights Naz Foundation, and later filed an appeal in the apex court.        
	The high court judgment has outraged many religious and cultural groups. The ruling legalises not only homosexual relationships but many forms of heterosexual sex so far banned as unnatural.        
	RTI veto        
	The Right to Information (RTI) Act cannot be used to force a judge or judicial officer to reveal how he had made up his mind in a case, the apex court said today.        
	Judges usually give reasoned orders, and these can be challenged only in a higher court, it said.        
	RTI cannot be used against a judge to explain a judgment, the CJI observed. Judges only speak through their judgments.        
	He warned of action against lawyers who file such RTI petitions.        
	The apex court dismissed an appeal against an April 2009 Andhra Pradesh High Court order that had said: Information (under RTI) does not mean any information but only such information which is recorded and stored and circulated by the public authority. What transpired in the mind of the judge would not come under (the) definition of record.        
	Andhra resident K. Gandhaiah had filed the appeal. Earlier, he had through an RTI application asked a district judge to explain an order that went against him in a land dispute. He had accused the judge of judicial dishonesty.        
	The Information Officer of the Ranga Reddy district court and later the high court rejected his plea for such information.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 17: The Supreme Court today set aside a Calcutta High Court ruling ordering perjury cases against cricket board chief Sharad Pawar and five others for allegedly filing a false affidavit on Jagmohan Dalmiyas expulsion.        
	A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan directed the high court to look afresh into Dalmiyas complaint and hear arguments by Pawar and the other board officials before deciding whether a perjury case was justified.        
	Appearing for Pawar, attorney-general G.E. Vahanvati argued that the high court judge had ordered the perjury case without hearing Pawar and the others. The others included BCCI president Shashank Manohar, chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty, secretary N. Srinivasan, vice-president Chirayu Amin and ex-secretary Niranjan Shah.        
	The high court had set aside the expulsion of Dalmiya  a former board president  over alleged financial irregularities and ordered the perjury cases in November 2008.

	New Delhi, Sept. 20: The Centre has given its nod to set up 20 Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) in partnership with state governments and the private sector.        
	The expenditure finance committee under the finance ministry that had earlier suggested deferring the setting up of the IIITs to the 12th plan period, gave its go-ahead on Friday after the human resource development ministry modified the proposal.         
	The IIITs will be set up during the 11th and 12th plan periods. The earlier proposal had said the institutes should have to be set up within the 11th plan period.         
	Each institute will come up at the cost of Rs 100 crore to Rs 130 crore. The earlier proposal had said each institute would cost around Rs 200 crore, an estimate the finance ministry rejected.         
	The HRD ministry will bring a separate IIIT bill in Parliament to make them statutory bodies so they can offer degree courses. Apart from providing 50 per cent of the capital, the Centre will also take care of the recurring costs for four years.         
	After four years, the government will completely withdraw from financing the institutes. Then the institutes will be managed by the private sector, a senior ministry official told The Telegraph.         
	The private players, however, would not be allowed to charge exorbitant fees. Decision on the fees and other administrative matters will be taken by the governing body of each IIIT that will have an HRD ministry official as well as a state government representative.         
	The state governments will provide 35 per cent of the costs and the land for setting up of the institutes. Each will specialise in areas that are of importance for that state and its industry.         
	The private sector partner, which will provide 15 per cent of the costs, will benefit as it will get skilled manpower from the institutes for its industry.         
	The process for setting up of the institutes will start after the IIIT Act comes into effect. The ministry plans to set up five IIITs in 2011-12 and the rest during the 12th Plan period (2012-17).         
	Each IIIT, according to the new plan, would be a centre of excellence and would concentrate more on basic than applied research.        
	There are four IIITs in the country already and they are solely centrally-funded.

  - Revenue loss of Rs 25 crore in Commonwealth broadcast rights deal brings Kalmadi panel under scanner        JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: Suresh Kalmadi, the beleaguered chairman of the organising committee of the Commonwealth Games, has now been sucked into another controversy over the way the international broadcasting rights for the Games were farmed out.        
	Auditors trawling payments sanctioned by the organising committee have stumbled upon deals struck through Fast Track Sales Ltd that led to a projected revenue loss of Rs 24.6 crore. Fast Track Sales had been picked as a consultant for farming out international broadcasting rights.        
	An inspection report submitted by the director-general of audit has slammed the executive committee for the way it appointed Fast Track Sales. The report says: No detailed technical evaluation of the bidders was carried out before approving M/s Fast Track Sales Ltd as consultant for international broadcast rights.        
	It says that the agreement with Fast Track Sales provided for a commission of 15 per cent of the broadcasting rights fees  2.5 per cent higher than what the other bidder was asking for. The result: a revenue loss of Rs 5.2 crore.        
	The report said tenders were received from only two firms  M/s Sports Marketing and Management (SMAM), Australia, and Fast Track Events, London. The bids were opened in June 2006.         
	SMAM and Fast Track Sales were invited to make presentations on June 6, 2006, and their proposals were placed before the board. SMAM had proposed a flat rate of commission of 12.5 per cent on the broadcast rights while Fast Track Sales had sought 15 per cent.         
	The audit report said the executive board approved the deal with Fast Track Sales on the basis of suggestions made by Mike Fennel, president and CEO of the Commonwealth Games federation and organising committee chairman Kalmadi.         
	The inspection revealed that under the terms of the deal, Fast Track had promised to strike a deal of $7.5 million from the broadcast rights for the UK/Ireland region.         
	The consultant (Fast Track ) was unable to finalise any deal in that region as late as April 2010 as BBC  to whom a sales pitch was being made  remained unconvinced about the successful conduct of the Games, says the report.         
	Ultimately, the organising committee told auditors that they had to negotiate a deal with the BBC at a far lower fee of $3.36 million.         
	The report said: This resulted in a projected loss of revenue of Rs 18.63 crore.         
	Similarly, the organising committee signed an agreement with Network Ten Australia in January 2008 but dilly-dallied on raising an invoice for close to five months because the consultant advised it to first seek a tax exemption that was unavailable under Australian tax laws.         
	The report said: The mistake cost OC a loss of interest of Rs 39.13 lakh.         
	There were similar delays in 10 other cases resulting in a loss of interest amounting to Rs 18.06 crore.

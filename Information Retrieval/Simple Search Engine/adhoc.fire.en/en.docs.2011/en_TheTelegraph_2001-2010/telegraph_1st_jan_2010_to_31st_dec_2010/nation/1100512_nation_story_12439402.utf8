          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 11: The official-level talks between the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, Bengal government and the Centre failed today following differences over the territory to come under the jurisdiction of the interim authority proposed for the hills.        
	The Morcha indicated it might boycott the political-level talks, tentatively scheduled for May end, if the governments did not agree to discuss territory. It submitted a fresh document to justify its demand for the inclusion of Siliguri and portions of the Dooars and the Terai under the interim set-up.        
	At the meeting, a precursor to the second round of political talks, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri insisted that no talks were possible without the inclusion of Siliguri, the Terai and the Dooars. We will go back to Darjeeling and decide whether to participate in the political talks, he said.        
	Bengal home secretary Samar Ghosh said the meeting was meant to discuss the interim authoritys powers. A discussion on territory was not part of it. We could not discuss anything.        
	In Calcutta, chief secretary Ardhendu Sen said: The talks did not collapse, only the date for the next round could not be fixed.        
	Home ministry officials said the areas demanded by the Morcha has substantial tribal and Rajbangshi populations.

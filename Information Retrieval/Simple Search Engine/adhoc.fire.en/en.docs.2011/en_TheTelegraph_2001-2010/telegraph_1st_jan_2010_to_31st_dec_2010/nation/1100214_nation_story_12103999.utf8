          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Feb. 13: The BJP tonight demanded that the Centre reconsider the decision to hold talks with Pakistan and accused the Maharashtra government of focusing too much on My Name is Khan at the cost of security.        
	Terror and talks cannot go together, BJP spokesperson Prakash Jawadekar, who visited the blast site in Pune, said. Jawadekar said the blast was a terrorist attack and asked what is the logic in holding talks?        
	In New Delhi, the BJP claimed that the Maharashtra government was engaged in protecting the makers of My Name is Khan, leaving the terrorists free to carry out the attack.         
	The whole Congress-led government and police in Maharashtra were engaged in protecting the interests of the actor, director, producer and distributor of My Name is Khan on the orders of Rahul Gandhi, BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said. This left the terrorists free to attack innocent people in Pune.         
	The Congress termed the BJP statement pathetic. Nobody should play politics with the security of the country, party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said. This is a time for all of us to stay united.

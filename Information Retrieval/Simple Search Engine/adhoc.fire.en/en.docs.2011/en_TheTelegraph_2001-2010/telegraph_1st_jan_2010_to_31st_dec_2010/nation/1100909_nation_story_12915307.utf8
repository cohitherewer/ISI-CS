          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: The human resource development ministry today suspended M. Chidambaram, the director of the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, for misconduct and asked him to join his parent institute, IIT Madras, immediately.         
	Chidambaram has been held guilty of defying the decisions of the NIT management.         
	He expressed surprise at his suspension. I do not even know what my mistakes are. I was never told about the allegations against me, he said.         
	However, Chidambaram admitted that some management officials disliked his way of functioning. He said the officials might have complained to the government against him.        
	A former professor of IIT Madras, Chidambaram had taken charge as the Tiruchirappalli institutes director in 2005 when it was a regional engineering college. The tech college was upgraded to an NIT in 2007 along with 19 other institutions through an act of Parliament.

  - No threat to chair, Sonia and Singh tell chief minister        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A TV grab of Omar Abdullah talking to the media in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, July 17: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today told Omar Abdullah not to worry about his continuance as Jammu and Kashmir chief minister as the party had no plans to disturb the coalition arrangement despite machinations by a section of local leaders.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also assured the National Conference leader of full central assistance in restoring normality in the protest-racked state.         
	The Congress leadership had called Omar to discuss political and administrative issues in the face of recent troubles in the state and speculation about a change of guard.         
	The series of meetings with the central leaders came in the wake of uninterrupted violence in the state where 15 people have died in clashes with security forces.        
	Omar had been worried as a section of Congress leaders, allegedly with the encouragement of Union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, prefers his father Farooq Abdullah to take over as chief minister if the Congress doesnt stake claim.         
	Sources said both Sonia and Manmohan asked Omar to concentrate on his work and not get affected by the political rumblings that cannot be stamped out.        
	 Farooq, too, dismissed as baseless suggestions about his taking over the reins, saying his son had the complete backing of the entire country.        
	It (speculation that I want to become chief minister) is totally wrong and baseless. I want to make it very clear that there is no such thing. Omar is the chief minister and has the backing of the entire country, the former chief minister said in an interview.         
	Farooq also said he had never received the support Omar was getting from the Centre when he was chief minister.                   A jawan keeps vigil in Srinagar on Saturday after curfew was lifted. Hours later, separatists called a shutdown. (PTI)      
	Sources said Omar had a good understanding with the Congress leadership and his personal rapport with Rahul Gandhi had also helped him overcome minor hiccups in coalition politics.         
	Omar, who also met home minister P. Chidambaram to discuss administrative matters, particularly the role of external players in abetting the recent crisis and ways to deal with hardliners within the separatist Hurriyat Conference, dismissed suggestions that he was not in control.        
	 Had I lost control, the situation would have been worst... he said.        
	At the meetings with the central leaders, sources said, Omar blamed vested interests for fuelling the violence.         
	He told reporters later that a section of local youths felt alienated and some of them were being used, but added that by the grace of god and the efforts of the government, there has been no casualty since Tuesday last. People are still coming to various places and protesting but fortunately not with the intensity (of) what we have seen in the past.        
	On the armys role in Kashmir, Omar said it was part of the counter-insurgency grid and of the necessary deployment on the Line of Control and along the border. Beyond that, he said, the army had no role.

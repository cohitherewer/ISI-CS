The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trade tops PMs Malaysia agenda
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Trade tops PMs Malaysia agenda
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	Kuala Lumpur, Oct. 26: Nine years since Atal Bihari Vajpayee became the last Indian Prime Minister to visit Malaysia, New Delhi believes its relations with the country have transformed enormously.        
	Indian officials point to the spurt in bilateral trade: from $1 billion in 2001, the figure touched $10 billion in 2008. It dipped to $7.8 billion this year but is projected to be buoyant in 2011.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who landed in Kuala Lumpur for a two-day trip, is expected to work on this potential.        
	His Malaysian counterpart, Mohammad Najib, recognised the potential as soon as he took office in 2009. Steering clear of the usual flight path to the US or to some other western power, Najib had made Delhi his first port of call, followed later by China, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.         
	Official sources said it was a conscious decision to give an orientation to his policy of tapping the worlds big markets.         
	Najib underscored his intention by including as many as six cabinet ministers in his delegation to India.        
	The sources said Najib also wanted to move away from the other countries given emphasis by his predecessors.         
	When Singh meets Najib on Wednesday, three issues are expected to dominate the agenda: economics, the need to carry forward the strategic orientation enshrined in the 2009 bilateral Delhi document and politics.        
	The two leaders will also launch a CEO forum that is expected to give a boost to business. An outcome document that will highlight the expectations of both sides is expected.        
	Already inbound investments from India worth $2.5 billion flowed into the Malaysian private sector, some through holding companies. Reliance, for instance, has set up its largest polyester textile unit, and Wipro has acquired Unza, its biggest healthcare hygiene company.         
	Malaysia, said sources, is as keen to benefit from Indias economic growth.        
	India and Malaysia are also engaged in negotiations to conclude a Comprehensive Economic Co-operation Agreement or Ceca  similar to the Cepa treaty that will be clinched with Japan. The Ceca will be a single undertaking encompassing goods, services, investments and other areas of co-operation.        
	That India and Malaysia are in a rush to conclude it was evident in the fact that seven rounds of talks were held in as many months.        
	The sources, however, said Singh was unlikely to raise the ethnic turmoil affecting citizens of Indian-origin, mainly Tamils.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 19: The BJP may decide tomorrow if it should join the nationwide general strike against price rise on April 27, called by a Left-led 13-party front.        
	Sushma Swaraj said the party core committee would meet tomorrow to firm up its strategy. But the indications are the party is not too keen on an engagement with the Left and its allies outside Parliament lest that impact its image as the only national alternative to the Congress.        
	The BJP is staging its own protest against food price inflation on April 21, when a public meeting will end in a march towards Parliament.        
	CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, however, denied that the Left parties had asked the BJP to join the hartal they are spearheading. But Samajwadi Party and RJD sources claimed they had approached NDA partner Janata Dal (United), asking it and the BJP to join the strike.

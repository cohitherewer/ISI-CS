The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Interim nod to Muslim job quota   Constitution bench to decide
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Interim nod to Muslim job quota     Constitution bench to decide
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          The Supreme Court                                        
	New Delhi, March 25: The Supreme Court today cleared as an interim step a four per cent job and education quota for 14 backward classes of Muslims in Andhra Pradesh, keeping out the creamy layer among them.        
	The court was hearing an appeal by the states Congress government against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order of February 8, 2010, that had struck the quota down for the third time.        
	The reservations  introduced and implemented by the state in 2004, 2005 and again in 2007  will now stay in force till an apex court Constitution bench decides on two petitions challenging the quota, to be heard from the second week of August.        
	The high court had shot down the quota on the grounds that it provided for religion-based reservation in violation of the Constitution, and that the state government had failed to identify all the beneficiary groups before implementing the reservation.         
	The Andhra law allows reservation for 14 Muslim groups that it names, as well as for all other backward Muslims except certain sections it specifies as advanced classes.        
	But the apex court bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) K.G. Balakrishnan, defended its interim order allowing quotas for the 14 categories named.        
	Identification of all such socially and educationally backward classes of Muslims will take time. It may take for ever. Why should those already identified as socially and educationally backward classes among Muslims be denied the benefits till then? the CJI said.        
	He said the state backward commission could in the interim  before the Constitution bench decides the issue carry out a survey to identify all the backward Muslim groups.        
	The issue of the states failure to specify every beneficiary group was raised in the apex court today by lawyers Harish N. Salve and Ramakrishna Reddy, who appeared for the anti-quota petitioners, VHP general secretary T. Murlidhar Rao and K. Sriteja.        
	This will make it possible for all Muslims except the affluent to get such quotas, Salve said. This is thinly disguised religious reservation. It is obvious that certain sections among Muslims are backward. Include them in Other Backward Classes.        
	The CJI rejected these arguments, saying: Dont say Muslims or Hindus. If certain sections are backward, they must get reservation.        
	It had been T. Murlidhar Rao who had challenged the quota in the high court all the three times the state government tried to introduce it. In 2004, it had brought the quota in through a government order, and the following two times through legislation.        
	Today, appearing for the state, attorney-general G.E. Vahanvati said: The starting point is social-economic backwardness, not religion, requiring a push. The lower the caste or occupation, the more backward the class. The label or identity has not changed social status in functions like deaths and marriages.        
	He said that providing reservation to certain occupational sections in one religion and not providing them in another had created a legally anomalous situation.        
	Vahanvati said religions other than Hinduism did not have a caste system but had all kinds of caste-like groups, such as the concept of biradari or jamait among Muslims who follow particular occupations and practise endogamy.        
	Senior counsel K. Parasaran, also appearing for the government, argued that a slight change in the name of a caste within another religion did not make it socially advanced.        
	You cannot give quotas to backwards among Hindus and not give it to backwards among Muslims. This is against Article 14 (right to equality), he argued.        
	The 14 beneficiary groups include fakirs, tanners, palm-leaf weavers, butchers, dhobis, stone-crushers, brush makers, magic show performers, attar makers, burial ground workers and barbers.        
	Those the state has declared socially and educationally advanced, and thus outside the ambit of the quota, are the Syeds, Mughals, Pathans, Iranis, Arabs, Ismailis, Vohras and the Imamis.

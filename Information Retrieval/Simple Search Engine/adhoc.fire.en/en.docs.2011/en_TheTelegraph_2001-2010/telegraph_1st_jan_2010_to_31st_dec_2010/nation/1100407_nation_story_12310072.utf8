	Patna, April 6: Rebellion in the JD(U) came to the fore today with dissidents organising a parallel meeting against the official state executive meeting today and questioning Nitish Kumars stand on the sharecroppers issue.        
	Former state party chief and MP from Munger, Lallan Singh, and senior leader Prabhunath Singh are the members of the state executive committee. But instead of joining the official meeting, the leaders shared the dais with RJD leader Akhilesh Singh and Independent MP from Banka, Digvijay Singh.        
	Prabhunath said: The Nitish government is working against the interests of the landowning people, for it harbours the wish to give ownership right to share croppers.        
	The rebels said they were holding the meet as part of their preparation to organise kisan panchayat to expose how the Nitish government was working against the interests of land owners.        
	Nitish, however, clarified that there was no sharecroppers bill pending with his government and he has no intention to implement the Bandyopadhyay Committees report.         
	Sources in the party revealed that the sharecroppers bill was only a pretext to put Nitish under pressure during the poll year. But state JD(U) president Vijay Choudhary said: Differences in the party will be sorted out soon. The JD(U) stays united and one.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Oct. 28: Four persons died after a blast at an illegal cracker unit in a health department residential complex near Kanpur, with the impact bringing down the two-storied building and damaging an adjoining health centre.        
	Twelve people were injured in the 3pm explosion and police said the number of deaths could go up as some residents were still feared trapped in the debris of the government building in Kalyanpurs Barah Sirohi, 25km from Kanpur town.        
	A bigger devastation was averted as the government health centre  with no facilities for admitting patients, who are only examined and given medicines  was closed at the time of the blast. It is open in the mornings.        
	Deputy inspector-general Prem Prakash said prima facie evidence pointed to an illegal cracker factory in the quarters. Small-size crackers were being produced at the unit in the quarters. We have collected samples of them from the spot of the blast. Further investigations are on. It does not appear to be a terror act.        
	The dead included a woman and a ward boy of the health centre. Of the 12 injured, four are children and eight women.         
	Inspector-general G.L. Meena said raw materials used to manufacture crackers had been found in the debris. The suspicion is that such items were stored there and used to make the crackers illegally. The blast occurred in the staff quarters. The affected building has six such quarters, Meena said, adding the rescue was on.

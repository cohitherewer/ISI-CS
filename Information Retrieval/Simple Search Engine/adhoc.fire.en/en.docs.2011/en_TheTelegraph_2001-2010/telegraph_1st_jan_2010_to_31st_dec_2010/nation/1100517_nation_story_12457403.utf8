                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Eight virgin Kashmir destinations by helicopter

	Srinagar, May 16: If you have plans of touring Kashmir next year, dont draw the line at visiting the usual spots  the Line of Control awaits you.        
	The Jammu and Kashmir government is connecting eight virgin locales  some of them on the LoC and no-go areas for decades  by air safaris.         
	Breathtakingly beautiful, these far-flung places are also known for being trouble spots and have, therefore, remained largely unexplored.        
	For the last two decades, the only visitors to some of these places have been gun-wielding militants sneaking into Kashmir. But officials said these areas were mostly peaceful now.         
	The eight destinations include Bangus, Gurez Valley and Lolab in the Kashmir Valley, Zanskar in Ladakh, and Doda, Kishtwar, Poonch and Rajouri in Jammu. Bangus, Gurez, Poonch and Rajouri are border areas.         
	We have shortlisted eight places in the first phase. All these places have a great tourist potential but, for some reasons, not many people go there.         
	Our aim is to showcase the unexplored and attract high-end visitors, said state tourism minister Nasir Aslam Wani.         
	The plan involves construction of helipads in these areas, so that choppers can fly in tourists, and creation of other infrastructure.         
	They are all safe places and completely secured. We want tourists to save their travel time. We also dont want them to worry about what they might encounter travelling by road, a government official said.         
	But the government is also aware of the threat development might pose to the ecosystem of these virgin zones. So no concrete structures will be built to house the tourists, the official said. Instead, we will have tented accommodation for the guests.         
	Wani said the government would soon float countrywide tenders for the air safaris. The Jammu and Kashmir Tourist Development Corporation will be the nodal agency to co-ordinate the air safaris, the minister added.         
	The state government already has plans to develop Bangus, 95km from Srinagar, as a biosphere with emphasis on eco-tourism.         
	Spread over 300sqkm and ringed by the lofty Shamsbari, Rajwar and Mawar mountain ranges, it is bigger than any other existing tourist resort in Jammu and Kashmir.         
	It would take a trekker 10 days to walk around the valley and it has the potential for adventure tourism, trekking, camping, skiing, fishing and a lot more, said Saleem Baig, a former director-general in the tourism department.         
	Some 50 species of animals, including musk deer, antelope, snow leopard, red foxes and bears, live here, while 19 streams criss-cross the carpet of green grass that covers the area.         
	Gurez, around 140km from Srinagar, is home to the ethnic Dards and the valley has six high-altitude pastures and several camping sites.        
	Sir Walter Lawrence, the British settlement commissioner of Kashmir who visited Gurez in 1894, had described the Valley as the most beautiful of Kashmirs valleys.        
	The famous Kishen Ganga river flows through the valley before entering Neelam Valley in Pakistan.         
	Restrictions on visiting Lolab Valley, 110km from Srinagar, have been fewer, though it remained infested with militants for long.

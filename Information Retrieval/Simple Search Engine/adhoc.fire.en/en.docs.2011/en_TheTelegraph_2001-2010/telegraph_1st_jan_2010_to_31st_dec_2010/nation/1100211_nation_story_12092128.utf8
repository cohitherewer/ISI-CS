	Washington, Feb. 10 (PTI): About two lakh Indians had been living illegally in America in 2009, a report prepared by the US homeland security department has claimed.        
	The report, which compiles data for 2009, says the number of illegal Indian residents in the US has increased by 40,000 over 2008 figures.        
	The number of unauthorised foreign residents in America has, however, decreased from 11.6 million to 10.8 million in the same period  a drop of 7 per cent  the report, released yesterday, said.         
	Between 2000 and 2007, the unauthorised population grew by 3.3 million  from 8.5 million to 11.8 million, the report, titled Estimates of the Unauthorised Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: January 2009, claimed.         
	The number of unauthorised residents declined by 1 million between 2007 and 2009, coincident with the US economic downturn, the report revealed.         
	The highest number of unauthorised residents in the US were from Mexico (6.7 million).

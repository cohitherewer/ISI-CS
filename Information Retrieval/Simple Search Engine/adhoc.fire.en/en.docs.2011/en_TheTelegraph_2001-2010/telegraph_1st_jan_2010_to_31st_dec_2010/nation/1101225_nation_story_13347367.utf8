          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: The Congress is showing signs of decay, a CPM mouthpiece has said, the criticism coinciding with disclosures today that the Centre had asked for the Left partys cadres to be disarmed in Bengal.        
	Ironically, the Peoples Democracy editorial comes at a time the CPM has itself started a rectification campaign to stem the perceived rot from long stints in power, especially in Bengal where it has ruled for 34 years.        
	In West Bengal, the Congress party is playing the role of a junior partner to the Trinamul Congress in its violent assaults on the CPI(M) and the Left, the editorial said, less than a week after a Congress political resolution at its plenary accused the Left of resorting to a cycle of political violence in Bengal and Kerala.        
	The editorial is devoted almost entirely to attacking the Congress. It paints a picture of the Congress under siege in its 125th year, faced with corruption charges, price rise, revolt in Andhra Pradesh and the poor performance in the Bihar polls.         
	The Congress party shows symptoms of decay which has set in due to corrosive effects of becoming an instrument of the big bourgeoisie for power and privileges, divorced from the problems and issues of the aam aadmi, the editorial says, taking a dig at the emphasis on the common man in the Congresss campaigns and policies.        
	With reference to Left-ruled Tripura, the editorial accuses the Congress of allying with the separatist forces since the time of Rajiv Gandhi.         
	In Tripura, the Congress has the history from the time of Rajiv Gandhi of allying with the separatist forces which have been indulging in terrorist violence just to weaken the CPM and the Left Front.         
	The write-up denies the Congresss charge that the Left parties are working in tandem with the BJP  an allusion to the way both sides stalled Parliament  and says the allegations are a canard. The CPM, it says, opposes the policies of both the parties.         
	Over corruption, the editorial says: The Congress leadership sees nothing wrong in having its ministers in government promoting the interests of big corporates and getting favours in return.

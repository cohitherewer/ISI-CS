          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 13: Sixteen Naxalites surrendered in Gajapati district today, underlining the success of the combing operations by security forces and mass-contact programmes held by the administration.        
	Never have so many Maoists surrendered together in the past in Orissa.         
	Confirming the surrenders, Gajapati superintendent of police Sanjeev Arora said that the 16 rebels included a Class VIII student. He claimed that the surrendering Maoists had cited torture by seniors and disillusionment with the cause. Under the rehabilitation policy announced by the state in 2006, rebels who surrender will get cash and land.         
	Along with the mass-contact programmes aimed at drawing the Maoists to the mainstream, district-level operations are on against the rebels in the border areas, particularly Gajapati and Malkangiri bordering Andhra Pradesh and Keonjhar on the Jharkhand border.        
	In Jharkhand and Bengal, the first, four-day phase of joint operations against the Maoists ended on Thursday.         
	Bengal inspector-general of police Surajit Kar Purkayastha said the first phase had been exploratory in nature and had revealed three abandoned rebel camps  one in Bengals Belpahari and two in Jharkhand.        
	According to senior officers, the rebels are finding it difficult to flee as the border areas of both states are being heavily guarded.

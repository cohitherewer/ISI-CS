The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Super   coach to meet PM 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Super   coach to meet PM 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                    
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: After training select intelligent, but poor, students to crack the IIT entrance examination, math teacher Anand Kumar will now share his vision for school education with the Prime Minister.         
	Manmohan Singh has invited Kumar tomorrow to personally deliver a presentation on his vision for Indian education, and the founder of one of the countrys biggest coaching successes cant wait. I am indeed fortunate to have been given this opportunity. I want to share several ideas with the Prime Minister, but I am particularly keen on IIT reforms and on building an ideal school, Kumar told The Telegraph.        
	Kumar, who has been teaching since 1997, started the Super 30 coaching classes in Patna for poor students in 2003 with an Indian Police Service officer, Abhayanand. The class selects 30 bright, but poor, students each year and trains them to clear the IIT Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), considered one of the toughest examinations in the world.         
	Between 2003 and 2008, 182 of the 210 students the coaching centre had picked won seats at the IITs. Its success rate of 87 per cent far exceeds that of other private IIT coaching centres in the country.        
	In 2008, Kumar and Abhayanand split, but the former retained the original Super 30 classes, and the success rate, last year.        
	Now, Kumar said he wanted to focus on schooling. But his vision appears focused on cracking competitive examinations. I want to create a school from which students can crack the IITs, civil services and other competitive examinations without external coaching, Kumar said.

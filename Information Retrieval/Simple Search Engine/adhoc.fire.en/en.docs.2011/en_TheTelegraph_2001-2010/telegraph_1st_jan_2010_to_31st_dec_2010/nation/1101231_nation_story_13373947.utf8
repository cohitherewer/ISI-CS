The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Yen and rial way out of Iran oil block
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Yen and rial way out of Iran oil block
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 30 (Agencies): The yen and the Iranian rial have emerged as options to pay for crude imports from Iran a day before the Reserve Bank of India officials meet their Tehran counterparts in Mumbai to discuss new payment mechanisms.        
	It can be any currency. It could be yen or (Irans) local currency, petroleum secretary S. Sundareshan said here today, after the RBI decided to stop payments through dollars or euros through an Iran-based payment system because of pressure from the US which believes Tehran is running a rogue nuclear programme.        
	Some reports even suggested rupee as an alternative  much like South Korea which pays Iran in Korean won  to break the deadlock that threatens to stall supplies from Indias second-largest source of oil imports.        
	Iran has refused to sell oil under the new rules. But Sundareshan offered hopes of a solution within days. We are working on an alternative settlement mechanism. It is being discussed at length with the ministry of finance and a solution will be found in the course of the next few days, he told a news conference.        
	The payments were so far being made through the Tehran-based Asian Clearing Union (ACU), which settles trade transactions from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, Maldives, Myanmar and Sri Lanka.         
	Till 2008, payments under the ACU were made in US dollars but after US imposed sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme, the euro became the preferred currency. But the European Central Bank recently asked the RBI to provide certificates the euro would not be used to import products on a list of US sanctions.        
	Sources said such a certification for oil imports was easy to provide and track, but the RBI chose to scrap the entire ACU system. The ACU mechanism, which was for all commodity and business transactions, is under some stress and the RBI wants to make changes in this mechanism, Sundareshan said.        
	 At their meeting with officials of the Irans central bank, expected to last a few days, sources said the RBI managers could finalise a panel of banks through which payments can be made. Indian importers can open letters of credit, which are often required for buyer and seller of a cargo to guarantee payment upon delivery or at an agreed future date. One trader said these are already used by some of Irans oil trade partners.        
	But the bank where the money has to be transferred to is missing from the chain. Finding an alternative bank will be difficult as EIH Bank of Germany, which used to act as a facilitator for such transactions for the ACU members, has been brought under US sanctions along with the Tehran-owned European-Iranian Trade Bank AG for aiding Irans nuclear plans.        
	Analysts and oil traders expect the two countries to resolve the issue, given the large volume and value of the crude at stake and the difficulties Indian refiners would face in finding alternative supplies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Revolution from barrel of blunders 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Revolution from barrel of blunders 
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                                           Prakash Karat        
	Calcutta, Aug. 31: The CPM appears to be in the process of charting out its history of historic blunders.         
	In his remarks on the critical review of the political-tactical line adopted by the party at the August 7-10 meeting of the CPMs extended central committee in Vijayawada, party general secretary Prakash Karat has admitted yet another mistake his party had committed. The revelation comes in the latest issue of the CPM organ, Peoples Democracy.         
	In the political resolution of the 19th congress, it was assessed that the (UPA I) government will not proceed further (on the nuclear deal), given the opposition of Left parties. This was a mistaken assessment. The reason for this was an underestimation of the capacity and determination of the Congress party and the ruling classes to implement the nuclear deal and to forge an alliance with the United States, Karat has mentioned in his article.         
	The review report adopted by the meeting (Vijayawada conclave) has reiterated that it was correct and necessary to withdraw support to the UPA government when it decided to go ahead with the nuclear deal. However, the report self-critically concludes that it was wrong to have allowed the UPA government to go to the IAEA on the safeguards agreement, Karat added.         
	Karats admission of mistakes reminded CPM leaders of the remark made by late Communist patriarch Jyoti Basu 14 years ago. After the party turned down the proposal of the United Front that Basu be made the Prime Minister, the latter had described it as a historic blunder. Then, CPM sources said, Karat was one of the prime movers against Basus prime ministership.         
	Theres more to the affair.         
	Although his Bengal comrades had fiercely defended the controversial land acquisition in Singur with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in the lead, the CPM general secretary has struck a different note in his write-up, talking about the need to protect the interests of the peasantry.        
	Four years after Mamata Banerjee began her crusade against the Bengal governments takeover of fertile tracts in Singur, Karat has stated in his party organ: The Party is opposed to the taking away of the lands of farmers without their consent by corporates with government connivance. The Party will take up the land issue, it will stand by the peasantry and the tribal people who are opposing their lands being taken away.        
	According to a CPM leader, the realisation could be too little and too late. Nandigram and Singur played havoc with our partys electoral fortunes. We have been losing panchayats, municipalities, Lok Sabha elections and Assembly bypolls, all because of the crucial land issue. After doing the damage to farmers, what will this admission of guilt do? asked the party leader.         
	Asked whether admitting mistakes could prove to be beneficial for the CPM, professor of economics Abhirup Sarkar said: For the CPM, it has almost become a ritual admitting mistakes. But being in the government you just cant say its a mistake. The person hit by a government move will never forget the ill-treatment meted out to him. So, such admissions do not cut much ice.         
	Seven-eight years ago, the Mexican government had tried to take away farmland for constructing an airport outside city limits. Farmers refused to accept the compensation package that was offered and that led to a confrontation. Many farmers and their leaders were arrested. Later, the government said it was a mistake on their part but the peasants refused to part with their lands as the official torture was still fresh in their minds, Sarkar added.         
	After Nandigram that saw the killing of 14 people in police firing on March 14, 2007, the Bengal chief minister, while addressing a party rally at the Netaji Indoor stadium, had said that it was a mistake and, pointing a finger at his head, added: I am owning all responsibility for this.         
	Owning responsibility, however, didnt fetch dividends for the CPM as the party suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Trinamul Congress and lost control of the East Midnapore zilla parishad.        
	The CPMs admission of mistakes, however, isnt a recent phenomenon. After having called Subhas Chandra Bose a Quisling as also Tojos dog during the Second World War, the Indian Communists had later said that their evaluation and appraisal of Netaji was wrong.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Nov. 14: Call it social networking, with a difference.        
	A Hyderabad student who was beaten up by his biology teacher has posted pictures of himself with bruises on the back and cuts on the cheek on Facebook, in a stunning and possibly the first exposure of corporal punishment on a social networking site.        
	Siddanth Totla, a class VIII student of St Pauls High School in Hyderguda, was beaten up by George on November 10 in full view of his classmates. Without as much as a murmur of protest in school, Siddanth posted pictures of his injuries a day later, triggering a series of uncharitable comments from classmates and condemnation by outraged parents.        
	The teacher is a mad fellow. He should be stoned, said a student comment made in Telugu.        
	George came from the jungle, hence he is junglee (wild), said another.        
	The school administration was taken by shock after a local newspaper picked up the pictures from Facebook and published them. The report did not mention what the boy had done to invite a beating from the teacher.        
	Brother Sudhakar Reddy, the principal of the 50-year-old missionary school, said the management had inquired into the incident over the weekend. The teacher has been suspended.        
	The boys father, Rajendra Totla, has refused to press charges against the school, although he verbally complained to the local police station. He is a businessman and an alumnus of the school.        
	It is my school and I did not want a blemish (on its reputation). So I refused to give a written complaint, though the police suggested it, Rajendra said.        
	Although the school authorities would be thankful to Rajendra, a member of the parents association has taken exception to his behaviour. Why should they post such brutal pictures when they had no intention of pursuing the matter? Such acts will embolden school authorities to be lenient to erring faculty members.        
	A spokesperson for the teachers association said the faculty had been taken aback at how the student had harnessed the reach of a social networking site to expose the school. What discipline can we enforce when children can talk about us or threaten to expose us on such networks?        
	Now we are more scared of the students than we are of our principal as we dont know what games these boys will be up to malign or defame us.

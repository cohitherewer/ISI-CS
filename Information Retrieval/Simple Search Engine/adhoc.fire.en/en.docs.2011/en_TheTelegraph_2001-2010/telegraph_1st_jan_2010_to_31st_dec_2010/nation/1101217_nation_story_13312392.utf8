The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Valleys new weapon: heart and the army man 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Valleys new weapon: heart and the army man 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Lieutenant General Syed Ata Hasnain lays a wreath at the Corps War Memorial during a Vijay Divas event at Rangrath in Srinagar on Thursday. (PTI)                                   
	Srinagar, Dec. 16: The first Muslim officer to head the army in Kashmir for almost two decades today said the force would deal with the situation in a humane manner and apply balm on the (peoples) wounds.        
	Lieutenant General Syed Ata Hasnain, appointed head of the Srinagar-based 15 Corps early this month, made all the right noises at his first media interaction as he spoke about rebuilding bridges with the state administration.        
	My approach is entirely humane and nothing more than that. I think my force should not been seen as a force with arms everywhere. Our main weapon is our heart. And that is the weapon we will carry around in all our efforts to bring stability to the state all over again, Hasnain said on the sidelines of a Vijay Divas event at Rangrath here.        
	I am looking at the long-term perspective as to how the army can assist the... government in reaching out to the people and putting a balm on the many wounds that may have occurred over a period of time.        
	Relations between the Omar Abdullah administration and the army have been less than cordial since the state government decided to shift an army camp from Bomai, Sopore, last year following the involvement of the troops in the murder of two youths.        
	The army is also critical of Omars moves to have the Armed Forces Special Powers Act amended and the strength of the army reduced in the Valley in phases.        
	Hasnains latest appointment comes in the middle of a controversy over then Northern Command spokesperson Lt Colonel Pradeep Kochars harsh criticism of Omar.        
	Kochar had said the chief ministers call for reducing the army presence in the state would please the separatists and their Pakistani handlers. The army has removed Kochar from the post for his outburst.        
	Hasnain appears in no mood to prolong the confrontationist past. He called on Omar the day he took over and pledged full support to him.        
	The lieutenant general is only the second Muslim to head the 15 Corps (and thus, to head the army in the Valley). Before him, Lt Gen Zaki had headed the Corps from 1989 to the middle of 1991.        
	Hasnain is an old Kashmir hand, having served as brigade commander on the Line of Control in the Uri sector before being promoted to major general to head the army division in Baramulla.        
	He said he had been in touch with many people in the Valley for the past two years. That is why I understand what the situation is.        
	The officer referred to the recent unrest as a temporary situation which was extremely well handled.        
	The army was in the background, assisting and advising wherever it could. I dont think a state can come where the army can be in the background completely. We are very much integrated with every effort of the state government. I am also the security adviser of the government and I always look forward to (giving) advice, he said.        
	Earlier, Hasnain had paid tributes to war heroes at a simple programme at the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry Regimental Centre. In his speech, he said the 1971 operation was one of the Indian militarys most magnificent achievements and congratulated the soldiers.        
	Vijay Divas is dedicated to the memory of the soldiers who laid down their lives for the country in the 1971 war. The sacrifices made by you for the country will not go in vain. The nation is grateful and you should know it, he said.

          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Gagandeep Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 4: Ajay Raj has always been on a short fuse. He used his gun, whether it was over kebabs, right of way or a fight with his fiance.        
	The 23-year-old, alleged to have shot dead under-19 India cricketer Gagandeep Singh last October, was yesterday caught in Delhi after police trapped him following a tip-off.        
	The young man had pulled out his gun again, but the cops cornered him, sources in Delhi police said today.        
	Police records say every time Raj is alleged to have killed, it has been over a trivial issue  because he couldnt control his temper.        
	It cost Gagandeep his life when the teenaged cricketer was shot after Ajay, police said, opened fire at a Meerut restaurant owner for delay in serving kebabs.        
	They fired four shots and killed the owner of the kebab shop and then while fleeing, when Gagandeep started to overpower them, they fired at him too, said Delhi police commissioner Y.S. Dadwal.        
	Shot thrice with a .32 revolver, Gagandeep died on the spot.                    
	After yesterdays encounter, the police said they seized a .32 pistol and seven live cartridges from Ajay, who was wanted in several case and had a reward of Rs 50,000 on his head.        
	The records show Ajays criminal career began in 2003, when he bashed up a bus conductor in Meerut over a ticket. A case of attempt to murder was lodged against Ajay.        
	In November 2007, Ajay and some of his associates are alleged to have shot dead a man because he was obstructing their way. They didnt even know him.        
	A case, lodged in Meerut, is still pending and Ajay is out on bail. He killed over the slightest provocation. He was never put away (in jail) because people never came to testify against him, they were so frightened. In all these cases he was out on bail, said a police officer.        
	On December 30, 2008, Ajay, the police records say, took to kidnapping for ransom to maintain his lifestyle. With the help of a friend called Ankit and three others, he kidnapped a businessman from outside his factory in Delhi. Then they called the businessmans family and demanded a ransom of Rs 25 lakh.        
	Three of the accused were later arrested but Ajay and Ankit managed to give police the slip.        
	In October, just a day before Gagandeep was shot, Ajay and his associates waylaid a woman. He wanted to gift the jewellery she was wearing to a friend who was getting married.        
	Ajay didnt even spare those he knew. In February 2009, he was arrested and booked for terrorising his fiance by firing indiscriminately at her house. He was angry because they had a fight over where to go out in the evening. He was later granted bail.        
	Police sources said Ajay told his interrogators he had studied up to Class XII and was pursuing a bachelors in computer application from IIMT Meerut, but dropped out midway through his fourth semester.        
	The son of a sugar mill manager in Ghaziabad, Ajay is not the only criminal element in his family. His younger brother Vijay Raj Sangwan, involved in a shootout, has been in Tihar jail for some time.

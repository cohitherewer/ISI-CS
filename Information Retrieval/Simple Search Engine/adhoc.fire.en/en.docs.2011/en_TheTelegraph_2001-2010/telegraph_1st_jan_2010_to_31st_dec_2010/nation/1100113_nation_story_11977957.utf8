	New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Central Board of Secondary Education has threatened to disaffiliate schools that fail to provide attention to disabled children or make up pretexts to deny them admission.         
	The circular issued by Indias largest school Board follows a spate of complaints of schools affiliated to the CBSE denying admission to disabled children.         
	Under the Pe rsons with Disabilities Act, no institution can deny admission to a disabled child because of his physical or psychological disabilities. But schools have been known to cite a variety of pretexts for turning away children with special needs.         
	Schools often tell parents they dot have disabled friendly infrastructure to turn away these children -- even though they are required under law to provide such infrastructure if needed by a child.         
	In its circular to all affiliated schools, the CBSE has reemphasises that all schools must follow the governments guidelines for inclusive education of children with disabilities.         
	These guidelines include allowing parents to pick an aide who can accompany the student during school, including writing examinations for the child if the student cannot.         
	All schools, according to the government guidelines must be disabled friendly by 2020, and must reserve 3 per cent seats for differently abled children.         
	Schools are also required to ensure the availability of teachers trained to teach children with disabilities.

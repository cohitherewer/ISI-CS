          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 8: The education sector in Cuttack is set to get a major boost as the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has proposed two more central schools.        
	The associations board of governors has recommended the feasibility of 78 more Kendriya Vidyalayas (KV) as part of the process initiated by the HRD ministry for expanding the network of such central schools during the 11th plan period. The feasibility report included two KVs in Cuttack along with nine others across Orissa to address the educational needs of children of central government employees who are frequently transferred.        
	At present, there are 36 KVs in Orissa. While nine schools are in the project and defence sectors, the rest are in the civil sector. No new KV has come up in three years.        
	The lone KV at Abinava Bidanasi in the southwestern part of Cuttack has classes from nursery to Class XII and a student strength of 1,670.         
	The school had received around 600 applications at the beginning of this academic session, but could accommodate only 89. The high demand reflects the need for more KVs in Cuttack. The two proposed KVs will help in filling up this gap, a teacher said.         
	While one has been proposed at Khannagar in the southeastern part of the city, the other has been planned at Mundali on the northwestern fringe.

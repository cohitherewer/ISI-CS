The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Beef protest at Pak flood camp
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Beef protest at Pak flood camp

	Islamabad, Aug. 22: Several hundred Hindus protested at a flood relief camp in Karachi last night after being served beef for dinner.        
	Officials said there were about 4,000 flood victims from various faiths in the camp. The Hindu inmates are mostly from the Scheduled Caste Baagri and Waghari tribes who live in and around Keamari town in Sindh province.        
	A large number of women, with the traditional tattoos on their faces and wearing heavy silver ornaments and colourful lehengas, came out of their tents with their children and demanded to be shifted somewhere else.        
	We are Hindus and consumption of beef is prohibited in our religion; but we were given beef, which is unacceptable, a flood victim, Mohan Baagri, told reporters.        
	Minority affairs ministry officials rushed to the camp to resolve the issue.        
	It was a misunderstanding. The food was for residents of the camp, but the authorities were not aware of their faith. However, they will now be given ration so they can cook their own food, a senior ministry official, Dara Kazi, told reporters.        
	He said the officials of his department were also visiting other camps to see if Hindus or other minorities were there. If minorities are found in other camps, we will provide them food according to their beliefs.        
	Javaid Sabagatullah Mahar, who is in charge of the camp, confirmed that some flood victims had protested. Now members of the Hindu community in the camp are being given ration separately, he said.        
	Baagris and Wagharis are experts at farming, especially of vegetables, pulses and fruit. They usually work in the upper districts of Sindh province.        
	These tribes had been peasants with their own farmland on the edge of the Waghari river in Indias Maharashtra for centuries. After a severe drought under British rule, they moved to Sindh province, where Pakistans Hindu population is concentrated.        
	Till 1947, most Hindus in present-day Pakistan were highly educated and economically advantaged urban residents. However, most of them migrated to India after Partition. The 1998 census counted 24 lakh Hindus in Pakistan.        
	Pak on India aid        
	Pakistan, which agreed to accept a $5-million flood aid from India following a prod from the US, has claimed the move has enhanced its diplomatic image since refusal would have undermined its insistence on resumption of dialogue, a PTI report said.        
	After dilly-dallying for several days, Pakistan recently accepted Indias aid offer.        
	Islamabads move has been criticised by some Pakistani politicians, but Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani has asked the critics to give reasons for their stand.        
	I would like to ask the critics of Indian aid on what ground we should refuse it. It will be a narrow approach if we refuse aid from India, Gilani said in Lahore.        
	But Nawaz Sharifs party, the PML-N, slammed the government for accepting the Indian offer on the US call.        
	Former foreign minister Abdul Sattar too said: It is beyond understanding that the government accepted the offer after a few days.        
	However, Gilani said: Would it not be a contrast if we refused the aid? On the one hand, we are stressing the resumption of dialogue with India and on the other, we refuse its aid. We should come out of this approach and give a strong image to Pakistan.        
	He said he was chairing a high-level meeting when he was informed about Indias aid offer. I told my foreign minister (Shah Mahmood Qureshi) to thank his Indian counterpart for the aid.

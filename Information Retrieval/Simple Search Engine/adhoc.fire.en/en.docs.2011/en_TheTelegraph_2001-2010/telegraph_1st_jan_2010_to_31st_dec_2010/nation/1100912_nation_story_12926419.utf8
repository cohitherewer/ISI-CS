The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangh frowns on BJP Munda snub 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sangh frowns on BJP Munda snub 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                          Arjun Munda, who was sworn in Jharkhand chief minister on Saturday     
	New Delhi, Sept. 11: The RSS has not taken too kindly to the undeclared boycott of Arjun Mundas swearing-in by L.K. Advani, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Ananth Kumar.        
	According to a Sangh source, the RSS saw the move as a direct challenge to its decision to bless a government headed by Munda.         
	What is wrong with having government headed by a tribal chief minister? was his counter to the quartet that is said to be sulking over the turn of events in Jharkhand.        
	But it felt BJP president Nitin Gadkari, who was principally responsible for putting the government in place, should have properly articulated the political reasons for it to his colleagues. Theres a communication gap that should be plugged in future, the source said.         
	The stress on the tribal factor was an answer to Advanis alleged attempts to prop up Hazaribagh MP Yashwant Sinha against Munda, using Sinhas ability and experience in administration and governance as a foil against Mundas supposed shortcomings on both the scores.        
	There were no takers in Jharkhand for Advanis gambit.        
	Its all well to emphasise the importance of a good, clean administration. But we are also in the business of politics and given the social equations in the state, theres no way we could have had a non-tribal at the helm. Munda, in the RSS and the BJP presidents opinion, was the best tribal candidate in the circumstances.        
	Didnt the Congress too opt for a tribal as chief minister (Madhu Koda) and he was out of the party fold, a source close to Gadkari said.        
	However, to correct the notion that Munda was chosen entirely for political expediency, Gadkari has written to him, emphasising the need for high-quality governance.         
	People of Jharkhand have high expectations from you and the party hopes that you will do everything possible to meet their expectations. BJP has always insisted on striving to give high quality governance in the states where it is ruling, and I am confident that your government will offer a government that delivers to the people of Jharkhand, he wrote.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia breaks J amp;K silence
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sonia breaks J amp;K silence
          SANJAY K. JHA                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 19: Sonia Gandhi today broke the Congresss silence on Kashmir, saying how urgent it was to address the anger and pain among the Valleys youth.        
	Her remarks came at a time many were beginning to see the party as a mere spectator to the Kashmir turmoil. Even the Congress Working Committee had desisted from issuing a formal statement on the crisis at a meeting two days ago, despite a briefing from P. Chidambaram on the situation in the state.        
	Sonia today told the Congress parliamentary party (CPP) she was anguished by the upsurge of violence and tensions in the Valley.        
	She did not echo the home ministers view that the states youth were being misguided and instigated; rather, she cited how a whole generation has grown up under the shadow of brutality and conflict.        
	It is a call to our collective conscience. The anger and pain that is manifesting itself, especially among the young, needs to be addressed. They are our very own and their suffering is ours. Dialogue and mutual understanding are the key to ending the cycle of violence and tragic killings. Our security forces have a difficult task, she said.        
	Sonias remarks appeared to reaffirm that the party had abandoned its initial perception that the trouble had been engineered from across the border. Even the Prime Minister had not mentioned any role of Pakistan or terrorists in his remarks at the August 10 all-party meeting.        
	Also, many in the party now appear to believe that the Kashmiri youths anger is directed principally at the state administration rather than the army. But to all indications, the party leadership is not ready to take any drastic action on such a premise, at least for now.        
	A senior leader said: Initially, only Ghulam Nabi Azad felt that the chief minister should be removed. But now even the state Congress president, Saifuddin Soz, agrees that Omar Abdullah has failed completely, and drastic changes are needed to restore peoples faith in the state administration.        
	But, sources said, Azad and Soz have not clearly voiced their concerns before Sonia since they presume she does not want Omar out.        
	The All India Congress Committee minder for Jammu and Kashmir, Prithviraj Chavan, who has remained aloof and silent, too, has created an impression that there is no question of removing the chief minister.

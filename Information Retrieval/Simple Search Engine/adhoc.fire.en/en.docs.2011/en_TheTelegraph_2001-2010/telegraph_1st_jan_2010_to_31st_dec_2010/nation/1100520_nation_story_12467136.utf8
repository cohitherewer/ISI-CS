	Bhubaneswar, May 19: On the second day of their bandh, Maoists today blew up a government warehouse in Malkangiri district.        
	Armed rebels swooped on the warehouse at Bodigata, about 620km from here, and used landmines to trigger the explosion. It was used as a panchayat building and later as a warehouse, said Kalimela police station inspector-in-charge D. Mishra.        
	However, no one was injured in the incident.        
	The Naxalites have left behind posters saying that government offices were being used to house security personnel, Mishra said.        
	After the explosion, the guerrillas disappeared into a nearby forest, raising anti-government and anti-police slogans. Security personnel had left for the blast site on foot to avoid landmines.        
	Meanwhile, the bandh hit vehicular movement in Naxalite-affected districts  Malkangiri, Koraput, Gajapati, Rayagada and Sundargarh.

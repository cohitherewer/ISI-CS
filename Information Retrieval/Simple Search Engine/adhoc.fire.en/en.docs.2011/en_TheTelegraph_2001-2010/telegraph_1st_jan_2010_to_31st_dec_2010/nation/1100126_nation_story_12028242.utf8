The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Deemed label denied, NID near varsity goal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Deemed label denied, NID near varsity goal
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           The NID campus in Ahmedabad                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: One of Pradyumna Vyass first challenges after taking over as director of the National Institute of Design (NID), Ahmedabad, last April was to decide whether to pull out of a nationwide scramble for deemed university status.         
	The institute decided not to persist with its request for the deemed tag, turned down by the University Grants Commission which argued that the NID was ill-equipped to meet its requirements.         
	Today, Indias premier design school stands on the cusp of winning the powers of a full-fledged university  without being tarred by the controversy that surrounds dubious deemed universities that won a tag it couldnt.         
	Instead of getting into any controversies, we decided to go to Parliament rather than the UGC. What matters is the credibility and the brand of the NID, Vyas told The Telegraph, his voice betraying a sense of relief.        
	The NID is set to win the power to award degrees through an act of Parliament while staying autonomous of the UGC requirements for deemed universities. At present, the institute offers only undergraduate and postgraduate diplomas.        
	The act will also bestow on the NID a tag that only a handful of the countrys 130 deemed universities can claim to justify  the design school will be called a centre of excellence.        
	The NID sought deemed university status in 2005, at a time when under Arjun Singh, the human resource development ministry had opened the floodgates for institutes desperate for the tag.         
	But while 55 other institutions, mostly run privately, won the UGCs approval for deemed status between 2005 and 2009, the NID had to wait four years, only to be turned down. The institute did not have the minimum number of faculty with PhDs required under UGC guidelines for the deemed university status, the commission said in its response to the NID request.         
	But NID isnt complaining. Vyas accepted that the institute would in all probability not have been able to meet the UGCs faculty qualification requirements because of the nature of design as a subject. Had the NID won the deemed tag, it may today have found itself alongside the 44 blacklisted institutions.         
	Many of the best teachers of design need not be PhDs. We get grassroots people to come and teach here. That is the beauty of NID and its strength, Vyas said. The UGC formulations on teacher standards do not match the requirements of NID, which needs autonomy to evolve its own standards, curricula and courses, he argued.

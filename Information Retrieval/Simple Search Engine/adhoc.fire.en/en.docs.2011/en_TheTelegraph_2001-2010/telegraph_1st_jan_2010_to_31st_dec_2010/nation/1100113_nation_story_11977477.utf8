The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Single law to create varsities

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 12: All future public and private universities may be recognised by a single legislation that will for the first time separate the creation of varsities from their right to award degrees.         
	India plans to end its decades-old policy requiring fresh legislations to recognise new universities each time they are set up under its latest proposed higher education reform, top government sources have told The Telegraph.         
	The human resource development ministry is drafting a new law that will create a mechanism allowing the government to add new universities to a schedule attached to the legislation, the sources said. The law will lay down basic norms that all universities will have to follow.         
	The move  recommended by a panel of experts fine-tuning the architecture of the proposed National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER)  will facilitate setting up new universities in the future. It will also demolish a key rationale today cited for the controversial concept of deemed universities  institutions that can award degrees without being created under a legislation.         
	The new bill will work in conjunction with another proposed law to set up the NCHER, according to the road map proposed by the expert panel.         
	At present, each time the government or a private firm wants to set up a university, a new law is needed recognising the proposed institution, automatically granting it rights to award degrees even without adequate infrastructure.         
	But the new reform bill  without a title at present  that the HRD ministry is now drafting will for the first time separate the creation of new universities and their legitimacy to award degrees. Under this new proposed law, the government or a private agency interested in starting a new university will have to approach the NCHER  proposed as the new overarching higher education regulator.         
	The NCHER will study the applicants proposal and if satisfied, ask the government to allow university status.         
	The new institution will then simply be added to a schedule attached to the reform law.         
	Parliament will still need to approve revisions to the schedule. But this normally takes much lesser time than taken by drafting and seeking sanction for new laws or amendments to the body of a law.         
	While addition to the schedule after parliamentary approval will legitimise the creation of the new university, it will not automatically empower it to award degrees  unlike at present.         
	The university will need to apply to the NCHER separately for the power to award degrees in specific courses.         
	Once the NCHER is satisfied that a university possesses the quality standards required to award a particular degree, this power will be granted.         
	Deemed universities  under a cloud following allegations that many of these institutions indulge in unethical practices  were encouraged for the past few years citing the time taken for legal sanction to new universities.         
	Several reports, including recommendations of the National Knowledge Commission, have indicated that India needs many more higher education institutions than it has.         
	Deemed universities  which can award degrees after recognition by the University Grants Commission  can help meet the demand-supply gap, proponents of these institutions have argued.

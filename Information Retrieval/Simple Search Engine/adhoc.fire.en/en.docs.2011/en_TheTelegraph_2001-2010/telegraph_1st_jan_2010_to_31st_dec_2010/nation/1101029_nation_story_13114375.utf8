	Birbhum, Oct. 28: The residents of a Birbhum village recently held a shradh and organised a feast after a langur that had troubled them was shot dead by the headmaster of a primary school.        
	On Sunday, Mangalmoy Banerjee shot dead the langur in Dihipara village, about 10km from Bolpur, while it was plucking fruits and damaging trees. Forest officials said the animal, which was shot in the head, was one and a half years old.         
	The next day, Banerjee and other residents of Dihipara buried the body of the langur and performed the shradh.        
	The forest department raided the headmasters house today and seized his two guns  a licensed single-barrel gun and an air gun. They also seized 38 cartridges. Banerjee was not at home at the time of the raid. The langurs body was exhumed and sent for a post-mortem.         
	We will start a case against Mangalmoy Banerjee under the wildlife protection act, said Anil Chatterjee, the forest ranger of Bolpur. Banerjees family has admitted that he had shot the langur dead, the forest ranger said.        
	Prasad Lohar, 16, a villager, said: The langur was destroying our trees, plucking and eating papayas. It used to jump on the tin roofs of our houses. Another villager, Toofan Lohar, 16, said: We felt happy the langur was killed. That is why we organised the feast.

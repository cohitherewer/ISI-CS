          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 15: Lok Sabha leader and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has invited Opposition leaders to lunch in Parliament on Tuesday to try and break the House logjam.        
	Both Houses were adjourned today shortly after they met as the BJP and the other Opposition parties demanded a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to examine the 2G, CWG and Adarsh housing scams.        
	Mukherjee rejected the demand and said the 2G case would be looked into by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), headed by BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi.        
	Last week, Joshi had indicated he was unhappy with the BJP for pre-empting the PACs scrutiny by campaigning for a JPC.        
	Congress leaders and UPA allies are also watching with interest if Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi attend the wedding of DMK minister Alagiris son in Madurai on November 18. Alagiri is the son of DMK patriarch M. Karunanidhi.        
	Sources in the Prime Ministers Office and the Congress refused to confirm if the two leaders would be present in the wedding.        
	The Congress today accused the BJP of mobocracy for stalling Parliament over the 2G scam even after telecom minister A. Raja had resigned. The Opposition, mainly the BJP, has faith in mobocracy and not democracy, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said.        
	He added that the agitating MPs should not draw their salary for the days on which they did not work.

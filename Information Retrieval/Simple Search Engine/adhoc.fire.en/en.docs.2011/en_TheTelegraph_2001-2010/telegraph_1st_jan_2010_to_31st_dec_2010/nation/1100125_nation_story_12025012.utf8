          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Jan. 24: Three months after a House committee expressed surprise over the lack of vending zones in the city, Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) is set to come up with at least four such zones by February-end.        
	Its an ironical situation. While in one of the twin cities, vending zones were being constructed for rehabilitation of vendors/hawkers, in another there has been virtual inertia, a three-member House committee had observed, while appraising the vending zone project in Cuttack in October last year.        
	Though nearly 150 vending zones had come up in the state capital since Cuttack and Bhubaneswar were declared twin cities, they were yet to take shape in Cuttack. CMC had then submitted a list of 18 vending zones to the House committee.         
	Orissa Khudra Utha Dokani Mahasangha president Subash Singh today said the mayor had promised four vending zones would be opened in the first phase, work for which would be completed by the end of next month.        
	Singh said while announcing this at a meeting of city vendors, the mayor had further assured that work on 14 other vending zones would be taken up after transfer of the identified land to CMC.         
	Sources said the 18 places identified for vending zones are  Matamatha, Jagatpur, Chhatra Bazaar-Matrubhaban, Chhatra Bazaar-Ranihat, Jobra-Rehman Square, College Square, Bidanasi Embankment Road, Nuapatana, OMP Square, Madhupatna-Press Chak, Biju Patnaik Chakh, Sati Chaura, Press Chakh-Kathajodi Embankment, Sector 6, Jobra, Bajrakabati Road, Nua Bazaar-Potapokhari and Nuabazaar-Taladanda Canal.        
	The House committee appraisal route was adopted after the Orissa Khudra Utha Dokani Mahasangha, spearheading the cause of 20,000 street vendors and hawkers in the city, had pressed for vending zones through protracted agitation protesting eviction without any option of rehabilitation.        
	Singh, the co-ordinator of the Orissa Committee of National Association of Street Vendors of India, said the CMC was expected to adhere to the national policy, which envisaged setting up of town-vending committees for each city with representatives of vendors and other stakeholders.        
	The policy further envisages the registration of street vendors with identity cards instead of the existing licensing policy and allocation of space to them by ward committees on the basis of the decision of the town vending committee, Singh said.

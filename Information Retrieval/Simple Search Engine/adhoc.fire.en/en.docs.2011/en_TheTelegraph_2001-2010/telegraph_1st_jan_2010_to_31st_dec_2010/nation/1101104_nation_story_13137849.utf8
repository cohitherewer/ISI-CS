	New Delhi, Nov. 3: A computer glitch hit a Delhi airport terminal touted as world class, delaying a Calcutta-bound Air India flight on the tarmac by over three hours as passengers were made to board manually.        
	Half of those booked on Flight 112 had boarded the plane when the system at the T3 terminal stopped functioning, forcing them to wait in their seats for takeoff while the rest of the passengers were ushered in.        
	Today was the debut of the terminals domestic wing, and Air India had shifted 11 flights to the new facility.         
	The Calcutta flight wasnt the only one affected.         
	An Air India plane to Patna, with former Prime Minister Deve Gowda on board, took off an hour and 15 minutes late in a delay blamed on shortage of crew.

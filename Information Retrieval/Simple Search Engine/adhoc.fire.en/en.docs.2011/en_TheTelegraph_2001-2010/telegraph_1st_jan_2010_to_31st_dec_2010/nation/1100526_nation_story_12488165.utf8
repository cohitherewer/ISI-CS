The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Posco survey amid heavy security
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Posco survey amid heavy security
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 25: The field survey for Poscos land acquisition started in Jagatsinghpur district amid heavy security today, as anti-plant protesters decided to resist the initiative.        
	The survey started from Nolia Sahi under Gada Kujang gram panchayat, which is dominated by plant supporters. Eight survey teams have gone to the village, Jagatsinghpur collector N.C. Jena told The Telegraph.        
	While six teams have started land survey, another two have taken up enumeration of trees.         
	Though South Korean steel major Posco had signed an MoU with the state government on June 22, 2005 to set up a 12MTPA greenfield plant, the project had failed to take off as the affected villagers had put up barricades to prevent entry of officials for land acquisition.        
	The anti-plant protesters had been staging a dharna at Balitutha, the entry point to the proposed plant site, since January 26 blocking the roads. However, police cleared the site on May 15 by firing rubber bullets and bursting tear gas shells.        
	Senior district officials were present during the survey today along with heavy police deployment.         
	The survey went on peacefully and we have taken adequate precautionary measures to prevent any untoward incident, said Jagatsinghpur superintendent of police S. Devdutt Singh.        
	However, leaders of the CPI-backed Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti said they would oppose the survey.         
	We will not allow the survey team to enter our villages, as we are totally opposed to any displacement, said samiti president Abhay Sahu.        
	Keeping the possible resistance in mind, the government decided to exclude Dhinkia village, the epicentre of the anti-Posco movement, from the survey.        
	Posco requires 4,004 acres out of which 437 acres are private land. Out of the private land, nearly 300 acres are in Dhinkia village.

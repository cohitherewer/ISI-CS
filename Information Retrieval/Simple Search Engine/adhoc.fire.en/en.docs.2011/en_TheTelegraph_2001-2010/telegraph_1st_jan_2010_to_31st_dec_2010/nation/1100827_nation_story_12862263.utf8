          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: Rahul Gandhis decision to address a rally of tribals in Orissas Niyamgiri Hills today is being viewed as an important landmark of his nascent political career amid a strong buzz that he might be given a new assignment in the impending AICC reshuffle.        
	The new assignment is expected to have bigger political challenges than refurbishing the Youth Congress and party student wing NSUI, which Rahul looks after as general secretary now. The shuffle is expected any time after September.        
	Party leaders feel Rahul has worked hard and brought radical changes in the two front organisations, which is reflected in their enhanced appeal in most states, and now want him to try to strengthen the parent organisation. His decision to venture into the rough terrain of tribal politics signals a coming of age, they say.        
	He first tried to understand Indias complexities through serious interactions with social scientists and academicians. Then he took up the cause of the poor and the downtrodden. He visited different parts of the country, went to villages and understood ordinary peoples problems. Then he identified himself with the youth of the country. He has gone through the rigours in the last five-six years, a senior leader said.        
	That todays Orissa visit was part of a well-thought-out plan was made clear when Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said this afternoon that Rahuls initiatives are proof of the partys sensibilities and commitments. Unrest in tribal areas and land acquisition are the countrys biggest concerns at present, he said.        
	Rahul had last week visited Aligarh to express solidarity with farmers protesting against forcible land acquisition by the Mayavati government. Today, he said in Niyamgiri that he is the tribals voice in Delhi.        
	Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had in the recent past stressed the need for development in tribal areas and advocated a holistic approach to the Naxalite problem. Now, explicit support to the Manmohan Singh governments decision to veto Vedantas mining project in Orissa and the demand for a new land acquisition act are being seen as part of a plan to project Rahul as the partys most authoritative spokesperson on national concerns.        
	A senior leader said Rahul was now ready to move up the ladder. The party, however, is vertically divided on the next course. While one section wants him to join the government and gain administrative experience, the other would like him to continue with party work.        
	The first group argues that there is not much time left for him to understand the complexities of governance and establish his hold on the bureaucracy if the party wants to contest the 2014 general election under his leadership.        
	This section is in complete disagreement with those in the party, including some ministers, who feel Rahul should not think of becoming Prime Minister till the Congress wins a simple majority. These leaders would rather that Rahul gain political experience by taking charge of states where the Congress is weak.

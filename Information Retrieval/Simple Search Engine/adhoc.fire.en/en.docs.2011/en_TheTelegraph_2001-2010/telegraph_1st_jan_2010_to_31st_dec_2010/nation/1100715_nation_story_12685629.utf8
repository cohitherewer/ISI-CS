The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre weeds out CPM theme park
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Centre weeds out CPM theme park
          JOHN MARY                           The mangrove theme park                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, July 14: The Congress-led Centre has ordered the closure of a controversial Kerala mangroves theme park owned by a CPM-backed society that professes to work for protecting nature.        
	The park in Kannur was opened this April by Malayalam actor Suresh Gopi in the face of a campaign against the facility by a local NGO whose activists were thrashed by alleged CPM supporters on inauguration day.         
	The pro-CPM Eco Tourism Society, which owns the park, has Save Earth, Save Yourself as its motto.        
	The closure order has been issued by A. Senthil Vel, additional director in the Union environment and forests ministry, which is headed by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh. The park authorities have been asked to stop work or the ministry will be constrained to take action under the environment act. The order also says the park has been built violating norms restricting construction activities close to coasts.         
	Senthil has directed the chairman of the Kerala State Coastal Zone Management Authority, which enforces the building curbs, to inspect the site with experts and submit a report within 15 days on the ecological damage caused by the park. Senthil has cited reports by the chief conservator of forests and S.K. Susarla, a scientist with the ministry, confirming that the park was built in a pocket full of mangrove vegetation.        
	For Marxists, mangroves are just shoots and leaves. But for the rest of us, the endangered mangroves are the lifeline of the coast, said Bhaskaran Velloor of Kannur District Environment Committee, which opposes the park. Bhaskaran was among the four activists of the NGO who were allegedly thrashed the day the park opened.        
	The park, located around 240km from Kochi in Kannurs Pappinissery, offers boating and sightseeing, and even has a floating restaurant as an added attraction. When fully developed, the Rs 5-crore facility will have an indigenous medicine centre, water sports, fish farms, a library dedicated to habitat and an artisans colony. Some of the 4.5-hectare land is owned by the society, while the rest is on lease from the local panchayat.        
	K. Sudhakaran, the local Congress MP, said the panchayat had turned away other developers citing the very laws it had now flouted while sanctioning the CPM-backed park. A perfect example of how power can be misused, he said.         
	Society head N. Unnikannan and local panchayat chief K. Narayanan insist the objective is to promote nature-based tourism. But even the pro-CPM Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad, a science and literary council, found little merit in the societys assertions, saying the park would not help the cause of the environment.        
	Kannur, where the park is located, has more than half of the states 1,700 hectares of mangrove forests.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rebel jars jam Bengal tracks
          OUR BUREAU                          Policemen near one of the packets on the tracks. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Jan. 2: What fog did in north India, two plastic jars and as many banners did in Bengal today.        
	The jars wrapped in paper and the banners on rail tracks near Jhargram paralysed the railway administration for much of the pre-dawn hours and held up several long-distance trains.         
	At least eight trains were detained for three to four hours on average while three passengers trains between Kharagpur and Tatanagar were cancelled.        
	The disruptions came 72 hours after Wednesdays close shave in which two rail- waymen on night patrol alerted officials about tracks being hammered away in the same region 10 minutes before an express train was to pass.        
	At 3am on Saturday, the Howrah-bound Koraput Express was a kilometre away from Sardiha station when the driver saw a banner stretched across the tracks and stopped the train.        
	Almost simultaneously, a single-coach railway patrol special that was moving in the opposite direction found another banner across the tracks and alerted Jhargram and Kharagpur stations over wireless.        
	Such patrol specials are based in Tatanagar and Kharagpur stations and move without any pre-scheduled route or time. The patrol specials, consisting of an engine and a coach, were occasionally used earlier but since Wednesdays incident, these are patrolling the tracks in the Maoist belt between Kharagpur and Rourkela every night, said a South Eastern Railway spokesperson.        
	An official said that soon after the trains stopped, hundreds of villagers descended on the tracks and surrounded the two trains. Armed with single-barrel guns, some Maoists also surfaced, slamming the train with iron rods and shouting at passengers that they would be shot if they tried to get off the trains.        
	No one got off either train following the threats and the railway security forces waited till daybreak, said Pranab Kumar, senior security commissioner of the railways at Kharagpur.        
	The Maoists and the villagers left around 4.30am.         
	When it was bright enough to see, Railway Protection Force jawans got off the patrol train and removed the banners that read: CPI (Maobadi) zindabad. Make the January 2 bandh a success.        
	The Maoists had called a bandh today in five states  Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Orissa and Chhattisgarh  to protest alleged violation of human rights and torture of minorities and women by police.         
	The jawans inspected the tracks and found a package each in front of the patrol van and behind the Koraput-Howrah Express. Electric wires ran from the packets into the jungles on both sides. The railway force then called the bomb disposal squad in Midnapore town.        
	As the track ahead of the train was clear, it was escorted by security personnel and maintenance staff to Sardiha station around 6.20am.        
	The joint forces reached the spot around 8.30am and inspected the tracks and started combing the neighbouring villages. The bomb disposal squad reached around 9.30am and found in the packets two plastic jars filled with sand.         
	The tracks were declared safe around 10.30am after which train services were resumed.        
	Superintendent of police Manoj Verma said the Maoists had visited four neighbouring villages and forced the villagers to accompany them and hold up the trains.

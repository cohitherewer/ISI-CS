The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Recovery of cash alone not bribery: SC
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Recovery of cash alone not bribery: SC
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 9: The Supreme Court has said that mere recovery of money from a public servant will not amount to bribery unless the cash has been demanded and voluntarily accepted for a favour in discharge of official duties.        
	The clarification was given in an order setting aside corruption charges against a village patwari, a keeper of land records. Banarsi Das allegedly took Rs 400 to change records in favour of the real owners of a piece of land that had till then been incorrectly shown as someone elses .        
	(The) high court has fallen in error in so far as it has drawn the inference of demand and receipt of the illegal gratification from the fact that the money was recovered from the accused, a two-judge bench said. They were referring to Punjab and Haryana High Courts dismissal of Dass appeal against a trial court order sentencing him to four years in jail under the Prevention of Corruption Act.        
	The recovery of money cannot be said to be of no consequence, the court said. It is necessary for the prosecution to prove that there was a demand for money and that it was voluntarily accepted by the accused, the apex court said.        
	Under the anti-corruption act, demanding and accepting money for doing a favour in discharge of official duties is a sine qua non for the conviction of the accused, the bench said.         
	The currency notes found on Das, who was apparently trapped, had matched the description given to the authorities. But the apex court said it hadnt been proved that he had demanded the money for an official favour.

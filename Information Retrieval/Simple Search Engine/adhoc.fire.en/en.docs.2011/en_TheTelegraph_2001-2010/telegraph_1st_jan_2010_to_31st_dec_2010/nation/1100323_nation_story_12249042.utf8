          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 22: Public transport collapsed, schools were attacked, landmines planted and posters found in Maoist-hit districts on the first day of a 48-hour bandh called by Maoists.        
	The extremists called the bandh in six states  Bihar, Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, three districts in Maharashtra and one district in Madhya Pradesh opposing Operation Greenhunt.        
	Despite increased patrolling and stepped-up security measures taken by the police and the CRPF, most buses  both government and private  stayed off roads, as the owners did not want to take a risk. Barring a few private buses, most of the owners refused to take out buses apprehending attacks.        
	Absence of transport systems, coupled with the rising temperature, made the day difficult for commuters.         
	Road blockades and felling of trees were reported at many places, including Rayagada, Gajapati, Berhampur, Malkangiri and Jeypore.        
	The police traced landmines near Roxy railway station on the Barsuan-Kiriburu section. Movement of trains on this route was paralysed for sometime.        
	Similarly, two DPEP school buildings at Bodapada in Narayanpatna were attacked. On Saturday night, the ultras had killed two persons in Malkangiri and Koraput branding them as police informers. For the past two days, the guerrillas have been on move, pasting posters and asking people to support the bandh call or face consequences. Posters have also been found at Bimalgarh, Chunaghati, and Kalta.        
	In another development, the Sundergarh police arrested a Maoist cadre, Bimal Munda, during a joint combing operation with CRPF in the Topadihi forest area.

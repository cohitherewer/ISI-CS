The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Feuding Bihar allies blow hot and cold 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Feuding Bihar allies blow hot and cold 
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                          Nitish Kumar                                  
	Patna/New Delhi, June 22: Reports that Nitish Kumar does not want Narendra Modi to campaign in Bihar for the Assembly polls created fresh strains in the states ruling coalition today, with BJP leaders asserting they would not be dictated to.        
	However, four Bihar BJP ministers attended the days cabinet meeting, chaired by the chief minister, prompting some to suggest an improvement in ties since the BJP yesterday decided to stick with the alliance. But others cited the absence of two BJP ministers to stress that the rift had not begun to heal.        
	The remaining three of the BJPs nine ministers were in Delhi, along with two other state party leaders, to discuss the future of the alliance with party chief Nitin Gadkari. Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Modi, who had called off a joint appearance with Nitish on Sunday, also met veteran L.K. Advani, who is against snapping ties.        
	The days sound bites, however, related to the Nitish-Narendra Modi row. BJP sources said the Gujarat chief minister was livid after Nitish returned the Rs 5 crore he had sent as flood aid in 2008, and had refused to be persuaded not to campaign in Bihar.        
	Modi has his backers in Nitishs cabinet. Who is a third person (Nitish) to decide if Narendra Modi will campaign or not? Its the BJP campaign committee that will decide the matter, said Giriraj Singh, one of the two ministers to skip todays cabinet meeting despite being in Bihar.        
	Both partys fire-fighters are trying to find a way of saving the alliance without hurting the egos of Nitish or Modi.        
	We are sitting tonight to sort the issue out, said BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussein. He said the party had not received any message from its ally about Modi being unwelcome in Bihar.        
	Janata Dal (United) spokesperson Shivanand Tiwary said: We want the alliance to continue. But as chief minister and the NDAs leader, Nitish Kumar will naturally decide who is suitable and needed for the campaign.        
	Adding to the strain, Nitish sent a police team to Surat to inquire into the ads carried in Patna newspapers about Modis flood aid, but recalled it after an angry reaction from the BJP, PTI reported.

	Jhargram, May 28: The last thing Anthony Gomez did last night before dozing off in the S6 coach was to mutter a prayer.        
	God saved me twice in two minutes. Its a miracle that I am here talking to you, he said this morning, after surviving nine harrowing hours inside the mangled coach, one of the worst affected compartments.        
	The 50-year-old Mumbai resident was one of the few lucky passengers of the Howrah-Kurla Jnaneswari Express to either clamber out or be rescued after bogies jumped tracks and were rammed by a goods train two minutes later.        
	 I woke up to a big bang, almost as if a bomb had gone off in the coach, Gomez recounted.        
	After being flung off my berth, I found myself on the floor with something heavy over me. People were crying and screaming all around and I couldnt get up. Then came the second explosion, he said.        
	Gomez, who was returning from a visit to his Calcutta-based sister Monica, came to know only much later that the second explosion was caused by the goods train that rammed into some of the derailed coaches that had tilted towards a parallel track. The goods train then dragged some of the Jnaneswari bogies for some distance.         
	Gomez recalled being pinned down by two bodies before becoming semi-uncoscious.         
	It wasnt until several hours later that he heard voices again, this time of rescuers. I screamed to grab their attention and they finally pulled me out around 10.30am, he said, wincing in pain but glad to be alive.        
	Sheikh Moniruddin of Jamalpur, Burdwan, also survived but his tale of survival was tinged with tragedy. Moniruddin, a 29-year-old tailor in Mumbai, managed to crawl out of coach S4 despite suffering a head injury but his younger brother Sheikh Meher Ali, 24, is feared dead.        
	I survived because I slid under a seat but my brother didnt get a chance, cried Moniruddin, his head bandaged and face streaked with dried blood.        
	Moniruddin and a few others in the coach were fortunate to find an opening in the mangled coach through which they clambered out in the darkness and were found by villagers.        
	Sheikh Nazrul, 35, from Arambagh in Hooghly, fractured his collarbone but managed to come out of the mangled coach through a broken window. He also dragged out his injured wife Mamoni Begum and son Firdaus, 5, but couldnt trace daughter Nargis, 8, and brother Saidul.        
	Ahed Ali Ghazi, a 28-year-old mason from Hasnabad in North 24-Parganas, rolled over from his berth during the collision and found himself right next to a window with its bars twisted just enough for him to crawl out. He survived but son Rakibul, 8, daughter Meena, 12, and brother-in-law Yaad Ali didnt make it.

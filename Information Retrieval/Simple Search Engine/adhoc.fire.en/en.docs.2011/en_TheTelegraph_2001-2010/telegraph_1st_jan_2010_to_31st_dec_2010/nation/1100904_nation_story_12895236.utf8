  - Tale of two families: Identity of slain jawan tilts scales         JOY SENGUPTA                                                  
	Patna, Sept. 3: Hope died for Piyari Tete today but flickered back to life for Rajni Devi.        
	When Rajni was told yesterday that her husband, assistant sub-inspector Abhay Kumar Yadav, had been killed by Maoists, Piyari was already on her way to Patna with her family. They arrived today, hoping to meet chief minister Nitish Kumar and plead with him to get Lucas Tete freed.        
	The rebels had abducted the Bihar Military Police assistant sub-inspector on Sunday along with Abhay and two other policemen.        
	Tetes daughter Angela said early this morning that the family expected to meet Nitish by 10am. Mother is okay, she said. Piyari had earlier threatened suicide if her husband was not released.        
	No one was allowed near the family at the Bihar Military Police headquarters. The police took them away to a house on the compound, ostensibly to provide them with refreshments. Piyari was seen dragging herself towards the building. Sometime in the next half-an-hour, the family was quietly taken out through a back gate.        
	When contacted again, Angela said: We are going now. We have met the chief minister. He has given his assurances.        
	She disconnected the phone on the directions of some policemen. Till then, the family, which had travelled more than 450km from its village in Jharkhand, did not know Tete was dead.        
	Around 10.30am, director-general of police Neelmani announced: The body of Lucas Tete has been recovered from the Simra Tari Korasi forests... in Lakhisarai.        
	Since no other body has been found, the police are presuming that Abhay is alive. Although the Maoists had last evening claimed to have killed him, the police had not confirmed the death.        
	Lallan Yadav, a cousin of Rajni, said this was a sort of temporary relief.        
	Why are the Maoists doing this? And why are the police not letting us know the facts? Can you imagine the condition of a wife who is told in the evening that her husband is dead and the next morning that he is alive but still a captive? She cant speak. On her behalf, I appeal to the rebels to release the rest of the hostages, he said.        
	There was no word on the whereabouts of Rajni and her children, who had stood at the chief ministers door for four days begging him to act.        
	The Phulwari deputy superintendent of police, Rakesh Dubey, had whisked the family away to a safe zone yesterday. Today, he refused to reveal where they were. Piyari has left for home with her husbands body.        
	Additional director-general of police (headquarters) P.K. Thakur said: The family was taken to Lakhisarai where a guard of honour was given to Tete. After that, the body was handed over to the family. They have been sent to Jharkhand under police protection.        
	Rajan, Tetes nephew, said over the phone from Kolebera in Simdega district that the family was returning by road. What can be done now? All is over. The Bihar government could not do anything. Altogether, eight people had gone to Bihar to meet the chief minister, he said.        
	They included Tetes wife, three daughters, three male relatives and a friend of one of the daughters. Now they have started for Kolebera and will arrive by 2am. The burial will take place tomorrow.

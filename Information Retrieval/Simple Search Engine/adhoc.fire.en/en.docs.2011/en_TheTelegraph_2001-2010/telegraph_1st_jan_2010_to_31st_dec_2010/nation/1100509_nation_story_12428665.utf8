          SHAHNAWAZ AKHTAR                              
	Giridih, May 8: A police team from Rajasthan has detained a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh official in Jharkhands Giridih district for his alleged role in the 2007 Ajmer Sharif blast, which killed three people.        
	Mahendra, a native of Indore, used to be zilla pracharak of the Sanghs Giridih unit. If he is found guilty, it would be the first proven link between the Sangh and a terrorist blast.        
	The anti-terrorism squad (ATS) picked Mahendra up from the compound of a school, the Saraswati Shishu Mandir, from where he had been carrying out the Sanghs activities for the past one year.        
	Sources said Devendra Gupta, an arrested Ajmer Sharif blast suspect, had told the Rajasthan police that Mahendra was involved in the attack. They added that Devendra had also accepted his links with the Abhinav Bharat Sangathan, a Hindu radical group accused of involvement in the blast, which took place just outside the dargah of Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti.        
	Ever since he (Mahendra) came to this place, he would rarely stay at home. He was on the move most of the time and spoke only to a select few, a domestic help at Mahendras home here said.

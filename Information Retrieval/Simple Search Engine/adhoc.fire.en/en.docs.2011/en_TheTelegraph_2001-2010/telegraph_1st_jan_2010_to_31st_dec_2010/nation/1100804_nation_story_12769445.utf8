	New Delhi, Aug. 3 (PTI): Nobel laureate Amartya Sen today told Manmohan Singh that he did not approve of New Delhis policy on Myanmar, adding that the Indian democracy allowed him to say so to the Prime Minister.        
	I do not agree with your policy on Burma. In a democratic country like India, I can say this to the Prime Minister, Sen said while delivering a lecture on literacy here.         
	Singh, who was by Sens side, smiled when the Nobel laureate made the comments.        
	 Sens forthright remarks came close on the heels of India hosting Myanmar military ruler General Than Shwe last week. Shwe faces global flak for not allowing democracy to take root in the country where pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been barred from contesting elections slated for this year.        
	 India has been engaging Shwes government, maintaining that it is in its vital interest.        
	 Sen also drew a distinction between the ideals of Mao Zedong and the action of Maoists in India. Mao had promoted basic education in China, which augmented the economic development of the country. But the Maoists in India are affecting the basic education structure in states like Bengal, Sen said.

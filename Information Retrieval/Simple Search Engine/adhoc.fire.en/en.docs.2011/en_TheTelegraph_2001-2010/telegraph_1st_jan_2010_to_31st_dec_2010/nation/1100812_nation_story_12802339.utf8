          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 11: The Congress-led UPA government appeared a little closer to political consensus on the civil nuclear liability bill after the BJP today indicated its willingness to back the legislation with some give and take.        
	The signals emerged at a meeting finance minister Pranab Mukherjee held with top BJP leaders L.K. Advani, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Murli Manohar Joshi, Yashwant Sinha and Jaswant Singh this morning.         
	Sushma, leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, claimed Mukherjee had invited them as leader of the Lower House. But a Congress minister insisted the BJP had sought the meeting to clear the air over its objections.        
	The minister claimed that with the areas of disagreement narrowing, an understanding could be clinched next week.         
	Both sides claimed the government had agreed not to allow private firms to operate nuclear power plants for the next 20 or 30 years. The BJPs stand is that the sector should continue to be controlled by the government and state-owned firms.         
	The minister denied any plans to the contrary. There is no question of letting in private operators surreptitiously. They cannot come in unless the Atomic Energy Act is amended.        
	The BJPs earlier position was that if all such plants were state-owned, there was no need for a liability bill since the government would bail out victims to any extent in case of a nuclear disaster. Now, however, the party is coming round to the idea that a law is needed irrespective of who owns such units. We need a liability law for existing plants, Jaswant said.        
	The government is also learnt to have told the BJP leaders that its eagerness to get the bill passed is not aimed at pleasing US President Barack Obama ahead of his India visit later this year. US firms dont want to do business with us unless a law is enacted. Obama should not be brought in, a government source said.

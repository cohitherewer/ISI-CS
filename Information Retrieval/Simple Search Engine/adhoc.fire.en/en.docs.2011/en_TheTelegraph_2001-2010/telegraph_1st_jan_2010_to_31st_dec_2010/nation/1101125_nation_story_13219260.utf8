          RAMASHANKAR                              
	Patna, Nov. 24: The peaceful elections, marked by the absence of a full-scale strike by the Maoists, have prompted suggestions that the Nitish Kumar governments soft handling of situations involving the rebels have paid dividends.        
	Analysts and some critics who do not want to be named have sought to link the relatively peaceful polls and a perception that the Bihar government soft-pedalled the Lakhisarai crisis in which four policemen were held captive and eight others were killed by the Maoists.        
	An estimated 51 per cent votes were polled in the Maoist-affected areas despite a boycott call and the majority of the seats have gone to the JD (U) and the BJP.        
	The analysts said although the Maoists did issue the boycott call, they did not enforce the diktat. Besides, many rebels actively participated in the polling.         
	The rebels did plant improvised explosive devices in some pockets, attacked candidates campaign vehicles and burnt election offices to make their presence felt, but they did not go all out against the polls.        
	The analysts pointed out that till the fourth phase of elections, the Maoists maintained a low profile.         
	Barring a landmine explosion in which five policemen were killed on October 21, no big instance of Naxalite violence was reported from any constituency.         
	The elections in Jamui, Munger, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura and Nawada also passed off almost incident-free. The Maoists, however, stepped up activities ahead of the fifth and sixth phases of elections in their bastions like Gaya, Aurangabad, Rohtas and Kaimur districts. An outgoing MLA was kidnapped but subsequently released.         
	 The state police machinery maintained silence over the launch of Operation Green Hunt and also protested setting up a unified command in Bihar, apparently not to invite the wrath of the rebels in election year, said a police officer who had been shunted by the NDA regime.        
	He said the soft attitude became evident during the August 29 Lakhisarai encounter.         
	However, other police officers pointed out that the government managed to save the lives of the hostages, except one who was killed.         
	A senior police officer attributed the peaceful poll to strategic deployment of security forces. The deployment instilled a sense of confidence among the voters, who turned up in large numbers, the officer said.

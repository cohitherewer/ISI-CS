          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi. May 14: India plans to restructure its college admission policy to allow vocational education students lateral entry mid-course into mainstream higher educational institutions for the first time following the Australian model.         
	The human resource development ministry has asked the University Grants Commission and the IITs to prepare a mechanism for multiple entries and exits from courses.         
	Multiple entry and exit points, which will allow students to shift institutions mid-course, could theoretically benefit students of both vocational and mainstream higher education.         
	Delhi University already allows mid-course transfers, but these are generally on a case-by-case basis and the policy is never extended to vocational education students.         
	The IIT Council  the highest decision-making body of the institutes  occasionally makes exceptions to allow transfers of students from one IIT to another. No IIT, however, admits students mid-course from other institutions .         
	But the single largest section of students who will benefit from such multiple entry and exit options will be vocational education students, HRD ministry sources said.        
	Lakhs of students join institutes teaching industrial training, software applications, hospitality, secretarial work and other vocational programmes. In 2007, India announced a National Skill Development Mission with a promise to provide job-oriented vocational training to a million people a year.         
	But at present, only those with few opportunities in mainstream higher education generally take up vocational education.         
	One major reason, sources said, is that vocational courses are not recognised as academic qualifications that facilitate lateral entry into higher educational institutions.         
	A student trained in industrial work for four years has to apply for first year engineering at a college with fresh school pass-outs, at present.         
	Under the restructured policy, such a student will be allowed to join an appropriate engineering course mid-way  directly in second year, for instance.         
	The impetus for the plan came following a trip by HRD minister Kapil Sibal to Australia last month.         
	Australia allows lateral movement of students between mainstream and vocational education courses.         
	Close to a lakh Indian students went to Australia last year alone, mostly to pursue vocational education courses.

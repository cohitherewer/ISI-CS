          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, July 31: A student of Osmania University, the nerve centre of the Telangana agitation, committed suicide last night, apparently to fulfil a vow that he would sacrifice his life if all TRS legislators who had resigned won in the recent bypolls.        
	T. Ishan Reddy, who was doing his masters in computer applications, set himself on fire on the campus. Police found his charred body and half-burnt sandals in bushes near the library early today. The autopsy was conducted at the spot itself after agitating students refused to let police take the 23-year-olds body away.         
	Reddy killed himself less than 24 hours after all 11 TRS legislators and a BJP MLA, who had resigned to press statehood, won the bypolls.        
	A suicide note, found near the body and purportedly written by Reddy, said: I took a vow at the temple of Maisamma (deity) that I will sacrifice my life if D. Srinivas and other Congress candidates are defeated in the elections and all other TRS candidates are elected. Now that they are all elected, I am fulfilling my wish.        
	Reddys suicide was the fourth this year by a student of the university as the campaign for a Telangana state spilled onto the streets of Hyderabad again. Students and TRS and BJP leaders took out a procession with the body.

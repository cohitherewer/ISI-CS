                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Safe but at Mayas mercy
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, March 9: On paper, a wafer-thin majority of four and a cushion of 21. On the ground, a dreaded supporter called Mayavati.        
	The UPAs official support will stand at 276 MPs, four more than the majority mark, if the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal formally withdraw backing tomorrow as threatened.        
	The UPA will then have to depend on Mayavatis 21 to ensure it does not find itself on thin ice when the budget proposals are put to vote. Although Mayavatis BSP opposed the womens bill along with Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav, she is not expected to side with the Samajwadis when it comes to the fate of the UPA government.        
	However, the BSPs increased significance in a scenario fraught with uncertainties does not suit the Congress, which is looking to emerge as Mayavatis principal adversary in Uttar Pradesh.        
	On the plus side, the Congress can hope to widen its basket of options by keeping an eye on possible fair-weather friends like the Janata Dal (United) and the Biju Janata Dal. Five of the seven Dal (United) MPs voted in support of the bill.        
	Such permutations are expected to shield the UPA in Parliament but the Congress will not be breathing easy.        
	With the Yadav twins upping the ante on food inflation and threatening to bring in cut motions on the Finance Bill, the government and the Congress will have to muster all their manoeuvring skills. Especially if the BJP and the Left too stick to their earlier stand of bringing in cut motions.        
	Stung by the way their MPs were evicted from the House today, Lalu Prasad and Mulayam, sources in their parties said, are thinking of bringing in a no-confidence motion against the government.        
	If the threat materialises, it will put the Oppositions claim to have forged unity over economics to test. A BJP leader, however, said his party wasnt keen to embark on a political misadventure.        
	The BJPs reading is that the Left, too, may not be too interested in playing ball with Lalu Prasad and Mulayam at a time it is fighting with its back to the wall in Bengal and Kerala.        
	For the government, the immediate worry, without the Yadavs cushion, is pushing through the Finance Bill. The governments number-crunchers believe they will have to tap unattached MPs like Jaswant Singh and Jaya Prada to bail them out if a crisis looms.        
	While nobody in the Congress seriously believes Mamata Banerjee will do anything precipitate before the Bengal polls, her concern over the possible impact of the bill on Muslims is something that, sources conceded, the Congress itself cannot brush aside.         
	As for the BJP, it has regained the honorific of an honourable Opposition after a disruptive phase. But a senior MP said: We will have to fine-tune our strategies so that we dont end up looking like the B-team of the Congress.        
	The BJPs biggest fear is that the Congress has repeated the success it had reaped with the rural job scheme and the farm-loan waiver. If you ask who is the winner, I will say it is Sonia and the Congress. She has shown the kind of guts we lacked. Leadership is about risk-taking, the MP said.

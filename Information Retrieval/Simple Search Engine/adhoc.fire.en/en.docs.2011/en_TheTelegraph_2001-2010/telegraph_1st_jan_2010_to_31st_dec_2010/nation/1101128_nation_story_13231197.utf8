The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pages go missing from Adarsh file
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pages go missing from Adarsh file
          SADAF MODAK                           Ashok Chavan                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 27: The urban development department has filed a complaint of theft of several pages from a file on the Adarsh Housing Society amid allegations that the papers were stolen to shield officials involved with the high-rise scam.        
	Officials at Marine Drive police station registered a case of theft and attempt to destroy records against unknown persons after Gurudutt Vajpe, a secretary in the urban development department, complained that the papers were taken away from the office without permission.        
	The complaint, filed yesterday, said pages 15, 97, 99 and 297 were missing from the notings of the correspondence department in the urban development ministry.         
	The file, from which the pages are missing, relates to the period between August 30, 2009, and November 1, 2010, when former Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan was in charge of the urban development department.        
	Chavan had to step down on November 9 after allegations of involvement in the scam at the housing society, where flats meant for Kargil war widows were allotted to relatives of politicians, defence officials and bureaucrats.        
	A senior CBI official today claimed it was the agency that first found that certain notings related to the final phase of the scam had gone missing and had brought it to the notice of the state government.        
	The CBI, Mumbai, has started a preliminary inquiry into the scam, and collected documents from various state departments, including the Mumbai collectorate and the urban development department.         
	Former IPS officer-turned-lawyer Y.P. Singh, who has filed a public interest litigation in Bombay High Court on the scam, said the papers could have been stolen to hide manipulation of documents.        
	The scam involves falsification of documents and papers. For certain officials, it would have been less perilous to have the files removed than them being investigated for forgery, Singh said.         
	Singh had earlier filed a complaint with the state anti-corruption bureau and urged it to launch criminal proceedings against former chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and IAS officials, including Ramanand Tiwari.        
	Tiwaris son Onkar is among the 103 persons who were allotted a flat in the Colaba high-rise.         
	The 31-storey building, originally meant to have six floors, has also been found to have violated coastal regulation zone laws and floor space index rules.        
	Prithviraj Chavan, who replaced Ashok Chavan as chief minister, retained urban development along with housing and general administration.

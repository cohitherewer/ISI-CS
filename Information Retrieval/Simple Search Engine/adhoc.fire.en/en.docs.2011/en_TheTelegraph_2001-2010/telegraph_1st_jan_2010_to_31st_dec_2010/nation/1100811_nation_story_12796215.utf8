The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Aussie test rattles Indian students
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Aussie test rattles Indian students
                            
	Melbourne, Aug. 10 (PTI): Hundreds of foreign student nurses, mostly from India, are facing deportation from Australia for lack of proficiency in English.        
	The career threat comes as the nursing students have almost completed their courses and landed lucrative job offers.        
	The students, estimated to number 400 and mostly from India, China, Thailand and the Philippines, claim that the authorities have changed goal posts midway by raising English language standards.        
	The Nursing and Midwifery Board has raised the International English Language Testing System minimum score from 6.5, which means a student has to be a proficient and a competent speaker, to an academic 7 levels. The students say they received no notice of the change before it came into effect on July 1.        
	The Australians are following the UK in applying the strict standards in written and spoken English as a must for allowing work permits and citizenship.        
	The troubled nursing students have received backing from the Australian Nursing Federation (ANF), which has described the change in registration requirements as an absolute bureaucratic debacle. The goal posts have been changed on these students, ANF Victorian branch secretary Lisa Fitzpatrick was quoted as saying by The Australian.        
	Fitzpatrick said the students would struggle to pay back their loans on nursing salaries in India, and that many had sold their homes to finance their courses and stay in Australia in the first place.        
	An Indian nursing student, Prince Joseph, said he had already completed an 18-month course from Ballarat University but to meet Australian standards for a registered nurse, he will have to qualify under the eligibility programme as a good speaker or else face deportation.        
	I spent around $25,000 (over Rs 10.5 lakh) to be a registered nurse but right now there is no registration and no job. It is clear discrimination, Joseph said.        
	The tragedy has also struck some students about to graduate. Those whose visas are due to expire within weeks complain they dont have the time to take additional language studies or sit the tests before being made to return home.        
	They would then have to re-apply for migration, despite many having job offers from hospitals and aged care homes desperately trying to find staff amid a shortage of nurses.

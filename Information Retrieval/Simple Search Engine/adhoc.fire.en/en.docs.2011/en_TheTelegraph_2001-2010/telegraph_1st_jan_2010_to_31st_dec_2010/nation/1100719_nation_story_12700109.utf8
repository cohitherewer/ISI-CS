                              File picture of Moshe Holtzberg                            
	Mumbai, July 18 (PTI): Sandra Samuel, the nanny who saved baby Moshe Holtzberg from terrorists in the 26/11 attack on Chabad House, will be granted Israeli citizenship.        
	The official website of Chabad House, a Jewish centre in Colaba, quoted Israeli interior minister Eli Yishai as saying that a decision to allow Samuel Israeli citizenship was taken recognising her heroism and called the move a humanitarian step.        
	Samuel, 45, a widow, was working for Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and wife Rivka, Moshes parents who stayed in Chabad House since their arrival in Mumbai. Samuel had been looking after Moshe from his birth.        
	On November 26, 2008, two terrorists entered the narrow Colaba lane where the Jewish centre is located and turned the building into a battle zone for the next three days.         
	Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg died in the attack but Samuel, with the help of the familys cook, managed to flee the building with Moshe in her arms.         
	She ignored the crackle of the gunfire and the explosion of the grenades that rocked the building, ran up the stairs and whisked the boy away from the motionless body of his mother to safety.         
	She said Moshe had five finger-shaped bruises on his back. A spokesperson for Chabad in Israel, Menachem Brod, however, said the family did not think the boy had been abused.        
	After their funeral, Samuel left for Israel along with Moshe.         
	She looks after the boy, a little over two years old, at his grandparents home in Afula, Israel.        
	Samuel, a Christian, has given up her life in India, leaving her two sons, aged 18 and 25, to move to Israel, where she said she would stay as long as my baby needs me.        
	Her job with the Holtzberg family was to have been a temporary one but she once said she was so captivated by the giving, courageous couple that she stayed on.

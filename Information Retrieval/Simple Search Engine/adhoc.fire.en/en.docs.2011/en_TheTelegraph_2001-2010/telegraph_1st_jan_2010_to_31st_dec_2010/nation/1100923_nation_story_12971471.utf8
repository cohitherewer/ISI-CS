The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | French fries? No, crisp protein
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      French fries? No, crisp protein
  - Gene job on potatoes          G.S. MUDUR                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: Indian scientists have for the first time bolstered the protein levels in commercial varieties of potatoes by inserting a gene from a grain plant into the carbohydrate-rich tubers after a 15-year academic effort.        
	Scientists at the National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR), New Delhi, have used genetic engineering to develop the first commercially important varieties of potatoes loaded with a near-perfect balanced protein.        
	Plant biotechnology experts not associated with the project have dubbed the feat as significant but some have questioned the nutritional value of these potatoes, arguing that their total protein content is still low.         
	The gene from the tropical grain plant called Amaranthus hypochondriacus has led to a 60 per cent increase in the total protein content of potatoes, the researchers have reported in this weeks issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.        
	The NIPGR scientists have spent over 15 years on the amaranthus project that began in the early 1990s with the discovery of a gene called Ama-1 and the first transformation of a non-commercial European potato in 2000.        
	We see a meaningful improvement in the quantity and the quality of protein in potatoes, Subhra Chakraborty, a scientist involved in the project, told The Telegraph. A series of safety studies on animals and field trials indicate that the transformed potatoes are suitable for commercial cultivation. Weve done the science  our work is ready for regulatory assessment, Chakraborty said.        
	The new research has shown that the addition of Ama-1 raises the total protein content  in the best performing of seven Indian commercial varieties  from 88 milligrams per gram dry weight to 140 milligrams per gram dry weight of potatoes.        
	A 60 per cent increase would be significant, said Suman Sahai, head of Gene Campaign, a non-government organisation campaigning for rigorous scientific assessments of genetically modified crops. The question is whether such an increase is sustainable and if it is, what is the price it is extracting from the potato plant?        
	In collaboration with the Central Potato Research Institute, Shimla, the NIPGR scientists analysed the biochemical makeup of the transformed potatoes and have certified them as similar to ordinary potatoes.         
	Some scientists are also questioning the nutritional value of such potatoes. This is excellent science, but I would argue that it is unlikely to contribute in any meaningful manner to improving protein nutrition, said Prasanta Ghosh, a senior scientist and a former adviser to the Centres department of biotechnology.         
	The total protein content of potato, although enhanced by 60 per cent, still remains relatively low compared to the requirement of protein from a balanced diet, Ghosh said. A kilogram of potatoes transformed with the Ama-1 gene can deliver only about 140 grams of protein. Youll always need an additional source of protein for a balanced meal, Ghosh said.        
	However, the NIPGR scientists say such criticism is unfair. We have not merely added protein, weve also improved the protein quality, said Asis Datta, a senior scientist at the NIPGR who, along with his student Chakraborty, had discovered the Ama-1 gene in 1992-93. The Ama-1 gene has a sequence of amino acids that is a near perfect sequence for a nutritionally rich protein, Datta said.         
	The researchers say the potatoes are not intended to replace other sources of protein, but they will deliver a protein not available at all in conventional potatoes. Some improvement is better than none at all, Chakraborty said.        
	The NIPGR scientists also argue that potatoes are consumed worldwide  they are grown in more than 125 countries, and an estimated one billion people around the planet consume potatoes every day.         
	The scientists said they planned to apply for regulatory approval of these potatoes, but declined to speculate about how long it would take for the genetically modified potatoes to be approved for commercial cultivation.

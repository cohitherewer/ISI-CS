          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 12: The UPA government appears to have revived efforts to push through a two-decade-old legislation  Participation of Workers in Management Bill, 1990  put into cold storage after its introduction in the Rajya Sabha.         
	The labour and employment ministry, led by the Congresss Mallikarjun Kharge, today held wide-ranging discussions with representatives of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), industry bodies, leading central public sector enterprises and senior officials of the department of public sector enterprises.         
	The aim was to arrive at a consensus over the proposed law, shelved after its introduction because of stiff opposition from industry.        
	Trade unions have for long been pressing for the passage of the bill. But the efforts to revive it now are being viewed by political observers as a bid by the Congress-led government to score another point on its aam aadmi agenda.        
	The ministrys invitation letter for todays meeting suggests the government is keen to push through the legislation.         
	Despite various attempts, this ministry has not been able to evolve a consensus. It would be necessary to know the extent of existing participation of workers in management in central public sector undertakings and the steps proposed to be taken for workers participation in the near future, the letter said.         
	The bill seeks to ensure specific and meaningful participation of workers in management  from the shop floor to the company board.        
	The government wants public sector units to take the lead. It would be essential that central public sector undertakings take a lead. Thereafter, it may also be possible to evolve consensus among other stakeholders, the letter said.        
	After being shelved in the face of opposition from the industry, the bill was referred to a standing committee of parliament. The House panel submitted a report favouring the proposal and urged the government to pursue it.         
	The ministry has examined the recommendations of the parliamentary standing committee and it has been decided to pursue the Bill after consulting social partners for modification, if any, in view of new social economic parameters that have evolved since 1990 (an allusion to reforms), the ministry said in the letter.

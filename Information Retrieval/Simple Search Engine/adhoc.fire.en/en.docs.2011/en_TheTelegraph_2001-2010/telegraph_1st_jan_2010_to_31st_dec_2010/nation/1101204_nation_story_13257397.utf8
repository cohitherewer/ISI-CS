The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Deemed to get UGC aid
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Deemed to get UGC aid
  - Education regulator funds for self-financed campuses        BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                                     
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: The UGC will give funds to self-financing deemed universities in a decision that could become controversial.         
	The decision by the higher education regulator was taken at a September 27 meeting of the UGC, three of whose 10 members represent private deemed universities.         
	Self-financing deemed universities are supposed to finance themselves. They charge huge fees from students and UGC has no mechanism to monitor the fee structure. They should not expect any grants from the government, said M.N. Buch, chairman of the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Gwalior.         
	UGC gets its funds from taxpayer money and should spend it in the best interest of the common students of the country, Buch said.         
	At the time of grant of deemed status, the institutions claim they are self-financing and do not want UGC grants, he added.         
	The regulator, which has so far been giving grants only to government institutions and select private institutions of repute, has decided to extend the assistance to self-financing deemed universities which are not getting any salary or maintenance grants from the state or central government but are receiving some grants for any other purpose.         
	The majority of private deemed universities, which have so far not received regular grants from the UGC but have been getting funds to hold seminars or conferences, will benefit.         
	The decision comes at a time a government review panel has recommended the withdrawal of deemed university status to 44 institutions found unfit. The panel, headed by P.N. Tandon, also found 44 other deemed universities deficient on several parameters and suggested giving them three years to make corrections, failing which the tag should be withdrawn. The committee found 38 deemed universities up to the mark.         
	The decision could spark a controversy because three UGC members represent private deemed universities  Achyutananda Samanta of Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubhaneswar, Vidya Yeravdekar of Symbiosis, Pune, and Shivajirao Shripatrao Kadam of Bharati Vidhyapeeth University, Pune.         
	The meeting that decided to accord self-financing deemed universities 12-B status to allow them to access grants was attended by these three and three other members of the commission.         
	At present, 23 of the 130 deemed universities are getting some maintenance grants. Most of them are over 30 years old and have established themselves as institutions of repute. The UGC decision would benefit the new deemed universities.         
	The UGC has also decided that private state universities that are not receiving salary and maintenance grants from the government but are receiving funds for some other purpose will also be eligible for assistance. There are 64 such institutions.         
	The UGC Act says those institutions that are recognised under 12B are eligible for grants. About 6,000 institutions are at present covered by the provision.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish govt report card in June
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitish govt report card in June
  - Bihar CM eyes polls        NALIN VERMA                                    
	Patna, March 26: With an eye on state elections, Nitish Kumar will be releasing his governments annual progress report five months early, keeping aside Rs 1,500 crore for flood relief to keep voters happy.        
	Soon after taking over the reigns on November 24, 2005, Nitish announced that he would present his governments report card on that date every year.         
	The trend-setting practice gave him an edge over his rivals, as it earned him wide appreciation for its transparency, allowing the Opposition and the people to study and question the claims.        
	However, with the indication that the Election Commission might notify the poll dates sometime in August/September, imposing the model code of conduct, Nitish apparently felt that he would not be able to present the report card for the fifth year.         
	Hence, this time he will be presenting it in June.        
	Nitish is aware that floods have been a recurring phenomena in north Bihar and its devastating impact usually generates anger among the affected villagers.         
	We are not worried on this count, as my government has kept Rs 1,500 crore in its contingency fund to ensure flood relief to the people, he said.        
	In fact, the relatively better relief operations in the region devastated by the Kosi floods in 2008 paid his party good dividends. The JD(U) fared extremely well in the Kosi region in last years Lok Sabha polls.        
	Nitish also has no qualms accepting that his party is in the poll mode now. It is the poll year. We will go to people telling them what we have done for them and requesting them to judge our performance, he said, adding: The JD(U) will go in alliance with the BJP. There will be no trouble at all in striking a deal on seat-sharing between the two parties.        
	Nitish categorically ruled out any possibility of shuffling or expanding of his council of ministers. Elections are drawing closer and I do not think re-structuring of the council of ministers at this juncture holds any meaning. It is the time for the peoples representatives to go to the electorate and get their mandate renewed.        
	The chief ministers clear no to the expansion of his ministry must have disappointed a few leaders within the JD(U) and also in the BJP who had been waiting for a ministerial berth ahead of the polls.

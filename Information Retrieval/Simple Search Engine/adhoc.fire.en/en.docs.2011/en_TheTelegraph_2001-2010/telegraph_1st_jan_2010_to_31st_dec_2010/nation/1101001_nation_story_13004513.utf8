          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: Security agencies will keep round-the-clock vigil across the country for the next four days, especially watching fringe religious groups and elements who could trigger mischief.         
	It will be a crucial few hours till tomorrow afternoon. After that, we will be able to reach some conclusions, a source said this evening. The good part is that four hours have passed peacefully since the judgment. If the night passes peacefully, then it will be fine.        
	Sources said groups such as the Abdul Nasser Madhany-led Peoples Democratic Party in Kerala were under watch. Of the 32 places declared sensitive on Tuesday, four are in Kerala. The judicial custody of Madhany and 12 others, lodged in a jail on Bangalores outskirts, have been extended till October 12.         
	The cabinet committee on security discussed measures to ensure communal peace, sources said. State governments have been asked to be firm in dealing with even minor incidents of disquiet.         
	As the verdict was announced, the control room at North Block bustled with activity. Joint secretary-rank officials in the home ministry will monitor the control room in shifts.        
	Bulk SMS ban        
	The ban on bulk mobile text messages has been extended till October 1 to prevent rumours fomenting trouble.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Brooms out, but in hospital
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Brooms out, but in hospital
          G.C. SHEKHAR                           A Youth Congress worker during the clean-up drive                                  
	Chennai, Nov. 13: Dozens of Youth Congress workers used brooms, mops and acid to clear away cobwebs and remove stains from the corridors of a government hospital today, joining student volunteers in a clean-up drive as part of a birthday celebration.        
	But as the nearly 100 Congress members joined in the effort, one couldnt help wonder if it packed a message for central leaders: clean up corruption in the Union telecom ministry, headed by A. Raja of ally DMK, which heads the ruling coalition in Tamil Nadu.        
	For the record, the clean-up act at the Institute of Health and Hospital for Children at Egmore in Chennai was to coincide with the birthday celebrations of Union home minister P. Chidambarams son Karti.        
	Normally we celebrate our leaders birthdays through blood donation camps and distributing clothes and food. When a local magazine highlighted the sordid conditions in this hospital complex, we decided to clean up this place to coincide with Kartis birthday (which falls on Tuesday), said local Congress councillor M. Rukamangathan, who organised the effort.        
	Both Chidambaram and his son have been insisting on a greater role for the Congress in Tamil Nadu, where elections are due next year. While Chidambaram spoke his mind in Trichy last month, Karti has been saying the Congress should be given two Assembly seats for every Lok Sabha constituency. This works out to 78 Assembly seats in a 234-member House.        
	In the 2006 state elections, the Congress had contested 48 seats and won 34.        
	Today, as the volunteers, in white T-shirts with Kartis face printed on them, got down to cleaning up the hospital, the councillor insisted there was no political message in the exercise.         
	Rukamangathans team had been working to clean up the compound for the past two days, clearing the place of shrubs and garbage. One team spent two days cleaning the choked sewers.         
	It is the duty of the public works department to keep the hospital premises clean but it showed no interest though our director complained every week, said a hospital official.        
	The public works department is headed by chief minister M. Karunanidhi.        
	Finally we can breathe a little easier, said Muthukumar, the father of a five-year-old patient.

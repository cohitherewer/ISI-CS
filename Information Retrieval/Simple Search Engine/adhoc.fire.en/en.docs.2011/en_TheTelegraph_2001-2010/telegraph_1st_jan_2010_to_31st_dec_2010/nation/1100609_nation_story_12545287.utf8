The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress jolt to Chiranjeevi
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Congress jolt to Chiranjeevi
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, June 8: The hero has learnt his lesson  never trust politicians.        
	Actor-turned-politician Chiranjeevi got his first taste of political manoeuvres in the recently concluded Rajya Sabha elections in Andhra Pradesh after the Congress courted him, invited him to Delhi and then forgot all about him, all within a space of 48 hours.        
	The hurt actor, who gave up films two years ago to launch his Praja Rajyam Party (PRP), later told the editor of a pro-Congress vernacular paper: See, how the Congress has let me down.        
	The Congress had invited Chiranjeevi to Delhi on June 2, five days before yesterdays elections, as a fallback after MP Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddys mini revolt.        
	Chiranjeevi, who met Congress president Sonia Gandhi, later returned to Andhra, where he held a meeting of the PRP executive as well as the legislature party and promised unconditional support of the partys 18 legislators to the Congress.        
	The bubble burst soon. After the Congress high command tamed Jaganmohan, who had the support of nearly 50 MLAs, including a dozen state ministers, it forgot Chiranjeevi. So much so that Chiranjeevi was not even requested to endorse a set of nominations before the Election Commission, said a PRP leader.        
	All four Congress nominees, including Union minister Jairam Ramesh and three other sitting members, went on to be elected unanimously.        
	The two candidates of the Telugu Desam Party Yarlagadda Satyanarayana Chowdhary and G. Sudharani  were also elected unopposed.        
	On June 4, the last day of filing nominations, Chiranjeevi had kept himself free so that he could be present when Ramesh filed his papers. But neither the state Congress, nor national Congress leaders bothered to invite him, the PRP leader said.        
	Disgusted, Chiranjeevi left for Chennai that evening.        
	But before he left, he voiced his hurt to the editor, who told chief minister K. Rosaiah what Chiranjeevi had said.         
	Rosaiah then called Chiranjeevi and thanked him profusely on behalf of the Congress president and assured him that he shouldnt feel ignored and that the Congress would use his services whenever needed.        
	Rosaiah later called the editor and told him to carry a news item that he (the chief minister) had phoned Chiranjeevi to thank him for his support and that the Congress would always be indebted to him.        
	Sources close to the actor said it left Chiranjeevi surprised as he was not sure why he was being thanked.         
	But by now he must have realised why  its all about manoeuvres.         
	The PRP has been losing ground after it failed to click in last years elections and political watchers say Chiranjeevi wouldnt like his film base to be affected.        
	One observer said the actor was planning to become a producer and also direct two films. By October, Chiranjeevi is likely to announce a new film, the observer added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kasab to remain in special cell
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Kasab to remain in special cell
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 7: The Maharashtra government has decided to keep Pakistani gunman Ajmal Kasab at the bomb-proof cell specially created for him inside Arthur Road jail till Bombay High Court formally confirms his death sentence.        
	The decision followed a meeting of additional chief secretary (home) Chandra Iyengar, who visited the jail in south-central Mumbai today, held with top police officials.        
	We have decided to keep Kasab in Arthur Road jail at least for some time. Arthur Road jail not only has all the security measures in place, but it is also convenient to keep him here if we have to take him to Bombay High Court for hearings later. We could always shift him to another jail after the high court process is over, Iyengar said after the meeting.        
	Kasab, sentenced to death yesterday in the 26/11 case, has been in solitary confinement in a special barrack located next to the courtroom of special court judge M.L. Tahaliyani since the trial began in April 2009. Apart from round-the-clock vigil by Mumbai police, Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel have been guarding the jail.        
	The state government has reportedly spent over Rs 5 crore to secure the cell with a metal roof to ensure protection against any possible bomb attack.

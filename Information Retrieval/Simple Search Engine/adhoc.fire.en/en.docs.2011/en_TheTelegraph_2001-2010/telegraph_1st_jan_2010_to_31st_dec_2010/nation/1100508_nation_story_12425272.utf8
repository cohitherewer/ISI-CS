	New Delhi. May 7: Kapil Sibal has decided to meet representatives from states to assuage concerns raised by them over a proposed new overarching higher education regulator before approaching the cabinet with the plan.        
	The HRD minister has called a meeting with state education ministers on June 18 and with the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) on June 19, to thrash out differences on the proposed regulator.        
	The move is strategic because support for the regulator from states and from the CABE  Indias apex education advisory body  will help Sibal tackle opposition from within the central government.        
	Several states, including Bengal, have objected to the proposed National Commission for Higher Education and Research that will replace the current higher education regulators.

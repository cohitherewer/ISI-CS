The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MK meet sparks early poll buzz
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      MK meet sparks early poll buzz
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	New Delhi, Dec. 13: Bengal governor M.K. Narayanan today called on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pratibha Patil, fanning rumours about early elections in the state.        
	The meeting was termed routine but political circles were abuzz that it could be related to Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjees demand to advance the Bengal polls, scheduled in April-May next year.        
	Similar speculation had begun after Narayanan met Pranab Mukherjee, the seniormost Congress leader from Bengal, yesterday and home minister P. Chidambaram on Friday. The meeting with Pranab was said to be informal and officials remained tight-lipped about it.        
	The proposed visit of chief election commissioner S.Y. Quraishi to Bengal next week has added to the speculation. Poll panel officials said Quraishi would merely take stock of the situation in the state with polls scheduled in less than six months.        
	Narayanan today refused to take questions on elections after the meeting with Singh in Parliament. On violence in Bengal, he said: All violence is a crime and we are working on it.        
	Mamata has been demanding that polls be advanced to January-February so they are completed before the Madhyamik and Higher Secondary exams begin in late February. Also, Trinamul does not want to give the Left Front, demoralised by a string of electoral defeats since the 2008 panchayat polls, any extra time to recoup.        
	Given Bengals political situation, students will get distracted in the run-up to the elections. So we want the poll process to be completed before the exams are held, a Trinamul leader said, adding that Mamata had taken up the issue with Pranab.        
	Sources said the Centre was desisting from rejecting Mamatas demand outright, as Trinamul is the second largest UPA partner. It is believed to be weighing the options keeping in mind that the ruling CPM could make a big issue of it.        
	The Election Commission can hold polls any time within six months of the due date. But given the Maoist menace and political clashes in Bengal, officials said they needed time to ensure elections were free and fair.        
	Bengal is more sensitive than Bihar. We took more than a month to complete the election process in Bihar. In Bengal, too, the elections would have to be held in a number of phases, a poll panel official said.

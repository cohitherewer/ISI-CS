	Ranaghat/Calcutta, May 21: Mamata Banerjee today described Rajiv Gandhi as my dear leader on his death anniversary, signalling to the Centre she would keep her alliance with the Congress afloat despite the break-up over the Bengal civic polls.        
	Today Rajiv Gandhi was killed. He was my dear leader and I must pay homage to him on this day, an emotional Mamata said while campaigning at the Ranaghat Mukti Sangha ground, about 90km from Calcutta.        
	Ironically, all her 19 candidates for the Ranaghat municipality are pitted against Congress nominees. Mamata too hit out at state Congress leaders throughout her hour-long speech for trying to split the anti-Left vote to strengthen the CPM. She, however, did not name anybody.        
	I want you to vote for Trinamul candidates. Reject those who have entered the fray midway to divide the anti-Left vote and strengthen the CPM, she said.        
	Mamata said she would leave for Delhi today to attend the first anniversary of the UPA II government tomorrow.        
	I am with the UPA and will remain in it as long as I can stay with honour. I shall attend the first anniversary programme of the UPA II government as a mark of respect to the Prime Minister, she said.        
	Three days ago, Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhis political secretary Ahmed Patel had telephoned Mamata requesting her to come to Delhi for the anniversary programme.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata would use the development to rebuild her bridges with senior Congress leaders, including Bengal Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee, whom she had accused of breaking up the alliance.

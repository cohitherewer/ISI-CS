                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Honour killing stink in business student death
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                            Ajit Saini and Anshu Tomar                          
	Lucknow, May 8: The body of a business management student, head severed and legs chopped off, was dug out from a paddy field in Muzaffarnagar yesterday in another suspected honour killing amid fears that his missing girlfriend might have been murdered too.        
	Police today arrested the girls father and brother, though both had got themselves admitted to a nursing home.        
	Last month, a three-month pregnant Delhi-based journalist, whose family didnt approve of her relationship with the man she wanted to marry, was found smothered to death in her Jharkhand home.        
	Koderma police later arrested Nirupama Pathaks mother, the only other person present when the 23-year-old was murdered. However, a magistrate yesterday ordered the police to file a case of cheating, rape and abetment of suicide against the dead journalists boyfriend following a complaint by her mother.        
	Muzaffarnagar police said 23-year-old Ajit Sainis body was found in New Mandi, about 7km from the West Uttar Pradesh town. Sources said some villagers saw body parts lying in the field and called the police.         
	Ajits killing was most brutal, SP (city) Rajiv Malhotra told reporters. His legs were chopped off and head was severed from the body.        
	The officer said a search had been launched for Anshu Tomar, 21, the missing girlfriend of the final-year BBA student.        
	Both Anshu, a BA student, and Ajit studied in City Sriram College in Muzaffarnagar district, 375km west of Lucknow. Ajits relatives said the two had been in love for the past couple of years but the girls family was against the inter-caste relationship.        
	The girls family was against their marriage as Ajit was from a backward caste, said Ajits neighbour Santosh Singh.        
	Both backward castes, the Tomars consider themselves higher on the social ladder than the Sainis.        
	Ajits uncle Ram Kishore said the couple had eloped in March but Ajit had called home in April to say that Anshus parents had relented and were willing to accept him.         
	Ajit called on April 29 to say he was coming back to get married with Anshu, but after that we didnt hear from him. We dont know what has happened to the girl. She may have been killed too.        
	Relatives said Ajit was planning to do his MBA from a college in Pune.        
	As the needle of suspicion pointed to Anshus family, her father Narendra, 52, and brother Anuj, 19, got themselves admitted to a nursing home in Barot district that adjoins Muzaffarnagar, only to be arrested minutes later.        
	Circle inspector Sashisekhar Singh said the police were questioning Anshus father and brother. Both families are upper middle class economically, he said.        
	On March 30, a court in Karnal, Haryana, had sentenced five members of a panchayat to death for the honour killing of a young couple, in a landmark verdict against such kangaroo courts whose writ runs strong in several areas of Indias backward hinterland.        
	But in a public show of defiance against the order, thousands had assembled in Kurukshetra last month and condemned the court ruling.

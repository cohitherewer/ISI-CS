          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Nanoor, May 15: Two men were killed in Birbhums Nanoor block today when over 200 CPM cadres clashed with Trinamul Congress supporters over turf the Marxists had lost.        
	District Trinamul leaders identified the two victims as farmers Sanjay Ghosh, 28, and Al Amin Sheikh, 30, and claimed they were party supporters.         
	Farhad Abbas, the additional superintendent of police, Birbhum, refused to reveal the identity of the dead.        
	He said six people were injured and at least 40 houses, belonging to supporters of either party, were torched during the clashes that broke out in a string of villages in Nanoor around 1.30 this afternoon.         
	No one had been arrested till late this evening.         
	Nanoor had witnessed a similar clash a fortnight ago when nearly a hundred houses were torched.        
	The police believe that the clashes are a result of the CPMs desperation to regain lost ground in Nanoor after Trinamul trumped the Marxists in Birbhum in last years Lok Sabha polls.         
	Trouble started today after CPM men attacked Trinamul supporters at Dighirpar village. The clashes soon spread to four other villages  Madda, Sirajpur, Nanagore and Khujutipara  with more activists from both the parties joining in. The police said bombs were hurled and firearms used.         
	Armed CPM cadres attacked our supporters and torched nearly 40 houses in Madda and Dighirpar, Anubrata Mondal, the Trinamul district president in Birbhum, alleged.        
	Trinamul supporters retaliated after the news reached Sirajpur and Khujutipara.         
	Eight Trinamul supporters suffered bullet injuries in Khujutipara. Sanjay and Al Amin have died, Mondal said.         
	Of those injured, the condition of Rahim Sheikh, 32, who took a bullet in his chest, was stated to be critical.        
	Senior police officers said forces could not be sent to all the five villages during the clashes.        
	By the time the police reached Sirajpur, the clashes had already spilled into neighbouring Khujutipara, an officer said.        
	It took time to send reinforcements there. The warring groups attacked each other, taking advantage of the absence of adequate police personnel.        
	Local CPM leaders, however, denied involvement in the clashes.        
	The villagers resisted a Trinamul attack on CPM workers in Khujutipara village. In the clashes, two were killed and six injured, said Hashibur Rahman, a CPM zonal committee member.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Somnath speaks, Karat skips
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Somnath speaks, Karat skips
          OUR BUREAU                          Somnath Chatterjee unveils a picture of Jyoti Basu in the Assembly. (Amit Datta)                                  
	July 8: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat today skipped the Jyoti Basu memorial lecture delivered by expelled veteran Somnath Chatterjee, underscoring the rift between the partys Bengal unit and the central leadership.         
	Fellow politburo members Sitaram Yechury and Brinda Karat also stayed away from the event on the Bengal Assembly premises to mark the 96th birth anniversary of the late patriarch. All three leaders had been invited by Bengal Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim.        
	While Yechury and Brinda were both learnt to be in Delhi, Karat was out of station on party work. None could be reached for comment but sources said Karat was against attending any event where Chatterjee, whom he had expelled for not toeing the party line on the nuclear deal, was an invitee.        
	Party sources, however, confirmed that Karat would attend the birth centenary celebrations of ideologue Promode Dasgupta, starting from July 13 in Calcutta.         
	The decision to invite Chatterjee appears to have been deliberate on the part of the Bengal leaders, who recently disagreed with the central leaders on the wisdom of calling Mondays bandh on the same day as the BJP.        
	While Karat stayed away, Chatterjee seemed to enjoy his moment, sitting beside chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee who had quietly walked out of a politburo meeting that refused to exempt Bengal from the July 5 strike.         
	The former Lok Sabha Speaker, who unveiled a portrait of Basu by artist Wasim Kapoor, said the former chief minister was never dogmatic and had an excellent personal relationship even with Opposition leaders.        
	The comment could be interpreted as a dig at Karat, seen as inflexible by his critics who blame his decision to snap ties with the Congress as one of the reasons for the Bengal CPMs successive election defeats.        
	Chatterjee praised Basu as the brightest star that had shone in the countrys political firmament for a long time and recalled how Basu had been entreated repeatedly in 1996 to become Prime Minister.        
	Halim said Jyotibabu would have become the best Prime Minister of the country.        
	Bhattacharjee said Basus success was in being able to lend a national dimension to the struggle waged by communists for the well-being of workers and peasants.        
	State Congress chief Manas Bhuniya attended the event and also spoke on Basu. Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee stayed away despite being invited by the Speaker.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia amma jab makes crowd clap
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sonia amma jab makes crowd clap
          ASHUTOSH MISHRA                          Rahul Gandhi                                  
	Malkangiri, Sept. 12: The Biju Janata Dal today tried to rouse the people against the Centre on the Polavaram project by invoking Oriya pride, but it took a film stars comment on Sonia amma to get the crowd to respond.        
	Tribals ferried from various parts of Malkangiri made up the modest crowd at the partys Malkangiri Banchao, Polavaram Hatao rally.        
	BJD ministers accused the Centre of deliberately undermining the development of the state. Launching a blistering attack on Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, they charged them with stalling the Posco and Niyamgiri projects in Orissa on flimsy grounds while supporting the controversial Polavaram multi-purpose project in Andhra Pradesh that threatens to inundate 29 villages in Malkangiris Mottu tehsil.         
	They have no concern for the people of Orissa as the Congress stands no chance here. But they are backing Andhra Pradesh on Polavaram with an eye on their vote bank in the Telengana region. But Oriyas are not going to take it lying down. They know that Sonia and Rahul are their enemies, revenue minister Surya Narayan Patro thundered.        
	Calling for an all-out war against the Centre, labour minister Pushpendra Singhdeo described it as a fight for the self-respect of the Oriyas who are being humiliated by the Congress-led UPA government. They have not even bothered to seek our opinion on the Polavaram project though it is going to cause massive damage in our tribal-dominated areas, he said.        
	Energy minister Atanu Savyasachi Nayak reminded the crowd that the Biju Janata Dal was launched to fight for the Oriya cause. We are not going to let down our people. The party will fight for them everywhere, whether its Malkangiri, Lanjigarh or Kujang. This rally is only the beginning of the battle against the injustice being meted out to Orissa, he said, accusing the Centre of conspiring to keep the state backward.        
	There was little cheering or clapping from the crowd, made up mostly of Koya tribals, but the party sought to make up for their apparent lack of enthusiasm by showcasing its tribal leaders Ramesh Majhi, a junior minister, and Jayram Pangi, the Koraput MP.        
	Majhi launched a personal attack on Sonia, whom he accused of deliberately blocking the progress of Orissa. Let her know her Italian policies are not going to work here. We will fight this injustice being meted out to our people in every block and district. This is going to be a state-wide movement, he thundered.        
	Finance minister Prafulla Ghadei, the senior-most minister in Naveens cabinet, targeted Rahul. He talks of being the soldier of the tribals. He should come to Malkangiri and fight for the cause of the Koyas, he said.         
	But the only speaker who could get the crowd to respond was Berhampur MP and matinee idol Siddhanta Mohapatra. He had a piece of advice for Sonia. They call her Sonia amma. She should try to understand the meaning of that. A mother treats all her children with the same kind of love. The moment she starts discriminating she ceases to be a mother, he said, evoking spontaneous applause for the first time.         
	Mohapatras presence seemed more important to some than the Polavaram controversy. Bhaskar Majumdar, a businessman, said: For me, the biggest attraction here is Siddhanta Mohapatra. I had seen his movies but this is the first time I am seeing him in person. He looks good. I dont know much about this Polavaram business.

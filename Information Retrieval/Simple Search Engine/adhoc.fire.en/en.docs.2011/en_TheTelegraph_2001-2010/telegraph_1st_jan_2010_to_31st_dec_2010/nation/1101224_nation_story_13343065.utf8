The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bail for Maoist politburo leader
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bail for Maoist politburo leader
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Dec. 23: A CPI (Maoist) politburo member from Bengal who had been sentenced to life by a fast-track court was granted bail by Jharkhand High Court today.         
	Amitabh Bagchi, 53, had moved the high court against an order of a fast-track court, which had awarded him life sentence.         
	The high court ruled that merely possessing Naxalite literature was not a criminal offence.         
	Bagchi, however, will not be released from jail because he has been remanded in a criminal case pending in Andhra Pradesh.        
	The Maoist leader was arrested from Ranchi station on August 24, 2009, on the basis of a tip-off.         
	He was allegedly carrying Maoist literature.         
	During interrogation, Bagchi is said to have confessed his involvement with the Maoists.        
	At the end of his trial in the fast-track court, judge Alok Kumar Dubey found him guilty under Section 121 of the Indian Penal Code (waging war against the government) and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, and sentenced him to life.        
	During the trial in the high court, Bagchis advocate Jitendra Singh argued that the police had recovered Naxalite texts from him, but that did not mean that he was advertising or propagating rebel ideology to incite people.         
	Singh disputed the lower courts stand that the books supposedly seized from him, such as Jail Break Jehanabad and Dandkaranya Nai Jansatta, were highly provocative.         
	If the books were indeed so provocative, then the judge ought to have been transformed into (believing) in the Naxalite way of thinking, the advocate said.        
	After hearing the case, the high court said that possessing Naxalite literature did not make anyone a criminal.

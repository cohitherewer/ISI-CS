	Srinagar, April 9: The Jammu and Kashmir Assembly today saw members of the Opposition Peoples Democratic Party smashing chairs and uprooting mikes over the passage of a controversial bill that will allow inter-district job recruitment for Scheduled Castes.        
	The PDP had supported the bill in its original form that said residents of a particular district alone were eligible for government posts in that area. It was against the amended bill because Scheduled Castes from Jammu would apply for government jobs in Kashmir.         
	Jammu has a significant Scheduled Caste population, but Kashmir has a negligible percentage. The BJP and several parties were also with the PDP.         
	The brainchild to exclude the Scheduled Castes from the inter-district restriction was the Congresss, which is an ally of the ruling National Conference (NC).        
	There were differences between the NC and the Congress because the NC, too, supported the original bill.         
	The bill was put to vote by the Speaker through a voice poll without heeding the sloganeering.        
	This further infuriated the PDP members, who went on the rampage. Speaker Mohammad Akbar Lone later said five microphones were uprooted.         
	PDP president Mehbooba Mufti called the passage of the bill a murder of democracy. All we wanted was a discussion but the government was unwilling. The reserved category people should enjoy reservation proportionate to their population in a particular district, she said.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 25: Amar Singh and Jaya Prada, expelled from the Samajwadi Party for anti-party activities, today sought the Supreme Courts intervention to pre-empt any move to disqualify them from Parliament.        
	The duo claimed that since they had been expelled they could not technically be said to have voluntarily given up party membership to come within the scope of the anti-defection law.        
	However, under a Supreme Court ruling of 1996, expelled members are to be treated as deemed members of a party in matters of disqualification. They are bound by the party whip and will incur disqualification if they fail to toe the line.        
	That is anti-dissent, Singhs lawyers said. Neither could the duo join another party nor float a party of their own, their petitions said. The top court judgment was also contrary to legislative intent, the lawyers claimed.        
	Singh is a Rajya Sabha member whereas Jaya Prada was elected from Uttar Pradeshs Rampur. They were expelled in February 2010.

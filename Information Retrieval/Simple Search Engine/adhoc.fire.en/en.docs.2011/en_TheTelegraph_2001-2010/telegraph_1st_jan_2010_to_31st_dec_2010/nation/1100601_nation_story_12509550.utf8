The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong wary   of Jagan
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong wary   of Jagan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Jaganmohan Reddy                                        
	New Delhi, May 31: Jaganmohan Reddy today arrived in Delhi defiant as ever but the Congress leadership ruled out tough action, fearing such a move could maim the party in Andhra Pradesh.        
	The Congress, therefore, has decided on a more-carrot-than-stick policy to pacify the son of late chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, who died in a helicopter crash last year.        
	Jagan asserted that his yatra through sensitive Telangana, which came in defiance of the party leaderships warnings and has triggered violence, would continue. His yatra is being seen in Andhra as an attempt to bully the party into handing him the chief ministers post.        
	But Jagan today said: Whatever Im doing is for my father. Im sure the Congress president will understand my point. It is not political; I am not doing this as an MP or a leader but as my fathers son.        
	Senior Congress leaders appeared to reciprocate the sentimental side of the claim, saying they wanted YSRs son to stay in the party and taking a lenient view of his immaturity.        
	M. Veerappa Moily, the general secretary in charge of Andhra affairs, ruled out punishment. Asked if the Congress was angry with Jagan, he said: No, no, he is a young man and son of our great leader and he is always with the Congress. Dont worry about it.        
	The central leadership had asked Jagan not to conduct rallies in Telangana, a region still tense over the statehood controversy. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had even warned him against the yatra and threatened action, but Jagan kicked off the programme on May 28, sparking violence in Warangal district.        
	Jagan said the yatra is meant to console the families of those who had committed suicide or died of shock after YSRs death.        
	The Congress, though, doesnt want to discard the stick altogether for fear it could send a message down the ranks that indiscipline is not an issue.        
	Responding to questions on Jagans defiance, spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan said: The party has taken cognisance of the matter. It is under consideration.        
	Natarajan, however, issued a veiled warning to Jagans supporters saying: The Congress is over 100 years old and cannot be weakened by one or two individuals. There is no time frame to take a decision on his action but the party would take appropriate action at a suitable time.        
	Jagan is upset because of the partys deal with Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyam Party, a step some view as the Congresss attempt to create a buffer against YSRs son. But Moily clarified today that the deal was limited to the Rajya Sabha elections.        
	The central leadership will try its best to persuade Jagan to lie low for now and wait his turn.

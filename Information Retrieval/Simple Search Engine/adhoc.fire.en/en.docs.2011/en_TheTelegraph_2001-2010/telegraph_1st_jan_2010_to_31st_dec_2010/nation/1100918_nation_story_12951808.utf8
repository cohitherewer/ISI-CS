The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Verbal volleys after tennis bonhomie
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Verbal volleys after tennis bonhomie
          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: The bonhomie shown at Flushing Meadows last week by the Indian and Pakistani ambassadors to the UN may prove short-lived.        
	Their two countries today exchanged volleys on the court of international politics, with New Delhi telling Islamabad not to meddle in Indias internal affairs by issuing gratuitous statements on Kashmir.        
	Earlier, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had said in Islamabad that India should exercise restraint in Kashmir.        
	The exchange has cast a shadow on the possibility that Qureshi and Indian foreign minister S.M. Krishna may have a pull-aside in New York next week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, which the two will attend.        
	South Block believes that Islamabad will now raise the temperature over Kashmir at the UN meeting in New York, the city where Indias Rohan Bopanna and Pakistans Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi had scripted history this month by teaming up to reach the US Open mens doubles final.        
	In a rare show of solidarity, the Indian and Pakistani ambassadors to the UN, Hardeep Puri and Abdullah Hussain Haroon, had sat together in the stands to cheer the doubles pair. But the two diplomats are now likely to exchange angry words on Kashmir at the UN session.        
	A Krishna-Qureshi meeting in New York hasnt been totally ruled out despite todays developments. It was being seen as a possible ice-breaker after their fractious news conference in Islamabad on July 15, although the two had spoken over the phone on August 13 after India offered flood aid to Pakistan.        
	Even if they do not have a pull-aside, they will face each other at the Saarc foreign ministers meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.        
	Foreign ministry spokesperson Vishnu Prakash today said: India firmly rejects gratuitous statements issued by Pakistan on Jammu and Kashmir, which amount to interference in the internal affairs of India.        
	New Delhi, however, kept the dialogue door open. India reiterates its commitment to resolving issues of mutual concern with Pakistan through dialogue and peaceful means. However, Pakistan must fulfil its solemn commitment of not allowing territory under its control to be used for terrorism directed against India, Prakash said.        
	In Islamabad, Qureshi said: Pakistan has sought early and full resumption of the dialogue process with India (and) wants a constructive, sustained and result-oriented dialogue... on all issues, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.        
	At the same time, he said, Pakistan will continue to stand by the Kashmiris in their just cause.        
	Gross and systematic abuse of human rights... in Kashmir must end. Pakistan calls upon the Government of India to exercise restraint, Qureshi said.

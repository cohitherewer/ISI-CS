	Hubli, Dec. 22 (PTI): Farmers in Hubli today staged a rasta roko protesting a sharp fall in the prices of onion after the Centre allowed duty-free import of the commodity.         
	The farmers, who staged the protest outside the office of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee, demanded that the old price should be retained.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhopal, Sept. 7: A senior Indian Forest Service officer has been accused of sexual misdemeanour by a young researcher in Canada.        
	A.K. Bhattacharya, the chief executive officer of the Madhya Pradesh Eco-Tourism Development Board, was in Vancouver to attend a mid-career training course at the University of British Columbia between August 8 and 22.        
	The victim, whose identity and nationality are being withheld but who is of Chinese origin, was serving as assistant course co-coordinator of the training programme. She has filed a complaint, following which the university authorities have informed the Indian high commission.         
	The Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (IGNFA), Dehra Dun, which had sponsored Bhattacharya, has sought an explanation from the official.        
	In his response, Bhattacharya said: I was asked whether I had called the woman to my hotel room late on the night of August 18. I told them that she was drunk and came to my hotel room on her own. the woman, who is in her 20s, said she wanted to see some photographs on my laptop regarding the training and I showed her the same.        
	The official has written to IGNFA that he viewed the woman just like my daughter and nothing should be read into it.         
	In Bhopal, where Bhattacharya is a familiar face, the news of his alleged unbecoming conduct has sent shockwaves. Most of his colleagues find the allegation absurd and aimed at tarnishing the image of the official.         
	Bhattacharya said the woman perhaps cooked up the outlandish allegation to save herself. Possibly her superiors might have come to know about her indiscretion and sought an explanation.

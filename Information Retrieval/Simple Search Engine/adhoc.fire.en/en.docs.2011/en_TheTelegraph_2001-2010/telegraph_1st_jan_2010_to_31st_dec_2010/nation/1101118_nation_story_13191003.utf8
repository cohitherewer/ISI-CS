          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Yeddyurappa (top), Gadkari                           
	New Delhi, Nov. 17: The BJPs anti-corruption crusade threatens to claim one of its own.         
	B.S. Yeddyurappa, who toted up more than his share of troubles in the little over two years he has been Karnataka chief minister, is in hot water again.        
	Documents released by the Opposition in Karnataka alleged that Yeddyurappa freed government land to favour his two sons, a son-in-law and daughters-in-law.         
	BJP president Nitin Gadkari  in a spot himself for allegedly recommending allotees to flats in the Adarsh housing society in Colaba  is expected to meet RSS leaders in Nagpur over the weekend.         
	RSS joint general secretary Suresh Soni met him on Monday to demand an explanation on the charges against Yeddyurappa.         
	The Sangh is concerned on two scores. Like Gadkari, the chief minister is its hand-picked nominee and it steadfastly supported him through the crises he faced.         
	Second, it fears that the BJPs campaign against corruption might take a beating if Yeddyurappa remains in the public domain for the wrong reasons.        
	In one case, Yeddyurappa allegedly denotified 11.25 acres (now valued at about Rs 181 crore) acquired in February 2004 by the Bangalore Development Authority for a song in order to create a residential area.         
	After denotification, around 2.5 acres, valued around Rs 38.15 crore in the market, was sold at a tenth of the market price to a firm called Besto Infrastructure Bangalore Limited. Besto is a subsidiary of Besto Ice-cream. It is a partner of a real estate firm owned by Yeddyurappas sons, Raghavendra and Vijayendra, and son-in-law R.N. Sohan Kumar.        
	The chief ministers contention was that denotifications were permitted under the law and his predecessors had been doing that.        
	The BJPs legal eagles are at work to see if the denotifications were legal.        
	Yeddyurappa will resort to rearguard action. He is likely to announce a high-level probe into all the land deals during his regime as well as those of his immediate predecessors, H.D. Kumaraswamy and S.M. Krishna.        
	Sources maintained he had indeed complained to the BJP president about Ananth Kumar, Bangalore MP and general secretary, for instigating the latest round of trouble.        
	His political secretary Dhananjay Kumar denied the news.        
	The chief ministers problems arise from the overwhelming presence of Vokkaligas in the state administration.         
	The Vokkaligas are loyal to Deve Gowda and Kumaraswamy. There is a marginal presence of Lingayats, the community to which Yeddyurappa belongs.

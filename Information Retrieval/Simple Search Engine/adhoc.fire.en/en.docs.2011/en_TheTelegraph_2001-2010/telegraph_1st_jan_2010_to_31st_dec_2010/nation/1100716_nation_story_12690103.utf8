	New Delhi, July 15 (PTI): An Indian Army officer is under a probe by the UN mission in Congo on sexual exploitation and abuse charges after he was allegedly found in the company of sex workers in a hotel there.        
	The investigation is under way in Congo, where the Indian troops are based under the UN mission, and army headquarters here has been informed in this regard.        
	Defence ministry sources said here today that Major R.S. Ghumman, belonging to the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles battalion, was being questioned by the probe team.        
	Visiting sex workers while serving under the UN flag is barred under peacekeeping rules and the code of conduct for the Congo mission. The probe is being handled by the conduct and discipline unit of the UN, the sources said.        
	The army chief and the adjutant generals branch in the headquarters are aware of the investigations and are fully informed on the matter, a source said.        
	Ghumman was reportedly found accompanying sex workers on July 6 while leaving a pub in North Kivu province. He was at the pub along with a military observer from Tunisia and the two left the place with local women, according to reports reaching here.        
	The two were noticed with the women by an employee of the UNs office of internal oversight services. The officers were reportedly having an argument with them.        
	The employee, identified as Alexandria, reported the incident to the UN missions military police unit and a complaint was registered with the discipline unit on charges of sexual exploitation and abuse.        
	A case of violation of curfew, too, was registered. Under UN rules, officers on duty during the day should not venture out of their residential facilities at night. The discipline unit also sought log details of a car and the vehicle was identified as one belonging to the Tunisian officer, who admitted to being with Ghumman at the hotel that night. Ghumman is on the verge of completing his tenure in Congo and is expected back in India soon.        
	The Indian Army, too, might initiate disciplinary proceedings against him based on the probe report, the sources said.         
	In March 2008, three Indian peacekeepers in Congo were detained after a woman complained that they had raped her. UN Secretary General Ban ki-Moon had demanded disciplinary action against them for sexually exploiting local women and children.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt focuses on averting notice
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Govt focuses on averting notice
  - Observations, not meant for record        SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                      The Supreme Court                                
	New Delhi, Nov. 17: The Union government is expected to focus tomorrow in the Supreme Court on staving off any notice to the Prime Minister on petitions that deal with the telecom controversy.        
	Sources associated with the government today shrugged off yesterdays questions by the court on why Manmohan Singh delayed a decision on a plea for sanction to prosecute A. Raja , stressing that were only observations and not part of the court records.         
	The observations were made in the context of seeking an explanation from the government on the alleged delay in deciding whether Raja, the former telecom minister, needed to be tried, the sources said.        
	The court has only asked for an explanation and we will explain everything, a source said. The government is likely to present a timeline to dispel the impression that it was slow in moving on the complaint of Subramanian Swamy, one of the petitioners and Janata Party president.        
	The question of permission to prosecute Raja has turned academic now as he is no longer a minister. However, when he was minister, he could not have been tried without the Prime Ministers permission, which Swamy had sought.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had replied to Swamys complaint on March 19, 2010, 16 months after the sanction was sought. The CBI had filed a case against unknown persons and companies on October 21, 2009.        
	The Prime Minister wrote back to Swamy that the CBI was dealing with the case and, therefore, his plea for sanction was premature.         
	Swamy had said in court yesterday that if the Prime Minister had decided either way  responded with a yes or a no  he could have moved court in appeal.         
	Under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA), an individual can complain against a Union minister and seek sanction for his prosecution from the Prime Minister, the competent authority to grant sanction in this case.         
	Thats what Swamy did. But with no reply forthcoming, he moved the high court for sanction. The Prime Minister replied subsequently to his letter. But after the high court rejected his plea for sanction, Swamy moved the Supreme Court in appeal.        
	Swamy, sought out by the RSS for advice on foreign policy issues and seen by critics as a political gadfly, is arguing the case himself.         
	Swamy is relying on a 1997 judgment that mandates a competent authority to decide on prosecution under the PCA within four months. Time limit of three months for grant of sanction for prosecution must be strictly adhered to, the court had then held in what was known as the Jain Hawala case.        
	Under the ruling, the Prime Minister could have taken one more month to consult the attorney general (AG) or any other law officer in the AGs office.        
	Government sources are hoping that once the reasons are explained, the court may be satisfied. The high court had earlier rejected Swamys plea because the CBI probe was going on.        
	In case the court finds the explanation unsatisfactory, arguments will first have to be heard from both sides on whether the petition was maintainable against the Prime Minister. Swamys petition has specifically named Dr Manmohan Singh in his capacity as the competent authority.        
	The sources said that the court could then delete the personal reference from the array of parties as a matter of propriety and issue notices to the office of the Prime Minister. In that case, the cabinet secretary will have to answer the notice.        
	No sitting Prime Minister has ever been issued a court notice, with the sole exception of P.V. Narasimha Rao who had to appear in a special court in the hawala case but after his term was over.

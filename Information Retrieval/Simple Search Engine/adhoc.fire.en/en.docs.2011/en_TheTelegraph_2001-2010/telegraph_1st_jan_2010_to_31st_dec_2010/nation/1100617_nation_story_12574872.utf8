The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chair on forgotten heroes
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Chair on forgotten heroes
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, June 16: India is setting up professorships in honour of 10 freedom fighters to study the lives and work of those who have not been popular subjects of post-Independence historical research.         
	The culture ministry will fund 10 research chairs at central universities under the plan first proposed by a government panel set up on the 150th anniversary of the 1857 revolt, top government officials told The Telegraph.         
	But universities and human resource development (HRD) ministry officials are sceptical about the move, arguing that the plan is not thought out well enough and may fail to serve its purpose.         
	Kapil Sibal has called a meeting on June 29 with representatives of the culture ministry currently under the Prime Minister, sources said.         
	The idea of focusing research efforts on freedom fighters largely ignored by post-Independence historians is great, but unless we have a deeper understanding of what kind of research we want, the move may not yield results, a source said.         
	The government has already identified at least five of the 10 freedom fighters after whom the chairs will be named, the sources said.         
	They include 1857 heroes  Tatya Tope and Kunwar Singh, Kartar Singh Sarabha of the Ghadar movement in the early 20th century and General Shah Nawaz Khan of the Indian National Army and Congressman Saifuddin Kitchlew.         
	The proposed research need not only be on the freedom fighters  after whom the chairs are named. But two major factors have played a role in determining who to name the chairs after, the sources associated with the process said.         
	The names of the chairs have to represent varied shades of the freedom movement and cover different periods of the struggle for freedom from the British, the sources said.         
	The chairs must also represent the philosophy behind the projects and so must be named after freedom fighters famous for their contribution but not the figureheads of their movements, they explained.         
	That is why we have chosen Kitchlew and not (Jawaharlal) Nehru, Khan and not (Subhas Chandra) Bose, the source said.

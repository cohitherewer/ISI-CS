The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lashkar raid amp; hijack alarm
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lashkar raid amp; hijack alarm
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: Intelligence agencies have warned of an aerial strike by the Lashkar-e-Toiba, the alert coinciding with a hijack alarm based on revelations made by an arrested Huji kingpin.        
	Lashkar has acquired around 50 paragliding equipment from Europe which the Pakistan-based outfit could use to carry out aerial raids, according to the input received by the home ministry.        
	The warning has fuelled concerns about an attack ahead of Republic Day, and while it is not clear how the Lashkar terrorists could glide in without being intercepted by the Indian Air Force, security agencies are not taking chances.        
	The shield around vital installations is being strengthened. Radars at strategic locations have been tuned to spot low-flying objects, sources said.        
	The hijack alert stems from the interrogation of Mohammed Amjad, alias Khaja. The south India chief of the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (Huji) chief, arrested by Hyderabad police on Monday, has told investigators that Islamic groups aligned to the al Qaida or the Lashkar plan to hijack Indian planes.        
	The target, sources suspect, could be flights of the government-owned Air India/Indian Airlines operating to or from any one of the Saarc countries. The sources said the hijack alert is not specific to January 26 and such an incident could happen anytime in the near future.        
	The warning has turned the spotlight on all flights operating from the region, with security agencies deciding to step up scanning and surveillance.        
	The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has issued an advisory to all airlines to conduct a mandatory 100 per cent secondary ladderpoint check  just before passengers board a flight  till January 31.        
	The directive applies to all aircraft flying to or from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.         
	We have intelligence inputs that there could be a hijack attempt of Indian planes, said a home ministry official.         
	Other security measures, including additional checks of baggage and travellers at airports, are being put in place. Sky marshals are also being deployed, the civil aviation ministry said.         
	The warning that terrorists could pick state-owned airlines assumes significance because of the December 1999 hijack of the Kathmandu-Delhi Indian Airlines plane to Kandahar in Afghanistan.         
	One passenger was stabbed to death by the hijackers before the Vajpayee government agreed to release four militants in exchange for the 167 fliers and crew.        
	The twin alerts come after US defence secretary Robert Gatess warning on Wednesday that Islamist militant groups in south Asia could trigger a war between Pakistan and India through what he called a provocative act.

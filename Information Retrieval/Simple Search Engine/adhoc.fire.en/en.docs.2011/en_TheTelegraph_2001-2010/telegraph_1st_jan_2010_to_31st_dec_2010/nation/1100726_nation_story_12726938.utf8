          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Nitish Kumar                           
	New Delhi, July 25: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has accused the Centre of encroaching on the autonomy of states in financial matters.         
	Speaking at the 55th meeting of the National Development Council (NDC) yesterday, he demanded a change in the pattern of five-year plans so that states have a greater say in implementing development schemes.         
	He said the quest for inclusive growth would remain a dream unless some of the urgent issues pertaining to resource allocation and determining the overall financing pattern are reconsidered.         
	Nitish stressed the need to devise a different approach to address centre-state relations. There is a growing tendency on the part of the central government to start many ambitious populist schemes for which they wish to take credit at the expense of states by lowering the allocation to the sector, he said. This represents an increased encroachment on the autonomy of states.        
	He alleged that many schemes for states were often announced without meaningful prior consultation. Earlier discussions in the NDC favoured a reduction in both the number and the allocation for centrally sponsored schemes. Far from this, we now see a reverse tendency to the central sector to expand these schemes in multiple ways including through legislation, he said.

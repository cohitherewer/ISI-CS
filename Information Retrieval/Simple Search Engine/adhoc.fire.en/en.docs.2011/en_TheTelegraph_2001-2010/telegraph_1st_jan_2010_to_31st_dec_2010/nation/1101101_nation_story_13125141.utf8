The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Everybody has a finger in high-rise pie
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Everybody has a finger in high-rise pie
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                          Sonia Gandhi pays tribute on Indira Gandhis death anniversary at Shakti Sthal in New Delhi on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 31: Varsha, the chief ministers residence in Mumbai, was deserted today and at the Congress party office, there were few who stood up for Ashok Chavan who is in trouble over the Adarsh society scandal.        
	More politicians have got sucked into the scandal, prompting former chief ministers such as Vilasrao Deshmukh, Sushil Kumar Shinde and Narayan Rane and Sharad Pawars nephew Ajit Pawar to issue furious denials or disclaimers.        
	In Delhi, the Congress crisis-managers gave a glimpse of the dilemma before the party by saying more time was needed to decide Chavans fate.        
	A.K. Antony personally called all top party leaders of the state today and except for one, everybody has given a negative report on the chief ministers functioning. He has upset many by flaunting his closeness to Rahul Gandhi. But the fact is that it is more a claim than reality, a Congress leader in Mumbai said.        
	Antony and Pranab Mukherjee have been asked by party president Sonia Gandhi to look into the Adarsh society controversy before a decision on whether or not to sack Chavan is taken. The two ministers met tonight but said more time was needed.        
	Leaders of the ruling coalition in the state are pointing fingers at each other over the scam. Chavan has blamed his predecessor Vilasrao Deshmukh, party sources said, arguing that he was only the revenue minister when Adarsh society came up and had followed chief minister Deshmukhs orders on the matter.        
	Deshmukhs friends in the party were unhappy when he was replaced with Chavan after 26/11 and were keen to have him shown the door, the sources said.        
	Chavan is now trying to get back at Vilasrao by revealing details of the alleged benami properties of the former chief minister and some other top Congress leaders of the state. He submitted a list of all these properties to the party top brass on Saturday, the Congress source said.        
	Deshmukh, on the other hand, is blaming Chavan. The former chief minister said he did approve the letter of intent of 20 people who wanted to become members of the society, but did so on the recommendation of Chavan who was the revenue minister. The list had come for my approval only for counter signature and you do it in good faith, he said.        
	The former chief minister also denied the allegation that he recommended the allotment of three flats in the Colaba high-rise. I had not recommended anybodys case. There is nobody in the society who can claim to be my relative or near and dear one.... This appears to be a conspiracy to defame me, he said.        
	Eight Maharashtra Congress-NCP leaders have been accused of having benefited from the Adarsh scandal. A BJP delegation will meet the governor tomorrow to seek the dismissal of the Chavan government.        
	Shinde, as the then chief minister, gave final approval to the society in 2004 and is alleged to have recommended one allottee. He today said only the media was making a hue and cry and nothing much was happening in Delhi on the Adarsh front.        
	NCP boss Sharad Pawars nephew Ajit Pawar, who is now the water resources minister, rejected allegations that he had recommended two relatives. Show me even one person who is either a relative or someone I know who is a member of the society, he said. I have not recommended anyones name for membership.        
	Rane, who gave initial permission to the society as Shiv Sena chief minister in 1999 and has been accused of recommending two flats as Congress revenue minister in the Deshmukh government, also denied the allegation as an attempt to defame him.        
	Shivaji Rao Nilangekar, who cleared the final allotments as revenue minister in 2004, former forest minister Patangrao Kadam and home minister R.R. Patil are alleged to have recommended allotments. Sources close to Chavan, who has been accused of recommending five allotments, said that with skeletons tumbling out of every top leaders closet, the chief minister was hoping to survive.

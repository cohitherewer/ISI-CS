          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Dec. 27: Some Lashkar-e-Toiba top guns recently attacked the security forces in Kashmir  not with bullets but with stones. So say the police.        
	Lashkar commanders including the Valleys most wanted militant, Abdullah Ooni, and Qalimullah participated in stone-throwing during the recent pro-azaadi agitation, the north Kashmir police chief said today.        
	Muneer Ahmad Khan, deputy inspector-general (DIG) of police, north Kashmir range, added that the imam of a Sopore mosque, too, had been held for stone-throwing.        
	A stone-thrower, Firdous Ahmad Sheikh alias Birbal,who is involved in 10 cases, gave a detailed account of the nexus between stone-throwers and Lashkar during his interrogation, Khan told reporters at Sopore.        
	Surprisingly, militants like Qalimullah and Abdullah Ooni not only sponsored the agitation but physically participated in the stone-throwing.        
	Ooni became Lashkars Kashmir chief a few years ago, replacing a Pakistani commander, Furqan. He has been evading arrest for years.        
	During questioning, Firdous also revealed that a nexus existed among the Hurriyat hawks led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani, some government employees and the stone-throwers, Khan said.        
	Numerous arrests have been made based on his revelations. On the basis of confessions from some stone-throwers that they were planning a suicide attack on the security forces and police, a cache of arms and ammunition was seized from the home of a local man, Mohammad Amin Dar, he said.        
	The north Kashmir DIG said a stone-thrower arrested recently, Abdul Lateef Lone, had turned out to be the imam of Jamia Masjid Amargarh in Sopore.        
	During questioning, he revealed that Rs 400 is being paid to the stone-throwers leaders on Fridays, Khan said.        
	Lone was detained under the Public Safety Act. He has told us that the Hurriyat cadres raise the money locally. The biggest chunk of this money comes from the fruit mandi (market) and saw mills.        
	Last month, Kashmir police chief S.M. Sahai had said his force had arrested about 60 government employees, including a special police officer (SPO), for stone-throwing since the agitation began on June 11. Another 75, including some officer-level employees, were under the scanner.        
	Khan said some women overground workers, or OGWs, were supporting the militants in Sopore.        
	There are 20 active OGWs in north Kashmir. A dreaded woman OGW, Raja Begum, whose house was used as a hideout by militants during an encounter in which an army officer was killed, has recently been arrested. Another is absconding, he said.        
	Khan said 26 militants, including five local Kashmiris, had been killed and a huge cache of weapons and ammunition was recovered this year in Sopore. About a dozen have been arrested.        
	Sopore has re-emerged as the militant capital of Kashmir, and dozens of insurgents are believed to be active there.

	New Delhi, Sept. 17: The Centre wants the all-party MP delegation going to Jammu and Kashmir next week to meet a cross-section of people and will send written invitations to separatists, including Hurriyat leaders.        
	Senior home ministry officials said the 39-member team, expected to be headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, would hold an open house during their two-day trip on September 20 and 21. Politicians, traders and even shikara (boat operators on Srinagars Dal Lake) associations will be welcome.        
	Although everyone is free to meet the MPs, letters are being sent to separatist leaders requesting them to hold discussions with the team, which will visit both Jammu and Srinagar. Home minister P. Chidambaram will be part of the delegation. It is likely to return on Wednesday and give its feedback on the situation.        
	A cabinet committee on security meeting is expected later next week to chart the Centres future course of action on Kashmir.        
	Central ministers A.K. Antony, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Pawan Bansal are also expected to be in the delegation, as is Kashmir Congress leader Saifuddin Soz. The BJP will be represented by Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley.         
	Other possible names include Mulayam Singh Yadav (SP), T.R. Baalu (DMK), Basudeb Acharya (CPM) and Gurudas Dasgupta (CPI).

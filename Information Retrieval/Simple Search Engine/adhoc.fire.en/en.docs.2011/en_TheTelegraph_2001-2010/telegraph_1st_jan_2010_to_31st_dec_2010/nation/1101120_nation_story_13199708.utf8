          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Prithviraj Chavan                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 19: Prithviraj Chavan today kept the controversial urban development and housing ministry with himself as he expanded the Maharashtra cabinet to include 29 more ministers.        
	In a move to reassure the Opposition and blunt its attack on his eight-day government, the chief minister also stripped Narayan Rane of the revenue portfolio and handed it to Balasaheb Thorat, a Vilasrao Deshmukh supporter and former agriculture minister who has a clean reputation.        
	Prithviraj, however, did not give in to the Shiv Sena demand to drop Rane from the new cabinet. Rane was appointed industries and ports minister, a portfolio he has held in the Vilasrao Deshmukh cabinet.        
	The move partly pleased the Sena, which has been running an aggressive campaign against Rane following the Adarsh housing society scam and has met governor K. Sankarnarayanan to seek his ouster from the cabinet.        
	Sena spokesperson Neelam Gorhe said: We are disappointed Rane has not been dropped from the ministry but we are happy he is no longer revenue minister. It indicates that Chavan has taken note of our campaign. He should not just stop at this. We expect him to review all controversial decisions taken by Rane related to transfer of land.        
	Chosen to succeed Ashok Chavan who quit over the Adarsh scam, Prithviraj kept urban development, housing, housing repairs and reconstruction apart from general administration. He was sworn in chief minister on November 11 along with 10 NCP ministers in the first phase.        
	Nineteen more cabinet ministers and 10 ministers of state were sworn in today to take the cabinet strength to 40.         
	The Congress can include three more ministers in the 43-member Maharashtra cabinet, divided in a 23:20 ratio between the Congress and the NCP.        
	Chavan chose to exclude big names and give less known but younger faces in the party a chance. Rajendra Shekhawat, Amit Deshmukh and Praniti Shinde, respectively the children of Congress heavyweights Pratibha Patil, Vilasrao Deshmukh and Sushil Kumar Shinde, did not find a mention.        
	Instead, less known faces like Rajendra Mulak (Nagpur), Rajendra Gavit (Palghar) and D.P. Sawant (Nanded) were brought in. So was Tripura governor D.Y. Patils 39-year-old son Satej Patil, the NCP legislator from Kolhapur. Patil was appointed the junior home minister.        
	Chhagan Bhujbal, who was replaced as deputy chief minister by Ajit Pawar, was given the tourism portfolio in addition to public works. But he was denied the funds-rich Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation.        
	Pawar has the energy, finance and planning portfolios. Water resources portfolio has gone to his aide Sunil Tatkare. R.R. Patil has been retained as home minister.              
	Others given key portfolios include Patangrao Kadam (forests, rescue and rehabilitation), Jayant Patil (rural development), Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil (agriculture and marketing), Ganesh Naik (state excise), Harshawardhan Patil (parliamentary affairs), Rajendra Darda (school education), Rajesh Tope (higher and technical education) and Suresh Shetty (public health).        
	Only two women figure in the new cabinet: Congress leader Eknath Gaikwads daughter Varsha Gaikwad, who has been given women and child development, and Sharad Pawar protg Faujiya Khan, who is the minister of state for general administration.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Terror spike link to troops pullout
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Terror spike link to troops pullout
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Omar Abdullah                                  
	Sringar, April 2: Jammu and Kashmir police have prepared a confidential report blaming the resurgence of militancy in Sopore on a troops relocation, ordered in the face of popular demand and political pressure.        
	Sopore has now emerged as the born-again capital of militancy in Kashmir, witnessing several deadly attacks on security forces and prompting the state government to create a new police district in the area in January.        
	The police report, a copy of which is with The Telegraph, blames Sopores historically proven anti-establishment ideology and a couple of administrative decisions of relocating armed forces camps as two key reasons for the resurgence of militancy.        
	The Omar Abdullah government had claimed victory last year after getting a 22 Rashtriya Rifles camp relocated from Bomai in Sopore to the premises of a college several kilometres away. The move had followed massive protests against the alleged killing of two civilians by the troopers. Two CRPF companies too were relocated later from the Ningli and Hathishah bridges in the area.        
	The decision of relocating (the) Bomai camp seems strategically incorrect. (It) has created a void and vacuum in the area with militants having (direct) access (to Sopore) from Kandi Kupwara (a border district in north Kashmir) via Zaloora bowl, the police report says.        
	On the relocation of the CRPF camps, the report says it has allowed the militants as well as the stone-throwers to travel unhindered to the town centre. The report reaffirms that the militants are becoming tech-savvy, making it difficult for the security forces to track them.        
	They have switched over to different methods of communication, including voice overlapped Internet protocol e.g. Skype, which is difficult to track. Spoofing of satellite phones (used by the militants) does not give proper co-ordinates, thereby protracting the process of zeroing in on their location, the report says.        
	Police sources say that more than 50 militants are now active in Sopore. You have around 35 active militants in the Zainageer belt and 20 others in the Rafiabad belt of Sopore police district. Plus, around 10 more militants are in a state of flux, a source said.        
	Top militant leaders, including the Lashkar-e-Toibas Abdullah Uni, Harkat-ul Mujahideen commander Nouman and Hizb-ul Mujahideen commander Basharat Saleem, are believed to be operating from Sopore.        
	More than 20 security personnel and 15 rebels have been killed in this area in the past six months, with around a dozen militant attacks taking place this year alone.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, Nov. 9: A cab driver who kidnapped and pushed a schoolgirl and her little brother into a Coimbatore canal last month was shot dead by police today when he tried to flee from custody.        
	Mohan Raj, 33, was being driven to the crime spot, 50km from Chennai, to re-create the killing when he snatched sub-inspector Jothis revolver and demanded to be taken to Kerala. Told by the police team that nothing of the kind would be done, he fired twice inside the van, injuring Jothi and another SI, Muthumalai.        
	In retaliation, inspector Annadurai fired three rounds, killing Mohan on the spot.        
	On October 29 morning, Mohan had kidnapped Muskaan, 10, and Ritish, 7, posing as a stand-in car pool driver. Instead of dropping them to Suguna Rip Matriculation School, he drove them to a lonely spot, allegedly raped Muskaan along with an accomplice Manoharan, and then pushed the children into the canal.        
	Mohan and Manoharan, arrested within a day of the killings and lodged in Coimbatore jail, were being taken in separate vans to the crime spot around 5.30am when the firing took place at Pothanur, 20km from Coimbatore.        
	Our officers acted in self-defence, said C. Sylendra Babu, the Coimbatore police commissioner. While SI Jothi suffered a muscular injury in his right arm, SI Muthumalai was admitted in a serious condition with a bullet in his stomach.        
	Muthumalai underwent an emergency surgery at Kovai Medical College Hospital and is out of danger.        
	The killings of the schoolchildren had provoked anger and outrage among the people, with some calling for their execution. Even inside the jail, they had to be lodged in a separate cell because some prisoners were furious at their crime.        
	The police had decided to fast-track investigations and file a chargesheet in 30 days.         
	Some human rights activists hinted the incident may have been staged as the police were under pressure to send a strong signal against kidnappings. A Chennai schoolboy had been abducted  and freed  three days after this incident.        
	What was the need to take them so early in the morning for investigation if not for a planned encounter killing? asked human rights activist and lawyer N. Prabhukumar.        
	The police said the visit had been scheduled for the morning to shield the duo from any public attack as they had almost been assaulted when they were produced in court a week ago.

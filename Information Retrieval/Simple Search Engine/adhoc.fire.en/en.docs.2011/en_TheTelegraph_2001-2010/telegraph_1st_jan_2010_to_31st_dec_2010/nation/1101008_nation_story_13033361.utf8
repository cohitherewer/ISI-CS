          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: Planes with noisy engines will no longer be allowed to take off or land at night at Delhis Indira Gandhi International Airport, bringing relief to residents living nearby.         
	No aircraft operator shall operate Chapter 2 aircraft to/from IGI airport under any circumstances between 2200 hours and 0600 hours with effect from October 31, 2010, an aviation environment circular issued by the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation said.         
	The circular was issued on a Delhi High Court directive following complaints about the noise by JNU students and residents bodies in areas near the airport.         
	The rule is in line with the environment-friendly regulations of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which define Chapter 2 aircraft as those mostly powered by noisy turbojet engines. Most of these aircraft were manufactured during the late 1970s.         
	The difference between a Chapter 2 and a Chapter 4 aircraft, being produced now, is similar to that between a car of the pre-pollution-control era and a Stage-III car whose engines emit much less noise and smoke. The new-generation aircraft are about 75 per cent quieter than those built 40 years ago.         
	Issued last month, the circular said that because of the absence of a dedicated airport zone and improper land planning in the vicinity of airports in India, communities residing in these areas are facing day-to-day problems because of the large volume of aircraft operations.         
	For people living near airports, the cumulative impact of a large number of flights is the problem, rather than just the noise generated by individual aircraft. Periods of respite are rapidly disappearing and the noise is becoming more frequent in the evenings and nights, the residents feel.        
	The airline regulatory body said IGI airport would adopt mix mode operation from three runways to distribute the concentration of noise over a large area.         
	The new DGCA rule also says that no aircraft operator should indulge in any activity related to aircraft operation that exceeds or intends to exceed the maximum permissible noise limits at IGI airport ... during any part of the day.         
	An aircraft operator would be allowed to fly a Chapter 2 plane at night only under exceptional circumstances and that too after taking prior permission from the regulator, the circular added.        
	Pending notification of permissible noise levels at airports by the Central Pollution Control Board, the DGCA has fixed the limits in airport zones at 105 decibels during day and 95 decibels at night.         
	These limits are lower than those at most major international airports, including New Yorks JFK (99 decibels), Rio de Janeiro (118.4), Paris (104.5) and Osaka (107). Three airports in London have 94 decibels as the limit. Some other major airports, like Chicago, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Melbourne, have no noise limit.         
	October 31, when the new rule takes effect, is when the winter schedule of flights begins.

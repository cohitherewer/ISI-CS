The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Time for pranams, not calculations
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Time for pranams, not calculations
          SUVRO ROY                       Advani pays homage to Jyoti Basu at the Assembly.   Picture by Amit Datta                          
	Calcutta, Jan. 19: Lal Krishna Advanis first question to party colleagues after landing at Calcutta airport today was how would Jyoti Basus death impact Bengal.        
	The answer came quick. The party (CPM) is trying to capitalise on Jyoti Basus death, said state BJP chief Rahul Sinha, but it will not yield any political result.        
	The former deputy Prime Minister, whose party-led regime at the Centre Basu had once described as a government of barbarians, did not comment.         
	Advani walked towards the VIP exit of the airport. As a handful of waiting reporters moved in, their microphones and notepads ready, the 82-year-old BJP leader paused. Jyoti Basu was a leader of the masses and his death is a loss to his party, common people and the country as a whole, he told them.        
	When a reporter asked if Basus death would give the Opposition any advantage, Advani folded his hands before replying: This is not the time to calculate gains and losses. But the absence of Jyoti Basu will definitely be a loss to the party.        
	With Advani were BJP national president Nitin Gadkari and Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav.        
	Advanis motorcade, forced to slow down as it neared the Assembly where Basus body lay in state, reached the House around 1.30pm.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim and finance minister Asim Dasgupta received Advani and escorted him to where the late communist leader lay draped in a Tricolour. Gadkari, Yadav and Sinha followed.        
	He placed a wreath and stood beside Basus body, head bowed, for a minute before leaving. The chairman of the BJP parliamentary party looked lost in thought as he moved towards the exit and didnt seem to have noticed Bhattacharjee approaching him.        
	Will you please come to my chamber?  Sheikh Hasina is there, the chief minister asked him.        
	As Bhattacharjee escorted Advani to his chamber, the Bangladesh Prime Minister emerged. She smiled when she saw the BJP leader.        
	The two dignitaries exchanged pleasantries before Hasina left, asking the chief minister to take Advani to his room.        
	When Advani entered Basus chamber, he was greeted by CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury and Left Front chairman Biman Bose.        
	Advani smiled at Basus son Chandan, daughter-in- law Rakhi and grandson Subhojyoti, who were also in the room.        
	I know Advaniji since 1977 when I was information and cultural affairs minister, Bhattacharjee told state BJP chief Sinha as an Assembly staff served tea, biscuits and cashew nuts.        
	Advani finished his tea in silence. None of the leaders touched either the biscuits or the cashew nuts. After about 10 minutes, Advani stood up to leave.        
	As Bhattacharjee escorted the BJP leader to his car, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat walked up to Advani and requested him to write something in the condolence book kept in the lobby.        
	Advani turned and walked back a few steps to the lobby.         
	If the passing away of an individual leader can very correctly be described as the end of an era, it is the demise of Shri Jyoti Basu. A great stalwart of the Marxist movement has passed away. I offer my respectful homage to him, to all his party colleagues, to his son and other family members. My pranams, he wrote in the condolence book.                    INPUTS FROM SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

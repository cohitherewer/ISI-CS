	New Delhi, Sept. 6: The turf and the track at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the showpiece venue of the Commonwealth Games, have sunk unevenly at many places, according to the minutes of a meeting of a group of ministers (GoM) tasked to monitor preparations.        
	The minutes have recorded several other disclosures that not only raise questions about how such a stadium could host an international event but also suggest that the primary objective now is to somehow get the event over with.        
	The revelations also indicate that the ambition of pulling off a grand opening ceremony has been scaled down drastically to assessing the feasibility of staging a show at all.        
	The October 3 opening ceremony appears headed for disaster if the Delhi rains dont let up, the GoM has noted.        
	It isnt just segments of the opening ceremony that may have to be cancelled or curtailed. The much-touted blimp, Aerostat, that is scheduled to hover atop the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium and beam live pictures of the cultural show may be a non-starter.        
	The GoM has expressed strong displeasure at the delay in preparations by opening-ceremony producers Wizcraft and music composer A.R. Rahman. It has asked the organisers to have an alternative plan ready in case the weather does not improve.        
	At a meeting on September 1, the GoM headed by S. Jaipal Reddy was told that excessive rainfall had turned the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies as well as track and field events, into a slush field. The minutes reveal the turf and the track have sunk unevenly.                  AR Rahman      
	The first full dress rehearsal at the stadium, scheduled for September 1, has now been put off till September 25, leaving only a week of practice before the opening ceremony.        
	According to the minutes, Vikram Sarkari of Wizcraft said: Because of excessive rains during the last few weeks, the turf and the track have sunk unevenly at many places and these have caused major delay in the show production. The rehearsal at the venue was scheduled to start on September 1 but because of the rain it has got delayed.        
	To repair the turf, the CPWD has rolled 600 tonnes of sand on it. But if the rains continue, the schedule would get further affected, Sarkari said.        
	The GoM was told that in case of heavy rain, the sand may sink and, in that case, it would not be possible to put the stage in place as it is of 450 tonnes. In such a situation, it would not be possible to put any flying scenic (Aerostat).        
	Sarkari also said the sequencing of the show may also have to be changed as per the logistic feasibility.        
	The insistence now will be on the feasibility of the show and not on the grandeur, the GoM minutes said.        
	Cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekhar suggested at the meeting that they (organisers) should have an alternative plan if any problem is encountered in the functioning of the Aerostat.        
	Chairman GoM (Reddy) also emphasised the need for an alternative plan. It was decided that in case India Meteorological Department informs about bad weather on October 1, this plan should be made operational.        
	The producers apprised the GoM of the details of the music for the opening ceremony. Rehearsals are under way for the Rhythm of India and Swagatam segments as Rahman has provided the scratch music.        
	The GoM, however, expressed strong displeasure at Rahman and Wizcraft. As far as Tree of Knowledge segment is concerned, the six gurus (classical dancers) are not happy with the music development by Mr Rahman and wanted it to be changed, the minutes said.        
	Sonal Mansingh, one of the six gurus, informed the GoM that right up to August they did not get anything and hence they started producing their own scratch music. Mr Bharat Bala agreed with Mrs Sonal Mansingh that the music for this segment would be as per the suggestion of the six classical gurus.        
	The GoM minutes say that the segments titled Great Indian Journey and Mahatma, the initial tracks by Rahman, were not liked. The composer is now developing a new track. For the Celebrations segment, the music track is yet to be developed.        
	The GoM expressed its strong displeasure on the delay that is taking place in different aspects of show production. It clearly suggested that if anybody is not performing their responsibilities in the given time period, he should be replaced, the minutes said.

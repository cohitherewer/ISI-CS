          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 9: The CPM today criticised Mamata Banerjee for the Trinamul Congresss decision to abstain from voting on the womens reservation bill in the Rajya Sabha.         
	Biman Bose, the state CPM secretary, said: It is unfortunate that the Trinamul chief, herself a woman, opposed the historic bill. The Left parties have been asking for the passage of the bill for a long time.         
	CPM leaders were, however, ambiguous on sub-quotas for Muslim and OBC women, a demand made by the RJD and the Samajwadi Party. Mamata, too, indicated that she favoured quotas for Muslim and OBCs  with an eye on Muslim votes in Bengal  though party MPs said they were not against the bill but opposed to the way in which it was passed in the House.         
	Asked about the sub-quotas, Bose said: There is no question of opposing the demand (for sub-quotas). But the Constitution has the provision for Scheduled Castes and Tribes, not for others. Thats why I am not commenting on those demands.         
	Beyond this, Bose declined to elaborate and left the news conference quickly.         
	The Bengal government had recently announced 10 per cent reservation for OBC Muslims on the grounds of economic and educational backwardness.         
	The CPMs Bengal unit seems to have decided to downsize its contingent to the Left rally in Delhi on March 12 to protest price rise, unemployment and the anti-people Union budget. It had been decided earlier that about 5,000 activists and leaders, including Bose, would go. But Bose said fewer people would participate from Bengal and there would be no massive public meeting. A procession will walk from Ramlila Maidan to Parliament Street and a small protest meeting will be held there, he said.

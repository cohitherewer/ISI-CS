	Rajabandh, May 28: Four rescuers enter the tilted S4 coach of the Jnaneswari Express and bring out a young man in a blood-soaked T-shirt and trousers.        
	They put him on a stretcher and rush him towards a doctor who is standing in a paddy field off the tracks in the blazing sun. He gives the patient on the stretcher a quick once-over and feels for his pulse.        
	He is dead, the doctor says stoically.        
	The four men, who had been waiting for the verdict, remove the body from the stretcher, cover it in a white sheet and run back towards the same coach in search of another passenger  or body  trapped in the train.        
	I wish the next passenger I bring to the doctor is alive, murmurs a young rescuer, a South Eastern Railway employee, in a light-blue T-shirt and navy blue trousers.        
	His wish comes true. The doctor puts the next passenger, a young woman, on a drip and finds space for her in the air force helicopter that is ready to leave for Midnapore Medical College and Hospital, carrying those in need of immediate medical attention.        
	We are trying our best to save these people but the job is difficult, the doctor says.        
	Over 1,200 trained rescuers from various agencies, 100 and odd doctors and more than 200 paramedics were deployed to rescue and save the passengers but the tragedy again highlighted the holes in the railways disaster management system.        
	Railway sources admitted that although the incident took place around 1.25am, the rescue operation started only at 4am when a team of civil defence personnel and CRPF jawans arrived and a generator was set up.        
	The gas cutters arrived even later. The rescue operation continued through the pre-dawn darkness as more bodies tumbled out of S4 and S5.        
	I was in coach S6 and could jump out to safety, but those who could not were groaning and asking for help. But there was no help for over two-and-a-half hours, said Saiful Seikh, a 33-year-old Mumbai-bound passenger.        
	We saw some uniformed people after some time, but there were not enough of them and they were miserably ill-equipped.        
	Some railway officials claimed that full-fledged rescue work had begun around 3am, but the passengers said it started only after halogen lights lit up the area around 4am.        
	We were stretched for resources in the initial hours. We did not have enough gas cutters to cut through the steel and extricate the passengers. The rescue work gained momentum only after more agencies joined the operation, a railway official said.        
	He said the bogies had to be cut through carefully as there was always a possibility of a bogie catching fire or a passenger trapped inside getting hurt.        
	As the bogies were tilted, it was difficult to stand properly inside them. So we could not rush the job, the official said.         
	As the day wore on, more help arrived in the form of a rescue train from Kharagpur, a contingent of the BSFs National Disaster Resistance Force (NDRF), and personnel from the state governments disaster management group. But although men and machines had arrived, the rescue operation lacked co-ordination.         
	The lack of planning was reflected in the delay in the use of cranes to separate the bogies of the passenger train from the engine of the goods train and to lift the bogies.         
	Two cranes with 480-tonne load-bearing capacity were brought from Kharagpur and Chakradharpur in the morning but they were used only after 4.30pm, an NDRF official said.         
	Without the bogies being crane-lifted, it was difficult to remove those bodies that appeared to be pasted inside.        
	Railway officials blamed the district police for the delay in the use of cranes.        
	Once state finance minister Asim Dasgupta held a meeting on the spot to co-ordinate among the agencies and assigned one bogie to each, the pace of rescue picked up.        
	Three air force helicopters  two MI-17s and an advanced light helicopter, Dhruv  brought in doctors and technicians and flew the injured to hospital.

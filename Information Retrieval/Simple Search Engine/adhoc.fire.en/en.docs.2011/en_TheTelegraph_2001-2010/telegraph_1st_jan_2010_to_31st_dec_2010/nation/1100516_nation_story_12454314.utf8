          SANTOSH K. KIRO                          BIT, Mesra to collaborate with US college                                  
	Ranchi, May 15: In order to systematically harness solar energy, students of BIT, Mesra, along with students of Harvey Mudd College, California have undertaken a joint project to develop a solar energy storage system.         
	The students team will develop a mechanical system for harnessing and storing solar energy so that this energy can be preserved for long and used when required.         
	A team of three students from Harvey Mudd College  Andrew Xue, Hufasa Ahmed and Jennifer Lee, accompanied by a professor, Gordon Pickett, will arrive in BIT, Mesra, tomorrow. Joined by three final year students of BIT Mesra  Siddharth Menon, Siddharth Murarka and Abhishek Sadany, the students team will begin their work here from May 17. The project has been assigned a time period of a year. The team, guided by two teachers of BIT, Mesra, Arvind Kumar and Anil Kishen, would discuss the topic and other aspects of the research in detail for two weeks before it proceeds to California for further exploration. In California, the joint team will work on the project for two months, before the BIT team comes back and continues with the project here for rest of the time span.         
	Today, energy crisis is a global phenomenon. Through this project the team of students will try to address this crisis, which will be useful to the society from the point of view of clean energy, said Arvind Kumar, an associate professor of mechanical engineering department of BIT, Mesra.         
	The project is being undertaken under the Global Clinic Programme of Harvey Mudd College, which facilitates such research works for undergraduate students, thus providing them with an opportunity to work on real life engineering issues that is both relevant and important for the society. The clinic programme is so named because it provides real life experiences to engineering students, in a manner similar to the clinical experience provided to medical students.         
	This apart, it is also aimed at developing in the students the perspective and skills required to function effectively in a global context.        
	The conventional energy is aiding pollution and adding to global warming. Also it is non-renewable energy, which is pushing the scientist confraternity to look for sustainable methods of harnessing renewable energy. The project of the BIT, Mesra, and Harvey Mudd College is thus being looked upon as an effort in this direction.         
	After the completion of the project, the students team will present their work before the experts in BIT, Mesra, sometime in May next year, said K G Pande, co-ordinator of the project at BIT, Mesra.

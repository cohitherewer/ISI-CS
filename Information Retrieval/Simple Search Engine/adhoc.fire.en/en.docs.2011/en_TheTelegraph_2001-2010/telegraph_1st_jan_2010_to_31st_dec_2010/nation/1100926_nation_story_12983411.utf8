	Similarly, Sannata is a character out of a Bollywood film. The youth would surface near a police station during evenings and hurl abuses at cops. We laid a trap and arrested him. It turned out that he was a Bihari boy whose mother had later married a Kashmiri.        
	Many of the pseudonyms were earned through some act of bravado during stone-throwing, the sangbaaz say.        
	My friends think that my stones are as destructive as poison, said a youth. Now some call me by this name (Poison) and I dont mind.        
	Stone-throwing is not new to Kashmir but had earlier remained confined to Srinagars old city and towns like Sopore and Baramulla. It became a mass movement during the 2008 Amarnath land agitation.        
	For the security forces, battling the third successive summer of anti-India protests, these stone throwers are sometimes a bigger catch than militants. The police on Thursday arrested one of the most wanted stone throwers, Asif, nicknamed Hartal because of his ability to enforce shutdowns.        
	Its all very different from the late 1980s, when militancy erupted in Kashmir. A new jihadi lexicon had then taken root in the Valley, although the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), the first militant group, professed a secular ideology.        
	The mujahids from jihadi groups such as the Hizbul Mujahideen, Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen outnumbered the militants from the JKLF and other secular groups.         
	Many of the jihadis picked up catchy pseudonyms. Hizb chief Mohammad Yousuf Shah is known by his alias Syed Salahuddin, adopted from the name of legendary Muslim commander Salahuddin Ayuubi.        
	Today, the militants strength has shrunk to less than 500 but the stone throwers are believed to number in thousands.        
	The police say they are yet to come across any organisation floated by the stone throwers on the ground, although several such groups have sprouted on social networking sites.        
	They have names such as Kashur Hathiyar  Kani Jung (Kashmir weapon  stone-throwing), I am a Kashmiri Stone Pelter and the Stone Throwers Association of Kashmir.        
	As these names suggest, there is hardly anything Islamic about them.

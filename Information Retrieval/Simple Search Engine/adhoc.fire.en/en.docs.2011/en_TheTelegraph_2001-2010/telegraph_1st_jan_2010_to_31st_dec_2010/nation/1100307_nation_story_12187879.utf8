          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 6: The Union finance ministry today denied reports that India had succumbed to Chinese pressure on Arunachal Pradesh at a World Bank meeting.         
	A statement from the finance ministry claimed that India has made no commitment to anyone, including the World Bank, that it will not pose projects pertaining to Arunachal Pradesh for funding from any multilateral development bank. The statement said: It has been our clear and consistent position that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India.         
	The clarification came after news reports cited a purported World Bank document where external affairs minister S.M. Krishna was quoted as stating that India will not pose any Arunachal Pradesh-specific project to the bank, and which said the Chinese representative at the bank was pressing for the operationalisation of Krishnas statement.

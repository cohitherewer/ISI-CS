The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gujjar talks   fail
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Gujjar talks   fail
                                  
	Bayana, Dec. 26 (PTI): Talks between Gujjars, who want a five per cent job quota, and the Rajasthan government today failed to yield any result and the communitys protesters continued to block rail tracks and roads.        
	State energy minister Jitendra Singh, an emissary of the Congress-led Ashok Gehlot government, said the state was ready to set up a committee with their leader Kirori Singh Bainsla as one of its members to resolve the standoff.        
	But Bainsla rejected the offer. I want a permanent solution to this because I do not want to leave things half way, he said, threatening to intensify the protest if the demand was not met within a week.        
	On December 22, Rajasthan High Court rejected the Gujjars quota demand, saying the state had not been able to establish how the community is eligible for the special quota. It has allowed the state government a years time to collect data to establish the backwardness of Gujjars in education and employment.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      NRI voting rights
                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 24 (PTI): The Centre has issued a notification to enable a select group of NRIs to vote, months after an amendment bill permitting such rights was passed during the monsoon session of Parliament.        
	The move will benefit NRIs who have not acquired citizenship of any other country and are living abroad owing to employment, education or otherwise, overseas Indian affairs minister Vayalar Ravi told the Lok Sabha today.        
	These NRIs are now eligible to register their names in the electoral rolls in the places of residence mentioned in their passports. However, they will be able to exercise the franchise only if they are present in their constituencies on polling day.         
	The Election Commission is likely to finalise soon the rules for entry of such NRIs names in electoral rolls, Ravi said. So far, their names were deleted from the lists if they stayed outside the country for more than six months at a stretch. The change will now allow them to register even if they are away for longer periods.

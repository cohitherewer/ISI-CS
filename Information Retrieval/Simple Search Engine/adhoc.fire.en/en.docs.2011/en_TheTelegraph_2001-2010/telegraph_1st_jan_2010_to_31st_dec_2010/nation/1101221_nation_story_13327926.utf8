                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Raj sips with BJP, Sena   sees red
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                                                    Bal Thackeray (top) and Raj      
	Mumbai, Dec. 20: Raj Thackeray today dropped in for a cup of tea at the state BJP office, but that was enough for BJP ally Shiv Sena to threaten a boycott of the December 22 NDA rally.        
	Raj had just finished addressing a meeting of his Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) at the LIC building in Nariman Point, located bang opposite the BJP office, when he decided to walk across the street. His meeting with state BJP chief Sudhir Mungantiwar and general secretary Vinod Tawade lasted about 20 minutes.        
	Mungantiwar said nothing was brewing between the BJP and the MNS  it was just that Raj was in the vicinity and he had decided to invite him for a cup of tea out of courtesy.        
	This doesnt mean new political equations are in the offing. It was not a political meet. He dropped in... as a guest and we just had tea.        
	Political circles, though, are abuzz because civic polls are due in Mumbai in early 2012, and the MNS is eyeing big gains. The civic body is now ruled by the Sena-BJP.        
	Sena sources said Bal Thackeray was upset and might call up L.K. Advani. Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray has apparently asked the BJP to clarify its stand on todays meeting, else his party would stay away from the December 22 rally.        
	The Sena may be particularly galled because just before Rajs visit to the BJP office, Sena and MNS activists had squared up before the LIC building, shouting slogans and creating tension in the area.        
	Asked how the BJP would explain the meeting to the Sena, Mungantiwar said: He (Raj) is not their enemy; he is (Uddhavs) brother.        
	During the last Assembly polls, Mungantiwar had called Raj a test tube baby of NCP leader Sharad Pawar for eating into BJP votes. He said he still held the same view.

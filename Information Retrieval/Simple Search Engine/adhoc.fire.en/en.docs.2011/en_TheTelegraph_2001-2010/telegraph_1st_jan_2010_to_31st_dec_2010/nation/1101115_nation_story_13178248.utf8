          ARCHIS MOHAN                                     
	New Delhi, Nov. 14: The foreign ministers of India, Russia and China met today in China for their annual trilateral talks, but it is a grouping which even in its eighth year is yet to agree on its name.         
	The grouping that represents 40 per cent of the worlds population and 10 per cent of the global landmass is loosely called the Russia-India-China or RIC forum.        
	But Delhi likes to call it India-Russia-China or IRC, which has irked China, which instead calls it China-Russia-India or CRI.         
	The first ministerial meeting of the group took place on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in 2002. The first standalone foreign ministers meeting took place in Vladivostok in June 2005.         
	External affairs minister S.M. Krishna today reached Wuhan, in Chinas Hubei province, for the two-day meetings with his Russian and Chinese counterparts.        
	While one of Krishnas focus will be canvassing support for Indias bid for a permanent seat at the Security Council, the three countries are also expected to finally solve the nomenclature conundrum.        
	One proposal is that for future meetings, the host countrys name will come first and will be followed by the previous years host. So todays meeting  the 10th ministerial meeting  would be called the China-India-Russia meeting.         
	India had hosted the ninth meeting in October 2009 in Bangalore.         
	Krishna held separate bilateral talks with his Russian and Chinese counterparts. In a 70-minute meeting with Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi, he sought Chinas support for Indias UN bid, stressing the need for the international community to focus intensively on this issue.         
	During the meeting, Yang gave positive indications, PTI quoted foreign secretary Nirupama Rao as saying.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Knight with torment taint
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Knight with torment taint
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, March 9: Forget quotas, the bill has the power to change hearts too.        
	Muslim and backward-class women today found a chivalrous knight who didnt mind being thrown out of Parliament for their cause  a man accused of grabbing a poor womans land and beating her up.        
	Subhas Yadav was among seven unruly MPs who were bundled out of the Rajya Sabha today for disrupting proceedings as they pressed for sub-quotas for Muslim and backward women.        
	Ironically, Subhas, RJD MP and brother of Bihars most empowered woman, Rabri Devi, is booked in a case of assaulting a Muslim woman and grabbing her land.        
	Subhas Yadav and his henchmen assaulted me in full of view of the people and grabbed a piece of my land near my house in Line Bazaar, Ahmadi Khatun said in her written FIR in October last year.        
	Line Bazaar is near Selarkala, the ancestral home of Rabri Devi and her brothers in north Bihars Gopalganj district, 140km from here.        
	Sub-divisional officer (SDO), Hathua, J. Prasad said the case was being investigated.        
	Khatun realises she has a long haul ahead. It is hard for police and the local administration to lay their hands on the powerful MP, she says. My land is still under his possession.        
	So has the man who is accused of beating up a woman and grabbing her land had a change of heart, enough to suffer the humiliation of being thrown out from the House?        
	Definitely not, says Janata Dal (United) spokesperson Anil Pathak. It is not a case of change of heart. Subhass tenure as Rajya Sabha MP is ending next month, and he indulged in all the drama to appease his powerful brother-in-law Lalu Prasad for a second term.        
	The RJD boss, along with Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, has been vociferously opposing the womens reservation bill for not providing for sub-quotas for Muslim and OBC women within its framework.        
	Sources said Pathaks remark may not have been off the mark because Lalu Prasad and Rabri have both been annoyed with Subhas for working from behind the scenes to ensure the defeat of the RJD boss in Pataliputra in the last Lok Sabha polls.         
	Lalu Prasad denied Subhass wife Renu an RJD ticket from Gopalganj in the last Assembly elections. Subhas, however, fielded Renu as a rebel candidate against the official RJD nominee.        
	But Subhass histrionics in the House today may not pay off. Lalu Prasad is believed to have made up his mind to accommodate Lok Janshakti Party boss Ram Vilas Paswan in the Rajya Sabha in place of Subhas.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Lucknow, Dec. 15: An Uttar Pradesh village has elected a beggar as its headman in protest against corruption that blocked development in the area.        
	Sahawar Shah village in Badaun district, about 375km from here, voted overwhelmingly for Narayan Nat who has been begging for 20 years, since he was 35.        
	The October election win has not changed Nats way of life, even though it has assured him of an income of Rs 1,500 a month  he still goes out to beg every morning and comes home with Rs 35-40 at the end of the day.        
	Nine members of Nats family spread out among neighbouring villages to beg, Bharat Soni, a villager, said.        
	All the previous village pradhans became rich, purchased cars and ignored local development. They would charge money for even issuing a birth certificate, Soni added, explaining the decision to make Nat the headman.        
	In September, when the panchayat poll was announced, a group of 50 villagers held a meeting and decided to field the beggar who belongs to a nomadic community branded outcastes in society.        
	The villagers got him to file nomination papers and went door to door campaigning for him. He did not have to spend a single penny.Nat, initially nervous, won hands down. His brother Ramesh said there were 11 candidates, but the villagers rejected all the rest, ignoring caste affiliations.        
	I dont know what it means to be a village headman. But theres one thing I cannot do, I cannot steal money from the government exchequer for I am illiterate. I dont know how to go about it, he said over the phone of a local journalist. I am not going to stop begging, he asserted.        
	Nats journey from marginal farmer to beggar began in 1960 when his father sold the familys 12 bighas to marry off his three sisters. Badauns local district officials are surprised by the voters choice.It is a strange choice and corruption may have prompted the villagers to cast their protest votes, said Udaivir Singh, tehsildar of Bisoli under which the village comes. Paupers are not allowed to contest, he added, but Nat did have some money.        
	We all need to introspect on this trend that villagers are dragging a beggar to become their village head, subdivisional magistrate R.K. Srivastava said. This is not the first time a beggar has been elected village head. Haleema Khatoon, 34, was elected mukhiya of Kirora panchayat in Bihars Katihar district in 2006.

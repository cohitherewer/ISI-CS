	Midnapore, May 24: A court today rejected charges slapped on the 24 accused in the Shilda massacre under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and for waging war against the state, saying there was no proper approval.        
	I am not inclined to take cognisance in respect of the offences (under UAPA and waging war against the state) for want of proper sanction from the competent authority, Sheikh Mohammad Rezza, the additional chief judicial magistrate of Jhargram said. The accused include Maoist top guns Kishan and Bikash.        
	A senior Calcutta High Court advocate, Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee, said in case of the UAPA, the law-enforcing authority needed to seek the approval of the Centre through the state government.

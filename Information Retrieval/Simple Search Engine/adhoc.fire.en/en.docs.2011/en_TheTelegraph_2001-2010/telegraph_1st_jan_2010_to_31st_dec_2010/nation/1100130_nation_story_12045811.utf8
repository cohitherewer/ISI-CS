          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 29: The Supreme Court today issued notices asking the Centre to respond to a petition seeking to end the University Grants Commissions (UGC) powers to accord deemed university status.        
	Such powers, the petition filed by a consumer activist contended, can only be exercised by Parliament or state legislatures by enacting a law creating a university or recognising an educational institution as a university. It pointed out that Section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956, conferred wide, unguided and absolute powers to recognise an institution as deemed university, commercialising the process of granting degrees.        
	The petition came days after the apex court ordered the Centre not to go ahead for now with its move to de-recognise 44 deemed universities over alleged poor standards. The innocent student, having invested time, money and effort, receives a piece of paper as degree with no value or substance, said the petition filed by activist Jitendra Narayan Singh from Bihar, one of the states where deemed universities face the axe.        
	The power to grant deemed status has been exercised in favour of institutions which do not have the standards to be recognised as universities, the petition said. The institutions, in turn, confer degrees to make profit instead of imparting education. The students, as consumers of services offered by these institutions, find themselves being robbed of the value for their money, Singh, the founder trustee of consumer group Awake India Foundation, said.

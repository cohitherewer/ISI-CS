	New Delhi, March 13 (PTI): Three men allegedly planning to rob a money exchanger were arrested today after a gun battle with police near a Metro station in east Delhi in which three persons, including a constable, were injured.         
	The arrested men have been identified as Sandeep, 27, Narender, 26, and Danny, 27.         
	The police had received a tip-off that a gang would assemble near Geeta Bhavan in Karol Bagh to rob a money exchanger.         
	A trap was laid and at about 11am, five gang members came on two motorcycles. As the police began listening in on their conversation, they got suspicious and pulled out firearms.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Raid whiff as Games files go missing
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Raid whiff as Games files go missing
          ARCHIS MOHAN AND SANJAY K. JHA                          Suresh Kalmadi                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 18: The Commonwealth Games corruption probe could lead to raids on the homes and offices of some of the organisers to find missing documents, sources said.        
	Agencies investigating wrongdoing in the Games preparations have complained that key files and documents are untraceable or unavailable at the offices of the government departments that carried out the work.        
	Enforcement Directorate sources said they might raid some of the key people behind the organisation of the Games to unearth documents relating to work contracts, procurement and the like.        
	The government has asked the senior bureaucrats who were overseeing the organising committees work to keep doing so till further orders. Sources said these officials presence would be a deterrent to any attempt at derailing the probe and that these bureaucrats would help the investigators.        
	The Central Vigilance Commission has asked the Games organising committee to keep samples of all the equipment or props it had rented, from toilet rolls and soap dispensers to gymnasium equipment. The committee has been accused of paying exorbitant rates for rented articles, the total bill coming to more than Rs 600 crore.        
	The Comptroller and Auditor-General has asked its officials to speed up the audit of Games-related work, which it aims to complete within three months. The Prime Ministers Office has ordered a probe headed by V.K. Shunglu, a former CAG.        
	Organising committee chief Suresh Kalmadi today left the venue of a group of ministers (GoM) meeting through a side door, possibly to avoid the media as well as Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit. Kalmadi and Dikshit have been engaged in a verbal duel since the Games ended, insinuating corruption by each others offices.        
	The tension between them was evident. Kalmadi turned up 15 minutes early for the meeting and, till the others arrived, remained huddled with GoM head S. Jaipal Reddy whom he had met yesterday too.        
	Dikshit arrived 15 minutes late. The duo used different gates to leave the building. The others at the meeting included sports minister M.S. Gill, Delhi lieutenant-governor Tejinder Khanna and cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar.        
	The Congress today disapproved of the Kalmadi-Dikshit duel, saying everyone should observe restraint. On Saturday, Dikshit had said: The real corruption seems to be with regard to the money given as loans (to the organising committee).        
	In response, Kalmadi said her aspersions were most disappointing and uncalled for and that she must reflect on corruption in her own departments. He said that while the Centre had given the organising committee only Rs 1,600 crore, it had given the Delhi government over Rs 16,000 crore for Games-related projects.        
	Reddy announced the government decision to let senior officials continue to monitor the organising committees functioning, saying this was because it would take time to bring things to a close after a big event. The cabinet secretariat had posted these officials in the committee in mid-August to help speed up construction work.        
	The government decision indicates how serious the Prime Ministers Office is about the corruption probe. Reddy said the sports ministry will decide on the exact period for which their (these bureaucrats) services should be spared for the organising committee.        
	The GoM passed a resolution noting the Games highly successful conclusion, congratulating Indian medal winners and thanking all Indians and the people of Delhi in particular for their spontaneous and consistent moral support.

	Bijnor, March 15 (PTI): A young bank officer in Uttar Pradesh was beaten to death by five people after an argument over the price of a water bottle.        
	Harsh Vardhan Tyagi, 25, who worked as assistant manager at the Bijnor branch of HDFC Bank, was assaulted at an eatery on Barrage Road on Saturday evening during a heated exchange of words.        
	The deceased, who was the grandson of a former MLA, Shiv Kumar Tyagi, was returning to Bijnor from Meerut with his colleagues where they had gone on official business.        
	On the way, they stopped their car at the eatery to buy a water bottle.         
	The salesman charged Rs 2 over the printed price and this led to the quarrel.         
	At one stage, the salesman and his four companions, including the owner of the eatery, attacked the customers with sticks. While the other three colleagues fled, Harsh Vardhan was beaten up and suffered a blow on his neck from some sharp-edged weapon.        
	The police, on being informed, reached the spot and took Harsh Vardhan to a hospital but he died on the way.        
	The manager of the bank lodged an FIR against the attackers. A case has been registered under Section 302 (murder), 147 148 and 149 (abetment) of IPC.         
	Two of the accused have been arrested.

	New Delhi, July 20: Amid the struggle to fathom the cause of the rail accident at Sainthia, forensic medicine and pharmacology experts are speculating that sleep-inducing substances could explain the inaction of the Uttar Banga Expresss motormen.        
	Forensic toxicologists and pharmacology specialists say the investigators should examine the possibility that the motormen had either been intentionally drugged or had unknowingly consumed sleep-inducing substances.         
	Traditional herbal products as well as modern drugs may be used to put people to sleep, according to the experts who are not connected with the investigations.         
	Just 10mg or 20mg of the drug called nitrazepam can put an adult to sleep within half an hour, said Chandra Gulhati, a specialist in pharmacology, and editor of the Monthly Index of Medical Specialities, India, a journal on drugs.         
	The small quantity of the drug required to induce sleep makes it easy to be given through a drink  either tea or even a cold drink. The taste wont change, the sugar in the drink will mask any differences in taste, Gulhati said.        
	Extracts of Datura, a herb used in traditional medicine, are among the most common substances known to have been used in the past to drug fellow train passengers, said B. Suresh Kumar Shetty, associate professor of forensic medicine and toxicology at the Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore. Datura acts on the central nervous system to induce an altered state of consciousness.        
	Pharmacologists classify some Datura species as hallucinogenic  its compounds have been known to cause visual alterations and delirium. Three years ago, Israeli doctors had documented Datura-induced coma in two patients.        
	Herbal compounds could take half an hour to an hour or even longer to put a person to sleep, the experts said. The speed would depend on the identity of the substance, its concentration, and whether it is taken on an empty or a full stomach.        
	Action would be delayed if it is taken with or shortly after a big meal, Shetty said. Gastric emptying time is typically about four hours. A sleep-inducing substance has fast action when taken on an empty stomach.        
	Forensic medicine experts say an analysis of the viscera of the drivers during the post-mortem would help investigators determine what they had consumed before their train rammed into the Vananchal Express.

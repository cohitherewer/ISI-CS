The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Army salary surprise in Adarsh papers 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Army salary surprise in Adarsh papers 
                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 21 (PTI): The CBI will approach the defence ministry for a clarification on whether an army chiefs salary can be as less as Rs 23,450, which General Deepak Kapoor has apparently claimed as his pay in the Adarsh housing documents.         
	The CBI has procured the documents from the Maharashtra government in which the profiles of all the members of the housing society, originally meant for housing Kargil war widows, were mentioned along with their monthly income, official sources said.        
	The documents, made public by an RTI activist Yogacharya Anandji, showed that former army chief General Deepak Kapoor had declared his salary as Rs 23,450. Surprisingly, around the same time his Lieutenant General, Tejinder Singh, had announced his salary as Rs 41,000 a month.        
	The CBI has collected these documents and will write to the defence ministry seeking details, a senior official said, adding that if any of the officers had filed false affidavits, action could be taken against them for misrepresentation of facts.        
	Kapoor was not available for comment.         
	He had earlier claimed that he paid for the Adarsh Society apartment through his savings and bank loans.        
	According to the documents procured under the RTI Act by Anandji, former army chief Nirmal Chander Vij had in 2007 declared his monthly income as Rs 39,825.        
	The documents have revealed that at least 40 out of the 87 Adarsh flat owners declared their monthly income to be Rs 12,500 or lower as of January 2004 (in a 71-member list) and December 2007 (in a 16-member list).         
	Under a 1999 government resolution, civilians as well as retired defence and government employees could not get memberships in societies such as Adarsh unless they earned Rs 12,500 a month or lower. The rule was later relaxed for a few officers.        
	Among the income declarations of Rs 12,500 or lower, are those of Kanishka Pathak, son of former Mumbai civic chief Jairaj Pathak, and Malav Shah, son of Pune-based builder Jayantilal Shah, who declared his income as Rs 11,000.        
	Brigadier M.M. Wanchu, an office-bearer of Adarsh, listed his income as Rs 10,000 a month.

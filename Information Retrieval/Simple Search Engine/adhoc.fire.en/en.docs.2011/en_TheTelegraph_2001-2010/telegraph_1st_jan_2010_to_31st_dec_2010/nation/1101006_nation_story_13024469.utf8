	Mumbai, Oct. 5: Flying to the US? Prepare for a 16-hour, non-stop plane ride if you are an Air India frequent flier.         
	Starting October 31, Air India is converting all its flights to destinations in the US  John F. Kennedy airport in New York, Newarks Liberty International Airport, Chicagos Hare airport  as well as Toronto into non-stop flights that will bypass Europe altogether.        
	Confirming the development, an Air India spokesperson said: Flights from the gateway points in India to the US will become non-stop. However, once these flights touch down in India they will connect to multiple destinations.        
	For instance, it is learnt that daily flights from JFK to Delhi will fly up to Mumbai and Toronto-Delhi flights will continue to Amritsar. The Chicago-Delhi flights will head to Hyderabad while the non-stop flight from Newark to Mumbai will have a service to Ahmedabad.         
	The Air India spokesperson did not confirm the new routes.        
	Industry insiders said Air Indias decision to operate only non-stop flights to the US followed the move to shut down its Frankfurt hub in an effort to slash costs.         
	By shutting down the Frankfurt hub, the loss-laden state-owned carrier will save roughly Rs 200 crore a year in costs.        
	The airline has already shut down its London-New York service that caused much concern, especially in north India, as it was a route that had started in 1955 and appealed to Indian holiday-makers who preferred to visit family and relatives in London before proceeding to the US.        
	The move defies all logic, said a source associated with the airline. It will only increase the financial burden on Air India that has been suffering a loss of Rs 250 crore a year each on the Mumbai-New York and Delhi-New York non-stop routes.        
	The losses on these routes could not be ascertained.         
	Sources also said that unlike other large Indian private carriers which had managed to lease out their wide-bodied Boeing 777s to foreign airlines, Air India hadnt been able to find any takers for more than a year.        
	It is expected that Air India will fly its 238-seater Boeing 777-200 LRs and its 342-seater Boeing 777-300 ERs to the United States. LR stands for long range and ER for extended range.         
	However, no confirmation was available from the official spokesperson on the type of fleet that would fly non-stop from October 31.         
	Sources said the decision to fly non-stop to North America would also turn out to be an expensive proposition as the planes would have to tank up on fuel to fly directly.         
	Not only will Air India have to buy aviation turbine fuel (ATF) domestically at much higher prices than overseas, it will also need to carry a full tank load, forcing it to make adjustments in passenger and freight load and slowing down speed, they added.        
	Sources said there would be extra pressure to maintain high load factors on a sector that already had adequate seating capacity thanks to rival carriers. Moreover, passengers may be reluctant to take non-stop, 16-hour flights, preferring instead to break their journey in Europe.

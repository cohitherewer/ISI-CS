  - Shias talk of separation        MUZAFFAR RAINA                                     Hurriyat moderate leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq (top) at a protest rally in   Srinagar; A policeman   aims a stone at   protesters. (PTI)                                                          
	Srinagar, July 6: A sectarian divide has emerged in the moderate Hurriyat camp, threatening its fragile unity.        
	A prominent Shia group headed by Aga Syed Hassan today said it was under pressure from its rank and file to dissociate itself from the Hurriyat faction led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and float a separatist front representing Kashmirs Shias.        
	The fissures have emerged after Asiya Andrabi, a hard-line woman separatist, asked the Mirwaiz to expel four senior executive members ---- Hassan, former chairmen Abdul Gani Bhat and Molvi Abbas Ansari, and Peoples Conference leader Bilal Gani Lone ---- for their anti-movement stand. Ansari and Hassan represent Shia groups.        
	Ansari had criticised the Opposition Peoples Democratic Party for inciting the recent wave of stone-throwing, angering hard-liners such as Andrabi who see the protests as part of a resistance movement against Indian occupation.         
	A spokesperson for Hassans group, Anjuman Sharie Shian, has criticised the Mirwaiz for remaining silent on Asiyas character assassination of its leader. The Anjuman, a constituent of the Hurriyat executive council, the separatist conglomerates top decision-making body, has decided to boycott Hurriyat meetings.        
	The spokesperson suggested the Anjuman had also kept open the option of snapping ties. Asiya Andrabi has hurt the sentiments of the Shia community which is unacceptable and the response of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq to Asiyas tirade is not sufficient. It appears he is supportive of her remarks, the spokesperson said.        
	The Anjumans central committee has authorised Hassan to take a decision on parting ways with the Hurriyat and floating a new front. If our participation in the Hurriyat is unwelcome, we shall bid goodbye to forum (Hurriyat) politics. Nobody can ignore the sacrifices of Aga Hassans family in the freedom struggle since 1931, the spokesperson said.        
	The Anjuman has, however, said it will continue supporting the forums programmes to take the movement forward until a formal decision on a split is taken.        
	The Hurriyat is already divided into moderate and hard-line factions, led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Syed Ali Shah Geelani, respectively. The last time it split was in 2003 but that was for ideological reasons. The break-up came over Geelanis opposition to the alleged proxy candidates fielded by Bilal Lones party in the 2002 Assembly elections.        
	The Anjumans discontent marks the first time fissures have emerged on sectarian lines in the Hurriyat.        
	A moderate Hurriyat leader said the Mirwaiz was aware of the development and would try to protect the camps unity. Asiya had (also) targeted leaders like Bilal Lone and Prof Bhat, who are Sunnis. I dont know why the Anjuman is making an issue of her statement. Besides she (Asiya) is not part of our Hurriyat, a moderate leader said.

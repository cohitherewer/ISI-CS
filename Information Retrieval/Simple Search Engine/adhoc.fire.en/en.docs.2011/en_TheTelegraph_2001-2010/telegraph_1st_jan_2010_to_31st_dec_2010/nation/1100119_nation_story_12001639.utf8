The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cold Pak ties cast a cloud on IPL auction
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cold Pak ties cast a cloud on IPL auction
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                        
	Mumbai, Jan. 18: The still frosty relationship with Pakistan continues to cast its shadow on the cash-rich Indian Premier League.         
	The bids for the third edition of the league, scheduled to begin on March 12, will be opened tomorrow when 66 players go under the hammer, 11 of them from Pakistan.         
	The eight teams will pick 12 cricketers for the tournament, which was held in South Africa last year because of elections in India.         
	The auction will be held at Mumbais new second Trident hotel in the Bandra Kurla Complex business district. Ironically, the old Trident hotel in the Marine Drive area was one of the targets of the 26/11 attacks by Pakistan-based terrorists, which spoiled Delhi-Islamabad relations and led to a suspension of cricket between the two countries.        
	Left out of the IPL party last season, Pakistani players, fresh from their success in the T20 World Cup, were looking forward to this years auction.        
	But with New Delhis position on Indo-Pak matches unchanged, IPL team owners are concerned.        
	There has been no written communication, but team owners have been reminded by some IPL functionaries of the difficulties they could face in case of another terrorist attack from Pakistan. Therefore, many think it is better to be safe than sorry. But Kings XI Punjab hopes to shop for Shahid Afridi if possible. He is the only Pakistani player for whom the owners may throw caution to the winds, said a team source.        
	Of the 66 players who will go under the hammer, 11 each are from Pakistan, Australia and South Africa. The rest are from other cricketing nations and renegades from the Indian Cricket League.        
	Despite being on everybodys wish list after they lifted the ICC T20 World Cup, few among us may actually bid for the Pakistani players. They could not send their visas to the IPL in time. Many in the IPL believe that should there be any more trouble involving India and Pakistan, the team owners could be big losers. With India and Pakistan, you can never tell when and what will precipitate a crisis. So there is this unspoken caution that IPL officials indicate to us and the franchisees are wary, said a source in another IPL team.        
	While the team owners are sceptical about picking up the Pakistanis, some Australian players are said to be in two minds about playing IPL Season 3 despite registering for the auction.        
	Prime among them is Adam Gilchrist, who expressed worries after Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray declared that players from Down Under would not be allowed to play in Mumbai and Maharashtra as long as the racist attacks continued on Indians.        
	But a Deccan Chargers official told The Telegraph they were confident their captain would take part.        
	Everything is under control and both him (Gilchrist) and coach Darren Lehmann will be very much a part of the next IPL. The squad will assemble in Hyderabad on February 26 for a conditioning camp, said a Chargers official.        
	IPL sources said the bids were unlikely to go beyond Rs 2.5 crore this year with West Indies all-rounder Kieron Pollard at the top of the heap.        
	Last season, Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff of England had fetched the highest bid at Rs 7.5 crore apiece.        
	This year each team has an allotted Rs 4 crore for player shopping. Plus, most of them are spending money on buy-outs to get rid of non-performing players. Of the 12 that will be picked up eventually, only six are likely to pocket respectable amounts, said the IPL official.        
	In case of a buy-out, a contracted player is paid his dues and relieved before the expiry of the contract.        
	Pollard, his teammate Darren Bravo, New Zealander Shane Bond, Pakistanis Afridi and Imran Nazir and Australias Philip Hughes are expected to be the most sought after. Insiders said Pollard could fetch a price as high as Rs 2.5 crore.        
	Few English players are part of the auction apart from Rob Key and Mark Ramprakash, who, at 40, will be the oldest cricketer under the hammer.        
	The three-year contracts of earlier seasons will make way for just year-long deals  so the players auctioned tomorrow will be available only for IPL Season 3 and the Champions League Twenty20 in December 2010.        
	This is mainly because of the additional two teams that will be added from Season 4, said the IPL source.

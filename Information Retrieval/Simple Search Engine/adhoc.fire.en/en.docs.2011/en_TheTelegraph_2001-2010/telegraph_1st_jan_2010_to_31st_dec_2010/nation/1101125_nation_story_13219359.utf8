	Patna, Nov. 24: One of the stories of the day was that though Nitish Kumar blanked the Opposition, he ran rather close to being beaten by his ally.         
	The BJP surged remarkably as the trends poured in and was neck and neck with the Janata Dal (United), its senior partner, at one point. Even though the Dal (U)s tally pulled ahead as the day progressed, it was for nobody to deny that the BJP had registered a much better success rate, increasing its kitty by nearly 35 seats even though it contested less than half the seats the Dal (U) kept.         
	Leaders of both parties were keen to allay suggestions that the BJPs stellar showing could alter the dynamics of the alliance. Dont see this as a victory of this party or that, said BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad. This is a wholesome mandate for the alliance and the work it has done under captain Nitish Kumar. It will be mischievous to over-speculate and over-analyse the implications of this result on the alliance itself.         
	Dal (U) general secretary Shivanand Tiwary sounded an equally cautious and circumspect note. Why must we see this as the BJPs or the JD(U)s victory in separate compartments? This is the victory of the team and the job it has done, the people have voted for both together under the unchallenged leadership of Nitish Kumar. All suggestions that this might pull power equations this way or that are meaningless.        
	Even so, there are lessons both parties are drawing from this as they sit down to interpret the message of the mandate. The BJP, elated and rather relieved its numbers have gone north rather than south, seems under no illusion that this victory is something of its own making.         
	Let us be clear, said a top state party leader. We have been beneficiaries of the Nitish effect in a substantial way, this is nothing we could have achieved on our own. The surprising thing is we have won several seats where Muslim votes are critical, Nitish has swung them to us.        
	Built into that argument is the unstated admission that the BJP and the ruling alliance were happier not having the likes of Narendra Modi hit the campaign trail in Bihar. Modi is a sore point that both the BJP and the Dal (U) want to keep off the Bihar table, but there is emerging evidence that the BJP has benefited from the transfer of classically Nitish votes that probably would have been scared off had Modi been part of electioneering.         
	Said a seasoned Bihar observer: It is clear that the way Nitish has handled this alliance, he has actually neutralised the rough edges of the BJP that are an irritant to the minorities in particular. That is the great paradox of these results  the BJP has become stronger under Nitish but it is not that classical BJP politics has become stronger. What has become stronger is the kind of BJP Nitish prefers, a tamed one.                    Supporters of Nitish Kumar celebrate after the Bihar election results in Patna on Wednesday. (Reuters)      
	Equally strong is the sense in the party that enhanced numbers do not necessarily give the BJP a handle to drive a harder bargain with Nitish, either in terms of ministerial berths or on policy issues. The party is acutely aware that if its Assembly numbers have mounted, Nitish too has made critical gains, so critical that, theoretically, he is in a position to cobble a majority of his own if the BJP becomes a worrisome ally.         
	Nitish has pushed himself very close to a majority on his own, said the BJP leader. If we try and push him on the basis of our better performance, he could exercise other options, it is important we do not lose sight of that. The most important thing is to keep the alliance on track.        
	The Dal (U), on the other hand, was left wondering whether its lack of an organisational network had cost it a few additional seats. A top partyman admitted the JD(U) had worked like a one-man show, relying too much on Nitish.         
	The results probably tell us that there was overwhelming goodwill for us and we could not encash it all because we do not have the kind of machinery that the BJP has. They have reaped more benefits from this goodwill than we have. Perhaps it is time for the leadership to focus on building an organisation.         
	Shivanand Tiwary argued, though, that elections, particularly in north India, have always been individual centric and too much emphasis is often put on cadres and organisation. This has been a lamp-post election, Tiwary said. Whoever had Nitishs backing seems to have won, so in a sense the people themselves have become the organisation, they are the party today. This has happened in the past with Lalu Prasad and Karpoori Thakur as well, they were leaders who pulled their weight with the masses irrespective of any organisation.         
	Asked whether a grassroots network could have helped the Dal (U) to greater numbers in the Assembly, Tiwary said: It is too early to comment on that, let us savour this moment of victory for now, the analysis can follow.

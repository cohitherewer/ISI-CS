	New Delhi, May 3: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is scheduled to meet Manmohan Singh tomorrow, the talks coming at a time the Congress-Trinamul Congress alliance in the state has collapsed over this months civic polls.        
	The problems in the Opposition alliance have come as a ray of hope for the ruling CPM, reeling from a string of poll setbacks, though the party has not felt enthused enough to stress too much on the break-up.        
	The appointment with the Prime Minister is at 11am. After that, Bhattacharjee will attend the CPM politburo meeting, which will be followed by the partys three-day national executive that will take stock of the political scenario.        
	Good personal ties between Bhattacharjee and Singh have long worried Mamata Banerjee. The CPM hopes to flaunt tomorrows meeting to irritate its mercurial rival again. The Trinamul chief was said to be enraged when Singh asked Bhattacharjee to sit in his car when the Prime Minister went to see an ailing Jyoti Basu in January.         
	Bhaskar Khulbe, the resident commissioner of Bengal, confirmed the appointment, but did not divulge the purpose of the meeting. The chief minister will meet the Prime Minister at 11am on Tuesday but I have no idea about the agenda, Khulbe said. According to Khulbe, no meeting is planned with home minister P. Chidambaram.

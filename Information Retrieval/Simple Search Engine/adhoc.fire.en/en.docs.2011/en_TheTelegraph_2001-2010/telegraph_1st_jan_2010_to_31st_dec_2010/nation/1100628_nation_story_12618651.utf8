	Bhubaneswar, June 27: From the next monsoon, tourists wont have to wade through knee-deep water to visit the Sun Temple in Konark. The state government has decided to introduce a proper drainage system at the 13th century heritage site to stop its flooding.         
	A day after heavy rains inundated the temple, the water resources department on Saturday chalked out a plan to construct a 1900-m-long drain spending around Rs 1 crore. It would allow easy discharge of storm water from the temple.         
	The Orissa Construction Corporation would be given the responsibility to construct the proposed drain. Executive engineer of drainage division S.K. Sahoo said: We oversaw the situation and decided to construct a drain at the earliest. We also discussed the waterlogging issue with the Archaeological Survey of India officials.         
	An ASI official said: Drains will certainly help solve the flooding problem. We will extend our full cooperation to the Orissa Construction Corporation in developing the drainage system.        
	Torrential rains flooded the Sun Temple, about 30km from Puri, last Friday. Several tourists could not go inside the temple to watch the rich artwork on its walls.        
	Last year, rains had left the temple in knee-deep water. Tourists had a tough time wading through the flooded temple.        
	Several NGOs and those associated with the tourism industry had been demanding proper drainage system at the Sun Temple. They heaved a sigh of relief following the state governments decision.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Return of Lalu: party pumped up, rival happy
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Return of Lalu: party pumped up, rival happy
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                            Lalu Prasad (top) and Nitish Kumar                          
	Patna, Aug. 25: Lalu Prasads decision to put aside the Rabri rubber-stamp and return to lead the electoral charge of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) appears to have enthused the party anew.         
	At long last, as one top RJD functionary said, the real leader in his rightful place, no longer must we labour under the farce of having to prop up Rabri Devi.         
	But before they get too excited, they might want to think again. Lalu Prasads comeback as claimant for chief ministership has delighted chief minister Nitish Kumar and his ranks in equal measure.         
	Thats the poignant and painful paradox of being Lalu Prasad. He is the RJDs greatest, and probably only, asset, but he is also the partys biggest drawback.         
	He remains, even after five years out of the saddle, not merely the best-known political figure in the state but also its most charismatic and astute. But then, he also remains most terribly haunted by the ghosts of serial lapses during his long years at the helm. Those were years whose memory hed best want forgotten, but his opponents are unlikely to tire of reminding people in the campaign that has just got underway.        
	Your job is already half done, Nitish has been telling party workers in a sardonic riposte aimed at his prime adversary, the very thought of Laluji returning to power in Bihar will drive voters away from him. And as if to rub his sarcasm deeper, the chief minister has also begun to mock Lalu Prasads remorseful appeal to voters: Laluji is going around telling people he will not repeat the mistakes of the past but the real question is whether the people are going to repeat the mistake of voting him.        
	But that Nitish has accorded Lalu Prasad the status of chief rival in the coming contest in itself perhaps a tribute to the RJD leaders political vigour and tenacity.         
	Its nothing he will take as a compliment but its no mean feat that after 15 years in power and five out of it, Lalu Prasad is still able to worry Nitish about which way the dice will fall. Its nothing he will take as a compliment but it is no mean thing that if he made bad news of himself and the RJD, he also remains the partys only good news, its sole hope as it starts the run to regain power.        
	His sprawling west Patna home, the official residence of wife Rabri Devi, who remains leader of Opposition, has become a hive of ticket-seekers; he remains a credible merchant of political fortune, still able to put a high price on his wares.         
	Lage hue hain akele ladai mein, he tells us between attending to the prattle of rival pleaders for the party symbol, adai tough hai, lekin hum bhi kum tough nahin hain (I have engaged single-handed in this battle; it is a tough one, but I am tough too).        
	He sits under a makeshift portico-cum-outhouse to one side of the bungalow, swamped by current and would-be courtiers. Above the clamour of requesting and rejection hovers the constant and heady trilling of a battery of phones, landlines, mobiles, all afire as ranks burn the wires from near and afar to seek their leaders favour  tickets, tickets, tickets, oh for an RJD ticket!         
	Dekhte hain, he says, pleased at being at the centre of competitive commotion, aur sab kahta hai ki Lalu khatam ho gaya. Khatam aadmi ke paas log tikat maangne aata hai? (Do you see this? And they say Lalu Prasad is over. Do people come seeking tickets from a man who is over?)        
	If politics is the art of the possible, Lalu Prasad has often proved its converse  he has achieved the impossible. And he might yet; dont write him off. Consider this: Fifteen years in power. Fifteen fairly besmirched years. Absence of governance, near-zero development, personal and political scandal, excessive nepotism, destructive populism, astounding chicanery. Yet, in his darkest hour, the man grabs 56 seats, the second largest in an Assembly of 243, and a more than respectable percentage of the vote.         
	In his worst election, Lalu Prasad had netted 23 per cent of the vote as opposed to Nitishs 20 per cent and the BJPs even lower count.

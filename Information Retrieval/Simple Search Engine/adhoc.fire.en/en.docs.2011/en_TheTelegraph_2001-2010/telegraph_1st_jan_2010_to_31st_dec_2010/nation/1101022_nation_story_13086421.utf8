	Madurai, Oct. 21 (PTI): Madras High Court has ruled that a government employee who had earlier delivered twins cannot be denied maternity leave benefits for her second delivery on the ground that she already has two children.        
	Justice K. Chandru disagreed with a June 1997 government order that said maternity leave shall not be granted to government employees who already had two surviving children. The relief came on a petition filed by a government schoolteacher.        
	The judge said the intention behind regulating grant of maternity leave could only be to limit the benefit up to the second delivery and not on the basis of the number of children born during each delivery.        
	If it is not construed in this way, it may produce ridiculous results. To cite an example, if during the first delivery, a woman government employee delivers a single child and by the second delivery if she delivers twins or triplets, then should she be disqualified? the judge said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Spot-fix queries for Bollywood starlet
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Spot-fix queries for Bollywood starlet
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 7: Bollywood starlet Neetu Chandra was today questioned by cricket officials about the spot-fixing scandal, an Indian board source said, adding that other film people and IPL cricketers could come under a cloud too.        
	The source, a top Board of Control for Cricket in India official, said officials from world body ICCs anti-corruption unit had quizzed Neetu about her alleged links with Pakistani bowler Mohammed Asif, a spot-fixing accused.        
	Why just Neetu, there are other Bollywood people in this muck as well. And we are not ruling out the role of IPL cricketers, either, the source said. A leading batsman has for long been under suspicion. His (place in the) batting order was brought forward so he could not spot-fix. A Sri Lankan cricketers name is also under a shroud.        
	Officially, IPL chairman Chirayu Amin and governing council member Rajiv Shukla denied any knowledge of Neetus possible role or the possibility of any Indian players involvement in the scam.        
	Neetu had been named by Asifs former girlfriend Veena Malik as one of his Indian contacts involved in IPL spot-fixing, a source said. Media reports said Neetus name had figured on Asifs cellphone.        
	The SMS exchanges between them related to critical cricketing issues, according to the ICC. We do not have the details or the transcripts with us, but hope to get them soon, the board source said.        
	Contacted on her cellphone, Neetu declined to speak on the matter but a PTI report said she had denied any links with Asif. Her publicist Dale Bhagwagar told The Telegraph that far from having anything to do with fixing, she had nothing to do with cricket at all.        
	Neetu was regularly seen at IPL parties in various Indian cities and was the chosen celebrity for Gitanjali jewellery when it decided to gift Morellato watches to five Deccan Chargers players.        
	A regular basketball player, she had been spotted with NBA star Pau Gasol at various parties in Mumbai last month when he came to India to boost the growth of basketball and the NBA in this country.

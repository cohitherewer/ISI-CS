          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                               
	Varanasi, Dec. 8: One American couple dashed to the airport to take a flight out to Delhi after the blast last evening, but most other foreign tourists in Varanasi are staying put.         
	Jane Hendrickson, 36, was out on the busy main road leading to Dashashwamedh Ghat this morning for a cup of masala chai and a smoke. The Rapid Action Force was patrolling the street but that didnt bother the visitor from Sydney who had just arrived.         
	A blast can happen anywhere. The terror network is operating internationally. I heard it on the train this morning that there was a blast here. I did not take a train back. I am not scared, she said.         
	I am planning to stay in Varanasi for a week. I will go for yoga, therapy massage and enjoy the activities of life on the ghats, Jane added.         
	The blast site was cordoned off, priests were in a closed-door huddle and rows of empty boats were anchored to the bank as residents stayed away from the ghats but French visitor Haizea Berthod was out for a morning stroll.         
	I had left the ghat an hour before the blast yesterday. But I could hear the sound from my room in the hotel I have checked into near the ghat, she said. I have been here for the last two weeks and I have begun loving the yoga training, why should I leave? All I have done this morning is to send an email home stating that I am safe.         
	Four foreigners were among the 45 injured.        
	Tour operators in Varanasi said there have been very few cancellations by foreign tourists this time.

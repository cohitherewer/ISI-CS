The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mediator hunt for Ayodhya gathers pace
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mediator hunt for Ayodhya gathers pace
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: The Centre and the Mayavati regime are scouting for mediators to reach out to groups involved in the Ayodhya title suit, with a little over a fortnight to go for judgment day.        
	Sources in the central and state governments said although the aggrieved party  be it Hindu or Muslim  was likely to move the Supreme Court for a stay on the September 24 verdict, the political ramifications would have to be tackled almost immediately.        
	There is no question of dithering because our feedback is the (Uttar Pradesh) chief minister has racheted the build-up to such an extent that people in and around Ayodhya are seeing a replay of 1990 (when the Babri mosque was first attacked), an Uttar Pradesh Congress MP said.        
	The Muslims are edgy, the Hindus are watching the RSSs and VHPs movements, and the BJP is looking to make its comeback. In this country, politics is still driven by religion and caste, even though the temple issue looks like its dead.        
	The Muslim side is represented by the All India Babri Masjid Action Committee that has remained more or less intact since it was set up in the eighties to take on the Sangh fraternity.        
	The Centres  and to an extent, the BJPs  problem is who will speak up for the Hindu groups that contested the ownership of the land on which the mosque stood.        
	The Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas, a trust set up to build the Ram temple, has arrogated to itself the right of representing the Hindu community. The trust is a loose coalition of mostly north Indian sadhus, sants and mahants, and VHP and BJP members.        
	Temple-mosque conflict observers believe that while late Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao partially managed to split the Hindu clergy and lure some clerics to the governments side in the nineties (before the mosque was demolished) to undermine the RSS-VHP-BJP, the present government will have little luck on this count.        
	Over the years, the Nyas co-opted most of the clergy. Weve been searching for unattached ones who could serve as intermediaries in a sticky situation. But we havent zeroed in on anyone, an Uttar Pradesh bureaucrat said.        
	Mahant Yogi Adityanath, the BJPs Gorakhpur MP, claimed: Its impossible for Congress agents to survive outside the orbit of our functioning because they get exposed.        
	Most of those with the Nyas have been linked to the VHP from the start, including Adityanaths religious mentor Mahant Avaidyanath who heads the Ramjanmabhoomi Uchcha Adhikar Prapta Samiti, an oversight committee to supervise various panels concerned with the issue.        
	While the Congress is counting on Faizabad MP Nirmal Khatri  respected by the areas Hindus and Muslims  to tide over the problem, official sources in Delhi said Shatrughana Singh, a joint secretary in the Prime Ministers Office, might be an important resource person.        
	When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was Prime Minister, he inducted Singh to head a special Ayodhya cell in the PMO to negotiate with the RSS-VHP.

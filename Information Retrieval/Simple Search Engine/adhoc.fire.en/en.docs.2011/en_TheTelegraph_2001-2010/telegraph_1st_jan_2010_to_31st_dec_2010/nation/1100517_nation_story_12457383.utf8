	New Delhi, May 16: The stampede that killed two persons at New Delhi railway station was waiting to happen, commuters alleged today saying such last-minute platform switches were common at the station, including one yesterday.        
	The railways standard clarification, station regulars said, is: Its a technical problem.        
	Today, a railway official at least gave a specific explanation saying the platform switch was prompted by a technical problem in the engine of a train on platform 15.        
	So the Rajdhani, which was to come in at platform 15, was sent to platform 13 and the Sampark Kranti was shifted to platform 12, he said.        
	An elderly man said there had almost been a stampede yesterday when Mamatas pet Duronto train rolled in at a platform different from the designated one.        
	The announcement, he said, was made less than 10 minutes before the Calcutta-bound train arrived at the platform.        
	The crush almost suffocated me to death; it was so crowded. People had no help from any official as they ran here and there trying to cross the overbridge to get to the other platform, said the man, who had come to see off his son at the station yesterday.        
	Todays victims include 35-year-old Soni from Uttar Pradesh, whose two-year-old son lay injured on the platform after the stampede, crying for his dead mother. The other dead passenger, a 12-year-old boy, is yet to be identified.        
	We only needed to make it to the other side of the platform. I dragged my four children to a corner and began moving towards the train but people fell on us from all directions. My wife and I saved our kids by shielding them with our bodies. My kids have minor injuries and my wife has a swollen arm, said a passenger, Imran.        
	Sumitra Devi said she had lost her lifes savings: I was going to my daughters wedding. I have lost all my cash and jewellery.        
	A three-member committee will probe the tragedy.

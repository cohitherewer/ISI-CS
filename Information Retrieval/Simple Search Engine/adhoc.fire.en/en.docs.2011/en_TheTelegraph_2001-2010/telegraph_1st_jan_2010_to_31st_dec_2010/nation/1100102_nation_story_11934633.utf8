          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 1: India and Pakistan today exchanged lists of their nuclear installations and facilities.         
	The two neighbours had signed an agreement on the prohibition of attack against nuclear installations and facilities on December 31, 1988.         
	The pact mandates that the two countries inform each other of their nuclear installations facilities on the first day of every year. The first such exchange of lists took place in 1992.        
	India today rejected the so-called chief minister of Gilgit-Baltistans claims of the region having become the fifth province of Pakistan.         
	The entire state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India by virtue of its accession to India in 1947, the external affairs ministry said.

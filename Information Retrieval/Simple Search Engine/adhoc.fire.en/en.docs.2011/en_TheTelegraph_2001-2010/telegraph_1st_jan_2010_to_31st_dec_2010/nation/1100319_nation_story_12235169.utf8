The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP doubts on N-bill
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP doubts on N-bill
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 18: The government may use the proposed nuclear liability bill to allow back-door entry to foreign operators in the field that is now under the public sector, the BJP has reportedly told the national security adviser.        
	The Opposition party questioned the Centres intention to allow nuclear damage victims to seek remedy from civil courts in addition to claiming liability payments from the culpable operator.        
	These apprehensions were conveyed by the leaders to the national security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon, who had briefed them on the matter yesterday. The leaders who met Menon included Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Murli Manohar Joshi and Yashwant Sinha.        
	It is understood that Menon was asked to state clearly if only PSUs would be in the business of nuclear energy production and distribution or if the government intended to bring in foreign firms. If the Centre was to reserve the nuclear sector only for government operators, what was the need for the proposed liability law, the BJP leaders asked him.        
	Menon reportedly emphasised that the government was not thinking of allowing foreign operators as it was not allowed under the existing atomic energy law.        
	The national security adviser was reminded that 60 facilities were envisaged to generate the projected units of nuclear energy, but for doing this India neither had the expertise nor the money. One leader asked if the low compensation amounts were meant to entice international players to the sector who will probably come in with third-rate technology.         
	Apparently no plausible explanation came from Menon, prompting the BJP to infer that the objective of liability-capping was not to serve the government or the PSUs but to put in place a structure that would serve foreign operators.        
	This governments track record is such that it has one basic credibility crisis. This legislation is being drafted under international compulsions, said a leader.        
	The BJP asked if a foreign company was the operator and the compensation was paid by the government if it exceeded the ceiling the bill sought to impose, was it to surmise that tax payers would underwrite the damages. To this, too, there was apparently no convincing explanation.        
	The BJP leaders said they were surprised to learn that the government had proposed to classify the indemnity into amount paid for immediate relief and additional sums to be awarded by the civil courts which the victims were free to move. One of them wondered if a legislation that provided for multiplicity of laws for victims of negligence and accident was being contemplated and if indeed the victims would be in a position to approach even one of them.        
	The BJP stressed that the liability law should be simple and straight and provide for the payment of immediate compensation and long-term indemnity of very large sums. It said the time span for redeeming the damage should be extended for 10 to 30 years given the long-term effects of a nuclear mishap.        
	At the moment the BJP felt that the battle lines between the UPA and the Opposition on the bill remained firmly drawn. The government is where it is, we are where we are, a leader stated.

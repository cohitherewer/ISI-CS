          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           Bandopadhyay in Parliament on Wednesday. (PTI)    
	New Delhi, May 5: Mamata Banerjee was the focus of Opposition criticism in the Lok Sabha yesterday. Today, her party chief whip Sudip Bandopadhyay wasnt spared even by the Speaker.         
	An embattled Trinamul Congress was left virtually alone to defend its leaders in the Lok Sabha for a second day, after Speaker Meira Kumar formally reprimanded Bandopadhyay for his behaviour yesterday while defending party chief Mamata.         
	Bandopadhyay had allegedly used unparliamentary language against CPM leader Basudev Acharya while defending Mamatas absence from the Lok Sabha during a debate on the Mumbai motormens strike.         
	Those words and the manner in which they were said were unbecoming of a member of the House. I disapprove of such conduct. I hope no member of the House will again give an occasion for the Chair to make such an observation, Kumar said at the start of proceedings today, in a rare and sharp rebuke to the Calcutta North MP.         
	The CPM, however, demanded that the Trinamul chief whip offer an unconditional apology to Acharya and stormed the well of the House, forcing Kumar to adjourn proceedings twice.         
	BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi also demanded that Bandopadhyay apologise to the House. I request that he should apologise to the House and to Shri Basudev Acharya, Joshi said.         
	But Bandopadhyay remained defiant. I need not be taught how to behave in Parliament, he told the House. Holding aloft a copy of yesterdays proceedings, Bandopadhyay challenged his critics to prove he had used unparliamentary language.         
	If any of the words in the proceedings can be proven as unparliamentary, I am prepared to apologise, he said.         
	Later, he said he accepted the Speakers statement.         
	Leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee asked the Opposition to accept the Speakers verdict and allow proceedings to continue, but also subtly hinted that an apology from the Trinamul leader would help.         
	It is not that sometimes these things do not happen  tempers run high. I myself have on a number of occasions apologised to the House, Mukherjee said.

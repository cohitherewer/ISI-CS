          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: Sonia Gandhi and Rahul have held up Congress-ruled Haryanas policy of land acquisition, relief and rehabilitation as a model.        
	But a closer look suggests that the claims may only be partially justified as other states argue that their models are better even while borrowing elements from the Haryana system.        
	Bhupinder Singh Hooda crafted the policy with an eye on his key principal political constituency, the farmer, in 2006, around two years after he was sworn in as Haryana chief minister for the first term. The rules were enforced with retrospective effect to cover all acquisitions carried out from 2005.         
	The policy followed years of land protests similar to those now being witnessed in Bengal, Orissa, Maharashtra and elsewhere.         
	A key feature of the Haryana policy is that it sets the minimum rates  ranging from Rs 8 lakh to Rs 20 lakh (in areas like Gurgaon near Delhi)  for plots. It also provides for a 33-year annuity to be deposited at the rate of Rs 15,000 per acre annually. This will go up at the rate of Rs 500 per acre every year.         
	An annuity is a financial asset where money is deposited over a number of years, after which it yields a lump-sum amount or monthly payments. An example is a pension plan with individual contributions.        
	Another feature is the allotment of a minimum 50 square yard plot on the acquired land to enable the seller to stay there. After winning a second term in 2009, Hooda promised farmers bigger payouts but didnt put a figure.        
	Haryana is one of Indias smallest but wealthiest states and a top investment destination, which means it can afford to pay prices less affluent states cant.        
	Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati also revisited her states land acquisition policy, pushed by an agitation in the western districts. Although she claimed it was a big improvement over Haryanas model, she borrowed elements from it. Her policy provides, besides the compensation, higher annuity and a one-time sum at the rate of Rs 96,000 per acre if the annuity is foregone.        
	Owners get 7 per cent of the acquired land to build homes, with a minimum area set by the government. In a housing project, the buyer has to reserve 17.5 percent of the dwelling units for the farmers who have sold the land.        
	So, are other states enthusiastic about the Haryana model? Not quite. Tamil Nadu, for instance, has looked towards BJP-ruled Gujarat for lessons. In that model, 60 per cent of the land acquired is returned to the owner who gets it back in a more developed condition.         
	In the other 40 per cent, the developer can set up commercial or residential projects for sale. Tamil Nadu prefers this model for two main reasons. One, there are no forced acquisitions. Two, the government does not intervene.

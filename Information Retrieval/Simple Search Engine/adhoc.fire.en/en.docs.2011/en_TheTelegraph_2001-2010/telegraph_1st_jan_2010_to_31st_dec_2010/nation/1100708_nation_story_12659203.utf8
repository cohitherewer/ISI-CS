	Hyderabad, July 7: A 30-year-old American woman working with the Clinton Foundations office here was raped at knifepoint at her flat this morning, police said today.        
	The woman, a nutritionist, was allegedly attacked between 3am and 4am when she was alone in her second-floor apartment in Road No. 11, Banjara Hills. She has told the police the rapist took away Rs 5 lakh in cash and jewellery.        
	The police have formed two teams to investigate the case and, based on the description of the suspect given by the woman, have launched a hunt with sniffer dogs. The victim has been admitted to hospital for a medical examination.         
	The woman has been living as a tenant in the flat since October 2009, officers said. City police commissioner A.K. Khan visited the flat this morning.        
	Police sources said there was no sign of a break-in, suggesting the attacker may have been known to the victim although she has denied this. Officers also said they found no sign that any cash or jewellery had been stolen.        
	Everything appeared intact in the cupboard, a source said.        
	Police commissioner Khan said he was waiting for the medical report and added that every effort would be made to catch the rapist. We do not want a wrong signal to go out about foreign nationals safety in the city, he said.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pillai can hit back with a PM parallel
          OUR BUREAU                      Indian home secretary GK Pillai                          
	New Delhi, July 16: Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi isnt alone in being cut to the quick by Union home secretary G.K. Pillais outspoken ways.        
	Many Naga militants have suffered his acerbic tongue, like the rebel leader who had introduced himself to Pillai as his outfits education minister about a decade ago.        
	If you are a minister then I am the Prime Minister of India, Pillai told the flabbergasted man.        
	Pillai, now 60, was joint secretary of northeast affairs at the home ministry from 1996 to 2001 and frequently interacted with the Naga rebels. The Naga leaders would leave incensed after their meetings with him, a militant source said.        
	Pillai, a 1972-batch IAS officer from the Kerala cadre, is known in the power corridors for his sense of repartee and his refusal to brook nonsense. A suave cowboy is how a junior colleague described him.        
	His friends and colleagues admit that the statement by Pillai that angered Qureshi was ill-timed but add that the home secretary has never been afraid to stick his neck out. Pillai is known for his work ethic, but isnt one for burying his head in a heap of files.        
	He likes engaging with the outside world, including journalists, whom most bureaucrats avoid even at the best of times. For the media, he has been a welcome relief from his predecessor Madhukar Gupta, who was the archetypal tight-lipped bureaucrat.        
	On Wednesday, on the eve of the Indo-Pak foreign ministers talks, Pillai had accused Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence of controlling and co-ordinating the 26/11 attacks from the beginning till the end.        
	Yesterday, Qureshi had said he and his Indian counterpart S.M. Krishna both considered the comment uncalled for, and compared it to alleged Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeeds anti-India speeches in their potential to hurt the bilateral dialogue. The Pakistani establishment and its media have accused Pillais remark of derailing the talks.        
	Krishna had not refuted Qureshis remark yesterday but today, as Indias ruling party and main Opposition ripped into the Pakistani minister and the BJP attacked Krishna for his silence, the external affairs minister said there was no question of comparison between Pillais remark and Saeeds speeches.        
	But Krishna did not directly rebut Qureshis statement that the two of them were of the same opinion on Pillais remark.        
	Pillai had based his comments on purported leads that Americas top investigating agency, the FBI, had gleaned from Lashkar-e-Toiba operative David Coleman Headley, home ministry sources said.        
	The Congress rushed to the home secretarys aid, spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi saying: Pakistans tone and tenor at the talks were negative and accusatory. He added that this approach was absolutely disappointing.        
	A former commerce secretary, Pillai took over as home secretary in June 2009. After his stint on the home ministrys northeast desk, he had worked as principal secretary to then Kerala chief minister A.K. Antony.        
	Sources said Antony wanted Pillai to be his secretary in the defence ministry but home minister P. Chidambaram won him over. Chidambaram and Pillai  the home secretary enjoys his ministers confidence despite their disagreements  have run the ministry more proactively than their predecessors.        
	There have been failures, such as the Manipur blockade, Darjeeling and the Maoists, but the duo can claim credit for preventing any major terrorist attack since 26/11, barring the German Bakery blast in Pune.        
	Pillais wife Sudha is a Punjabi who recently retired from the IAS and is now a member of the Planning Commission.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 27: Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan today landed at a literature festival a day before he was expected, perhaps to avoid bumping into Amitabh Bachchan for the second time in a week.        
	The superstar caused a flutter on Wednesday by attending the inauguration of a new wing of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, a Congress event where Chavan was present.         
	Today, it was Chavans turn to cause a flutter at the Marathi Sahitya Sammelan in Pune. The conference organisers, who were expecting to host Amitabh and Chavan tomorrow, went into a tizzy trying to change the schedule to accommodate a discussion in which Chavan was supposed to participate.         
	Chavan played it safe. Asked if he would come to the festival tomorrow, he replied: I will decide about it tomorrow.         
	Was he under pressure from the high command to steer clear of Amitabh? There is no pressure from the high command, Chavan said.        
	On Wednesday, though, Chavan had not been so guarded when he had to share the dais with the actor who has long ceased to be a presence in any Congress do after falling out with the Gandhis. When I saw Amitabh Bachchan I felt as if I am at an awards or cultural function, he had said.        
	Amitabhs recent praise of Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi  he called Modi shahenshah and agreed to be the brand ambassador of the state  and his association with the Samajwadi Party may have made him an untouchable in Congress circles.         
	But Congress ally NCP, which had invited Amitabh to the sea link event, clarified today that the party would ensure he is not insulted again.        
	State home minister R.R. Patil, who is from the NCP, said: Whether the government likes it or not, he (Amitabh) is an icon and rules millions of hearts. So let us take care and ensure that he is not insulted again. There are more pressing issues before the government and so I hope the media and the leaders now put a stop to this controversy and move on.         
	The BJP had accused the Congress of being narrow-minded to insult Amitabh only because of his association with Modi.         
	The BJPs alliance partner Shiv Sena today took up the cudgels on behalf of the actor. Sena boss Bal Thackeray said: Amitabh hasnt committed a crime by attending the event (sea link function).         
	He criticised the Congress as immature for treating him as an untouchable and also drew a parallel with the Congresss support for Shah Rukh Khan during the IPL controversy.         
	Thackeray said Amitabh was a true nationalist, but Congressmen were more interested in promoting Shah Rukh who had supported hiring Pakistani players for the IPL. Bachchan was not a thief, dacoit or a terrorist for the Congress to be so allergic towards him, the Sena patriarch said.         
	Amitabh had only enhanced the prestige of the event by his presence, Thackeray wrote in an editorial in Saamna, the Sena mouthpiece. All this merely because Bachchan is the brand ambassador of Gujarat and he was earlier the brand ambassador of Uttar Pradesh. That too, by the Congress which has made Sonia Gandhi the partys brand ambassador though she accepted Indian citizenship 17 years after her marriage with Rajiv Gandhi, he wrote.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bus burning death penalty
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bus burning death penalty
                            
	Chennai, Aug. 30: The Supreme Court has confirmed the death sentences of three ADMK officials in the Dharmapuri bus burning case, bringing to a close a gruesome chapter in Tamil Nadus culture of political violence after 10 long years.        
	Three college girls were charred to death in February 2000 as the ADMK protested violently against Jayalalithaas conviction in a corruption case, horrifying a state used to political parties venting their anger on public property and innocent citizens.        
	The incident has remained a blot on the ADMK since all the three prime accused were its officials while the other 25, handed seven-year terms, were its cadres.        
	We only hope that with this verdict, the culture of political violence in Tamil Nadu will come to an end for ever. That is the best tribute political parties can pay to my daughter, said Kasi Ammal, mother of K. Hemalatha, one of the three girls killed.

          OUR BUREAU                              Shiv Shankar Menon; Hillary Clinton				                                 
	New Delhi, July 20: National security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon today said the nexus between Pakistani intelligence agencies and terrorist groups was getting stronger, echoing the home secretarys comments on 26/11 that Islamabad had blamed for the failure of last weeks talks.        
	For us, it has been brought home most recently by what we learnt from (Mumbai suspect David Coleman) Headley which confirmed many of the things we knew before. And it is really the links with the official (Pakistani) establishment and with the existing intelligence agencies, it is that nexus which makes it a much harder phenomenon for us to deal with, Menon told a seminar organised by the ORF-Heritage Foundation Dialogue in the capital.        
	The comments came on a day US secretary of state Hillary Clinton said in Kabul that the Pakistani establishment, particularly its intelligence agencies, knew where Osama bin Laden was hiding. She also asserted that Headleys interrogation by US officials had thrown up quite a revealing set of facts we have shared with the Pakistani authorities.        
	Foreign minister S.M. Krishna raised the point while returning home from Kabul where he had met Clinton. Pakistan, he said, should take seriously the revelations made by Headley on 26/11 and not push them under the carpet. Earlier, he told Clinton that Indias dialogue with Pakistan will be a graduated one as the problems between the two countries cannot be solved in a few sittings.        
	Menons comments today dispelled the notion that home secretary G.K. Pillai had spoken out of turn and unilaterally just before foreign ministers Krishna and Shah Mehmood Qureshi met in Islamabad last week. Pillai had said the ISI was literally controlling and co-ordinating the (Mumbai) attacks from the beginning till the end.         
	Menons observations have sent the message that the Indian government is talking in one voice on terror emanating from Pakistan. Terror groups in South Asia have fused ideologically to train together, Menon said. What we know and what we see suggest that these links or nexus (between terror outfits and official establishment) would not be broken soon. If anything, it is getting stronger.        
	Pakistani foreign office spokesperson Abdul Basit dubbed the comments baseless accusations and yet another manifestation of the Indian establishments propagandistic stance towards Pakistan.

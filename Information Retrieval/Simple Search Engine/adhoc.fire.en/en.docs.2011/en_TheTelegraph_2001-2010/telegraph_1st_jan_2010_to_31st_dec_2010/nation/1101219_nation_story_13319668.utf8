The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat sees in leaks deep US influence
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Karat sees in leaks deep US influence
          OUR BUREAU      
	Dec. 18: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat today said the WikiLeaks revelations had exposed the extent of US interference in Indias domestic political affairs.         
	Karat claimed in Hyderabad that the leaked official cables had revealed how the US embassy had intervened and tried to influence Indian political parties and opinion-makers on the nuclear deal.         
	He said America had also mounted pressure on foreign policy matters such as the attitude towards Iran and Afghanistan.        
	As the WikiLeaks cables from around the world have shown, the United States pursues single-mindedly its imperialist interests. The unfortunate part is the complicity of the Manmohan Singh government in furthering some of these interests of the US, said Karat, who has been described as an extortionist in a cable sent in November 2007 before the nuclear deal was to be debated in Parliament.         
	The CPM appeared pleased with the leaks. One cable states that they have a true partner in the current Indian government led by Manmohan Singh. In contrast, in another cable the US diplomat has made objectionable remarks about the CPI(M) general secretary who is not amenable to their interests, a statement from the politburo said.        
	The statement pointed to another leaked cable that said Indian officials are loath to admit publicly that India and the US have begun co-ordinating foreign policies.        
	The party said the WikiLeaks revelations confirmed their allegations about Americas deep interference in Indias domestic affairs.        
	It confirms our apprehension that the US was pressurising India to weaken and destroy its independent foreign policy, CPM leader Nilotpal Basu said.        
	Choosing to gloss over the reference to Karat as an extortionist, the CPM used the leaks to accuse Manmohan Singh of being complicit in furthering US interests. The cables showed the actual state of Indo-US nuclear relations after the signing of the nuclear deal, the politburo said.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 27: A Tata pipe-making venture in Bengal with Japanese giant Kubota is struggling to make a mark because it has failed to get the Bureau of Indian Standards ISI mark as required under a central order.        
	BIS officials found during an inspection that some ductile iron (DI) pipes at the Kharagpur plant of Tata Metaliks Kubota Pipes Ltd, which had applied for the ISI tag, had quality specifications inscribed on them even before the certification process was over.        
	The violation meant the application got rejected. As the company was tackling the problem, the department of industrial policy and promotion  a Union commerce ministry wing that regulates manufacturing activities  issued a notification making BIS certification mandatory for such pipes, used mostly by civic bodies for water supply.        
	The order  issued after Tata Metaliks Kubota had applied to the BIS  prohibits manufacture, storage, sale and distribution of such pipes without the ISI certification. The rule does not apply to exports, though.        
	The notification snuffed out any hope the firm may have had about being able to sell such pipes in the domestic market without the ISI mark to buyers who trusted the Tata brand enough not to insist on the tag.        
	As a result of the procedural problems, the output at the plant has been less than 4 per cent of its installed capacity since it began commercial production almost a year and a half ago. The factory has produced only 3,991 tonnes of pipes compared with its annual capacity of 110,000 tonnes.        
	Tata Metaliks, Kubota Corporation and Metal One  also a Japanese firm  have pumped Rs 150 crore into the unit.        
	Harsh K. Jha, the MD of Tata Metaliks, admitted performance had been hit. We had made a technical mistake and the BIS rejected our application, he said, adding that a fresh application had been made.         
	Tata Metalikss annual report mentions that the application for the ISI mark was rejected over some procedural mistakes.        
	The inspection during which some pipes were found to have been improperly marked was carried out in June 2009, just a few months after production started at the Kharagpur plant.         
	The BIS had filed a case in a Midnapore court  the bureaus rules require such violations to be brought to court and settled there  which fined the company and some of its officials. The case was disposed of in February this year.        
	But the fresh application for the ISI mark could be made only in August as the bureaus rules allow re-applications six months after penalty.

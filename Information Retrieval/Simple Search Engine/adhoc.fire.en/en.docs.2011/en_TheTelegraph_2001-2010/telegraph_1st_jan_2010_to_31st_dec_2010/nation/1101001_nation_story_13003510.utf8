	New Delhi, Sept. 30: Legal experts today appeared divided over the wisdom of the Allahabad High Court judgment that said the disputed land should be divided equally among three contesting parties, and that the place where the makeshift Ram temple stood belonged to the Hindus.        
	Constitutional expert Rajeev Dhawan said the court had resorted to theology while giving the verdict.        
	It is essentially and effectively in favour of the Hindu groups.... Was there a mosque destroyed in 1992 or not? he said.        
	The court has gone into a question that it is ill-equipped to answer. It is a question of theology.        
	Justice R.S. Sodhi, a former Delhi High Court judge, said: I think this judgment is useless. It is a statuesque judgment. The court has gone into issues of belief, which it should not have. It has actually decided nothing.        
	According to Sodhi, the court should have said that Ayodhya was not a legal issue any more. It is a sentimental and ethical issue. The judiciary has to be very clean and clear, he said.        
	Supreme Court lawyer Prasant Bhushan said the high courts decision was based mainly on peoples faith and what they believed, therefore negating the natural process of justice.        
	It is an absurd judgment. No legal right can be declared on the basis of peoples faith, he said.        
	They (the three judges) have decided on all kinds of irrelevant and emotional issues. There is no legal basis to the ruling that the disputed land should be divided into three parts.        
	Constitutional lawyer Subash Kashyap accused the court of trying to resort to judicial mediation and reconciliation.         
	No ones claim has been fully satisfied. Nobody is entirely a loser, either. The court said the property should be divided because the parties were quarrelling, he said.        
	But he added: If that satisfies different communities, it is good.        
	Some experts favoured the judgment.        
	Senior Supreme Court lawyer Harish Salve said: It is a good judgment. The judges must have given reasons for the decisions. Some people have criticised the verdict... that is atrocious. Unless you read the full judgment, how can you criticise it?        
	Salve, who was the solicitor-general during NDA rule, said: The judges have taken the view that the land was in joint worship and it became joint property and, therefore, they directed the partition of... the joint property.        
	Former law minister and senior advocate Shanti Bhushan said: I welcome this judgment wholeheartedly. It strengthens secularism and paves the way for amity between communities.        
	B.A. Khan, former chief justice of Jammu and Kashmir High Court, said the verdict should be accepted by everybody.         
	No one should use the judgment for narrow political and personal interests, he cautioned.        
	The judgment should be detached from politics. The issue should be settled amicably, keeping the judgment in mind.

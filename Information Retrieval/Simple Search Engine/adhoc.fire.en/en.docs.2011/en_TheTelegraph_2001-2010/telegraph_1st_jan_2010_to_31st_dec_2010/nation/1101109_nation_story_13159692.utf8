The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US raises vital data hopes in PC ministry 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US raises vital data hopes in PC ministry 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: Barack Obamas comment today that Pakistan should act against the terrorists behind 26/11 has cheered the Union home ministry.         
	We will continue to insist to Pakistans leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders are unacceptable, and that terrorists behind Mumbai attacks must be brought to justice, the US President said to long applause in Parliament this evening.         
	Minutes afterwards, a senior home ministry official said: Obama telling Pakistan to take action against terrorists involved in the Mumbai attacks is a big thing.         
	In the run-up to the Presidents visit and during his stay so far, the perception in the security establishment was that the US was yet to send the tough signals to Islamabad. Brainstorming sessions were held on why the US was not sharing intelligence, and the consensus was that it wanted to hold back inputs that proved terrorists links with Pakistan.         
	Days before Obamas arrival, the home secretary said India was disappointed the US had not shared specific intelligence on 26/11 accused David Coleman Headley.         
	For the first time in months, the home ministry appeared upbeat today.         
	There was relief in the security establishment, which hopes that vital information will now be shared.         
	India has sent a formal request to the US authorities to share the contents of a complaint by Headleys wife to federal agents that her husband was an active member of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, sources said.         
	The information could help India re-affirm Headleys link to Lashkar, the Pakistan-based terror group that Delhi blames for 26/11, and Pakistans role in the attacks.         
	While hopes that the information would be shared were dim earlier in the day, by evening the mood had changed. Obamas statement had clearly surpassed expectations in the ministry.

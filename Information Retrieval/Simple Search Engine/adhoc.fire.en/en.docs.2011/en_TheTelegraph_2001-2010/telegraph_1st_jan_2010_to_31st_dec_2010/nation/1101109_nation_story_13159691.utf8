The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mystery of missing Krishna
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mystery of missing Krishna
          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: In the mahabharat that hosted Barack Obama, Krishnas place was in a corner.        
	While the Krishna in the epic controlled a war from a chariot, his mortal namesake S.M. Krishna was missing in action in one of Indias biggest state visits of recent times despite being the external affairs minister.         
	Not that Krishna wasnt present at yesterdays dinner hosted by the Prime Minister or at the delegation-level talks between President Barack Obama and Manmohan Singh at Hyderabad House today. As protocol demanded, he attended both these events.         
	But Krishnas voice was not heard either in the run-up to Obamas trip or during the visit. Nor was he part of any of the big photo-ops, though his cabinet colleagues Pranab Mukherjee, Anand Sharma and Kapil Sibal were seen and heard everywhere.         
	Unfortunately for Krishna, US officials had made his irrelevance evident even before their President landed in Mumbai on Saturday. Highly placed sources told The Telegraph the officials turned down a request from Krishnas office that the minister wanted to call on Obama today.         
	The officials, the sources said, conveyed to the Indian foreign office that Obamas schedule wouldnt permit him to meet Krishna.        
	Not many tears were shed for this slight as the Prime Ministers Office, led by national security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon, and the foreign office, led by foreign secretary Nirupama Rao, ironed out the creases for the presidential visit.        
	For the foreign ministers office, it has been a sharp fall from UPA I when Pranab Mukherjee seemed the monarch of all he surveyed. Yesterday, too, Mukherjee, now finance minister, sat at the high table during the dinner Singh hosted for Obama. Krishna cooled his heels at another.         
	This morning, at Obamas ceremonial reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan, it was Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, commerce minister Sharma and Rao who engaged US officials as everybody waited for Michelle and Obama to arrive. Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar also pitched in, talking to his US counterpart. Krishna stood in a corner.         
	Official sources confirmed that Krishnas office has generally been out of the loop for the Obama visit. While the Prime Minister himself oversees US policy, Menon and Rao did the groundwork for the visit, the sources said.         
	The Prime Ministers keen interest in foreign policy has reduced Krishna to just another minister. Also, Indias US policy has three essential elements  China, Pakistan and trade  and none is handled by Krishna in even normal circumstances, a highly placed government source said.        
	The Prime Minister, assisted by Menon, is in full control of Pakistan, China and US policy, while trade, nuclear or otherwise, is being handled by another select group, the source added.        
	This is in sharp contrast to when Mukherjee was foreign minister. Sources said Mukherjees decisive say in the Congresss political and economic worldview gave him the freedom to engage with America.        
	Although Amitabh Mattoo, professor at the School of International Studies, JNU, said Krishna had evolved from when he first took over the office of foreign minister, sources in South Block and in the Congress said 18 months was a long time and Krishna should have started delivering.         
	Krishna, more of a Karnataka politician, does not have that kind of a profile or know-how. Mukherjee was in control when George Bush visited India in 2006 even though the Prime Minister piloted the nuclear agreement, said a Congress source.         
	A retired foreign secretary, who didnt want to be named for fear of upsetting the foreign ministry, said Krishnas tenure had eroded the influence the foreign ministers office exercised on foreign policy. During Bill Clintons visit, Jaswant Singh was in command as he was Vajpayees point man on foreign policy matters. Krishna, despite having started the US-India strategic dialogue with secretary of state Hillary Clinton, cannot claim any such role in Indo-US engagement, the former bureaucrat added.         
	Many in the Congress and in South Block say Krishnas role during Obamas visit could be a precursor to a possible shift to something less taxing.        
	Krishna, who is over 78 and has led a punishing schedule in the past 15 months travelling to nearly 30 countries, may not mind if that something is not too bad as an alternative.

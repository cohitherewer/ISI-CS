          OUR CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                          Anand Prakash, father of Ruchikas friend Aradhana (PTI)                                  
	Jan. 1: Disgraced former Haryana police chief S.P.S. Rathore today got a weeks interim bail in two cases, while the Centre indicated the CBI might start probing whether he drove Ruchika Girhotra to suicide after molesting her.        
	The Panchkula sessions court granted him bail till January 7, when it will begin hearings in the two cases filed by Ruchikas family alleging the police doctored her inquest report and attempted to murder her brother Ashu at Rathores behest.        
	Central government sources said the CBI might take over the abetment of suicide case against Rathore after the Haryana government registered an FIR. Ashu had filed an application yesterday saying he wanted to file a case of abetment of suicide.        
	The sessions court told Rathore he could not leave the country without its permission or threaten anyone connected with the case, and must make himself available for investigation if the police asked him to.                  Abha, the lawyer and wife of Rathore, leaves the court in Panchkula on Friday. (PTI)       
	Rathores lawyer wife Abha told the court Ruchika was driven to suicide by stepmother Veena. Anand Prakash, father of Ruchikas friend Aradhana, however, said Veena merely looked after the Girhotra children, and that their father Subhash had never remarried.        
	The Girhotras lawyer, Pankaj Bhardwaj, challenged Abha to show the marriage certificate.        
	Abha alleged that the Girhotra and Prakash families had a shady background but were trying to becoming heroes in the media. She claimed Subhash had himself created discrepancies in the inquest report by referring to his daughter as Ruby.        
	She said Ashu had in his earlier court statements never mentioned any attempt to murder him.        
	The judge did not consider Rathores plea for anticipatory bail  since granting one to some extent intrudes into the sphere of the investigation - but accepted the plea of interim bail only till the next date of hearing.        
	He said that if the police arrested Rathore before January 7 in connection with the two FIRs, he will be released on interim bail on furnishing bail bonds of Rs one lakh with one surety of like amount in each case to the satisfaction of the arresting officer.        
	Rathore did not accompany Abha to court today. The street outside the couples house was deserted for the first time since December 21 when Rathore was convicted of molesting Ruchika, then 14, in 1990. The media had since then been camping outside the bungalow.        
	This is the first time in many days we have found it easy to walk down to buy groceries, a neighbour said. Also, no cars are stopping by for a look at his house; so there are no traffic snarls.

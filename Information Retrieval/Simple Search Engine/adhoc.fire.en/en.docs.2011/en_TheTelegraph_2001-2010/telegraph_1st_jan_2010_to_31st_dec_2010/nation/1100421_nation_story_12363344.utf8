The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tharoor twins in tweet battle
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tharoor twins in tweet battle
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                               
	New Delhi, April 20: Exit one Shashi, enter two tweeting Tharoors.        
	Shashi Tharoors twin sons, both journalists and active on Twitter, have come out in support of their embattled father, who was forced to quit as minister over the IPL row.        
	Although both have avoided directly posting messages asking for support for the Kerela MP, their Twitter pages are full of forwarded messages from fans and followers of their Twitter addict dad, who has gone silent on his page.        
	Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies. Dont worry though. Hes gonna rise, says a re-tweet on the pages of both Kanishk and Ishaan, Tharoors Yale-educated sons from his first marriage to academic Tilottama Mukherjee.        
	While Ishaan works for Time magazine in Hong Kong and has written cover stories on Nepal and the Philippines, London-based Kanishk is an editor with openDemocracy, a website for debate on international politics and culture.         
	One of his articles that appeared in The Guardian titled Cheerleaders shame Indian cricket criticised the IPL for its reliance on foreign cheerleaders which he said reinforces unsavoury Indian stereotypes about sex and women.        
	Ishaan has taken his battle a step ahead, asking for support for his father in a website dedicated to reinstate Tharoor. Pledge Your Support for Shashi Tharoor Now, says a message forwarded from Ishaan to Kanishk on April 18, asking his brother to join the site http://supporttharoor.org/ .        
	The website has been lobbying to collect pledges from Netizens since Sunday. By late afternoon yesterday, it had collected nearly 3,000, with its message board flooded with words of support, most of them from Malayalis from India and the Gulf.         
	While the brothers have dwelt on a variety of issues on their Twitter pages  from corporate fraud to Arsenals performance in the European league  their Twitter buddies seem to be interested only in updating them on their father. Tharoor was made a sacrificial lamb reads a tweet on Ishaans page with a link to an article that defends his father.        
	The brothers havent replied to any of the tweets concerning their father, but its clear that the networking site, a favourite of both Tharoor and IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, has become the digital battlefield in this war.        
	Tharoors followers have stood rock solid behind him. Indian Politics will not improve. Only people who even dont know how to write ABCDEF can sustain there. Not for Tharoor, tweeted a loyalist.         
	Another loyalist said the resignation was a black day for democracy and that Tharoor was a victim and a soft target.         
	A group of youngsters is circulating an online petition seeking Tharoors return to the council of ministers and have been gathering signatures, which they plan to submit to President Pratibha Patil.        
	If such loyalty is sweet, enmity can be tweeter.        
	Tharoor and Modi, surely implacable enemies by now, are still on each others followers list on Twitter.        
	While Modi is one among the 7,26,088 followers the former minister has on Twitter, Tharoor is among 74,822 people, including actress Shilpa Shetty and Australian cricketers Shane Warne and Damien Martyn, who are following the IPL commissioner.        
	Its hard to believe that neither Modi nor Tharoor, regular tweeters both, noticed they were still on each others list. What is more likely is that, with the IPL storm still raging, the two are keeping tabs on each other through the site.        
	One Twitterati, however, wasnt able to resist taking a dig at both Tharoor and Modi. Shashi tharoor amp; lalit modi are still following each other on twitter!! how TWEET!! wrote Swathi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pat for Gadkari with dress code tips 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pat for Gadkari with dress code tips 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Nitin Gadkari                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 5: Nitin Gadkari is barely two weeks into his job as BJP chief, but the verdict is already out.        
	The view in the partys 11 Ashoka Road headquarters is Gadkari is a vast improvement on his predecessor Rajnath Singh but would have to mind his Ps and Qs.        
	For starters, his well-wishers want him to discard his trousers, bush shirts and safari suits and get into the more familiar kurta-pyjama before his scheduled visit to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar shortly.        
	And yes, while addressing party workers in the heartland, he needs to purge his lingo of tapori idiom like chatoogiri (sycophancy) and lines from Hindi movies (chhodo kal kee batein) that he has been using at news conferences and interviews.         
	And please, hell be better off not overexposing himself to the media, said a BJP MP who was shocked to see Gadkaris engagements yesterday listed 19 interviews.        
	On the plus side, the view in Ashoka Road is that Gadkari is a person without an ego.        
	Hes Rajnaths antithesis. We dont know what was on Rajnaths mind but an impression was created that he saw himself as (L.K.) Advanis challenger, his equal. In his zeal to establish his supremacy, he tried to sideline established central leaders and paid the price. Gadkari has no such hassles, a source said.        
	Gadkaris morning hours in the central office are spent meeting workers and party officials. His office-bearers have been told if and when necessary, he would come over to meet them, not the other way round.        
	Gadkari has been calling on the three RSS nominees in the BJP apparatus  Ram Lal, Saudhan Singh and V. Satheesh  instead of receiving them in his office.        
	The BJPs biggest worry is surmounting the challenges in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. A Marathi-speaking person is abhorred in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and for good reasons. Gadkaris real test awaits him, a general secretary said.

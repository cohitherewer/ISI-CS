	Bhubaneswar, May 9: Several Maoists, engaged in a gunbattle with security forces in Koraput district since last evening, have been reportedly killed, though no bodies have been recovered so far.        
	The police believe that there were some casualties on the Maoist side during the encounter, chief minister Naveen Patnaik told reporters here before leaving for Delhi this afternoon. He added that details were awaited.        
	We dont know the exact death toll, but there are indications of casualties, admitted Prakash Mishra, additional director-general of police (intelligence).         
	Although no body has been found yet, there are marks to indicate that bodies have been dragged from the site. There are bloodstains at the spot and 12 kit bags have been left behind by the rebels, he said.        
	The joint combing operation by the polices Special Operations Group and elite Grey Hound of Andhra Pradesh began in the Gumandi forest  about 500km southwest of Bhubaneswar last evening.        
	The operation had begun after a tip-off about the presence of at least 40 to 50 rebels in the forest bordering Andhra Pradesh. The gunfight continued till the ultras began retreating, apparently unable to withstand the heavy gunfight.         
	The forces returned yesterday after recovering a powerful claymore mine planted by the rebels. A fresh gunbattle began this morning but no security force personnel was injured in the encounter.        
	In the recent past, seven Maoists were killed in an encounter at Deogarh and two in Sambalpur district, police sources said, adding that the bodies had been recovered.         
	A high alert had been sounded in the state following the Naxalite attack in neighbouring Chhattisgarh in which eight CRPF jawans were killed and 10 others sustained severe injuries yesterday.        
	In a related incident, the guerrillas left behind posters in Bisra near Rourkela threatening to blow up the local police station.         
	The posters  written in Hindi  ends with a lal salaam. Security has been beefed up in the area, said Rourkela superintendent of police Diptesh Patnaik.

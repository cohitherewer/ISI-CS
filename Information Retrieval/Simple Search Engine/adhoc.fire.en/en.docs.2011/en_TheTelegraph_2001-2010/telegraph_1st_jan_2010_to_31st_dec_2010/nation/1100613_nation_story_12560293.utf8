The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fresh plea on Anderson 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Fresh plea on Anderson 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 12: India may soon make another request to the US for Warren Andersons extradition, although government sources admit there is little hope of it being accepted.        
	However, the Congress leadership hopes that making a fresh extradition request would deflect some of the flak the party is facing over Andersons escape from Indian law at a time the party ruled both at the Centre and in Madhya Pradesh.        
	The government is set to ask attorney-general G.E. Vahanvati to reframe Delhis request for Andersons extradition, the sources said.        
	In Calcutta, Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee echoed this. We are trying, Mukherjee told PTI when asked whether India was trying to bring Anderson back to stand trial.        
	India had sent requests for Andersons extradition at least thrice to the US: in 2003, 2005 and 2008. Each time, Washington had turned Delhi down.         
	The US government had said the evidence provided by India did not prove Andersons personal culpability, negligence or liability in the Bhopal gas leak, as required under the India-US extradition treaty of 1999. It said Anderson could not be handed over just because he was then chief executive of Union Carbide.        
	The sources said neither the CBI nor any other investigating agency had any evidence to prove Andersons direct involvement in the worlds worst industrial disaster that killed at least 15,000 people.         
	An extradition request will come up for hearing in a US court, which would unlikely be persuaded by the available evidence to order extradition. So, it is extremely unlikely that a fresh request would meet a fate different from the three previous ones, the sources said.        
	Still, a request is likely to be made. The government is very conscious that it should make this request only after intensive homework to plug the gaps in evidence, a source said.        
	On all three previous occasions, the Indian foreign ministry had asked the investigating agencies to supplement Delhis request with more evidence to prove Andersons personal culpability. However, the CBI could not produce it.        
	After the US turned down the last request in August 2008, Indias then ambassador to Washington, Ronen Sen, had written to the CBI to provide more evidence. The CBI is yet to reply.        
	But this is not about the CBI or the foreign ministry or any other government agency. This entire process has been a collective decision, a source said, adding that neither the CBI nor any other government agency should be singled out for blame.

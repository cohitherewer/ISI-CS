          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Jan. 9: A teenaged Kashmiri died today apparently of bullet wounds he suffered during clashes yesterday between security forces and protesters, triggering more violence as the Valley remained paralysed for the fourth consecutive day.        
	Central Kashmir police chief H.K. Lohia, however, said Inayatullah Khan died in a stampede and no foreign substance had been found in his body, thus ruling out the possibility of the boy being hit by bullets.        
	The death and the subsequent protests came two days after security forces had ended a fidayeen siege that affected normal life in Srinagar.        
	Pro-freedom protests rocked the city the next day, prompting police to use force. Inayatullahs family claimed he was injured during one such protest.        
	Residents said Inayatullah, who succumbed to injuries at Soura Medical Institute today, was injured in CRPF firing at Lal Chowk.        
	He recently passed Class X exams and had joined a computer course. He had gone to attend a computer class when forces opened fire and killed him, said Muiz Altaf, a youth from the Dalgate area where the 17-year-old lived.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Composite dialogue surprise from Pak 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Composite dialogue surprise from Pak 
  - Prodded by army chief, Islamabad tried to include Kashmir, Sir Creek and Siachen on agenda        NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                    
	New Delhi, July 22: One reason for the stalemate during the recent India-Pakistan foreign minister talks was Islamabads demand for resumption of the composite dialogue within six months, government sources said today.        
	Pakistan apparently said the composite dialogues agenda should include Kashmir, Sir Creek and a time-bound demilitarisation of Siachen, issues that India did not want to discuss before Islamabad had shown results against terrorists, the sources said.        
	The unexpected urgency shown by Pakistan to bring these issues on the talks table stemmed from a nudge by the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, intelligence sources here believe.        
	External affairs minister S.M. Krishna and his team were taken by surprise when Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi raised these matters, and did not have ready answers for the Pakistanis, the government sources said. They added that Krishna had gone prepared for talks on trade across the Line of Control, among other things, but not on Sir Creek or Siachen.        
	A day after the foreign ministers meeting, Qureshi had said the Indian delegation had not come mentally prepared and that Krishna had repeatedly been on the phone during the talks to receive foreign policy directions from New Delhi. Krishna, though, has denied the allegation.        
	The sources said India wanted cartographic demarcation on the ground in Siachen before any troops withdrawal could take place.        
	In Siachen, the Line of Control is not marked on the map or the ground beyond a grid point known as NJ 9842. This is the southwestern edge of the glacier that India has controlled since 1984.         
	India says the line of demarcation from that point should travel straight northwards along the watershed, which Islamabad disputes.        
	Qureshi had appeared to partly blame home secretary G.K. Pillai for the failure of the talks, and angered the Indian political establishment by seemingly comparing Pillai with Lashkar-e-Toiba founder Hafiz Saeed.        
	Krishna has in a TV interview denied that Pillais comment on the eve of the talks about ISI involvement in 26/11  affected the outcome of his meeting with Qureshi but said the timing of the bureaucrats remarks could raise questions.        
	Pillais remarks about the extent of the ISIs involvement were reportedly based on the interrogation of David Coleman Headley, the suspected Lashkar operative in US custody to whom India has had limited access.        
	Reports have said the foreign ministry has complained to the Prime Ministers Office that it was kept in the dark on what Headley had revealed, but government sources have disputed the purported South Block claim.        
	They said that when National Investigation Agency sleuths questioned Headley in Chicago, a foreign ministry representative took down notes.         
	A briefing was also given to the Indian ambassador to the US, the sources said.        
	A report on the interrogation was received by the Prime Ministers Office and the external affairs ministry, a source said. Information was shared at every stage.        
	Government sources also said that during the bilateral home minister-level talks on the sidelines of the Saarc meeting of interior ministers in Islamabad last month, all but one of the meetings between the two sides included a representative from the foreign ministry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Babus shy of ID project
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Babus shy of ID project
          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, May 16: Indias elite babus are balking at working for a landmark government project that private-sector executives and Harvard scholars are queuing to join.        
	The Unique Identity Authority of India (UIDAI), which aims to provide 16-digit ID numbers to Indias billion-plus people, is short of IAS officers to man key posts a year after its inception.        
	Repeated requests from the department of personnel and training to state chief secretaries to send IAS officers on assignment to the authority, headed by IT czar Nandan Nilekani, have brought little result.        
	In contrast, the Nilekani brand is attracting professionals from fields such as technology, law, policy, marketing, social sciences and administration, whose employers are willing to pay them during their one-year sabbatical with the ID authority.        
	Applications for internships are piling up from foreign and Indian postgraduate students and research scholars in Harvard, Wharton, the IIMs and top Indian tech schools, eager to join a project conceived on a scale never attempted anywhere.        
	The babus have their own problems. Sources said the joint secretary-level officers that the authority needs are not comfortable with the idea of working in a start-up that may not immediately offer them the usual paraphernalia, such as their own offices and staff.        
	These officials are used to a level of comfort and a pecking order that they may not find at the UIDAI, a government source said.        
	He added that some of the babus probably also fear a loss of clout, explaining: There is also the factor of working under Nilekani, a world-renowned professional. Many fear they might get overshadowed.        
	Although the ID authority is happy recruiting professionals, Nilekani wants IAS officers to handle key jobs such as networking with government agencies. Bureaucrats understand government systems better, the source said.        
	But at its headquarters in New Delhi, the authority, recently renamed Aadhar (Foundation), has been able to find only four joint secretaries when it needs seven. The shortage is worse at the eight regional centres, to be headed by deputy directors-general who should be joint secretaries. Only two of the eight have DDGs.        
	The government has allowed the ID authority to hire private sector professionals as consultants on short tenures such as one year. Since the authority will be chartering unknown territories in... technology, logistics and computing, it is necessary that it has access to world-class professionals, UIDAIs website says.         
	The ID numbers are likely to start rolling out from August.

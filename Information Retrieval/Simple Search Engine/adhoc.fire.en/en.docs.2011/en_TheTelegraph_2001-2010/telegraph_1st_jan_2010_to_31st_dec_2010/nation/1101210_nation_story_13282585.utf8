The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP mocks one-man cover-up
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP mocks one-man cover-up
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Arun Jaitley      
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: The BJP has rejected the one-member committee appointed by the government to probe the sale of telecom licences, saying it amounted to abdication of parliamentary responsibility.         
	In a late evening briefing, Arun Jaitley said the announcement of the decision outside Parliament when it was in session amounted to a gross breach of parliamentary privilege and added the governments move buttressed the Oppositions demand for a joint parliamentary committee (JPC).         
	It was an unprecedented decision to assign the probe to a retired judge. Not all the issues in this case are judicially determinable, the Opposition leader of the Rajya Sabha said, adding that an panel appointed by the executive was not a commission of inquiry that could have conducted a public hearing.        
	We want a JPC because right from assigning a particular portfolio to a particular party and to a particular individual at that, to the working of lobbies for formulating a policy meant to foster fraudulence and entail losses to the nation in order to benefit a few individuals, all these subjects can be looked into only by a parliamentary committee. These issues are not judicial or auditing and accounting ones, stressed Jaitley.        
	He said the BJP had no problem if the probe went back to 2001 (when its government was in power) or even 1994, when the telecom sector opened up. That is secondary because we have no difficulty with when the JPC should start investigating, he said.        
	Jaitley mocked the UPA coalition as a cover-up government. If it has one strength, it lies in its ability at cover-ups, whether it is in covering up the CBIs functioning and appointments or the appointment of the CVC.        
	He warned the NDAs crusade against corruption would not cease with this Parliament session. We will take the fight to the streets, the BJP, the NDA and whoever else wishes to join us. We will go to the people, he said.        
	Asked to comment on the Ratan Tata-Rajeev Chandrashekhar spat, Jaitley said, We dont believe in dignifying the fight between two corporate individuals. We dont intend getting involved in it either. Let a JPC go into it.

	New Delhi, Aug. 30: Three premier universities have violated rules on using and storing radioactive material in a kind of negligence similar to Delhi Universitys sale of such a substance to a scrap dealer leading to a labourers death.         
	The revelations have been made by a UGC panel set up in the aftermath of the April radioactive leak in Delhi.        
	The committee found the violations at the University of Hyderabad, Pune University and Osmania University, also in Hyderabad. All three universities had procured Cobalt 60  the radioactive substance traced to Delhi University in the April leak  from Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd decades ago.        
	While the University of Hyderabad had taken permission from the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board to procure the material, the other two had kept the substance without the boards knowledge.        
	None of the institutions was using such material but had stored them in labs. The Atomic Energy Act requires institutions to inform the atomic energy board about the use and availability of radioactive substances through annual reports. None of the institutions had done so, the committee has said in its report.        
	The committee was set up on the instruction of HRD minister Kapil Sibal after the Delhi leak. Headed by G.K. Rath of AIIMS, it was asked to examine larger safety issues and frame guidelines.        
	At the three universities, the panel found they had not even put up radiation warning signs in front of the rooms where such materials were stored.

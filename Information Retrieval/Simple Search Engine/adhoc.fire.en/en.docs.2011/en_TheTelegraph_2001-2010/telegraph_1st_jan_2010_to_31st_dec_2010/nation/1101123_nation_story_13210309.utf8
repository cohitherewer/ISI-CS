          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                        Ravi Inder Singh      
	New Delhi, Nov. 22: A Bengal cadre IAS officer, now a director in the Union home ministry, was today detained by Delhi police for allegedly leaking sensitive information of commercial value.        
	Sources said the offices and home of Ravi Inder Singh, 43, were raided around 1pm by Delhi polices special cell on a tip-off from the home ministry. He could be suspended this week on instructions from the personnel and training ministry, the sources said.        
	Singh, a 1994 batch officer, was brought in as director in the internal security  1 division this February. The division handles, among other things, the row over access to BlackBerry codes that would enable the government to intercept corporate emails and chat services.        
	There was suspicion that information pertaining to commercial interests (was leaked). He mishandled information that could be of commercial value, a source said. But it had nothing to do with national security.        
	The source declined comment on whether the leak pertained to BlackBerry. He said Research in Motion, which manufactures the smartphones, was only a client of the home ministry and it would be unfair to say anything before a police probe.        
	Singh is the second IAS officer in the home ministry to come under glare. On April 29, . Ravi, joint secretary (disaster management) was arrested by the CBI for allegedly accepting a Rs 25 lakh bribe from fixers in the liquor business to transfer the administrator of the Union territory of Daman. Ravi was a Gujarat cadre officer of the 1983 batch.        
	Sources said the raids on both Singh and Ravi were conducted at the behest of people at the highest level. They said such steps were likely to continue so the government could send the signal that corruption will not be tolerated.        
	Singh was Cooch Behar district magistrate from 2004 to 2006. In September 2005, violence had erupted in the Bengal district during a hunger strike called by the Greater Cooch Behar Peoples Association to demand statehood. Five persons had been killed, of which three were policemen. Two Cooch Behar party supporters died in police firing.

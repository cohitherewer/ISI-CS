The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak sees pressure on Singh 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pak sees pressure on Singh 
                            
	Islamabad, Oct. 22 (PTI): Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said he believed a breakthrough was eluding the peace process with India because of domestic pressures faced by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	I think the Prime Minister (Singh) could not stand the pressure within Parliament and India, Gilani said.         
	I have had some productive exchanges with my Indian counterpart. I am disappointed that the promise of those meetings has not yet been realised. Full resumption of the dialogue process has yet to happen, Gilani told members of the Diplomatic Correspondents Association of Pakistan.         
	The only way forward for India and Pakistan is dialogue, Gilani added. Lasting peace and security in South Asia can only be achieved with a sincere effort.

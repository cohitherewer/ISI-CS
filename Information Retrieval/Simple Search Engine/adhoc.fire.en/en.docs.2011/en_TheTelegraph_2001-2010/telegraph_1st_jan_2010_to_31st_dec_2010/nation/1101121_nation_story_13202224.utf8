          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, Nov. 20: Want to punish your wife for walking out? Fake your own murder.        
	A man in his forties went to a graveyard, dug out a body, chopped off the arms and then went into hiding to give the impression that he had been bumped off  all to take revenge on his former wife and the man she had eloped with.        
	He almost succeeded in his plan to implicate the two before police found out the arms belonged to a woman.        
	Mohammad Shah, 43, is now cooling his heels in jail. His former wife Rukhsana, in her twenties, now lives with Shabir Ahmad Khan, 29, whom she has married.        
	Shah, a labourer in Anantnag, and Rukhsana had been married several years and had no children. The marriage started falling apart after Shah brought the younger man from Kupwara home one day.         
	The two had met during last years Amarnath Yatra where both worked as porters.         
	Soon, Rukhsana and Shabir fell in love.        
	Shabir Ahmad, station house officer in Bijebehara, Anantnag, said Rukhsana eloped with Shabir. Brought back by police and returned to her husband, the patch-up didnt last as Rukhsana insisted on a divorce.         
	Rukhsana is also in her twenties. She appeared before a judge, pleading that she didnt want to live with Shah, and succeeded in getting a divorce, a police officer in Anantnag said, adding that Rukhsana later married Shah. That was about eight months ago.        
	Shah never reconciled to the betrayal and decided to punish the two. And the best way, he reckoned, would be to fake his murder and throw the dismembered arms somewhere near Shabirs house so that the suspicion would fall on the young couple.        
	We found two upper limbs beside the house of Shabir recently. An identity card of Shah and his pheran (a cloak) were also found. Obviously, Rukhsana and her new husband were the prime suspects. Since Shah was missing, it appeared it was he who had been murdered, said an officer.         
	Investigators, however, became suspicious when they found the arms were of a woman. We found Shah was alive and hiding somewhere, the officer said.        
	Arrested, Shah confessed he had gone to a graveyard in Bijebehara and dug out a newly buried body of a 25-year-old woman. He chopped off her arms and buried the body again, the officer said. He then travelled to Kupwara, some 200km from Anantnag, carrying the arms.        
	Shah, the officer said, told them he wanted to take revenge on his former wife and her new husband.        
	Anantnag police chief B.A. Khan said a case of cheating and desecration had been filed against Shah.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | King versus nobles on Kashmir chessboard
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      King versus nobles on Kashmir chessboard

	Baramulla, July 21: The realm lies writhing in uneasy paralysis, its rulers play musical chairs in their sanitised mansions, immersed in obsessions over which tweedledee to drop, which tweedledum to pick.        
	Baramulla, like many a simmering township across the Valley, has eluded embattled peacekeepers for months and coughed up bodybag after bodybag, each the shivered spine of a new wave of anger and avenging.         
	A teenaged brickbat boy plunges into the Jhelum fleeing a police chase and drowns. When his body is fished out two days later, his funeral march turns into a tumultuous column sweeping across the river bridge from the old Baramulla hotbed, leaping to raze everything in sight. It eventually has to be fired upon and another boy dies; the flaming belly of one tragedy begets another, strife ripples on in ever expanding circles engulfing dateline after ravaged dateline: violent closure in Anantnag, a bilious spew of acrimony in Sopore, debilitating blockades in Tral, Shopian and Pampore, daily eruptions in Srinagars combustible downtown, a toxic pall stretched low across the Valley. Its dripping curses.        
	But Gupkar is a faraway world well insulated from the ruinous eddies swirling beyond its girded fencing of mortar and metal. A single alley, no more, that floats up along the spur of Srinagars Zabarwan Hill and forks left and right into Kashmirs many formidable addresses  Omar and Farooq Abdullah, Mufti and Mehbooba Saeed, mighty generals of the army, furtive intelligence spook-heads and police bosses, famed guest-houses for arriving VVIPs and notorious torture chambers for wretched commoners, and not too far along the road, the Governors majestic palace.        
	Gupkar is home to a succession of those who have taken turns ruling  or misruling  the Valley down many decades, down right from the imperial era of Maharaja Hari Singh whose summer chalet looms atop a bump overlooking the Dal Lake. Today it is the theatre of events abjectly symptomatic of its remove from reality. Theyre playing kings and pawns among themselves with all the intensity of intrigue that attends court games.        
	The head of the National Conference, Kashmirs divine right party, is about to roll, they say. Itll be the head of the redoubtable Farooq Abdullah, ordered asunder by his son Omar.         
	The marquees are being pitched and when the partys working committee meets on Thursday the crown that Sheikh Abdullah had placed on Farooqs temple could well be lifted and placed on anothers.         
	Farooq himself is resisting his beheading; in an obvious move to pre-empt his removal he told Radio Kashmir late this evening that he did not intend to step down from the NC presidentship. But the knives in the Omar faction are still out for him and party bosses were meeting till late to sort out differences over leadership.        
	Who could the new man be? Nobody knows, but if it is to be a historic beheading, it could be an equally historic crowning  for the first time in its history, the National Conference may appoint a chief from outside the Sheikh family. Its isnt a move thats going uncontested; lesser scions of the Sheikh family, among them Omars uncle and MLA Mustafa Kamal, are known to be unhappy.         
	But thats Omars will, the whisper steaming off the Gupkar bush suggests. This is the new leader establishing his own new order in the National Conference, a party that hell dictate to rather than be dictated by it. Change is the order of things and changes can bring fresh energy, but is this the time to be obsessed with re-ordering the party? asks an irate NC leader, Omar is playing chess-chess with his nobles, impervious to the siege all around him.        
	But theres more churn in the works, more sinister whispers swirl in Srinagars low grey skies. Omar, the informed tell you, is also about to banish some long-serving elders from the establishment. Abdul Rahim Rather from the finance ministry, along with a few others in the cabinet, and Sheikh Nazir from the general secretaryship of the National Conference. Both are of Sheikh-era vintage, both were odd ends in Omars scheme, the time for both, it would seem, is up.        
	Rather, widely respected and deeply imbued with experience Omar seldom found use for, appears to have been well set up for slaughter.         
	An unsubstantiated leak in a leading Srinagar daily a few days ago spoke of a minister having purchased a villa worth an astounding Rs 120 crore in Dubais super-elite Palm Jumeira. The story named no names, it only said the minister in question had recently returned from Dubai. Cheeky plot. It gave Rather away as the bearer of the Rs 120 crore taint without attracting libel because Rather was the only Kashmiri minister recently in Dubai. Rather has denied the charge, of course, and dared anyone to prove him guilty of corruption but the nail into his reputation  and probably his ministerial berth  has been driven.        
	Should Rather go  or even Farooq Abdullah  the veterans will go fairly unlamented. Whos to bother about a little blue bloodshed in Gupkar when all the Valley is in gory outcry?

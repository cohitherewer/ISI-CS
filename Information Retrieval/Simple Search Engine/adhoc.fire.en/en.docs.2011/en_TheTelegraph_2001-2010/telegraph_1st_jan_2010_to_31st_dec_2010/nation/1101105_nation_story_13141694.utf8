	New Delhi, Nov. 4 (PTI): The Supreme Court has chided the National Consumer Redressal Commission for quashing a Rs 5-lakh compensation awarded to a boy whose left leg had to be amputated for gangrene following alleged medical negligence.        
	A two-judge bench found that the apex consumer forum had decided to quash the compensation, awarded by the Gujarat consumer commission, despite a grave omission by the doctor, Mayur H. Mehta.        
	It said the national commission should have taken note of Dr Mehtas failure to produce the case details for six years, and not gone merely by vascular surgeon Ashwin Bhamars deposition that there could be 10 reasons for a person to develop gangrene.        
	The case papers/bed ticket maintained by the hospital... would have disclosed the line of treatment adopted by him (Dr Mehta). Why did he (Dr Mehta) not produce those papers? the apex court said.        
	It asked the national commission to re-examine the 16-year-old case and dispose of it within six months.        
	Marghesh K. Parikh had been admitted to Dr Mehtas hospital on October 31, 1994, with complaints of loose motion. He was administered glucose first through his right shoulder and then through the left foot, which developed gangrene.        
	Dr Mehta referred him to a certain Dr Chudasama, who treated the boy without success. The patient was taken to Dr Bhamar in Vadodara on November 5, 1994, and was referred to Bhailal Amin Hospital where his left leg was amputated below the knee.        
	The state consumer commission awarded the compensation rejecting Dr Mehtas plea that the patient had been brought to his hospital in a critical condition.

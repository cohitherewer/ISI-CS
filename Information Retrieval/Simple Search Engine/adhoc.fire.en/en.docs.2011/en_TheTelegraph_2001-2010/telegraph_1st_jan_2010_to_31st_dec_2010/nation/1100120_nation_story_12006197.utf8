	Calcutta, Jan. 19: It was a show like no other that Calcutta had ever seen. But it had nothing to do with the size of the crowds or the number of high-profile leaders in attendance.        
	Everyone agreed that the milling crowds that turned up for Jyoti Basus last journey were spontaneous, highly emotional and certainly not the organised kind that is so common for political rallies.

	But Basus final journey may have turned the communist tradition on its head  the peoples leader taking his last bow, lying in state on an Indian Army gun carriage and then with the police guns booming in a farewell salute.        
	And, of course, in what could be deemed a sacrilege by communist purists, the red flag replaced by the Indian national flag.         
	The armys gun carriage, piloted by motorcycle-borne policemen in military-like uniform, the rows of khaki-clad men marching in step and the booming of the guns made it a show far removed from the last journey of a political leader, least of all a communist.         
	The regalia is easier associated with state leaders or even military dictators. In the Indian political scene, the pomp and ceremony would have gladdened the hearts of a Mayavati or a Jayalalithaa.         
	The ever-multiplying cut-outs on Calcuttas walls of Mamata Banerjee, the CPMs bete noire, who stayed away from the event, are a different matter because it is the Left which claims to put the party above personalities.

	The presence of Sonia Gandhi, L.K. Advani and other dignitaries from other shores, including Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, enhanced the ambience and suggestion of a state funeral.         
	It was tantalising to ponder if the show also marked the end of another communist tradition  the disapproval of deification or personality cult. Even now, the Bengal CPM observes the birth anniversary of only one leader  Muzaffar Ahmad, whose name also marks a rather obscure street in Garden Reach.         
	But the adoration of Basu that todays event exhibited, along with proposals to name a street after him or set up a museum at Indira Bhavan, would suggest that he might change the party in unusual ways even after his death.         
	That the show might raise embarrassing questions was a possibility that seemed to have bothered the party even as it went on. Thats why the party was keen to avoid its responsibility for at least the armys involvement.        
	The state home secretary had earlier said that the suggestion had come from the Centre. But it was known today that the chief secretary had instructed the resident commissioner of the Bengal government in New Delhi to take up with the Union home ministry the possibility of a military funeral.         
	The chief secretarys letter asked for two things: a two-day state mourning and a military funeral, the resident commissioner, Bhaskar Kuble, told The Telegraph over the phone from New Delhi.        
	It seems incredible that the chief secretary did so without the chief ministers approval. The CPM, however, maintained that the party had not initiated the move, but it was obvious that it didnt say no to it either.         
	That raises the obvious political question: did the CPM expect the show to cause a sympathy wave and to use Basus memory to recover lost ground in Bengal? The partys leaders are apparently divided on whether the Basu wave would last long enough or would be strong enough till the next round of polls.        
	For many people walking in the funeral procession, though, it was a time of new resolutions and a pledge for a fightback.         
	It wasnt Sonias presence or Mamatas absence which carried the most significant political message. Mamata was being herself  the ever-uncompromising fighter against the CPM. Also, she was clearly unhappy with the Congress and the UPA government for what she thought was an unwarranted amount of generous gestures towards Basu.        
	To Congress leaders, Sonia was being proper and correct and her presence was an acknowledgement of the partys show of gratitude to both Basu and the CPM for making the first UPA government possible. Basu, in fact, wanted his party to join it, but the party at least supported it from outside.         
	But neither Sonia nor Mamata was the point of the political story. That point is all about the very un-communist nature of the spectacle and what it could mean for the party and, of course, for Basus ultimate image.

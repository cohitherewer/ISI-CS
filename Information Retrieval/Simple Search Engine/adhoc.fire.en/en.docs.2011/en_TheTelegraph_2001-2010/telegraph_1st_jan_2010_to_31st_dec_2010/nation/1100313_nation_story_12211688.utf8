The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Peta asks Maoists to spare dogs
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Peta asks Maoists to spare dogs
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, March 12: Known for their campaigns involving celebrities worldwide, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) has now appealed to Maoists to stop killing dogs.        
	Animals claim no nation, possess no weapons and hold no political aspirations. They are not a party to the Maoists battle. Yet dogs are being killed in your area of influence. For the dogs, there is no Geneva Convention and no peace talks  they are dependent on your mercy.        
	This is part of a letter that Peta sent to the outlawed CPI(Maoist) leadership operating in the Junglemahals Lalgarh area in Bengal in border with Jharkhand and Jamui and Champaran regions.        
	PETA, India, senior campaign co-ordinator Nikunj Sharma said the organisation had received reports of Naxalites going on a killing spree of dogs in at least 1,100 villages in Lalgarh, their self-declared guerrilla zone, and several villages in Bihar.        
	According to Peta reports, the Maoist leadership has issued directives to dog owners in particular and villagers in general to poison pet/stray dogs to death.        
	The reason behind guerrilla squads turning hostile towards canines is that they roam in packs in the hinterlands dotted with houses without boundaries and bark at the sight of armed rebels drawing attention of security forces or waking up villagers.        
	It is also because Bengal, according to Peta sources, has stepped up security around the Junglemahal region and Bihar  it is constructing roads in Jamui and Champaran  has deployed special auxiliary force (SAP) and CRPF jawans.        
	Sources in the security forces said they were yet to investigate if the Maoists were killing dogs.         
	But it is quite possible, as dogs have always barked at the sight of thieves, thugs and bandits. Criminal elements always treat dogs as their enemy and there is nothing unusual if the rebels are targeting them, said a senior police officer.        
	Sharma said the Maoists had already killed thousands of dogs in Lalgarh, Jamui and Champaran.         
	Peta believes that the Lalgarh villagers must be angry at the Maoists targeting dogs for Lalgarh has a tribal population, who are fond of dogs and other animals since ages, the statement reads.

	Jaipur, Dec. 8: MP Meena Singh wants a train for her sons baraat, and her colleague N.K. Singh got his son married in a Rajasthan palace.         
	Jodhpurs Umaid Bhavan played host to the wedding of Abhijeet Singh, the son of N.K. Singh, Bihars high-profile bureaucrat-turned-politician. Abhijeet, a management graduate, married Viveka Kumari, the princess of Idar principality in Gujarat this evening.        
	This is the second extravagant wedding in the Rajasthan city. On November 18, Jodhpurs own prince, Shivraj Singh, got married to princess Gayatri Kumari of Askot.         
	However, unlike his Janata Dal (United) colleague Meena Singh, N.K. Singh did not have to hire a full train to bring the wedding guests to Rajasthan.        
	Most of them flew in  some on chartered flights.         
	On the guest list were Planning Commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia, minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, civil aviation minister Praful Patel, Congress leader Digvijay Singh and Nagaland governor Nikhil Kumar. Former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, herself a princess, was also present.         
	Business tycoons Mukesh Ambani and wife Nita, Airtel boss Sunil Mittal and ICICI Banks Chanda Kochar were seen.         
	BJP leader Arun Jaitley was scheduled to drop in but Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, considered close to the grooms father, was unlikely to attend, sources said, because of the ongoing Assembly session.        
	N.K. Singh is the son of late T.P. Singh, who was in the erstwhile Indian Civil Service and was the son-in-law of one of the richest zamindars of Purnea. The MPs sisters  Krishna and Radha  are IAS officers.         
	Both bride and groom have connections with the Jodhpur royal family.         
	Abhijeets mother Prem Kumari is the daughter of Maharaja Hari Singh, an uncle of Maharaja Gaj Singh of Jodhpur. Viveka hails from Gujarat, the home state of Gaj Singhs mother, Krishna Kumari.

	Amitabh Bachchan is set to become Gujarats brand ambassador.         
	I thank you for accepting my offer and hope we shall be able to work together for the betterment of Gujarat, the actor has written to chief minister Narendra Modi.         
	Last month, Bachchan had offered to give his voice and face for promoting Gujarat tourism, following which Modi had written to the actor whose friend Amar Singh has resigned from key posts in the Samajwadi Party.         
	In a text message to The Telegraph, Bachchan confirmed he had agreed to become the brand ambassador.

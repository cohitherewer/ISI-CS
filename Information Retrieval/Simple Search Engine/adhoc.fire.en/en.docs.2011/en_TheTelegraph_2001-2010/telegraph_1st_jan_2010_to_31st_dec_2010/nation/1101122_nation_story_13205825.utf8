The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Deb softens on Rajarhat
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Deb softens on Rajarhat
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 21: Gautam Deb today struck a conciliatory note in his face-off with Mamata Banerjee over Rajarhat, saying he is ready to rectify mistakes in land acquisitions for the showpiece township.        
	Mamata Banerjee is a respected minister of the central government. We request her to point out our mistakes, if any, at Rajarhat. I will earnestly accept her suggestions. We will rectify our mistakes. I urge her not to resort to any destructive activities in Rajarhat, the Bengal housing minister said in Basirhat.        
	The conciliatory tone came a day after the railway minister and Trinamul chief threatened more protests against what she claims are forced land takeovers by Deb-headed developer Hidco in Rajarhat. If further attempts are made to acquire land from farmers for the township project, I shall oppose it tooth and nail. I am asking people to resist the move with all their might, Mamata said.        
	Debs remarks today also appeared like a climbdown against the backdrop of his own fiery statement last Tuesday when he had dared the railway minister to extend her 10 per cent land-return formula to Singur.         
	 Why only Rajarhat? Why not Singur, why not Nandigram and why not all railway projects, he had asked, days after Mamata had addressed a rally in Rajarhat and threatened court cases.        
	Debs apparent mellowing contrasted with the strident tone of his own boss, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, at a rally in Rajarhat today.         
	The township project is a reality. How can the development be stopped here? Bhattacharjee asked.

	Rayagada, June 3: A suspected Maoist, arrested during a search operation, died in police custody in Orissas Rayagada district, official sources said today.        
	Pidira Kadesika, 35, was picked up by the special operation group from the forests of Tugapalanka, about 100km from here.        
	Pidira suddenly fell ill and complained of breathing difficulties, additional superintendent of police Santosh Mall said.        
	He was immediately admitted to the district hospital where doctors declared him dead, the officer said.        
	The cause of his death is not known, the police said, ruling out physical torture during interrogation, which they added lasted for about 15 minutes. There was no external injury on his body, Mall added.         
	Deputy inspector-general of police (south-west range) Sanjeeb Panda said the suspected rebel might have died because of dehydration.         
	The body has been sent for post-mortem and the police are trying to find the cause of his death, Mall added.        
	A huge quantity of explosives, a country-made gun, four live cartridges, some banners and posters were found on Pidira, the police said.        
	Communication between Muniguda and Chandrapur, both in Rayagada, has been disrupted as Maoists fell trees to protest Pidiras death.

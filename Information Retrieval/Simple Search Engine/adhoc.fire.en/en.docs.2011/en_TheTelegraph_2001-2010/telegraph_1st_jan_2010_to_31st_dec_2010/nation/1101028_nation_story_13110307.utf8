The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata vow: zero collision
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mamata vow: zero collision
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee at the economic editors conference in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, Oct. 27: Railway minister Mamata Banerjee today said anti-collision devices would be installed in all trains in the country within a year.        
	We plan to install anti-collision devices (ACD) in all trains across the country in the next six months to a year. After this, there would be zero accidents because of collision. The safety of passengers is the utmost priority of the railways, she said at an economic editors conference.        
	Two crashes in Bengal in May between the Jnaneswari Express and a goods train near Jhargram, and in July between the Uttar Banga and Vananchal expresses at Sainthia  had left over 200 people dead.        
	Mamata spoke of the Metro train derailment in Calcutta last Thursday, the first time such a thing has happened in 26 years. Hinting that it might have been caused by sabotage, she questioned why railway property should be targeted without naming anyone. But she added political parties should do politics.        
	The ACD, designed and developed by Konkan Railways, has long been projected as ideal to check collisions. But installation of the device has been delayed as the railway board keeps changing its specifications. Mamata had given the project the go-ahead in January 2000 after riding a train on which the ACD was being tested.        
	Railway board chairman Vivek Sahai said preliminary test-runs in the Chennai-Arrakonam section of Southern Railways had thrown up 17-18 bugs in the ACD software. A second round of trials is due in mid-November.        
	It will cost Rs 2,500 crore for the devices to be installed across the country. It will cost about Rs 15 lakh to be installed in locos and around Rs 7 lakh per station, he said. There are about 7,000 locos and as many stations in the country.        
	The ACDs would first be installed on trains of the Southern, South Central and the South Western Railways, Sahai said. Although the devices had been successfully used by Konkan Railways and the North-East Frontier Railway, we need to carry out tests on multiple tracks, with automatic signalling and other parameters... as Konkan, etc., are single-track lines, he said.        
	The ACD is fitted into the trains engine and works on the global positioning system (GPS). It emits a signal when a train is within 1.5km of another, helping both drivers to slow down and avoid a collision. It is a self-acting microprocessor-based data communication device.        
	Mamata said the railways would shortly come out with a smart card. It would be a composite card that can be used in Metro, suburban and passenger trains as well as for e-ticketing. We are negotiating with SBI, she said.        
	Sahai said the railways had held talks with the State Bank of India. The concept is at a preliminary stage. We want the smart card linked to a bank account or be the refill type, which could be used to buy tickets across different modes of rail transport.        
	A similar concept had been tried out on Mumbai suburban trains and the Delhi Metro, he said. The idea now was to take it to the national level.

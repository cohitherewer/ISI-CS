          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: The HRD ministry has finalised a model for involving the private sector in setting up 2,500 schools in public-private partnership, with a provision for management quota up to 50 per cent.         
	Each school will have up to 2,000 seats  of which 1,000 will be for the management  and the government will take care of the expenses of 980 students. The money will match what the government spends on a student of a Kendriya Vidyalaya (KV). At present, that figure comes to around Rs 10,000 annually.        
	The school can charge as much it deems fit from students admitted under the management quota. The model has been finalised and has been sent to the Expenditure Finance Committee (of the finance ministry) for approval, HRD minister Kapil Sibal told The Telegraph.        
	The private partner will have to purchase land and construct the school building. Each such school will have Classes from VI to XII and will be affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education. The government can sponsor up to 140 students in each class.        
	The schools will have to utilise 25 per cent of the sponsorship money for infrastructure, while the rest can be spent on salaries and other items.        
	The model, drawn up after consultations with education experts and stakeholders, will be valid for 10 years, after which the government will gradually reduce sponsoring students and stop it completely by 2027-28.        
	The state governments will play the role of facilitator in locating land and creating conveyance facilities. Each school will be located in the block headquarters.        
	The 2,500 schools are part of the Model School scheme being implemented by the government. Under the plan, 6,000 model schools will be set up across the country during the ongoing Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-12). The government will build 3,500 schools entirely on its own.

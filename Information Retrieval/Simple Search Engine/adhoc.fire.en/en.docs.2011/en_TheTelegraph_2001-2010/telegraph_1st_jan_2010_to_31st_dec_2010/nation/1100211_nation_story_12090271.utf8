          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 10: Residents of Orissa, especially students appearing for exams, will be pleased to know that henceforth they will be spared power cuts in the evenings.        
	A decision to this effect was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik today to review the power situation in the state. Sources said the chief minister had asked officials not to effect power cut in evening hours, keeping in view the problems of students in preparing for examinations.        
	It was decided that the shortfall during the peak hours would be managed with hydro power.        
	According to sources in the energy department, the state has been passing through a power crisis because of decrease in hydro electricity generation following fall in water level in all major reservoirs. The state government had decided to reserve water for irrigation by scaling down hydro power generation.        
	In order to meet the shortfall of around 300-400MW, the energy department was effecting power cut in the morning and evening hours.         
	Naveen also directed the officials to expedite the ongoing thermal power projects besides the proposed 2,000MW thermal plant to be set up by Orissa Thermal Power Corporation Limited, a joint venture of state-owned Orissa Hydro Power Corporation and Orissa Mining Corporation, at Rengali in Angul district at an estimated cost of Rs 8,250 crore.

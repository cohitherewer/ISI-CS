                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Persi(an) gaffe
                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: Persi oops! It was a slip of the tongue but Manmohan Singh recovered fast.         
	At the joint media conference with the US President on Monday, Prime Minister Singh said: We (Obama and he) had a detailed exchange on the situation in our extended region, including East Asia, Persi..., Afghanistan, Pakistan and West Asia.        
	The gaffe seemed to suggest the leaders had a discussion on Iran  not unanticipated. But to admit that in public would have caused strains between Delhi and Tehran.

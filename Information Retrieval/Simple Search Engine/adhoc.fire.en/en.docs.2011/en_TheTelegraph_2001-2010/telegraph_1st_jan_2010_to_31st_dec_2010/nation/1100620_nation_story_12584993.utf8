	Hyderabad, June 19: Two Hindu militants accused of involvement in the 2007 Mecca mosque explosion have been sent to judicial custody, more than a month after their arrest in another blast as fresh leads threw up a link between the two.        
	A defence scientist also came under the glare amid suspicions that he sheltered one of the accused militants.        
	CBI sources said the scientist, who works with defence organisation DRDO in the city, was being questioned on whether he also provided the logistics for the blast.        
	Nine persons died when a bomb planted under a marble bench inside the Hyderabad mosque went off as worshippers were finishing their Friday prayers on the afternoon of May 18, 2007.        
	Five more died later when police opened fire to control a mob that had gone berserk.        
	A metropolitan magistrate on Thursday sent the two alleged militants, Devender Gupta and Lokesh Sharma of the Hindu outfit Abhinav Bharat, to custody for two weeks, three years after some 100 local Muslims were arrested by Hyderabad police who blamed militant groups Lashkar-e-Toiba and HuJI for the blast.        
	Although charges were filed against 26 Muslim youths, all of them were acquitted and the case was later handed over to the CBI.        
	But the probe had turned cold and the case was almost shelved last year untill leads in the October 2007 Ajmer blast threw up a link with the Mecca Masjid explosion.        
	A CBI source said the Rajasthan anti-terrorism squad arrested Gupta on April 28 in connection with the Ajmer dargah blast that killed three persons. Sharma was caught a few days later.        
	The two were brought to Hyderabad by the CBI on Thursday before being produced before the magistrate.        
	CBI sources said they were looking for two others, suspected bomb-makers Sandeep Dange and Ramji Kalsangra, both said to be techies.        
	In Hyderabad, the relief among city Muslims was palpable. Member of Parliament and chief of the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen Asaduddin Owaisi said the state police and the CBI should now realise that a new front had been opened by Hindu extremists.        
	The state police and the media had shut their eyes as they did not want to admit that a Hindu organisation was involved in such activities, Owaisi said.

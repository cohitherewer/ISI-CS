The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Army chief with last war badge
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Army chief with last war badge
          SUJAN DUTTA                               Deepak Kapoor (top)   and VK Singh                          
	New Delhi, March 31: General Vijay Kumar Singh, who was the eastern army commander in Fort William, Calcutta, took over as the chief of army staff today from General Deepak Kapoor.         
	Kapoor retired after more than 40 years in service.         
	V.K. Singh picked up the rank of General on assumption of office. Unless circumstances take a dramatic turn, he will be the last chief to have been through a full-fledged war. As a young captain in 1971, he was training Bangladesh mukti joddhas (freedom fighters) in the war with Pakistan that resulted in the birth of the nation.         
	The next army chief, if the government goes by the usual seniority norms, is likely to be General Bikram Singh, who took over in Calcutta today as the eastern army commander. He was commissioned into service after the 1971 war.         
	A third-generation soldier, General V.K. Singh has the unique distinction of sporting a Ranger tag on his shoulder after going through a gruelling special operations course in Fort Benning in the US.         
	During the 60-day course, the participants cannot sleep for more than three to four hours as they run, trek, swim, hike and paradrop with about 41kg of weapons and equipment into territory controlled by a terrorist and narco-trafficking organisation.         
	Army chiefs are mature people, Kapoor said after a farewell guard of honour. I hope my successor too will pursue policies that will take the army and the nation forward, he replied when asked what his words of advice were for General Singh.         
	As the eastern army commander, General Singh ordered the court of inquiry into an attempted land grab near Sukna in north Bengal that indicted Kapoors confidant and military secretary Lt General (now retired) Avadesh Prakash.         
	Asked if he was worried the army chiefs stature had taken a beating when defence minister A.K. Antony advised him to start disciplinary proceedings against Prakash instead of administrative action that he had initiated, Kapoor said: This is not the appropriate time to talk of such things.         
	An officer from the Rajput regiment, General V.K. Singh, has a two-year term as the chief. He was named the chief-designate on January 23 after the cabinet committee on appointments approved his name.         
	The first Indian army chief, Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa, who took over in 1949, was also from the Rajput Regiment. Singh was commissioned into the Rajput Regiment in June 1970. He participated in Operation Pawan, the Indian peace-keeping force in Sri Lanka for which he was decorated with the Yudh Seva medal.         
	Before becoming an army commander, V.K. Singh commanded the Jalandhar-based 11 Corps, served in the military operations directorate and as an instructor with the Indian military training team in Bhutan. He commanded his unit in counter-insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir. He topped his batch in the young infantry officers commando course.

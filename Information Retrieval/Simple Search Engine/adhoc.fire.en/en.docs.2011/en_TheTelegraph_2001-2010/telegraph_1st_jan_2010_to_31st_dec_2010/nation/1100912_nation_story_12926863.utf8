The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Postponement cloud on turnaround steps 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Postponement cloud on turnaround steps 
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 11: The eleventh-hour postponement of a key meeting of the cabinet committee on security (CCS) this morning could mean a setback for a whole set of measures that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had gradually put on track to attempt a turnaround in the strife-torn Kashmir valley.        
	Top among those proposals was the revocation of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) from central districts of the Valley, a move to which opposition has stiffened in the government as well as the Congress.        
	Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah, who met the Prime Minister last week to discuss those proposals, had hinted he was returning to Srinagar on the promise of an Id-day package that would have handed him something concrete to take to his angry constituents.        
	Sources both at the Centre and in the Kashmir government had clearly enumerated those proposals  partial lifting of the AFSPA, relief to the relatives of those who had been killed or injured during three months of violence, fresh economic and job-related measures. Omar had openly stated that the status quo is not enough and has been banking on the Centre making an offer he can make a fresh start with.        
	That Id has come and gone without any announcements would be a source of disappointment  and worry  to both Omar and those in New Delhi he has been working with to turn the violent tide. As one official said: There was a symbolism attached to Id and this has been a missed opportunity.        
	He was quick to add, though, that the complexity of the problem and the divergence of views in the government and the party does not make any decision quick or easy.        
	Omar left a flaming Srinagar to arrive in Delhi to lobby support for the peace package over the weekend. The CCS in now scheduled to meet on Monday.        
	The eruption of Id-day violence and arson in Srinagar will serve to emphasise the case of those arguing against any tinkering with the AFSPA and could well force the abandonment, if temporarily, of any substantive political or security initiatives. Apart from defence minister A.K. Antony and former J amp;K chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, the army chief, V.K. Singh, too had lobbied the Prime Minister against lifting or amending the AFSPA in separate meetings yesterday.        
	Added to their voices is the upped rhetoric from the BJP, whose leaders have been cautioning that any dilution of the security apparatus in Kashmir would amount to risking national security and playing into the hands of elements inimical to Indian interests.        
	The CCS, scheduled for 11 this morning, was called off amid such a build of contrary voices within and outside the UPA establishment. While the Prime Minister is still believed to favour a bold move, if only symbolic, if only as a gamble, others in his government and party are counselling caution on the grounds that India cannot afford to experiment with security measures in the Valley. Pulling the army off duty in the Valley, they argue, could only encourage separatist elements and fuel more protests.        
	Omar, and his backers in Delhi, have held, on the contrary, that beyond the nitty-gritty of whether it has been used or not, the AFSPA has become a red rag to the Valleys people and offering relief from the act could open a window of peace.        
	Omar himself has been under pressure from the Centre to not only tone up his civilian and police administration but also to resume mass contact. Some key changes in the administration have been made and more might be on the way, but resuming political activity has proved much harder. No political party, not even the Opposition PDP, has had the courage of conviction to intervene and occupy political space for fear of repercussions from the angry street.        
	Omars National Conference (NC) has been at the receiving end of even greater public ire; although the party won all eight Srinagar seats in the last Assembly elections, no NC leader has been able to speak, much less campaign, against the violence.        
	Prodded by New Delhi, Omar has begun a hesitant mass-contact programme, but thus far he has visited only remote, and relatively unaffected, districts. On the effort he made to reach out to people  to a Srinagar hospital by chopper to visit people injured in firing  he faced such a hostile reception he has not bothered going out again. He has, in fact, projected such incidents to tell the Centre he needs the support of concrete measures to regain public confidence.        
	The message emerging from the Valley, though, is that time might be fast running out, and even bold moves in contemplation with the Centre may not be enough to meet aspirations. Todays violence, and Mirwaiz Umer Farooqs statement that symbolic measures are not going to satisfy Kashmiris, is renewed proof of that.

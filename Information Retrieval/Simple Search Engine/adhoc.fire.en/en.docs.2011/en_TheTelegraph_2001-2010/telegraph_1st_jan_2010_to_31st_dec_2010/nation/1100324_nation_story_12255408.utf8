	New Delhi, March 23: No law prohibits pre-marital sex or live-in relationships, the Supreme Court said today.        
	When two adults want to live together, what is the offence? Does it amount to an offence? Living together is not an offence. It cannot be an offence, Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan, heading a three-judge bench, said, hearing petitions against Tamil actress Khusboo. The actress had said in a magazine that pre-marital sex was fine.        
	Even Lord Krishna and Radha lived together according to mythology, the judges pointed out, adding no law prohibited either pre-marital sex or live-in relationships. Please tell us what is the offence and under which section? Living together is (part of) right to life (given in the Constitution), the bench said. The other two judges on the bench were Deepak Verma and B.S. Chauhan.        
	The judges said activities perceived to be immoral by sections of society could not be branded an offence, trying to make a distinction between the two concepts.         
	The bench said Khusboos comments were personal. How does it concern you (the petitioners). We are not bothered. At the most, it is a personal view. How is it an offence? the judges said. Later, the court asked the complainants to produce evidence to show if any girl had eloped after the comments made by the actress. Khusboo was present in the court. The bench reserved its judgment on her plea that the cases be spiked.        
	Khusboo approached the apex court after Madras High Court dismissed her plea in 2008 to spike the cases.        
	The lawyer for some of the complainants argued that such comments from a well-known public figure like her would adversely affect the minds of young people, leading to decay in moral values and cultural ethos.        
	This is not the first time courts have sanctioned pre-marital sex and live-in relationships through observations that have created a controversy. In August 2008, the apex court validated long-term live-in relationships as marriages.        
	A bench comprising Justices Arijit Pasayat and P. Sathashivam had declared that children born out of such a relationship would no longer be called illegitimate. Law inclines in the interest of legitimacy and thumbs down whoreson or fruit of adultery, the court had said then. The court had fallen back on a 1927 judgment made by the Privy Council, the Supreme Courts predecessor in pre-Independence India.         
	In 1978, the Supreme Court recognised a live-in relationship as a valid marriage, accusing the authorities of questioning a relationship 50 years after the couple had begun living together and were treated as a married couple even by relatives.         
	Recently, Bombay High Court held that pre-marital consensual sex was fine, but sentenced a man for promising to marry a woman and going back on his words. The judge threw out allegations of rape but ruled that the man should have married the woman.         
	The statute books, however, do not yet reflect the change that seems to be sweeping through the corridors of the judiciary.         
	The National Commission for Women has recommended a change in the definition of wife as mentioned in Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), which deals with maintenance. It has suggested that women in live-in relationships be entitled to maintenance if the man deserts her. But the suggestion remains on paper.

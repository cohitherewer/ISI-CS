The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | On Womens Day: Three-musketeer ladies versus the Yuddha dads
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      On Womens Day: Three-musketeer ladies versus the Yuddha dads
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      Sonia Gandhi, Brinda Karat and Sushma Swaraj                          
	New Delhi, March 3: Three powerful midwives are ready to guide it to birth after 14 years in the womb. But a long-time male bugbear has promised war.        
	The government today said it would like the womens reservation bill to be passed in this session, fuelled by fresh impetus from Sonia Gandhi, Sushma Swaraj and Brinda Karat, and bringing hope to the jinxed legislation.        
	Parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Kumar Bansal told reporters the Centre intended to take up the controversial bill for consideration and passage in the Rajya Sabha on March 8, the International Womens Day.        
	The announcement came after the Union cabinet last week endorsed a report of a parliamentary standing committee where the bill  which envisages 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament and state legislatures  had been referred after being introduced in the Upper House last year.        
	But a confrontation loomed as RJD chief Lalu Prasad threatened war against the government and fellow Yadav leader, Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh, said his party would oppose the bill tooth and nail and warned of uproar in Parliament.        
	Yuddha hoga (there will be war), Lalu Prasad said in the Lok Sabha.        
	Bansal was silent when asked about the bills fate, nearly sealed 14 years ago after backward-caste MPs of regional parties demanded a separate 27 per cent quota for women of their caste in addition to the 21 per cent earmarked for Dalit and tribal women. But Congress sources claimed they were confident it would go through this time.        
	The reason for their confidence, they said, was the clout wielded by the three powerful women: Congress chief Sonia, BJP leader Sushma and the CPMs Brinda.        
	The three parties, who account for nearly 350 MPs in the 544-strong Lok Sabha and 138 of the 233-member Rajya Sabha, have unequivocally and consistently supported the bill. For the Constitution Amendment Bill to be passed, it needs the support of two-thirds of the members of both Houses.        
	Even if the three parties dont have the numbers now, they can count on the support of gender-friendly entities like the ADMK and the Telugu Desam Party and those unencumbered by the OBC imperative like the Biju Janata Dal.        
	Congress sources said Sonia was as influential in the last Lok Sabha as this one but not that confident and pushy. Except for a determined push in July 2009, she did not persist, saying a consensus needed to be evolved.        
	The Left, on its part, was preoccupied with blocking the Indo-US nuclear deal.         
	BJP sources said Sushma had resolved to come out of her mentor L.K. Advanis shadow and make a mark as leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.        
	She has already made an impact by foregrounding price rise as the BJPs main agenda. Because she is not seen as the face of the Ram temple movement, her acceptability quotient with the secular Opposition is quite high. But I believe her big moment is yet to come and the womens bill might just be it. She will try and push for it in a big way, a leader said.        
	Brinda has the advantage of being a CPM politburo member as well as a Rajya Sabha MP. Observers believe she will leverage her positions to smoothen the creases, if any, within the Left.        
	But if the bill has three women mascots to take it to fruition, it is saddled with three bugbears: Mulayam, Lalu Prasad and Sharad Yadav.        
	Not exactly known to see eye to eye, the Yadav bonding on the gender bill was evident at a social event last week.        
	Two of them were spotted together and the sole subject of their conversation was what should their strategy be to block the bill? One of them suggested the Opposition must be like Arjuna and not lose its focus on price rise.

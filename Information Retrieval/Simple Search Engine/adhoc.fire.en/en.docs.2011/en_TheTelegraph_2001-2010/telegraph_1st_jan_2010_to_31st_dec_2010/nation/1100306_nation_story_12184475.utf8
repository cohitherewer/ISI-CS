The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong jitters on womens bill 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong jitters on womens bill

	New Delhi, March 5: Two days before the government is expected to table the womens reservation bill, many in the Congress appear to have developed cold feet.        
	One of their worries is that the bills opponents may trigger pandemonium in the House and prevent a vote  a must for legislation that requires a constitutional amendment. The other is that alienating the regional parties opposed to the bill could cost the Congress in the future.        
	The Congress leadership is likely to meet on Sunday for stock-taking. A source close to the high command said: On Monday morning we will take a final call whether we should go ahead come what may, or take a second look at the whole thing.        
	One pro-bill lobby in the Congress argues that if the government caves in tamely and fails to introduce the bill in the current session  as Sonia Gandhi has said it would  the party would lose credibility and undermine its president.        
	The Congress has already hinted that the bill, which reserves 33 per cent of national and state legislature seats for women, would be tabled on March 8, the centenary of International Womens Day.        
	The bill needs the support of two-thirds of those present and voting in each House  a number that cannot be less than half the Houses total strength. With the Congress, BJP and the Left firmly in favour of the womens quota, the numbers pose no problem.        
	Yet, voting can be held only if there is order and discipline in the House and the lobbies can be cleared. Voting cannot take place amid slogan-shouting, the shredding of papers, name-calling, walkouts and storming of the well  regular occurrences during past attempts at introducing the bill.        
	Asked if measures would be taken to evict unruly MPs, a Congress minister appeared to betray the ambivalence that even some ruling party members have towards the bill. For this bill? Perish the thought. Things had better proceed smoothly, or we will go for another round of consensus, the male MP said.        
	The Congress is also looking at the possible political cost of alienating the Yadavs  Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh  and the Bahujan Samaj Party, all of whom have issued whips to their MPs to vote against the bill.        
	We have to ponder the implications especially since the possibility of having to do business with them after elections in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh cannot be ruled out, a Congress source said.        
	The Congress and the BJP have each issued a three-line whip, asking members to be present and vote for the bill. The Left parties have told their MPs to stay put in New Delhi for the weekend.        
	Parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Kumar Bansal has hosted a lunch for the chief whips of all the parties with an appeal for a vote  a convention followed before a constitutional amendment bill is tabled.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today expressed the hope in Parliament that the bill would see the light of day in the current session.        
	Orissa quota        
	The Orissa government today announced 50 per cent reservation for women at all three tiers of the panchayat system. Bihar, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have already reserved half their panchayati raj seats for women, and Rajasthan has promised to do so.

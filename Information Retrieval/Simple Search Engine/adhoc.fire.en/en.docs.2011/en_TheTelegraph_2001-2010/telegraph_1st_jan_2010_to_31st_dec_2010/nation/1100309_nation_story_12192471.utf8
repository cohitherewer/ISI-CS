          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 8: Landscape, mysticism, abstraction and spirituality  the canvasses put together at the Modern Art Gallery here depict the thoughts of 40 women artists in Art Era, an exclusive exhibition-cum-camp by women artists of Orissa.        
	The annual event, now in its second year, is a tribute to the unsung women artists of the state who have taken up art either as a vocation or a hobby.        
	The two-day exhibition  put up to mark the International Womens Day  is concluding today. There was no particular theme for the exhibition. During the camp, the artists were asked to paint on the spot for two days, said gallery director Tarakant Parida.        
	The exhibition was started last year on March 8.         
	There were 48 painters from across the country participating in the three-day event. This year, the organisers focused on highlighting the talents of the state.        
	According to Parida, putting together an exhibition of artists is difficult.         
	We dont have money and its very difficult to organise a sponsor for this kind of programmes in Orissa but of course things have to begin somewhere. We will do it in a much bigger way next year, he added.        
	Despite the pool of talent and potential, most women artists in the state are left to fend for themselves for lack of opportunities.         
	Every year, hundreds of women students pass out of art colleges and institutes of the state but there is hardly any opportunity for them to excel professionally. The situation worsens with marriage. There is so little time to devout for paintings as it becomes an investment without returns, said Priyambada Rath, an artist.                          
	The condition of artists, mostly women, is all the more pathetic in Orissa. We find it really very hard to sell a painting. Its depressing at times, said Rekha Mohapatra, another artist.

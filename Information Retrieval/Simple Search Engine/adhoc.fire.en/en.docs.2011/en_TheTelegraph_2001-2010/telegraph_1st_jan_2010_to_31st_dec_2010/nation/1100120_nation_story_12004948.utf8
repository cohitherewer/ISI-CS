          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Jan. 19: A student of Osmania University set himself on fire on the campus, the suicide breaking a brief lull in the campaign for a separate Telangana state.        
	Fuming fellow students, already agitated that authorities had conducted exams without completing the half-yearly syllabus, declared a Telangana bandh for 48 hours.         
	We have given enough time to the Congress governments in the state and at the Centre, said Pulla Rao, convenor of the Joint Action Committee of Osmania University students. How long do they expect us to be patient?         
	Venugopala Reddy, an MCA student of a local college, poured kerosene and set himself on fire this afternoon.        
	Reddys suicide for Telangana was the first by an Osmania student on the campus. In 1969, suicides by five students had triggered the agitation for Telangana. It had snowballed into a mass movement and nearly 375 people were killed in police firings in Hyderabad and other districts.        
	Osmania students began a three-week marathon walk yesterday from Hyderabad to Warangal that would cover 350km and touch all Telangana districts to whip up the campaign for a separate state.        
	The joint action committee of all parties, including the Congress and the Telugu Desam, jumped into action after the students announced the bandh.        
	Telangana Rashtra Samiti leaders met at a hotel close to the university campus and decided to join the bandh.

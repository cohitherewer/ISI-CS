	Aizawl, June 6 (PTI): Airport authorities today cleared the touchdown of an Air India plane despite a key equipment required during landing not being functional.        
	The Air India Calcutta-Aizawl flight today landed at the Lengpui airport that has one of the three tabletop runways in the country. The plane had 145 passengers on board and had failed to land in the past three days because of bad weather. At that time too, the Very High Frequency Omni-Directional Range (VOR) was out of order, said U.K. Ghosh, senior manager at the Airports Authority of India.        
	The landing comes weeks after the Mangalore crash that claimed 158 lives. This airport, too, has a tabletop runway.        
	The VOR is a system of navigational beacons at different locations in the airport. Each beacon broadcasts a signal at a particular frequency that is picked up by a receiver in the cockpit.

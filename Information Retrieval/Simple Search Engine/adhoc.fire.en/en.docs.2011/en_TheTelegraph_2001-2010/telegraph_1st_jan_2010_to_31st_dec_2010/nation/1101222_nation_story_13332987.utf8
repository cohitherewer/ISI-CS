          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          A Raja      
	Chennai, Dec. 21: Former telecom minister A. Raja is likely to appear before the CBI early next week in response to the summons issued to him by the agency in the 2G scandal, sources close to him said.         
	Raja has been consulting his party leadership and his lawyers on the stand to be taken during the questioning by the CBI.        
	Since we do not know the exact nature of documents seized from Niira Radia and former telecom officials, the lawyers are preparing the most likely questions that may be posed to Raja and what his answers should be, a source said.        
	The DMK leadership continues to keep Raja in good humour to ensure that the CBI inquiry does not spill over to chief minister Karunanidhis daughter Kanimozhi or her mother Rajathi.        
	Napoleon, the DMKs minister of state for social welfare and an MP from Rajas hometown of Perambalur, state forest minister N. Selvaraj, from the neighbouring Musiri Assembly constituency and South Chennai district secretary J. Anbazhagan called on Raja this morning.        
	Raja is now repeatedly being assured that he has not been isolated within the party unlike the impression given immediately after the first round of raids. When the second set of raids covered those close to Kanimozhi, Karunanidhi realised that he has to keep Raja in his inner circle to safeguard Kanimozhi, explained a DMK MP.        
	Although Raja knows this was the ulterior motive, he had little option but to play along, the MP added.        
	Karunanidhi has come up with another set of arguments over the 2G scandal. He cited former NDA telecom minister Arun Shouries recent deduction that the loss because of the 2G spectrum allocation would be around Rs 30,000 crore, not Rs 1.75 lakh crore, as alleged by the Opposition.         
	In trying to whittle down the size of the amount lost, the DMK chief has unwittingly admitted that Rajas decision had indeed caused a huge loss of revenue to the exchequer.         
	In the same statement, Karunanidhi asserted that neither he nor anyone (his family members or Radia) had pushed for Raja to become the telecom minister. He became telecom minister only because he held the same portfolio since May 2007 (in the UPA I after Dayanidhi Maran was asked to quit) and not because we insisted on it, Karunanidhi said.         
	In the same vein, Karunanidhi questioned the veracity of the Radia tapes, saying their contents were not true just because they got wide publicity.        
	The claim in the tapes that Dayanidhi Maran gave Rs 600 crores to my wife Dayalu alone is enough to prove that the tape contents are false, he said.        
	What is wrong if a north Indian lady and south Indian lady had a phone conversation? he shot back at reporters who had asked him about the leaked tapes that had his infotech minister Poongodahi Aladi Aruna describing M.K. Alagiri as a cut-throat politician.        
	Addressing party functionaries from Tiruchy district, Karunanidhi today urged them to come up with a suitable counter-attack against Jayalalithaas false campaign against his government and the DMK, especially over the spectrum scandal.        
	That is a far cry from a leader who only a few months ago had asserted that the DMK would ride back to power solely on the welfare measures it had implemented in the past five years.

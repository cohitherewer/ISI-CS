	The school would be felicitated at a formal ceremony in New Delhi and its content and method would be presented to other schools, he said.        
	With the award, the school can enjoy the accreditation for three years, allowing international exchange of students and faculties among the accredited schools.         
	Two members of the teaching staff of the school have already visited Chosen Hill School in Gloucester, UK, said principal Arun Prakash.

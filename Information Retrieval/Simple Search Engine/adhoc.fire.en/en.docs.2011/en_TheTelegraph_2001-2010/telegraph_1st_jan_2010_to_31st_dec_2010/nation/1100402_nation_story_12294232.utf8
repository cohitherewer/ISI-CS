          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 1: The Union home ministry feels Maoist leader Kishan has been asked by his chief Ganapathi to lie low and stay away from the media, adding to the theories on his silence that so far ranged from injury to death.        
	Ministry sources said Ganapathi had accused Kishan of having deviated from party ideology. It is possible that Kishanji is hit. Information with us points at a second explanation to why he is silent. It seems Ganapathi has asked Kishanji to cut down his media exposure, an official said.        
	The 2004 merger of the Maoist Co-rdination Centre and the Peoples War to form the CPI (Maoist) is also coming unstuck, sources claimed.        
	The point of contention among Maoist leaders is whether or not to replicate the Lalgarh experiment elsewhere in the country. While former MCC leaders advocate more Lalgarhs across India, the leaders of the erstwhile Peoples War consider Lalgarh to have been a failure where the Maoists lost several cadres.

          SHEENA K.                               
	Raipur, May 18: Bhikam Koya stood outside his hamlet in Korra for over two hours, helplessly watching women and children writhe in pain and plead for a drop of water.        
	But the fear of the gun held back Bhikam, a 24-year-old tribal, who had rushed out of his home on hearing the deafening explosion around 4.30pm yesterday when the passenger bus was blown up by a landmine near Chingawaram, about 40km from Dantewada town.         
	The device had been planted about 7 feet below the ground by the Maoists, who had detonated it on receiving real-time intelligence that security personnel were on the vehicle.        
	As many as 25 security personnel had boarded the bus somewhere along its journey from Dantewada town, flouting the standard operating procedure that prohibits them from taking civilian transport.         
	Police today revised the death toll to 31, of whom 16 were security personnel. Eleven of them were special police officers (SPOs)  local people drafted into the force to tackle Maoists  four district police personnel and one special branch jawan.         
	The remaining were civilians. Among the slain civilians were 25-year-old nurse Shanti Kashyap and laboratory technician Ramswarup Jain. Also killed in the attack were 19-year-old Rita Duthi and two youths, Sodhi Lakhma and Shyamnath Bagel. They are among the 10 bodies identified so far.        
	Sources said the special task force was the possible target. The STF, along with the SPOs, had launched a search operation in the area. But the STF personnel had managed to return in three trucks.         
	The exhausted SPOs, too tired to walk as required by the rulebook, boarded the bus. As there was no room inside, a few sat on the roof and became easy target for the Maoists, a senior police official said.        
	Bhikam, the Korra villager, said it was heart-wrenching to see the victims scream in pain for more than two hours before help arrived.         
	The other residents of Korra, a small forest hamlet near Chingawaram, too, had shied away from coming to the rescue of the wounded. The women and children were shouting for help and water, recalled Bhikam.         
	But the villagers did not dare offer assistance as the Maoists have dictated that anyone travelling on buses with the security personnel was open to danger.        
	A police team from Sukma, 40km away, finally reached the spot around 6.30pm, two hours after the explosion.         
	Till then, the injured persons, bleeding profusely, were lying on the ground in the scorching heat. Several of the people died because they could not get timely medical care.         
	The villagers said the passengers had been penalised because of the folly of the security personnel. The SPOs along with other policemen of the district force intercepted the bus and forcefully boarded it, said a source in Sukma, a small town on the Orissa border where the bus was headed.

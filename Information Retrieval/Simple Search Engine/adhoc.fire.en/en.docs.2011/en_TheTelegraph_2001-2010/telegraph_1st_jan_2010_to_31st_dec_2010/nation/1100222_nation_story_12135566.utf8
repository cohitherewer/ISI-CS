The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Job scheme work to be allowed on private land
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Job scheme work to be allowed on private land
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 21: The Centre has finalised guidelines that pave the way for a wide range of works on private land under the rural job scheme.        
	The beneficiaries will be small and marginal farmers across all categories, Scheduled Castes and Tribes and families below the poverty line (BPL).         
	The list of works under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) is likely to include construction of wells, ponds, ground-water works, levelling and shaping of plots, construction of drainage channels and all activities related to horticulture, sericulture, plantations and nurseries. These activities are not permitted on public/government land.        
	The guidelines will be notified by the rural development ministry, which oversees the scheme.         
	The proposed norms follow allegations that the provision allowing NREGA work on private plots was being misused. There have also been complaints about lack of clarity following the Centres decision to permit such work on private land.        
	There is a need for guidelines to facilitate work on individual land. Standard norms, with flexibility to cater to local needs, are needed so that the impact of such works is maximised, says one of the guidelines.         
	All that a landowner has to do to benefit from the move is apply to the local panchayat along with documents showing eligibility. Explaining the reason for the move, the guidelines point out that a number of studies carried out in the field show that there has been an increase in production on individual land treated under NREGA.        
	In the initial phase, work was permitted only on private land owned by Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and BPL families. Later, all marginal farmers, who own up to a hectare, and small farmers, those who own between one and two hectares, were included.         
	The guidelines, however, make it clear that work on plots owned by SCs and STs should get priority. Once works on the lands of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are saturated, works on lands of small and marginal farmers may be considered, one of the guidelines says.        
	No contractors or machinery can be used in such work, and only registered job-card holders can be hired. The responsibility of maintaining the records will lie with the beneficiary household.         
	The ceiling on wage payments for each work on such private plots has been set at Rs 1.5 lakh. But the amount can be increased if the district planning committee, the local body monitoring the rural job scheme, clears it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Posco caught between promise amp; protest
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Posco caught between promise amp; protest
          SUBRAT DAS                          Lee Myung-Bak in New Delhi on Monday                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 27: The $12 billion mega steel plant project of South Korean behemoth Posco proposed to be set up near Paradip port hangs in balance between promise and protest.        
	While chief minister Naveen Patnaik assured the South Korean president, Lee Myung-Bak, to expedite the much-delayed project, anti-plant protesters have launched an indefinite dharna opposing the project.        
	I assured the South Korean President that the Posco steel plant project will be expedited. Of course, our government will help and see that construction begins as soon as possible, Naveen told reporters here on return from Delhi after meeting Lee.        
	Naveen had rushed to Delhi by a special flight yesterday to meet Lee, who wanted to have a talk with the chief minister and discuss the issue.        
	Concerned over the inordinate delay in implementing the biggest foreign direct investment project in India, Lee had earlier expressed his interest to visit the proposed plant site and attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony apparently to give it a much-needed push. However, it could not materialise since the ground situation was not conducive, sources said.        
	Posco had signed an MoU with the state government on June 22, 2005, for setting up a 12MTPA mega steel plant with an investment of Rs 51,000 crore near Paradip port. However, the mega steel plant project, has virtually remained a non-starter with the administration failing to acquire a single inch for the plant due to the continued agitation by the project affected people for the past four years.        
	On the other hand, anti-plant activists intensified their agitation and launched an indefinite dharna in the proposed project area since yesterday coinciding with Naveens meeting with the South Korea President. We will continue our dharna, Abhay Sahu, the president of the Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, said.

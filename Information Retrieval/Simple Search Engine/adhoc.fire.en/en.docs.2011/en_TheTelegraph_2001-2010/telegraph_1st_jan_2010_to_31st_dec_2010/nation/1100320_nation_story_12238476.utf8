          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 19: A retired customs officials motive-less shooting of his schoolgirl neighbour yesterday continues to baffle police and psychiatrists.        
	The families of Harish Maroliya, 57, and Hemini Mehta, 14, separately performed the funeral rites at a crematorium today.         
	Maroliya, apparently angered by the noise of renovation from the flat above his, had kidnapped Hemini, a resident of the building, and shot her in his apartment before being mowed down by police.        
	The Maroliya family was busy with the funeral so we have not questioned his wife and daughters yet. We will do that tomorrow and find out if he suffered from any mental illness or had any previous history of psychological illnesses, deputy commissioner K.M. Prasanna said.         
	Maroliyas act seems completely bizarre. He held the girl hostage without a motive. This does not even look like an act of pure rage, psychiatrist Harish Shetty said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Church against 9/11 act
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Church against 9/11 act
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: The Indian Church has decided to appeal to Pope Benedict XVI and President Barack Obama to stop a US church from burning the Quran to mark the ninth anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.        
	The Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Florida, has announced that it will go ahead with its Burn a Quran Day despite city officials denying the radical Christian sect a burn permit.        
	The permission was denied on the ground that open burning of books is not allowed under US laws, but the outreach centre today indicated its plans were on course in an email sent to Christian groups and the media.        
	On September 11th, 2010, from 6pm-9pm, we will burn the Koran on the property of Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, FL, in remembrance of the fallen victims of 9/11. the email said.        
	The Indian Church has, however, decided to protest against the proposal because it believes such an act of hatred goes against the tenets of Christianity. In a rare instance of unity, all Christian sects have decided to write a joint letter to the Pope, Obama and UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon urging them to block the burning.        
	What the Dove World Outreach Center in Florida is doing is totally unacceptable and needs to be denounced by all right-thinking persons. The Quran-burning plan is totally against the tenets of Christianity and needs to be condemned by everyone who believes in Christ, Fr Babu Joseph, the spokesperson for the Catholic Bishops Conference of India told The Telegraph.        
	The Church leaders have decided to convene a programme, either in New Delhi or in Mumbai, to emphasise Christianitys message of peace and condemn those acting contrary to it. The meeting will be attended by representatives of Catholic denominations, including Mumbai Archbishop Cardinal Oswald Gracias, bishops of the Protestant Church of North India and other Christian groups.        
	We will speak out against a few Christian fanatics in the US, said Fr Savio Fernandes of the Bombay Diocese.

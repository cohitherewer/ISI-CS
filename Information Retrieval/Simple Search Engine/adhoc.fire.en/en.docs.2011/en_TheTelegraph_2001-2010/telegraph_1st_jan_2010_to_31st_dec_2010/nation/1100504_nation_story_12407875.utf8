                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Plan to rebuild rebel-hit schools

	New Delhi, May 3: The human resource development ministry plans to ask states worst affected by Maoism to focus resources on rebuilding schools attacked by the rebels  its first initiative directed specifically at these regions schooling challenges.         
	The HRD ministry plans to ask states to prioritise their resources  under Indias schemes to universalise primary and secondary education  to reconstruct damaged school buildings, government officials have told The Telegraph.         
	The ministry, sources said, was troubled by a report by international NGO Human Rights Watch on schools in Jharkhand, Bihar and Chhattisgarh, which were targeted by Maoists, mostly because they were occupied by security forces. The ministry is already implementing the countrys largest single programme to build new schools  6,000 model schools, one per block across India.         
	Maoist-affected states  like all other states  will also benefit from a model school in each block, and sections in the government are trying to peddle these schools as an initiative to help these regions.         
	But top officials confirmed that while Maoist-affected states would receive their share of model schools based on the number of blocks, they would not receive any additional or special schools. Out of 348 model schools sanctioned so far, 53 are in Naxalite-affected districts.         
	The rights report has however increased concerns within the government about the utility of building schools in these regions unless backup measures are taken to rebuild any attacked buildings, sources said.         
	The NGOs report lists 11 schools it visited in Bihar and Jharkhand alone that were occupied by paramilitary forces battling the Maoists. No classes could be held in these schools. The report listed several other schools targeted by the Maoists  allegedly because they were being used to house the paramilitary forces.         
	Attacks by Maoists or their sympathisers on school buildings are carried out generally using explosives or large sledgehammers to drill massive holes. Attackers also frequently riddle walls with bullet shots.         
	The ministrys move to give priority to rebuilding and maintaining existing schools in these regions was discussed at a recent meeting of the task force on Maoist-affected districts headed by the cabinet secretary, sources said.         
	Funds used to reconstruct school buildings will come from the money allocated to states under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, ministry sources said.         
	The government has identified 34 districts spanning seven states as worst affected by Naxalism. Jharkhand has 11 such districts, followed by Chattisgarh with seven, Bihar with six, Orissa with five, Maharashtra with two and one each in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

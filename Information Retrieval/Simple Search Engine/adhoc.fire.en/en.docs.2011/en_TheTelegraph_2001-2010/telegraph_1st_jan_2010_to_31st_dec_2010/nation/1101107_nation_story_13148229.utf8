The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Young gun shoots, BJP scurries to calibrate
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Young gun shoots, BJP scurries to calibrate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rajiv Pratap Rudy                                   
	New Delhi, Nov. 6: If Barack Obama refrained from putting a foot in his mouth, the BJPs young blood has obliged with gusto.        
	The BJP was tonight struggling to calibrate its hasty criticism of Obama for not mentioning Pakistan in his address at the Taj hotel. In evening hindsight, it appeared to have dawned on the party that the attack was not only ill-timed but had also dragged the bilateral relationship into a controversial frame.        
	The knee-jerk response during the day also betrayed the inexperience of the second line of leadership of the BJP, the core base of which has always been pro-US. It also proved that the Opposition party is yet to fill the vacuum left by veterans who could come up with nuanced responses when faced with multi-dimensional issues such as diplomacy.        
	 All of us are of the view that it is a bilateral relationship (with Pakistan) and no country, not even the US, has the right to intervene. If this is the premise, why should we expect Obama to straightaway start speaking on Pakistan? a party source said after spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy told reporters that the President of America had missed an opportunity to strike a chord with Indians.        
	At a media briefing, perhaps carried away by the explosion of initial breast-beating by some pundits on television channels, Rudy said the absence of any mention of Pakistan and its terror links had disappointed India.        
	He was speaking in that place, at the Taj hotel, where the world was shocked by the scenes it witnessed (on 26/11). The world had evidence, (and) the US had proof that the terror strikes and the massacres were directed from Pakistani soil, done by Pakistani security agencies and by terrorists trained in Pakistan, Rudy said.        
	In his first statement, the US President missed an opportunity to strike a chord with the people of India. He talked of (terror) perpetration, determination, solidarity, the scourge of terror. But knowing fully well, that the perpetrator is Pakistan, he disappointed India, Rudy added.         
	Rudy also said the Indian governments America policy appeared fuzzy.        
	A source close to Rudy claimed the spokesperson had been briefed by a senior leader and asked to stick to the text and spirit of a statement that was purportedly prepared after consultations with the partys foreign policy experts.        
	The statement was not circulated to the media despite requests.        
	Former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha, named as one of the experts, however, told The Telegraph he had no idea what had happened. I just landed in Delhi, Sinha, who arrived in the capital late this evening, said. Nobody spoke with me.        
	Jaswant Singh, whom Sinha replaced as foreign minister during the NDA regime, was not available for comment.        
	Some in the BJP said it was impolitic of Rudy to criticise Obama when he had set foot in India just hours earlier. It was also ill-timed, they said, considering the response Obama and First Lady Michelle got in Mumbai from a cross-section of people that included businessmen, employees of Taj hotel and students.        
	There is every chance we may come across as cussed and mean, the way we were looked at when we opposed the Indo-US civil nuclear deal, a source said. We should have waited for Obama to speak in Parliament and judge him.        
	Another source said it was time India snapped out of the gridlock that has linked it with Pakistan and now China in its relations with other countries. Let us do business with the US as US instead of looking at things through Pakistans lens.        
	Sources said senior party leaders, including Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Sinha and Jaswant, would meet at L.K. Advanis residence tomorrow to discuss the points the leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha would raise when she meets Obama on Monday. The BJP is expected to calibrate its position after tomorrows meeting.        
	Earlier, as Obama spoke at the Taj, BJP leaders worked their phones to share notes on whether they should go on the offensive from the word go. They concluded they should, if only to put the UPA government on notice, so that it would not allow Obama to have a free lunch and depart without giving away anything to India.        
	Rudy referred to this perception when he said Obamas focus was to open up Indian markets so that US business can prosper.

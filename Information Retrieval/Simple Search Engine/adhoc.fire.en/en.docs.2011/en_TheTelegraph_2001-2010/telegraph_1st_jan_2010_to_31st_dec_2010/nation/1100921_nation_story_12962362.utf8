          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 20: The home ministry has identified 32 sensitive locations in five states ahead of the Ayodhya verdict on Friday.        
	It has asked the governments of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala to give topmost priority to maintaining law and order as the judgment has the potential to evoke sharp reactions. Four locations in Uttar Pradesh have been marked sensitive.        
	The states have also been asked to hold meetings of security personnel and share local intelligence with the paramilitary. These forces will be kept on standby at locations near airports so they can be flown in to a disturbed area fast.        
	Sources said a tight vigil would be kept on religious organisations that could foment trouble. Agencies were already keeping watch on several outfits in Gujarat and Kerala, they said.        
	The Centre has decided to provide Uttar Pradesh 5,200 paramilitary personnel, including the Rapid Action Force, against its demand for 65,000. The home ministry said the state had over 1.2 lakh police personnel who could help with emergencies.

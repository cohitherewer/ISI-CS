	New Delhi, Oct. 5: The Congress leadership today called for punishing those involved in the criminal demolition of the Babri mosque, stressing on the assault in a subtle course correction from its initial response after last weeks high court verdict.         
	Sources said the party had taken note of the disappointment among Muslims after it refused to talk about the demolition on the day of the judgment, though some individual leaders mentioned it later.        
	Soon after the bench passed its order last Thursday, the party had said it respected the verdict but no leader raised the point that the crime of the demolition couldnt be diluted.        
	However, the next day home minister P. Chidambaram and senior leader Digvijay Singh both called for the strongest punishment for those who had brought down the mosque.        
	Today, a statement issued by the partys highest policy-making body, the Congress Working Committee  now called Steering Committee as its reconstitution is pending  said: It is important to underline that the verdict in no way condones the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992, which was a shameful and criminal act, for which the perpetrators must be brought to justice.         
	At an over two-hour meeting, attended by top leaders like Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee, the committee discussed feedback from different parts of the country and felt that the Sangh parivars attempt to interpret the verdict to its advantage had created unease among Muslims.         
	Although some speakers took note of the conciliatory gestures coming from the community, they also stressed the need for reassuring Muslims that the judicial process was not yet over in the sensitive case.         
	The Congress respects the judicial process with regard to the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit, the statement said. However, we must now await the final decision of the Supreme Court, as and when the appeal is filed. In the meantime, the Congress welcomes efforts by the parties concerned with the litigation to find an amicable and peaceful settlement.        
	The statement also said any distortion of the verdict by communal forces was detrimental to the larger national interest and would cause harm to the nations mood and desire for peace and harmony.        
	It was clear the party had done some fine-tuning in its approach. One, it had replaced the initial expression of welcome with respect and underlined that the September 30 verdict was not the final judgment.        
	Two, it had taken a holistic view, by rapping the BJP for distortion and not forgetting the vital aspect of the demolition in the whole Ayodhya episode.        
	The party had earlier been accused by some sections of Muslims of speaking a language similar to that of the Sangh parivar on the verdict.        
	The CWC also made it clear that the Congress would not take the lead in reconciliation efforts but only support any such initiative.        
	The meeting also discussed the Kashmir situation and the partys organisational elections. It was decided that a small committee would be formed to review the party constitution as many amendments were being suggested to make it more progressive and simpler.        
	A suggestion to hold an AICC meeting before the plenary in December was accepted. The new working committee will now be constituted at the AICC meeting itself, which will be held before Diwali in the first week of November.        
	The plenary, which will now be fully linked to the partys 125-year celebrations, will be held before December 20 instead of the initial plan for December 28.         
	Arjun Singh, A.K. Antony, Rahul Gandhi, Digvijay Singh, Prithviraj Chavan and G. Venkatsawmi did not attend the meeting as they were either out of Delhi or unwell.

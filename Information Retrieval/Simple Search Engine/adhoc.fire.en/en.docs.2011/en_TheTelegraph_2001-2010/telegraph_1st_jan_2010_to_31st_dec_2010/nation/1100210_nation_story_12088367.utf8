          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                    
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: The Supreme Court today asked the special investigation team it had set up on the Gujarat riots to explain allegations that it had withheld call records of top cops and ministers from a trial court.        
	A special bench monitoring the investigation into the major riot cases sought the explanation after solicitor general Gopal Subramaniam expressed concern saying crucial evidence was being withheld.         
	On December 2, 2009, the team had told the trial court in Gujarats Meghaninagar that the call records of late Congress leader Ehsan Jafri had been destroyed. Jafri had called up several police officials and ministers seeking help before he was burnt along with others in Ahmedabads Gulbarga Housing Society by rioters.         
	Former CBI chief R.K. Raghavan, who heads the special team, has been asked to reply to the charges.        
	Activist Teesta Setalvad had filed an affidavit mak- ing the charges. The reluctance by the SIT to get to the bottom of critical communications between those in power and key accused leading (the) attacks appears to stem from a design to shield the guilty, she said.

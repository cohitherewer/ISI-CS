                              Mohammad Haneef                            
	Melbourne, Dec. 21 (PTI): Indian doctor Mohammad Haneef has struck a deal with the Australian government for receiving a substantial compensation for his wrongful detention, three years after the episode which he said had a serious impact on his life and career.         
	Haneef, who was detained after being wrongly accused of having links to a failed attempt to bomb a Glasgow airport in 2007, returned to Australia last week to settle his compensation claim.         
	The 31-year-old doctor said the settlement would help him re-establish his career and reputation, and added that he would consider returning to the country.         
	The doctors lawyers refused to divulge details of the compensation but said the amount agreed upon was substantial.         
	Haneef and his lawyers completed two days of talks with the government in Brisbane today, news agency AAP reported. A decision to drop legal charges against former immigration minister Kevin Andrews was also taken at the meeting.        
	Part of the agreement is that the parties do not discuss the details of the settlement, Haneefs lawyer Rod Hodgson told reporters. I can say that Dr Haneef will receive a substantial compensation.        
	The compensation claim had also sought damages for lost earnings, interruption to his medical career, damage to reputation and emotional stress. Haneefs lawyers described the claim as unique in Australian legal history.         
	Before the mediation talks started, lawyers had said the compensation could be up to $1 million. Im very pleased and happy with the resolution of this matter, Haneef, who was accompanied by his wife Firdous and three-year-old daughter Haniyah, told reporters after the meeting.         
	My wrongful arrest and detention in 2007 was a very traumatic experience and todays settlement is a chance to end that part of my life and move on, he said.         
	He said he and his family still looked forward to returning to Australia as he thanked his friends and supporters in the country and in India who had been a great source of strength.         
	Haneef said he would consider the prospect of reapplying for his original job in Gold Coast. It certainly will take some time to get on track. I need to get my registration sorted and other things, and I need to discuss this with my family, he said, adding it could take less than a year.         
	On his return to Australia for the first time since his detention, Haneef had said he hoped the resolution of his claims would give him a chance to move on, although he believed it was too late for an apology.         
	The doctor had said Australia was a very fair place to live and work. The mediation process was held over two days and was chaired by former judge Tony Fitzgerald.         
	Haneef, who now practises in the UAE, will be in Australia for 10 days.

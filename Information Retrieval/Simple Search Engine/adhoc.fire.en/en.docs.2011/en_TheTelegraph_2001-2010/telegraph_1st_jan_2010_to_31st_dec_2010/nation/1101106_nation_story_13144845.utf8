The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress silence frustrates organisation
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Congress silence frustrates organisation
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Sheila Dikshit, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Prithviraj Chauhan applaud as Sonia Gandhi arrives at the AICC meeting in New Delhi. File picture                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 5: The Congress leadership has yet again betrayed its reluctance to discuss organisational matters, with the recent All India Congress Committee session choosing to focus on government schemes and political issues.        
	Senior leaders insist that all issues will be discussed extensively at the three-day plenary in December, but the claim inspires little hope because the AICC sessions silence on the various organisational problems is a clear indication of mindsets in the party.        
	The speakers at the meeting concentrated on praising the leadership and attacking the BJP. Even Sonia Gandhi chose to dwell on Kashmir, Maoists, Ayodhya, communalism, terrorism, inflation and environment while completely ignoring the partys plight in some states.        
	The rural job scheme, right to information, right to education, womens reservation, social security fund, food security, public distribution system, land acquisition act, the new mines and minerals act  they all figured in Sonias speech. But the deep resentment in the party over ticket distribution in Bihar did not.        
	This happened despite most senior leaders from Bihar choosing to be in Delhi for the meeting instead of campaigning in the ongoing election.        
	It isnt as though there was a ban on raising organisational issues. The partys success in the Kerala local polls was merrily discussed, but none mentioned the repeated defeats in Gujarat, including the latest in the civic elections.        
	The partys failure to reverse its decline in states such as Orissa is a challenge to its touted revival strategy, but the meeting conveniently bypassed the issue.        
	As for the claim that these matters will be debated at the plenary, even the longer sessions are so structured that ordinary party workers rarely get to speak their mind.        
	Even at the AICC meeting, those who were allowed to speak included the likes of Girija Vyas, Madhusudan Mistri, Ramesh Chennithala, Meenakshi Natrajan and Rashid Avi  people who anyway get regular opportunities to interact with the high command.        
	How desperate the ordinary party workers are to express their views before Sonia was reflected in an incident that happened when AICC members from Andhra Pradesh were being introduced to the party president.        
	All of a sudden, one woman delegate burst into an emotional speech, telling Sonia that the late Y.S.R. Reddy had harmed the party by only favouring the rich. Despite senior leaders efforts to calm her down, she went on unburdening herself before Sonia.        
	It was an expression of honest feeling that thousands of other party workers want to emulate  but never get an opportunity to.        
	The party constitution mandates that senior leaders meet ordinary workers at least twice a year at AICC meetings, and every three years at the plenary. But this schedule has not been followed in the recent past.        
	This AICC meeting was held after three years and the December plenary will be held after five years. The last plenary in Hyderabad was dominated by rural job scheme-related propaganda, with no attempt made to honestly discuss the partys weaknesses and the policy framework.        
	The last time senior leaders got together to discuss such matters in earnest was at the 2002 brainstorming session in Shimla. More such sessions were promised but did not happen.

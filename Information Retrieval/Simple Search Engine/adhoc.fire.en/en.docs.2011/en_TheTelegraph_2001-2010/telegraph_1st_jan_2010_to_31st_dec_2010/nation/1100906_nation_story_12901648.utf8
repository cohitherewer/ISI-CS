The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Deadline over, cops clueless
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Deadline over, cops clueless
          OUR BUREAU                          The Kukurjap dam in Jamui where the Maoists were supposed to release the policemen. Picture by Suman                                  
	Sept. 5: The three policemen taken hostage by Maoists had not been freed till late tonight and Bihar police officials seemed clueless about the trios whereabouts after the 4pm deadline for their release passed.         
	Last night, Avinash, a self-proclaimed spokesperson for the Maoists, said the three policemen would be set free at 8am today near Kukurjap dam in Jamui district.        
	This morning, Avinash told local journalists that the three  Abhay Yadav, Md Ahsan and Rupesh Kumar  would be set free by 4pm today.         
	Sources said the Maoists, by repeatedly going back on their word, were trying to buy time to escape from the forests in Lakhisarai that have been ringed by security forces.        
	Although additional director-general (headquarters) P.K. Thakur said the search operation had been intensified, the CRPF, the Special Task Force and Bihar Military Police personnel appeared confused about the combing operations being conducted. No chopper made sorties either.        
	Inspector-general (Bhagalpur) A.K. Ambedkar said searches were being conducted in certain pockets. Kuchh kuchh area mein operation hua hai (searches were conducted in some areas), he told The Telegraph. We had no official information about the release of the captive policemen till evening (5pm).         
	A senior police official camping near the dam, where the policemen were to be released, asked waiting media crews: We are in the dark. Do you have some information?         
	After the 4pm deadline passed, Avinash too seemed to have gone into hiding.         
	 The police claimed to have sealed all possible escape routes, but sources said a 40km stretch between Bhimbandh in Munger and Giridih in Jharkhand was open. The security forces fear to move into Bhim Bandh in Munger district even during the day after K.C. Surendra Babu, a Munger superintendent of police, was killed by the Maoists in January 2005, said a senior police official.

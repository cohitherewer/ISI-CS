The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Victoria PM calls attackers idiots 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Victoria PM calls attackers idiots 
                            
	Melbourne, Feb. 22 (PTI): The Prime Minister of an Australian state that has seen most of the recent racist attacks on Indians has dubbed the perpetrators bigoted, narrow-minded idiots and assured Indian parents of their childrens safety.        
	John Brumby, the Premier of Victoria, of which Melbourne is a part, said he would do everything possible to repay the trust the parents have placed in his government. I also understand those parents place their trust in the jurisdiction their child has chosen to live in to do all it can to look after the welfare of their children.         
	Writing in The Age, the Premier reiterated that the Indian community was a vital part of the multicultural Victorian society. There have been some disturbing incidents, and some of these incidents have had racist elements. Such racism begins and ends with a small number of bigoted, narrow-minded idiots. It is not part of our state, as evidenced by the thousands of Victorians who marched through city streets at the Harmony Walk last year.         
	His comments come against the backdrop of over 100 incidents of assaults on Indians in Australia, most of them in Victoria.         
	Brumby insisted that his government was working hard to bring down the crime rate and, though the number of assaults was too high, he said action was being taken regardless of the motive behind the attacks. Any violence committed in our community is an attack on us all, the Prime Minister wrote in the paper.        
	Brumby cited a recent Federation of Indian Associations of Victoria survey of Indian students that said 76 per cent of the 513 respondents were happy with their course and 72 per cent felt safe in the areas they worked and studied.        
	An attack motivated by race or prejudice is particularly disgraceful. The federal and Victorian governments have been as one on this issue, Brumby said.

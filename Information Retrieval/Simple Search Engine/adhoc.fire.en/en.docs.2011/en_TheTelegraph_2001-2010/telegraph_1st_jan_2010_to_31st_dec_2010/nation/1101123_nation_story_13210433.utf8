The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Swamy blames bureaucrats
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Swamy blames bureaucrats
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Subramanian Swamy                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 22: Subramanian Swamy today accused law ministry officials and other bureaucrats of trying to protect A. Raja by wrongly advising Manmohan Singh on whether to sanction the former telecom ministers prosecution.        
	It is regrettable that the law officers of the government had failed to apprise the Prime Minister of the law of the land that he must decide on the sanction question only on the materials provided by me, the Janata Party president, who had sought the sanction, said in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court.        
	On Saturday, the government had told the court the Prime Minister went by the law ministry advice to wait for the CBIs findings on the 2G spectrum row before deciding whether to clear Rajas prosecution.         
	The Centre had explained its position in an affidavit where it said Swamys letters for sanction had been dealt with and not ignored as the leader alleged.        
	Today, Swamy claimed the Prime Minister had forwarded his petition to the accused minister  Raja himself. This too is against the judgment of this court wherein it is held that in a petition for sanction, there is no dispute. Hence sending my letter of November 29, 2008, to Raja was patently illegal, he said in the affidavit.        
	Swamy also came down heavily on the PMO and other officials for allegedly trying to derail his attempts to pursue the probe of this monumental and unprecedented scam.         
	It details the sorry state of bureaucratic affairs in the nations highest seat of executive power: it appears to be geared to block any legal action against the corrupt acts of ministers. These officers have even flouted the manual of office procedure which they are obliged to follow.         
	Swamy appealed to the court to lay down guidelines to ensure such pleas from the common people to prosecute the high and mighty do not meet the same fate in the future. Such deliberate obfuscation by the bureaucracy in such an important matter of prosecuting corruption should be rectified so that in the future, a citizens efforts to set the law in motion is not rendered sterile.

	Los Angeles, Oct. 29 (Reuters): Liesl admitted she had a crush on Christopher Plummers Captain von Trapp, and Plummer said he dubbed The Sound of Music the Sound of Mucus as the entire von Trapp family cast reunited for the first time in 45 years.        
	In a broadcast of The Oprah Winfrey Show on Thursday, the 80 year-old Plummer, who has been reluctant over the years to even talk about the movie, joined Julie Andrews and the seven actors who played the children in the beloved 1965 Oscar-winning film for a session of reminiscing.        
	It made my career. It was that big of a movie, said Andrews, 75, who played the mischievous nun turned governess, Maria. We had no idea, really, at the beginning, that it was going to be that huge.        
	Plummer admitted having fallen in love with Andrews after seeing her on Broadway in My Fair Lady a few years earlier.                  The von Trapps as the world knows them. NOW AND THEN: 1 Duane Chase (Kurt),   2 Heather Menzies-Urich (Louisa), 3 Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich), 4 Christopher Plummer (Captain), 5 Julie Andrews (Maria), 6 Charmian Carr (Liesl), 7 Angela Cartwright (Brigitta), 8 Kym Karath (Gretl), 9 Debbie Turner (Marta)       
	The award-winning stage actor who had never before done a group interview with the rest of the cast since the movie was released, said he nicknamed the film Sound of Mucus because, there needed to be a cynic of some kind around to stop it from getting too saccharine.        
	Plummer recalled that drinking sessions in Austria, in gaps between shooting, had left him too big for his costume as the stern widower who whistles for his children.        
	Sixteen Going on Seventeen character Liesl, played by then 21 year-old Charmian Carr, admitted she had a crush on Plummer during the nine-month film shoot. I had a huge crush on him. He was so perfect, and he spoke with this perfect British accent, she said.        
	Heather Menzies, who played second eldest daughter Louisa, later posed for Playboy in the 1970s in a bid to shake off her squeaky-clean image. It didnt work, she said.        
	Thursdays Oprah show featured performances of songs from the movie by some of the real von Trapp great-grandchildren.        
	The Sound of Music won five Oscars, including best picture. A remastered 45th anniversary DVD and Blu-ray set, including sing-alongs, a map of filming locations and quizzes, goes on sale on November 2.

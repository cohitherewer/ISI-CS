          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: A probe into the mishandling of the parliamentary standing committees report on the nuclear liability bill has set the stage for changes in the way such panels function from the next session.        
	Chairpersons of such House panels will have to give instructions to their staff in writing, said the probe report prepared by the Rajya Sabha secretary-general and approved by Upper House chairman Hamid Ansari.        
	The aim, the probe report said, was to ensure that there is no room for any misgivings as in the instant case (the liability bill). This would obviate any criticism of the functioning of the (Rajya Sabha) secretariat.        
	The Rajya Sabhas secretarial staff was involved in drafting the nuclear liability bill report by the parliamentary committee attached to the Union science and technology ministry.         
	The House authorities found it necessary to clear the air on the role of the secretarial staff because the draft had raised a controversy.        
	Ansari was himself reported to be unhappy with the row, which was set off by the word and in the final draft.         
	The word almost wrecked the BJP-government consensus on the legislation and threatened to upset its passage in Parliament.         
	The BJP alleged that the and connected two sub-clauses of clause 17 of the bill in a way that suggested suppliers of nuclear plants were being given an escape hatch in case of accidents.         
	Eventually, after a gaffe, the word and was dropped and the bill passed by both Houses. The probe, however, steered clear of blaming individuals for the lapse.

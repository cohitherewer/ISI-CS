The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poor priority tag headache for NAC
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Poor priority tag headache for NAC
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: The National Advisory Council (NAC) that met today to discuss the draft of the National Food Security Bill had a new issue on hand.         
	That was whether all persons from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes should be categorised as priority households.        
	This category entitles households living below the poverty line (BPL) to a legal monthly entitlement of 35kg (equivalent to 7kg per member) at a subsidised price of Re 1 per kg for millets, Rs 2 for wheat and Rs 3 for rice.         
	The general households would have a monthly entitlement of 20kg (equivalent to 4kg per member) at rates not exceeding 50 per cent of the prevailing minimum support price for wheat, rice and millets.        
	NAC sources said when the draft bill, based on a note prepared by the convenor of the food security working group, Harsh Mander, was discussed, it was pointed out that all SCs and STs were not uniformly poor across states.        
	For instance, although Punjab had a much higher population of Dalits than Uttarakhand that might qualify as priority households, in fact they were much better off than the average person living in the hill state.        
	Similarly, Assam was a much poorer state than Mizoram that almost has a 100 per cent ST population.         
	The council was asked if that meant Mizoram would benefit by a universal application of the act that would cover the well-off and the poorer STs while Assam suffer because of having a mixed population?         
	We have to ensure that the law does not cause resentment among the states, a member said.

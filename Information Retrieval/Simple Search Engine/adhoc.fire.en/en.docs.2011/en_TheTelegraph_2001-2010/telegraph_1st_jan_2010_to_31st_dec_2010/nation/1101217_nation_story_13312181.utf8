The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Price of Kani link: cloud of doubt 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Price of Kani link: cloud of doubt 
  - Once a medal to flaunt, CBI raids turn glare on anyone who has connections with poet-turned-politician         G.C. SHEKHAR                           Father Jegath Gaspar Raj at a media conference in Chennai on Thursday                                        
	Chennai, Dec. 16: Even a casual connection with Kanimozhi used to be flaunted as a proud medal in Chennais social, cultural and political circles. Till the 2G scam reached its present crescendo, that is, and the CBI raids started.        
	Today, anyone seen close to the poet-turned-politician appears to have come under suspicion.        
	Father Jegath Gaspar Raj admitted as much while denying that scam funds have flowed into Tamil Mayiam, an NGO he runs and whose office was raided yesterday.        
	True in the context (of the 2G scam) created by the media, things have come under a cloud, he said today, asked if those associated with Karunanidhis literary heir had come under a scanner. We are being unfairly targeted just because we work with political personalities.        
	Gaspar Raj admitted that his association with Kanimozhi  one of the DMKs power centres  for the street festival Chennai Sangamam helped in getting logistical support from the state government. What he did not say was that it opened doors for him in the corridors of power.         
	We canvass for sponsors using professional agencies and not by dropping names, he said, trying to fight the popular perception that the Kanimozhi name brings in the funds for his projects.         
	Proximity to the Rajya Sabha MP is also credited for S. Saravanan, a man from a modest background, swinging a multi-crore land deal involving a 53,000sqft property on Chennais arterial road.         
	Kanimozhi claimed that Saravanan, who doubled as her secretary and her mothers business manager, had only acted as a mediator in the deal between 14 joint owners and a Malaysian businessman. But it is doubtful he could have cut in to the deal if it were not for his CIT Colony connection  a euphemism derived from the neighbourhood where Kanimozhi and her mother Rajathi live in a palatial bungalow.         
	The local media had been full of stories that Saravanan took control of the property when a dispute amongst the original owners had come to Rajathi for mediation, a DMK functionary said.                  Kanimozhi in   Parliament. (PTI)       
	Rajathi issued a statement today saying Saravanan, who used to work in her company, had become a real estate agent and had finalised the deal in his personal capacity and that she had nothing to do with it.         
	Poongodhai Aladi Aruna, the Tamil Nadu IT minister, is another Kanimozhi groupie. She owes her comeback into the ministry to the blessings of the mother-daughter duo. Poongodahi was sacked three years ago for arguing the case of a corrupt relative with the state vigilance chief, which became public through a leaked phone tap.         
	Poongodahi again finds herself in hot water after her phone conversation with corporate lobbyist Niira Radia  she described Karunanidhis son M.K. Alalagiri as a cut-throat politician  got leaked.         
	Now Alagiri wants Poongodhais scalp but Karunanidhi has resisted, arguing that dropping her now would alienate the votes of the Nadar community from which she hails.         
	Nakkeerans Kamaraj has got hit by a double whammy he is close to both A. Raja and Kanimozhi  not the best combination in these troubled times for the DMK. He, too, was raided by the CBI.        
	An unfazed Kanimozhi today made light of the CBI raids. This (the raids) is a process to show we are clean and DMK is very open to it, she said with a smile.

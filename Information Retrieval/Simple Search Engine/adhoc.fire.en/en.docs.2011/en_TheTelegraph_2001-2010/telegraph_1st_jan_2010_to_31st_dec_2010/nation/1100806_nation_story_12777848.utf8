	New Delhi, Aug. 5 (PTI): Finance minister Pranab Mukherjees anger at unsolicited telemarketing calls has prompted the government to crack down on what is increasingly becoming a public nuisance.        
	Terming it as an intrusion of privacy of telecom consumers, telecom minister A. Raja asked his ministerial secretary to take immediate steps to check the menace.        
	While Mukherjee expressed his exasperation on such calls after receiving one during a breakfast meeting to break the price rise imbroglio in Parliament, his cabinet colleague, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni, is cut up with unsolicited SMSes.        
	There is a place where you have to register your number to block calls and I have done that. So I am not getting those calls but I am getting SMSes on real estate in dozens and as a consumer I feel it is a violation of ones privacy and there should be a system to ban it, Soni told reporters outside Parliament.        
	A wide range of products and services are nowadays offered through telemarketing, which result in inconvenience and disturbance to telecom consumers, Raja said in a note to telecom secretary P.J. Thomas, asking him to convene a meeting and take steps to prohibit such calls.        
	BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu said: It has become a big nuisance as I am receiving about 30 to 40 unwanted calls a day. But now Pranabbabu has got such a call and I hope something would be done.        
	Mukherjee on Monday got a call offering him loans from a company while he was in a meting with Opposition leaders. Visibly angry, he handed over his mobile to minister of state for parliamentary affairs V. Narayansamy.

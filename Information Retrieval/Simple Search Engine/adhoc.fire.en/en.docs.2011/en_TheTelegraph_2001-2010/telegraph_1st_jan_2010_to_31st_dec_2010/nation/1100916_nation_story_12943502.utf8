                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Katiyar seeks temple solution through talks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Sept. 15: BJP vice-president Vinay Katiyar, an accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case, today asked for negotiations to settle the Ayodhya temple-mosque dispute.        
	We do not want a dispute, we want a temple and a temple through negotiations, Katiyar said, echoing senior BJP leaders in Delhi.        
	Sources said the party is apprehensive of a hostile verdict in the title suit. The verdict is due on September 24.         
	A day after the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court agreed to hear proposals for mediation on the Ayodhya dispute, Katiyar today insisted that the mediation model initiated by the Supreme Court recently to resolve the Nagaland-Assam border dispute be adopted for Ayodhya.         
	He lauded Ramesh Chandra Tripathi, a defendant of the title suit, who prayed for renegotiation of the dispute yesterday although Muslims and a section of Hindu petitioners opposed the application. Tripathis application will be heard on September 17.        
	I suggest the UPA government should join the Lucknow benchs mediatory move on September 17 as an intervener and work on a solution to the problem, he said.        
	Katiyar, a former Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal leader who is accused of playing an active role in the demolition, today steered clear of whatever the VHP would be doing. I am responsible for my actions as a BJP leader now, he said.        
	He also distanced himself from Kalyan Singh, the former chief minister who is a co-accused in the demolition case, who plans to visit Ayodhya tomorrow.        
	Kalyan told reporters today that he did not have any political agenda and the only purpose of his visit was to go and have a darshan of Lord Ram as the September 24 verdict might alter the circumstances in Ayodhya. At present, a makeshift temple stands on the disputed site.        
	Kalyan blamed the BJP  a party to which he belonged till some time ago  for causing immeasurable harm to the mandir movement.

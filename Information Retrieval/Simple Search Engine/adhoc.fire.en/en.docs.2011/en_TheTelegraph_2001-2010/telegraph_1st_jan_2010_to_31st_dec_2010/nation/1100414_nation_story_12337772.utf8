          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 13: Shashi Tharoor is being ably supported on the Web and TV by Jacob Joseph, his Man Friday.        
	Joseph, Tharoors officer on special duty at the external affairs ministry, dug deep into the Internet to throw up IPL chief Lalit Modis alleged involvement in a cocaine-peddling case as a sophomore in a US university in 1985.         
	Joseph posted the links to the news report on Twitter.        
	He also repeated the allegations on a television channel. What is the controversy about the Kochi team? Is there anybody there related to Tharoor? There are a lot of people seen at different public functions with him. Why single out Sunanda Pushkar? He is married to (Canadian) Christa Giles, said Joseph.        
	...And for your information, Modi is someone who was convicted for possession of 400 grams of cocaine and charged with assault and kidnapping. Those are the kind of people who we put in charge of cricket in this country, Joseph said in the interview.        
	The Supreme Court had dismissed a 2005 PIL questioning Modis standing as a cricket official in the light of the cocaine case.        
	The issue, Jacob said, is not about Tharoor or Modi, but about Tharoor and the rest of Kerala. We are going to take this on.        
	Tharoors friends, too, came out in his support on Twitter. Lalit Modi has much to hide, Tharoor only a girlfriend, wrote one.         
	saw the papers..why r we out to get the few sane politicians we have? tweeted author Chetan Bhagat.

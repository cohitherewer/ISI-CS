	Cuttack, March 31: Assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Suresh Chandra Ghosh, in charge of zone IV in Cuttack, has been suspended after a woman police constable accused him of sexual harassment.        
	The home department issued the suspension order on the basis of a report submitted by an inquiry committee on March 26, an official in the commissionerate of police said.        
	A senior lady IPS officer headed the five-member committee to probe into allegations that ACP Ghosh sexually harassed the subordinate woman constable at the Madhupatna police station in the city and created a hostile and intimidating work environment for her during much of the pre-noon hour on March 22.        
	The commissionerate of police had constituted the committee on March 25.

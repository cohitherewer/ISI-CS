          JOHN MARY AMP; PTI                      Relatives mourn near the coffin of their kin who died in the aircraft crash. (PTI)                          
	Mangalore, May 23: Class XI student Aaron Joel Fernandez, 17, had taken the ill-fated Air India flight after spending a vacation with his parents in Dubai.        
	After flying in from Dubai this morning, his mother rummaged through the morgue of Wenlock Government Hospital here and thought she had found her sons body  till she was told others had also claimed it.        
	Aarons father Frederick Fernandez had confirmed with their relatives in India that their son had died in the crash. The relatives had identified the body and had it kept at the government hospitals morgue.        
	The other claimant was the family of a youth from Kerala, aged about 30 and believed to be among the dead. They insisted the body wasnt Aarons and said the confusion stemmed from a case of mistaken identity.        
	A doctor examined the body but couldnt determine the age. Local BJP leader B. Nagaraja Shetty tried to settle the row but failed. A DNA test was the only solution.        
	This wasnt the only case. Twenty bodies, charred and in some cases without limbs, still have to be identified from the crashs 158 victims. Of the 46 dead Malayalis, the bodies of eight remain unidentified.        
	Among them are Aboobacker Siddique and Abdul Rasheed, who were coming home from Dubai to marry off their sister, Fousiya.         
	A team of experts has arrived from Hyderabad to conduct DNA tests, but relatives feared more delays because of the procedure. They urged the authorities to finish the task quickly and end their mental agony.        
	The father of Mohammad Ali, a cabin crew who perished in the crash, was desperate after being told that DNA tests would begin only later this evening. We want the DNA process to begin immediately so that we can be free of the unbearable agony, he said. The parents of another victim echoed the concerns of delay.        
	Kerala Opposition leader, the Congresss Oommen Chandy, urged the Centre to speed up the process. A DNA (test) is a scientific process which takes up to seven days to confirm a body. I have asked the authorities to do everything humanly possible to expedite the process and ease their agony, Chandy told reporters outside Wenlock hospital.         
	Doctors and nurses were focusing on the post-mortems as the bodies had started decomposing, after which they feared it would get even tougher to identify them.        
	For those who had managed to identify their loved ones, it was double-trauma  after the crash itself. Dental features, nails and jewellery were the main clues. Arguments were common when someone made a counter-claim.        
	Relatives of one Shailendra Rao from Udippi identified his body from the overlapping frontal teeth. Mohammed Ziyad, an insurance coordinator at Belhoul Hospital in Dubai, identified his mother Sulekha and her younger sister Naseema from their ornaments.         
	But unlike many others, the bodies of Ziyads cousin Mehzan and his son Rashad, barely two years old, were not charred. The close-knit family was coming for a relatives wedding.         
	Weve buried our dead. Life has to go on. The wedding (nikaah) will take place most probably as scheduled this Tuesday but therell be no celebration, said Ziyad.

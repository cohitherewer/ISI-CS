          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Security personnel guard the Taj Mahal on Wednesday ahead of Thursdays Ayodhya verdict. (PTI)                                        
	Sept. 29: The Muslim community is hoping for a peaceful solution to the Ayodhya issue if post-verdict, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi decide to act as peace-makers.        
	The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) chief, Maulana Rabey Nadwi, and other influential community leaders have appealed to all to abide by the rule of law. But some religious, political and social leaders are also deliberating on the post-verdict possibilities.        
	In the event of the legal suit going in favour of the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Wakf Board, the majority of the Muslim clergy is open to the idea of accommodating the construction of a temple, provided Manmohan or Sonia are successful in bringing the other side to the negotiating table for an honourable and peaceful solution that underscores the countrys age-old pluralism and co-existence.        
	However, there is no firm indication if the Prime Minister would be willing to embark on a potentially risk-laden path of resolving the emotive issue.        
	The contours of a possible Muslim gesture are still hazy, but there is a likelihood of the community sparing half of the 67 acres for the construction of a Ram temple.        
	Apart from Centre acting as mediator and guarantor, the community leaders look forward to creating a situation that will prevent future conflicts that are based on the festering wounds of history.        
	AIMPLB members said they were acutely conscious of the primacy of Lord Ram among the majority community and the need for communal amity in the country.         
	At the same time, the Muslim clergy feel that paramount concepts such as supremacy of the rule of law, dignity and sense of security are important for the collective growth of the country. In this context, there is near-unanimity among Muslims cutting across party lines that the existence of a mosque at the disputed site in Ayodhya has a special significance.         
	Moreover, they find nothing unusual in a mosque near a temple as there are thousands of places of worship spread across the country that are symbols of the countrys multi-cultural and multi-religious identity.         
	The Muslim community leaders are, however, extremely wary of approaching the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and its allies directly. The reluctance is rooted in a trust-deficit and the bitter experience of 2003 when the AIMPLB and Kanchi Shankaracharya had come close to an out-of-court settlement that fell through at the last moment.        
	The Muslim community is, however, sharply divided if the high courts verdict goes against the community. The moderate elements within the AIMPLB want an end to the campaign, citing religious texts that state a mosque cannot be constructed if the land is not legally owned.        
	However, another section wants the AIMPLB and the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Wakf Board to move the Supreme Court. This section believes such an appeal is needed not only because of the communitys sentiments, the need to use the legitimate option of moving a higher court and as an acknowledgement of those who suffered on account of the Babri dispute but also because it could act as a sobering platform that can defuse tension.

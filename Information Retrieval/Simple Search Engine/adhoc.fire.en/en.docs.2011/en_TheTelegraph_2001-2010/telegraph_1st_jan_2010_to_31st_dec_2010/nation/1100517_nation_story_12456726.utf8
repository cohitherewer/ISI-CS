The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Parties yet to decide Bihar RS seats
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Parties yet to decide Bihar RS seats
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, May 16: The one candidate who appears certain to enter the Rajya Sabha is Ram Vilas Paswan. Shrunk in his social base, Lalu Prasad is embattled in the endeavour to expand it. And as such, he has almost decided to field the lone Dalit leader from Bihar as the first candidate of the RJD-LJP combination.        
	But other than Paswan, no contestant either in the JD(U)-BJP or in the RJD-LJP can be sure of his success at the biennial polls to the Rajya Sabha scheduled take place on June 17 in Bihar. There are five vacancies to the Upper House from Bihar for which more than 25 people are standing in the queue keeping a close watch on their leaders move.        
	Speculation is rife over socialist veteran and JD(U) member of Rajya Sabha, George Fernandes. Chief minister Nitish Kumar sprung a surprise by getting the party patriarch acutely suffering from Alzheimers to the Upper House last year against the vacancy created by the entry of Sharad Yadav to the Lok Sabha.        
	Suffering from loss of memory, Fernandes even failed to comprehend that he had been elected to the Rajya Sabha. Aided by party leader Shivanand Tiwary and his wife, Laila, George somehow completed the formality to take oath as member of the House but never attended any of its proceeding. But Nitish then had announced: George sahib will continue as the Rajya Sabha MP as long as the JD(U) is strong enough to keep on getting him elected.        
	According to insiders, Fernandes, totally in the grip of the memory loss disease, does not even know that he is an MP. He no longer recognises anyone who calls on him. But Nitish is known for throwing surprises. So none in his party, even the close ones, is in a position to tell what the chief minister will do to the seat falling vacant against Fernandes completing the term.         
	With the premature death of Jamui MLA Abhay Singh, the Assembly has the strength of 242 MLAs.         
	Given the numerical strength of political parties, the JD(U)-BJP is all set to get three of its candidates through against two of the RJD-LJP combination.         
	Five seats have fallen vacant in the wake of retirement of R.K. Dhawan (Congress), Subhas Yadav (RJD), Fernandes and Ezaj Ali (JD-U) and Rajiv Pratap Rudi (BJP). The grapevine has it that the BJP may retain Rudi, who also figures as party spokesman in the team of president Nitin Gadkari.        
	But the fate of other retiring members are far from sure. The Congress, with barely 10 members in the state legislative Assembly, can retain its seat only if it strikes a deal with the LJP-RLD combination. But Sonia Gandhis party knows the price that Lalu Prasad can put for striking the deal with the Congress.         
	If the Congress thinks of retaining its Rajya Sabha seat, Lalu will not settle on anything less than a ministerial berth at the Centre which the Congress can ill-afford in the run-up to the Assembly polls in the state, said a Congress leader.

	Mumbai, June 4 (PTI): A Kingfisher flight about to land at Mumbai airport with 147 passengers on board was instructed to rework its touch-down route because a snag-hit plane was stuck on the same runway.         
	A collision was averted because the Kingfisher pilot obeyed the Air Traffic Controls instructions and immediately aborted the attempt to land.         
	Altogether, around 270 passengers and crew were on the Kingfisher and SpiceJet planes.         
	The incident comes within two weeks of an Air India flight overshooting the tabletop runway at Mangalore airport and going down a valley, killing over 150 people.         
	The Chennai-bound SpiceJet flight, SG 206, with 109 passengers on board got stuck on runway 27 just before take-off at 9pm because of the technical snag.         
	Around the same time, the Kingfisher flight, IT 318, from New Delhi was preparing to land on the same runway.         
	The ATC asked the pilot of the Kingfisher flight to do a go-around till the runway was cleared for landing. The pilot complied immediately and worked out a fresh approach route.        
	The aircraft, which had 147 passengers and eight crew members, landed at Mumbai airport shortly thereafter.        
	A SpiceJet spokesperson said the commanders of both the aircraft followed ATC instructions.        
	SpiceJet followed all instructions of the ATC and so did the Kingfisher flight, the spokesperson said.        
	A source with the directorate-general of civil aviation said that in keeping with ATC norms, the SpiceJet flight abandoned the take-off and went back to the bay.

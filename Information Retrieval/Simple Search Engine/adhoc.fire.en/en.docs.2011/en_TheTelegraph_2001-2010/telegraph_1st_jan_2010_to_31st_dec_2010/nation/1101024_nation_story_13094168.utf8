	 Calcutta, Oct. 23: Bengal Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim, 76, was admitted to a private nursing home on Saturday evening after he complained of acute respiratory distress.          
	Dilip Banerjee, a close aide of Halim, said the Speaker was on ventilation and his condition was critical. CPM sources said Hashim, who assumed the Chair in 1982, was at home when he began to feel uneasy around 6.30pm and soon developed breathing problems. He was shifted to the nursing home near EM Bypass. Earlier, on February 6, the CPM veteran had fallen ill during a visit to Kuala Lumpur to attend a session of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association of which he is the treasurer.

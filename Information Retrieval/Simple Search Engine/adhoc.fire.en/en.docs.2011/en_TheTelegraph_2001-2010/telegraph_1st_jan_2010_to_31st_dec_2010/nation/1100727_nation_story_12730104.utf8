	Ranchi, July 26: The hilly terrains have become more treacherous; the rivulets are overflowing, making the muddy tracks slippery; visibility is poor with the forests never looking so dangerous before.         
	Monsoon has made the anti-Naxalite operation more challenging, but the jawans are not deterred. They are marching forward, albeit a little cautiously.         
	Enthused by the successful operations in Latehar and Khunti districts after the onset of monsoon, the police headquarters has decided that the offensive against rebels would continue in its usual pace.         
	The men in khaki have been told that the rainy season is as disadvantageous for them as it is for the rebels. Hence, they should not feel that their enemy has the upper hand.        
	The motorable roads are virtually redundant for us as we are told to always walk. If camouflaging is easier for rebels taking shelter in the bushes, it also gives us an advantage. It may be argued that our jawans were killed in a landmine ambush in Barwadih on July 18, but the combing operation was successful despite the downpour. Last night also, we carried out successful operations along the Seraikela-Khunti border, said a senior police officer.        
	The jawans engaged in last nights encounter, however, complained that food supply was affected because of the rain. Though they were given raincoats, they had to take them off. There was no concrete structure around to take shelter and the security forces got soaked for two days.         
	Besides, the rivulets they crossed on normal days without making noise were now overflowing.         
	Khunti superintendent of police Manoj Kaushik too admitted that poor mobility was a great disadvantage during combing operations. It takes a little longer to reach the destinations. But the morale of the jawans was very high. They are fighting wholeheartedly despite all odds, he added.        
	Sources said in Latehar, the rise in the water level at Koel and Chaupat rivers had given an advantage to the rebels, who have taken shelter in different villages under Saryu panchayat in the Garu police station area. But new action plans were being worked out.        
	South Chhotanagpur deputy inspector-general of police R.K. Mallick maintained that the security forces were very eager to take advantages of the monsoon season.

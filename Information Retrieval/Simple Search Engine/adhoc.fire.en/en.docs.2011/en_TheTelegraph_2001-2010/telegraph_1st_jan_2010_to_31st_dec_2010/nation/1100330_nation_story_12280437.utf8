          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, March 29: A mine owner fighting a legal battle against Karnatakas powerful Reddy brothers was punched and hit with sticks, the assault coinciding with a Supreme Court-ordered survey of their mining leases.        
	Tapal Ganesh, in hospital with injuries described as not serious, alleged the hand of the three Reddy brothers  two of them ministers in the states BJP government  in the 11.30am attack in Bellary town today.        
	He has mentioned that he feels it (the assault) was with the support of the ministers from the district, said Bellary police chief Seemanth Kumar Singh. Ganesh had taken the Reddys, who own several mines, to court last year alleging they had encroached on Tumti Iron Ore Mines, a firm owned by his family in Bellary.        
	Ganesh told the police he was standing at a bakery near a hotel where a team led by Survey of India officials  who are camping in the town to conduct the survey ordered by Supreme Court  has been put up in the town, 350km from Bangalore. Suddenly, seven to eight men came in a vehicle, beat him up and sped away.        
	The apex court had last week ordered the survey to verify allegations of encroachment by Obulapuram Mining Company (OMC), which is run one of the brothers, tourism minister Janardhan Reddy, in Andhra Pradesh. The eldest of the Reddys, Karunakara, is the revenue minister. The other, Somashekara, is an MLA from Bellary City.         
	The Supreme Court has directed the survey team to complete its job in two weeks and file an interim report.        
	Janardhan, however, sniffed a conspiracy, alleging todays attack was the handiwork of his political rivals, particularly those in the Congress, to tarnish his image.         
	Perhaps, the conspirators also wanted to create an impression that law and order had deteriorated in the state, he said.

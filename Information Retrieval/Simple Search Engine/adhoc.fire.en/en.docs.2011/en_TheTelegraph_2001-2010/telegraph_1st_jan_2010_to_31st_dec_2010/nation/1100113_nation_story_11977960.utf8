	New Delhi, Jan. 12: India will create an online database of school certificates and college degrees spanning all legitimate educational institutions to curb the proliferation of fake degrees, human resource development minister Kapil Sibal announced today.         
	The government will use either the Central Depository Services Limited or the National Securities Depository Limited  the countrys two registered online depositories for stock market securities  to maintain the database.         
	The HRD ministry will draft a law making it mandatory for all schools and universities  government and private institutions  to register with the picked depository.         
	Once registered, the educational institution will transfer all certificates or degrees it is awarding to the depository.         
	Each student will have an identity number using which he can access his degree on the depository, and take a printout.         
	Prospective employers can also authenticate an applicants qualifications from the online depository.         
	But the depository will maintain individual security and only a student or those he authorises can access his degrees  for a fee paid to the depository.         
	The plan is learnt to be the brainchild of IIT Kanpur director Sanjay Dhande, who convinced Sibal to create a depository of academic qualifications along the lines of demat accounts used by stock market participants.         
	Sibal indicated that the plan may kick off by the 2011 academic session but HRD ministry officials warned that it may be premature to frame a timetable as the required legislation could take longer.

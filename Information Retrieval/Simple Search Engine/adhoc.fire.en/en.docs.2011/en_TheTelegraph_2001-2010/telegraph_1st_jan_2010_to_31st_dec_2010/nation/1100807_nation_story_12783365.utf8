          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Aug. 6: Rain devastated Ladakh today but in neighbouring Kashmir, it may have saved lives after seven consecutive days of bloodshed and deaths.        
	Heavy showers through the day kept most protesters indoors, offering the embattled state government a respite in the Valley.        
	A strict curfew remained enforced without break since July 30, but there was no loss of life for the first time in eight days.        
	Police said an uneasy calm prevailed through most of the day but a young man was critically injured in the late afternoon at Warpora, Sopore.        
	The youth injured in todays firing (by security forces) was rushed to hospital where his condition is said to be critical. The incident has triggered protests in the area, an officer said.        
	He said the government had been expecting massive protests today because Fridays offer people an opportunity to assemble. But it was raining heavily through the day, which kept most youths indoors, the officer said.        
	A police spokesperson said the situation was largely peaceful but stray stone-throwing was reported from Shopian, the Choon crossing in Budgam, and Warpora in Sopore.        
	He added: Some people set fire to the school building of Girls Middle School, Kalantra, in Baramulla and the Panchayat Ghar at DK Pora in Nowgam, Srinagar.        
	The latest round of protests that began on July 30 has left 31 people dead, mostly in firing by the security forces. The protests initially began on June 11 with the death of a teenager in police firing, and since then life has virtually been paralysed by curfews and shutdowns.        
	Chief minister Omar Abdullah has instructed the consumer affairs department to make available food grains through the public distribution systems outlets.        
	An official said the state government had decided to procure baby food and distribute it through its outlets. A sum of Rs 1 crore will be set aside for the purpose.        
	The state government has deployed three companies of the Rapid Action Force for the first time in Kashmir.

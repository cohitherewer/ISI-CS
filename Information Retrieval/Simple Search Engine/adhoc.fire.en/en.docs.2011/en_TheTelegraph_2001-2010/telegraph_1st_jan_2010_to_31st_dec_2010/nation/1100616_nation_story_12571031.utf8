          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 15: Denied entry as a wife, the young woman didnt just steal the lost grooms heart. She robbed his mothers locker as well.         
	The first to go missing was a gold ring. Then a mobile handset couldnt be found. Then it was the turn of saris, watches and a camera. Finally, the stove and two gas cylinders disappeared  all on Wednesdays.        
	Delhi police head constable Sharda Saini was at her wits end.        
	Someone was breaking into her house, in south Delhis police colony, every Wednesday and stealing valuables. This had been going on for six months now, and she didnt have a clue.        
	Saini then did what ordinary mortals do: approach the police.        
	The cops soon found out who the thief was.        
	About six months ago, Saini had asked an acquaintance, one Rakesh Sharma, to look for a woman who would be willing to marry her mentally challenged son.        
	Sharma introduced a woman called Shabana, 23, to the family but the marriage did not materialise as she belonged to a different community.        
	Shabana, though, was not ready to let go of the family, as investigators found out.        
	It emerged that though the family rejected the proposal, Sainis son Tushar (name changed) grew fond of Shabana. In fact, he was under the impression that they would one day tie the knot.        
	They started meeting regularly  every Wednesday  at a pre-set time when Tushar would be alone at home, according to the police.        
	Neither Tushar nor his mother knew that Shabana was already married, not once but twice, before she approached the Saini family.        
	According to the police, Shabana had married a labourer in a nickel polish factory in 2002.         
	But she abandoned him within three months after he started beating her up under the influence of alcohol.        
	Police sources said Shabana returned to her family, based in Mathura, only to return to the capital in 2005.         
	In 2008, according to the police, she got married again, this time to a taxi driver.        
	Then she met Anita, the leader of a gang of petty thieves. The 43-year-old, a mother of two, had reportedly deserted her husband 10 years ago and taken to crime.         
	After Shabana was introduced to head constable Saini earlier this year, she and Anita hatched a plan to rob the Saini family.         
	Shabana, according to the plan she and Anita had worked out, visited the police colony house every Wednesday and lured Tushar into giving her the keys to the locker where Saini kept all the valuables. Assuming he was giving the keys to his would-be wife, Tushar did not question Shabana.        
	Investigators said Shabana started emptying the house, step by step. Then she returned for more  the following Wednesday.        
	Last Wednesday, her luck ran out. The cops had laid a trap.        
	The police have recovered all the stolen articles. Anita has been arrested, too.

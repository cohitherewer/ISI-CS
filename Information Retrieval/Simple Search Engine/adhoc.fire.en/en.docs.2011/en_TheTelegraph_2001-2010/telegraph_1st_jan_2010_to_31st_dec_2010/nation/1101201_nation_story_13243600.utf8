          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 30: The National Investigation Agency has taken over the probe into extortion calls to four businessmen that sent a shiver up Calcuttas spine in February.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram said today: FIR No. 92/2010 dated February 26, 2010, of Bhowanipore Police station, Calcutta, was assigned to the National Investigation Agency for investigation on November 18, 2010.        
	Two businessmen had lodged complaints on February 26 after receiving the calls, made allegedly by Aamir Reza Khan, a Lashkar-e-Toiba operative and an Aftab Ansari associate.         
	The callers had allegedly threatened to abduct the businessmen if they did not pay the extortion amount, ranging from Rs 20 crore to Rs 40 crore.        
	Initial investigations by Calcutta police revealed the calls were routed through Dubai and Karachi. The state government approached the home ministry after Calcutta police failed to make any headway, a police officer said.        
	After February 20, calls were made to the offices of two reputable shoe companies in central Calcutta, the owner of a star hotel in south Calcutta and a businessman from Howrah. The police suggested that the caller, who identified himself as Aamir, was a Calcuttan accused in the American Center attack.

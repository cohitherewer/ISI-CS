The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre panel respite for divided BJP 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Centre panel respite for divided BJP

	New Delhi, May 26: The Congress-led UPA governments decision to refer the caste-based census plan to a group of ministers (GoM) has brought respite to the BJP, grappling with sharp divisions on such a headcount.        
	In public, the party accused the government of putting the caste-based census plan in cold storage by sending the matter to the GoM. But privately, leaders admitted, the majority of the partys top brass was opposed to the idea.        
	Spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy iterated the official line today when asked about such a census: The BJP had supported the demand in the Lok Sabha and our stand remains the same. But the government, it seems, wants to put the issue in cold storage. However, he did not specifically attack the government for referring the matter to the GoM, reinforcing the perception the party may be tacitly backing the move to buy time.        
	Yesterday, the BJP had urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to convene an all-party meeting, a call that was also seen as a sign of divisions in the party on the matter. The Prime Minister should call an all-party meeting on caste-based census, the partys principal spokesperson, Ravishankar Prasad, had said.         
	In private conversations, however, party leaders admit there is a dilemma. Other than the feeling that many of the top leaders dont want such a census, they realise that the Rashtriya Swyamsewak Sangh (RSS), the partys parent, opposes the idea on the ground that it would deal a blow to social harmony. The party is also worried that its support for caste in census could upset its core support base  the upper castes.        
	At the same time, however, the party does not want to appear anti-OBC when a large number of its MPs and key leaders  such as Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi  are from the backward classes.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, May 10: After Bollywood, its now a TV channel. The Orissa CID-crime branch investigating the Rs 500 crore chit fund scam in which public money was siphoned off has found links to New Delhi-based Lemon Entertainment Pvt Limited, as the funds have allegedly gone into the TV channel.        
	The scam involves transfer of money collected from nearly 2.14 lakh poor and unsuspecting depositors in Orissa by offering attractive rates of interest and returns to other companies and use in several other aspects, which impinge on financial regulations of the country and RBI guidelines.        
	The findings, according to sources, relate to diversion from Rs 394.58 crore allegedly collected by Fine Indisales, one of the chit fund-like money circulation business firms involved in the scam.        
	Investigations revealed prima facie that Lemon TV was financed with money collected by Fine Indisales, the company in which Bollywood actor-cum-producer Nasir Khan was a director. Findings indicate that a sizeable amount of money had gone into the news channel of Lemon TV, said a CID officer.        
	Bollywood film Shadow, released in 2009, was allegedly financed with money collected by Fine Indisales, the investigation revealed earlier. Investigation indicated that multi-level marketing companies had collected money from thousands of poor and unsuspecting people by offering high and attractive rates of interest against their deposits and then transferred to their accounts in Mumbai, Kanpur, Delhi and other places, an official said.        
	In the process, nearly Rs 500 crore had been apparently siphoned off from Orissa by several multi-level marketing companies and used in companies, which were closely held by a group of persons who are interlinked, the officer said.        
	Meanwhile, the investigating agency has filed its first chargesheet in connection with the multi-crore chit fund scam. Deputy superintendent of police P.K. Panda, who has been heading the six-member investigating team, filed an interim chargesheet last week in the court of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Balasore, implicating two directors of Mumbai-based Trident Advertising and Trade Link.        
	The charges, according to the sources, were framed against the two directors  R.V. Shinde and N.B. Navale  earlier this week under Sections 420, 468, 471 and 34 of the IPC and several Sections of the Prize Chit Fund Money Circulation Banning Act, 1978. Both were arrested in Mumbai on March 27. They are currently lodged at the Balasore jail, as their bail applications had been rejected.

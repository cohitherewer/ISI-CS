The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sena defeats Azmi son
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sena defeats Azmi son
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 23: Bal Thackeray got a sweet birthday gift, the Congress returned empty-handed and a Samajwadi strongman saw his son lose from a seat he had vacated, as results of Wednesdays Assembly bypolls in three states came in today.        
	The ruling BJP retained Chotila in Gujarat and the Opposition INLD held off a Congress challenge to wrest Ellenabad in Haryana in a battle seen as a test of Jat loyalty between chief minister B.S. Hooda and Om Prakash Chautala.        
	But the days biggest story was, perhaps, the defeat of Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmis son Farhan, who lost to his Shiv Sena rival in Bhiwandi East, a Muslim-dominated constituency in Maharashtra.        
	Azmi, the state Samajwadi president and one of the richest politicians around, had won from two seats in last years elections and later vacated Bhiwandi East.        
	In November, his refusal to take oath in Marathi led to an assault by legislators of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena headed by Raj Thackeray, the estranged nephew of Bal Thackeray.         
	Sena candidate Rupesh Mhatre, who won by just 1,676 votes, dedicated his win to Bal Thackeray. The Sena patriarch turned 84 today.        
	This victory is our birthday gift for Balasaheb. It is especially sweet, because this was a battle for the honour of Marathi manoos, Mhatre said. Abu Azmi dared to insult Maharashtra by refusing to take oath in Marathi. He thought people will forget all that because of his money power. The Sena victory took the partys tally to 45 in the 288-member House.        
	Samajwadi sources in Mumbai blamed renegade party leader Amar Singh for Farhans defeat. If Amar Singh had not made a tamasha and tried to extract political mileage out of Farhans electoral campaign by holding a rally for him with his Bollywood friends in tow, he would have won, said a source.        
	A close friend of Farhans father, Amar had held a rally at Bhiwandi with the entire Bachchan family and Sanjay Dutt earlier this month.        
	Amar Singh put off some of our regular voters for he is seen as the man who got Babri demolition accused Kalyan Singh into the party, the source added.        
	Samajwadi sources said Amar used the event just to send a message to party leaders in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Azmi was not available for comment, but sources close to him said he was unlikely to end his friendship with Amar.        
	In Haryana, the by-election in Ellenabad followed the resignation of Chautala, who had won from two seats.        
	INLD candidate Abhey Singh Chautala defeated Bharat Singh Beniwal of the Congress, which had hoped to bolster its thin majority. The partys only consolation was that the INLDs victory margin had come down from 16,000 to 6,000.

          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                               
	Mumbai, Dec. 18: Americas useless, better make friends with China.        
	Thats what Bal Thackeray thinks Delhi should do. But before you think its the Wen effect, heres why.        
	The Shiv Sena chief believes the Communist-led neighbour would prove to be a better ally than America in neutralising Pakistans terror apparatus.         
	In an editorial titled Chinshi Maitri Karach! (make friends with China) in party mouthpiece Saamna, Thackeray criticised Washingtons lack of concrete action against Pakistan and said it made more sense to forge enduring practical ties with Beijing.        
	Americans only talk of war on terror. It basically means America does not mind if (Osama bin) Laden or al Qaida indulge in violence in any country other than the US. Is the US planning to move in its forces in Pakistan or in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to help India the way it did in Iraq? If not, then we dont need your advice. Indian citizens are dying and the US provides Pakistan with millions of dollars of aid. Is this not encouragement to terrorism in a way? Thackeray said.        
	Instead of such useless friendship, he added, it is better to have practical friendship with China to fix Pakistan.         
	The editorial  published days after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao pushed for friendship with India during his visit earlier this week  lauded Chinas rapid growth. It said the country was marching ahead without getting enmeshed in the web of phaltu (useless) democracy.        
	Thackeray said India has had 14 rounds of talks to resolve the border dispute with China but there has been no sign of progress.        
	Even if 1,040 rounds of talks happen, it will not take the dialogue forward. We couldnt even tame Pakistan. We should forget dreaming about resolving the border dispute with China. We do not have the courage to attack China it is better to improve relations with China.        
	The Sena chief said China was the only country the US was scared of and would make a powerful ally. China has given the US a run for its money in economic, scientific and defence sectors, he added.

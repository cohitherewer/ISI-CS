The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Water waste? Pay a lakh

  - Rajasthan plans fine to enforce conservation        RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                          Fill with care                                        
	Jaipur, July 22: Save water or slake your thirst in jail  the choice is yours.        
	Recent guidelines issued by the Rajasthan government have made it compulsory for residents to conserve water. If they dont, the punishment is jail or a fine that can go up to Rs 1 lakh.        
	The new rules have come in the wake of a severe water crisis in the desert state, leaving the Ashok Gehlot government with little option but to come out with the order.        
	Under the guidelines, new buildings coming up on more than 300sqm plots must have a rooftop rain harvesting structure, an underground water storage tank and a water recycling plant.        
	Flouting the rules can lead to imprisonment for seven to 15 days or a penalty of Rs 25,000 to Rs 1 lakh.        
	The guidelines also say if these new buildings dont have provisions for such water conserving structures, they wouldnt be given electricity and water connections.        
	Home minister Shanti Dhariwal said the new rules were okayed at a recent cabinet meeting and no building plan would get sanction unless the blueprint had provisions for these structures.        
	Residents said the erratic monsoon had deepened the water crisis in the state. Water is now being supplied to homes in the capital every 48 hours.        
	Among the worst sufferers are people who have come from far-off states like Bengal to work as domestic helps. They live in one-room homes in dingy colonies and depend on the supply by the water department.        
	Malti, who works as a maid, is thinking of going back to her native Cooch Behar.        
	We have come here for money but if we dont get water, we would rather go back to Cooch Behar where water is not scarce, said the resident of Moti Doongri in Jaipur.        
	Here we get water every two days and that also after fighting over it. In my last 20 years here, nothing like this has happened.        
	In Ajmer and Tonk districts, water is being supplied to homes every five days. In Barmer, Bhilwara, Pali and Nagaur, it is once a week through trains and tankers.         
	In remote villages, water is being supplied through government as well as private tankers.        
	The erratic monsoon has left 75 per cent of dams in the state dry. A recent irrigation department report says 469 of the 618 reservoirs in the state are empty. Dams in Ajmer, Jaipur, Jhunjhunu, Sikar, Sawai Madhopur and Tonk have no water left. The three major dams in Jaipur  Ramgarh, Chaparwara and Kalak Sagar  are all empty.         
	In Jaipur, the water resources department has taken over private bore wells. There is also a plan to charge people extra if they use more water.        
	In his previous tenure from 1998 to 2003, Gehlot had faced the same problem of severe water shortage. The joke going around in political circles is that with Gehlot at the helm now, rain will again elude Rajasthan.        
	But with the strict guidelines in place, Gehlot, it seems, is ready to weather the crisis. If not rain man, he can play waterman at least.        
	Did anyone say the new rules needed to be watered down?

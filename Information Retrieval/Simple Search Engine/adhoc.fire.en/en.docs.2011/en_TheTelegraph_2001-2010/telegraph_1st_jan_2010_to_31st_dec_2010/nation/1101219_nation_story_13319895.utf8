The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Old foreign hands missing at plenary
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Old foreign hands missing at plenary
  - In a hurry, Congress does not invite like-minded political parties from abroad to attend meet         RASHEED KIDWAI                          Karan Singh                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: The Burari plenary is marked by the absence of representatives from foreign political parties that have longstanding ties with the Congress.        
	Past Congress plenary sessions have regularly been attended by delegates from parties such as the African National Congress, Awami League of Bangladesh, Nepali Congress, Labour Party of Britain, Baath Party of Iraq, Pakistan Peoples Party, Peoples Action Party of Singapore, and the Mongolian Peoples Revolutionary Party. Even the Chinese and Russian communist parties had often sent observers.        
	The previous plenary, held in Hyderabad in January 2006, had a separate enclosure for foreign delegates. Those from Africa, in particular, had attracted huge interest, though this had partly to do with the colourful headgears and hairstyles many of them sported.        
	Yes, we have not invited delegates from political parties from abroad who have been our friends. Christmas is round the corner; there were problems of logistics, security, etc, explained Union minister Anand Sharma, who has drafted the partys resolution on international relations.        
	But Karan Singh, who heads the Congresss foreign affairs cell, sounded regretful. I have not been kept in the loop. Please ask AICC (All India Congress Committee) treasurer Motilal Vora why these political representatives have not been invited, said Singh, who is also chairman of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.        
	A former Congress leader, who had worked hard to ensure attendance by foreign dignitaries during the partys centenary celebrations in Bombay in 1985, wondered how Anand could cite Christmas as the reason for overseas delegates absence.        
	The plenary was then held on December 27-28, much closer to Christmas, yet there was a huge turnout (of foreign delegates), the veteran said, terming their absence this year a sad commentary on the state of the present-day Congress.        
	Several Congress insiders echoed the sentiment, especially since this plenary is being held amid the partys 125-year celebrations. They said a political party that had led the freedom movement and helped unleash a global process of decolonisation should have organised its 125-year functions in a more elaborate manner. The Congress, they pointed out, is Asias oldest political party.        
	One reason for the omission to invite international delegates could be that the plenary has been organised in a very hurried manner. According to the partys existing constitution, the plenary is to be held by the current AICC, whose tenure technically ends on December 31.        
	However, its ties with like-minded parties abroad had been very important to the Congress in the days of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, who had championed non-alignment and pacifism throughout their tenures as Prime Ministers. The present-day party leadership not only fails to match these stalwarts global stature but also perhaps some of their global vision.        
	In any case, the Indian governments foreign policy has undergone subtle shifts in the changed world order, and how far the party is willing to take an independent line is an open question.        
	Also, the blurring of the line between terrorism and national struggle in an era of globalisation means the Congress would hesitate to be too upfront about its ties with some of its old friends abroad.

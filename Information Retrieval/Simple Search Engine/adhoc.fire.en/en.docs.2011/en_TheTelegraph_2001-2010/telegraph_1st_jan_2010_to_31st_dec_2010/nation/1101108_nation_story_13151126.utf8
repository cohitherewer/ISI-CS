	Mumbai, Nov. 7: As Air Force One winged its way through the Mumbai skies today, a senior US consulate official walked up to a CISF constable and pinned her consulate badge on his shirt before walking out of the VIP entrance.        
	The gesture appeared to symbolise the relief Indian and American security agencies felt after President Barack Obama ended his visit to the 26/11 city that had been bloodied in a terror strike two Novembers ago.         
	The arrangements in the run-up to and through the US Presidents Mumbai visit had, after all, been unprecedented and exhausting.        
	Exactly at 1.19pm, Obama and wife Michelle touched down on the tarmac in their chopper, Marine One. Both looked fresh, despite their morning engagements at St Xaviers and Holy Name High School. Their plane took off at 1.34pm, with aircraft movement suspended for 38 minutes before and after that, an official said.        
	Unlike the friction yesterday, security arrangements for the departure saw better co-ordination between Indian and US agencies. There was a small problem after the Americans insisted on clearance for a sniffer dog and his handler. That grew into an argument between the Secret Service and two Mumbai police officers on whether the dog should be allowed to board Air Force One.        
	There was a little flutter over the red carpet on the tarmac after it was suddenly removed. It was not a security issue. It is windy today and the carpet was flying in the breeze. So we thought it better to remove it, said a US consulate official.        
	A CISF officer, who has supervised security for many heads of state, said the Obama visit had been the most challenging. I never had to take such intense security measures. We had a huge CISF deployment. The entire operational area, including the domestic airport, the international airport and Apron L (where Air Force One was waiting), was sanitised several times, he said.        
	Colaba and Nariman Point sprang back to life after the St Xaviers event was over. The terrorists had completely shut down Colaba for four days in November 2008. Compared to that, this was nothing, Caf Leopold co-owner Farzad Jehani said.        
	I had to close down the restaurant completely yesterday. Today we had to briefly shut down. I didnt mind it because it was for a good cause.        
	Jehani, whose cafe was targeted by the terrorists, was one of the invitees to Obamas meeting with 26/11 survivors. I just shook hands with him. He applauded Mumbais resilience appreciated that Mumbai was back on its feet soon after 26/11 and promised that the fight against terrorism would continue.

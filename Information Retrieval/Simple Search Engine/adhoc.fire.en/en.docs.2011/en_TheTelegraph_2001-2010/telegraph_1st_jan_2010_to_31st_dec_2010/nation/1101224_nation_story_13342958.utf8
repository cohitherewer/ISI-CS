          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: The CBI has sought legal opinion to widen the ambit of its telecom probe to 2001 following the Supreme Courts directive last week to investigative all licences awarded over the past nine years.        
	The move came even as the agency prepared to question former telecom minister A. Raja tomorrow in connection with alleged irregularities in allocation of 2G spectrum.        
	Sources in the CBI, now investigating complaints of irregularities in 2007-08, said the bureau would have to start from scratch following the court directive, which delineated the contours of the probe that would now cover decisions taken by the BJP-led government also.        
	The sources said a fresh case would have to be registered as there had been no substantive complaints and also no prima facie evidence of any wrongdoing between 2001 and 2006.        
	This is why we have sought legal opinion on how to go about it to ensure compliance with the SC directive as well as investigate the matter, said an officer.        
	The issue came up for discussion earlier this week at a meeting chaired by CBI director A.P. Singh and attended by officials of the agencys anti-corruption branch.         
	Sources said Raja was likely to be questioned on advancing the cut-off date for allocating spectrum and on the role of his relatives in some companies that allegedly acted as a front for certain telecom firms which got spectrum between September 2007 and January 2008.         
	Raja, who flew to Delhi last night from Chennai, said he would cooperate with the CBI. I will appear before the CBI on December 24 at 10am. I will appear for interrogation, he said soon after he touched down.         
	The CBI had sent a notice under the Criminal Procedure Code to Raja on Monday, asking him to appear before it for questioning. Asked whether the former minister would be questioned at the CBI headquarters or at his residence, an agency source said it depended entirely on the investigating officer. The final decision is with the IO of the case, said a senior CBI officer.        
	On Tuesday, corporate lobbyist Niira Radia had been questioned at her residence.        
	The Supreme Court has asked the CBI to submit a status report on the 2G scam by February 10 when the case comes up for hearing.

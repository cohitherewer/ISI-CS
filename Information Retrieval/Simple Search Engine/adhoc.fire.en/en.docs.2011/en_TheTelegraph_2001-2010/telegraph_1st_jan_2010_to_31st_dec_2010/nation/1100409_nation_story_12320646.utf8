The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Moily issues warning to Dinakaran
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Moily issues warning to Dinakaran
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                      Dinakaran                          
	New Delhi, April 8: Union law minister Veerappa Moily today sounded a warning to Karnataka High Court Chief Justice P.D. Dinakaran who has been asked by a Supreme Court collegium to go on leave but has not heeded the advice.        
	The collegium said on April 3 that Dinakaran should go on leave and appointed Madan B. Lokur, the acting Chief Justice of Delhi High Court, in his place. Today, Moily said: The hands of law are long enough to catch anybody. Dinakaran is not above the law. Nor is he too big for the law.        
	Dinakaran, who has a slew of corruption charges against him, has not been allotted any judicial work since an impeachment motion was introduced in Parliament seeking his removal. The Supreme Court collegium stalled his proposed elevation after the allegations surfaced.        
	Dinakaran has, however, been handling administrative work such as allotting cases from his office at his residence. A section of lawyers claimed that this was affecting the working of the court.         
	The Chief Justice is yet to officially respond to the collegiums instruction. The Karnataka High Court website still shows him as the Chief Justice. Till he goes on leave, Justice Lokur cannot take charge.         
	Technically, if Dinakaran ignores the collegiums instructions, it can do nothing.         
	Under existing rules, the Chief Justice of India has no disciplinary authority over high court judges or chief justices.         
	He only has the moral authority to make an erring member fall in line. Several chief justices have demanded that the government fill this gap in the law. The governments ambitious Judges Standards and Accountability Bill proposes to address the matter, but it is yet to take off.         
	The law ministry has been planning for long to replace the Judges Inquiry Act with the new bill that will have a slew of other disciplinary measures for errant judges short of the impeachment process.         
	No judge has ever been impeached in Indias judicial history for lack of a political consensus in Parliament.         
	Ever since allegations of corruption were levelled against him in the wake of his proposed elevation to the apex court, Dinakaran has become a deeply divisive figure in the Karnataka High Court bar.         
	A section of lawyers has launched an agitation to have him ousted from office while another section has been protesting against his victimisation.         
	Those supporting him claim that he was being targeted because of his caste.         
	Justice Dinakaran is alleged to have amassed wealth beyond his known source of income. He allegedly acquired land, mostly community plots, beyond the prescribed ceiling.               
	About corruption charges against the judiciary, Moily said his government was trying to shift the focus from individuals to the institution. We cant work on an individual. We have to work on the system, he said.

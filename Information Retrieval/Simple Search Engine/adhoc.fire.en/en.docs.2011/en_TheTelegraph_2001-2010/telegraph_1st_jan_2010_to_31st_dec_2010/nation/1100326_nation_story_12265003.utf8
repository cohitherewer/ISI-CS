	New Delhi, March 25: The Supreme Courts interim go-ahead to the Andhra Pradesh Muslim quota means the poll-bound Bengal government can immediately implement its planned 10 per cent job reservation for the disadvantaged among backward Muslims if it wants to, legal experts said.        
	The Bengal government, which had announced the quota the day a high court had struck down the Andhra reservation last month, is involved in the lengthy exercise of identifying the backward classes among Muslims.        
	An earlier Supreme Court order had said that all the beneficiaries of a particular quota must be identified before the reservation is introduced.        
	This was one of the reasons the Andhra reservation had been struck down by the high court  the state had named only 14 beneficiary groups and left the rest unidentified, merely saying that certain specified socially advanced sections were excluded.        
	Today, however, the apex court interim order allowed reservation for these 14 categories, saying those already identified as socially and educationally backward should not be denied till all backward Muslim groups had been specified  a process that may take for ever.        
	This, legal experts said, should make it easier for the Bengal government to hurry the implementation of its Muslim quota  in an election year  without completing the enumeration of all the backward Muslim groups.        
	In case of a legal challenge, it could cite todays apex court order as precedent and ask that the backward groups already identified in Bengal be allowed the reservation while the state continued with its survey to later complete the list of beneficiaries.        
	A second point on which the Andhra law granting the reservation was set aside was its name: The Andhra Pradesh Reservations in Favour of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes of Muslims Act. The Constitution bans religion-based reservation.        
	The Bengal government has been careful on this count right from the start. It has announced that backward Muslims would get the quota benefits under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) head.         
	The Bengal government has also announced a creamy lawyer cut-off  a yearly income of Rs 4.5 lakh  to exclude well-off sections, fulfilling another court criterion.

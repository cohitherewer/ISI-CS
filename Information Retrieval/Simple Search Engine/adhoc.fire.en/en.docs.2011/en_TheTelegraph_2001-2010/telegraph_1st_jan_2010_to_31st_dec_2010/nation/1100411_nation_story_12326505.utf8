                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Amar hints at Bachchan split   No night at buddy home
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Amar Singh and Amitabh Bachchan at the inauguration of a studio in Pune in March. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, April 10: The hint came from a relaxed mind  Amar Singhs relations with the Bachchans were all but over.        
	In his latest blog, the expelled Samajwadi Party leader wrote that for the first time he did not stay with Jaya and Amitabh Bachchan in their Juhu bungalow while on a visit to Mumbai on Friday. He didnt explain why.        
	These days my mind is totally relaxed. First time I did not stay with the Bachchans. In the past, I used to book a hotel room because of the huge crowds (outside the film stars house) but I always made it a point to spend the night in their home. Jaya is quite ill, it was her birthday yesterday. I went to their place to wish her, enquire after her health and then I left. There was nothing odd about it, he wrote.        
	The blog entry came days after Samajwadi leaders made it clear they were keen to hold on to Jaya even as her brother-in-law Amar prepared to launch his own outfit next week.        
	At a Samajwadi programme in Jaunpur on April 6, party boss Mulayam Singh Yadavs son Akhilesh threw his support behind Amitabh, who has been under fire from the Congress. The Samajwadi Partys bond with Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan is unshakeable, Akhilesh said.        
	The next day, Mulayam spoke to reporters about the excellent relationship his party had with Jaya. She is with us, he said. Yes, she is.        
	The rest of Amars blog made no direct reference to Amitabh and Jaya. But the sub-text was loaded with a political message that said even great leaders like Indira Gandhi were courted by fair-weather friends who dumped her in distress and left her to lean on party workers who expected nothing from her in her good and bad times.        
	Those small workers who got nothing out of me (when he was the Samajwadis No. 2 as the general secretary), they are standing like soldiers besides me while those who used my position (for their benefit) have turned their faces away from me, Amar wrote.        
	He recalled that in the seventies, Indiras confidants included D.K. Barua and Karan Singh. But after her defeat in the elections following the Emergency, all of them left her, he said, including Barua, who is still remembered for his Indira is India and India is Indira coinage, and Karan Singh, who implemented Sanjay Gandhis family planning agenda as health minister.        
	If those who acquired clout through Indira Gandhi but were ready to drive a knife into her, who am I? he asked.        
	Amar could not be reached for comment. He is out of town and inaccessible, a family member said.        
	The last time he blogged on the Bachchans on April 1, Amar had obliquely justified Amitabhs association with Narendra Modi as the brand ambassador for Gujarat tourism after sharing a platform with the actor in a Pune college.        
	Their combined presence was supposed to clear the air that got fogged when Amar publicly expressed his disapproval of Jaya staying on with the Samajwadi as a Rajya Sabha MP.        
	It appears the fog has not been lifted yet.

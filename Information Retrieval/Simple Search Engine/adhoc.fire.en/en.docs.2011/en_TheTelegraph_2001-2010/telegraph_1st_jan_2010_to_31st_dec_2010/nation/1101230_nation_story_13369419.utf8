          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              Aarushi Talwar    
	New Delhi , Dec. 29: The CBI has closed the Aarushi Talwar murder case for lack of evidence, two and a half years after the Noida teenager was found murdered in her home.         
	The closure report was filed in a Ghaziabad special court today. It means all the suspects in the case will be free now.         
	In its report to the court, the CBI has expressed its inability to carry out any further probe because of lack of sufficient evidence in the case.         
	After completing investigation, the CBI has filed a final report for closure of case on ground of insufficient evidence in the court, said R.K. Gaur, the agencys spokesperson.         
	On May 16, 2008, Aarushi, daughter of dentist couple Rajesh and Nupur Talwar, was found dead with her throat slit at their residence in Noida.         
	The body of their domestic help Hemraj, who was the first suspect in the case, was found on the terrace the next day.         
	The case was riddled with missing clues, investigation goof-ups and wrong arrests.         
	A post-mortem confirmed that Aarushi was raped after being murdered. But the central forensic laboratory in Hyderabad said the vaginal swab of Aarushi sent to it was not hers.         
	The CBI failed to file a chargesheet against the accused  Talwars compounder Krishna and his alleged accomplices Rajkumar and Vijay Mandal  who are out on bail.         
	The agency also could not find clues from Aarushis mobile phone.         
	The case has been damaged beyond repair and crucial evidence was handled badly, said an officer.         
	The Talwars have decided to file an appeal against the closure report.         
	I am completely devastated and shocked. Aarushi has not got justice. We will continue to fight, Talwar told a TV channel.         
	Uttar Pradesh police, which was initially probing the case, had arrested Talwar on May 23, claiming they suspected this to be a case of honour killing.         
	The CBI, which took over the probe, arrested Talwars compounder Krishna on June 13, 2008. Vijay, the domestic help of one of the Talwars neighbours, was also later arrested by the CBI.         
	After spending 50 days in jail, Talwar was released.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In Mumbai, two India stories
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      In Mumbai, two India stories
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 29: If raconteurs are looking for the India story in Mumbai, be prepared for two narratives  a dichotomy that will probably ring true for many parts of the country.        
	In the upscale pockets and suburbs  where the absence of milk supply is the indelible memory of the 1993 riots for some  the message to move on from the past has become a fashionable catchphrase.        
	I am not bothered about the verdict. I think India wants to move on. Issues of faith dont move the new generation. As global Indians, we want to see the country as a superpower  such strife has no place in our lives. I remember the 1993 riots  we had no milk for eight whole days. The petrol pumps were closed. I dont want a repeat of that, says art-dealer Vartika Dalal, who lives in the Breach Candy area.        
	Echoes of her sentiment can be picked up from the bylanes of Hughes Road and suburban Bandra.        
	But in the downtown underbelly, the memories of the 1993 riots preclude the unavailability of essential supplies.        
	Mohammad Sami, a 44-year-old carpenter, and his family escaped through a back alley during the riots in 1993 but the state governments inaction on the Sri Krishna Commission report that indicted policemen throbs like an old wound.         
	Refusing to take chances, the Maharashtra government has invoked Section144, which prevents gatherings, from Wednesday till Thursday evening across the city to avoid a repeat of the communal violence in the early nineties. A red alert has also been sounded.        
	In Madanpura, a locality adjoining Nagpada from where Dawood Ibrahim, the architect of the Bombay blasts, hails, Jyothi Patel is looking forward to Diwali when she moves out of her neighbourhood after 40 years.        
	I wish the judgment came after Diwali, I am moving to a locality in Malad where my son has bought an apartment. My husband was set on fire by a mob, which included people we knew from the adjoining locality. Although things have settled down since then, the memories are too painful and I am praying trouble does not erupt here again after the verdict on Thursday, she said.        
	Some are willing to forget but not the inaction of the government. I cannot wish away the lingering pain when I see the very politicians who incited people into a murderous mob going scot-free. Why did not the state give them exemplary punishment? My brother was killed. I want results, not revenge, said Aftab Yakub, a carpenter in Jogeshwari East, the suburb where the riots first broke out on January 6, 1993.        
	A trust deficit exists. Thankfully, there is honest acceptance of this reality. There is an all-round effort to ensure that Thursdays verdict does not push Mumbai back into that same cauldron of violence, said social worker and lawyer Yasmin Ali Shaikh.        
	A prominent member of her local mohalla committee in Nagpada, Shaikh has been holding street meetings and plays in the area since the past fortnight.        
	Set up in 1994 following the riots by former police officers Julio Ribeiro and Satish Sawhney, the committees have been instrumental in defusing tension.        
	But we are leaving nothing to chance. There are always a handful of people who will try and provoke others. Tonight, we will patrol the streets, especially the entry and exit points of lanes. We are going to tell people in our localities not to fall prey to provocation, said Ayub Bhai, the head of the mohalla committee in the Muslim-dominated Naupada in Bandra East, adjacent to Shiv Sena boss Bal Thackerays home.

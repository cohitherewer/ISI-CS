The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Indian faces wife kill trial 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Indian faces wife kill trial 
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Dec. 8: Westminster Magistrates Court in London is certainly seeing quite a bit of action.        
	A day after Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, was sought by Sweden on sex charges, 30-year-old Shrien Dewani was due to make his appearance in the same court on the alleged offence of having Anni, his beautiful bride of two weeks, bumped off during their honeymoon in South Africa.        
	Shrien, whose family has a nursing home business in the west country, voluntarily went to a police station in Bristol at 10.38pm last night when he was held by Scotland Yards extradition unit  the same group which had earlier arrested Assange but in London.        
	The Gujarati community in Britain, reeling after the murder of Anni on November 13, is now in a state of near shock after Shriens arrest.        
	Brigadier Sally de Beer, of the South African Police Service national media centre, said: I can confirm that a warrant for the arrest of the husband of the slain tourist, Anni Dewani, was obtained by the South African police service after testimony implicating Shrien Dewani in her murder was given in court.         
	The warrant of arrest was forwarded to our counterparts in the UK  the foreign assistance division  who acknowledged receipt and advised that they would act on it .        
	In Britain, Shriens family have dismissed the accusation as ludicrous.         
	He is said to have recruited a taxi driver, Zola Tongo, 31, for 15,000 rand (1,300) to find the contract killers on his behalf.         
	What was odd was that Tongos confession was read out in court yesterday in precisely written English by a prosecution official.         
	So far no motive has been given as to why Shrien could have wanted to get his wife killed.        
	Such a bizarre plot would not be out of place in an Agatha Christie novel.        
	On the face of it, the couple, who married in Mumbai at the end of October, appeared to be happy. Later stories started emerging that Anni had been spotted crying on the flight to South Africa by cabin crew; and that the marriage had not even been formally registered.         
	Annis father, Vinod Hindocha, who lives in Sweden, was initially very supportive of his son-in-law. His relationship with Shrien, a UK resident, was a good one and I love him like a son, he declared.        
	But in subsequent comments, he changed tack and said that South African police should rule nothing out  thereby implying Shrien could be involved.        
	In Tongos written statement, he claimed that after the Dewanis arrived in Cape Town on November 12 he drove them from the airport to the citys five-star Cape Grace hotel.

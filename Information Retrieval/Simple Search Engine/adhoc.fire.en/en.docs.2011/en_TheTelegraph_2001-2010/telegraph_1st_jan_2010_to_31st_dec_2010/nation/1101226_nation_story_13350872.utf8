	New Delhi, Dec. 25: Former telecom minister A. Raja turned lawyer today, aggressively taking questions when the CBI questioned him on the 2G spectrum allocations for the second successive day.        
	He argued his case like a lawyer and was very aggressive while answering questions on policy decisions he took while awarding licences to telecom companies, a CBI officer said.        
	Armed with a file, Raja, a lawyer himself, arrived at the CBI office in his white Toyota Corolla around 8.55am. He was accompanied by a doctor and took the stairs to the anti-corruption branchs first floor office.        
	He was immediately taken to the room where investigating officers were expecting him. The doctor was asked to sit in another room. The questioning began at 9.15am.        
	He showed us some documents to present his side of the story relating to the award of licences to telecom companies. He denied having favoured any company and presented some papers in his defence, the officer said.        
	Next, the CBI confronted him with documents showing he had advanced the allocation cut-off date to allegedly favour some companies. He replied that what he did was in accordance with the law and the charges against him are motivated.        
	Raja also furnished some newspaper reports that allegedly tarnished his image.        
	He is very much abreast of legal tangles and demanded clinching evidence to show he was involved in wrongdoing. He was trying to be more aggressive today, the officer said.        
	At one point, we were clueless on what to question him. Now we will take some advice from legal experts before questioning him again.        
	Raja contested D.S. Mathurs claim that he had ignored his advice for auctioning 2G spectrum, saying the former telecom secretary had cleared files for issuing licences as per existing policy.        
	He showed us some internal documents bearing the signature of Mathur on files. We need to probe the matter further and will question Mathur if needed, the officer said.        
	Mathur is now retired and settled in Bhopal.        
	A CBI officer said the biggest challenge before the agency was to establish the money trail.        
	He said the modus operandi used by the scam accused was simple: float small companies with modest capital and then use these companies to bring in money now being looked on as bribe money.        
	The CBI suspects money has been invested in coal mines in South Africa and Malaysia fronted by Rajas men.        
	We have got a tip-off that money was invested in some mines in Malyasia and South Africa as well. We have already got some links after interrogating Rajas aides, R.K. Chandolia and A.K. Srivastava, as well as some hawala dealers, the officer added.        
	Rajas driver said: God knows when the questioning will be over. Its a festival day and the CBI people should wrap up the session soon. I have to buy a cake for my children.        
	The former minister came out of the CBI office at 4pm. No comments, he told mediapersons, smile intact on his face.        
	Asked if he would be questioned again, Vineeta Thakur, DIG CBI, said: It is an ongoing process.

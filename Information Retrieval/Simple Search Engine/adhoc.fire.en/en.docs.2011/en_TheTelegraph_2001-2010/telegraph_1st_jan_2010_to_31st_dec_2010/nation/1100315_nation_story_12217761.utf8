          OUR BUREAU                                              
	March 14: Maharashtra police today claimed to have foiled impending terror strikes on ONGC and two markets in Mumbai by arresting two men, while Gujarat celebrated a third catch: an alleged Kashmiri recruiter and bomb expert nicknamed Pepsi Bomber.        
	The three arrests last night, along with that of a top Manipuri rebel in Bengals Siliguri today, prompted the Union home secretary to crow about a good weekend for the security establishment.        
	Mumbai residents Abdul Latif alias Guddu, 29, and Riyaz Ali alias Rehan, 23,  described as ordinary youths from average families  were almost ready to carry out an attack when they were picked up at the citys Matunga railway station, an anti-terrorism squad (ATS) official said.        
	They had been under surveillance for three weeks and the police had been following their phone conversations with their Karachi handler whom they called Uncle, Maharashtra ATS chief K.P. Raghuvanshi said.        
	They had been directed to come to Pakistan with more recruits, but were asked to carry out one major strike in Mumbai before that. Their targets were ONGC oil installations, the Mangaldas Market and the Thakur Shopping Mall. They wanted to execute their plans soon; and setting fire to the targets was one of their plans, he said.        
	Mangaldas is a crowded garment market in south Mumbai, and Thakur Mall a large complex in the western Borivali suburb. The duo allegedly carried maps of areas like Sewri, Nhava-Sheva and the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre too.        
	The two youths earned their living doing small jobs, Raghuvanshi said. They are not very educated but seem to be proficient in operating computers. Latif is a resident of Bandra while Riyaz lives in Dahisar. Neither had a previous crime record.        
	The third accused, 32-year-old Bashir Ahmed Baba of Srinagar, was arrested from Samarkha village in Anand district. He was in close contact with Hizb-ul Mujahideen leader Bilal Shera who is based in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Gujarat ATS chief Ajay Tomar said.        
	Bashir had allegedly conducted recces on sites such as the Indian Space Research Organisation facility in Ahmedabad and the citys Akshardham temple, the scene of a militant siege seven years ago.        
	He had gained the nickname of Pepsi Bomber for his ability to assemble bombs in empty Pepsi cans, and had been arrested after Kashmir police had busted his factory. Out on bail, he had travelled to Gujarat where a tip-off from central agencies helped net him, Tomar said.        
	Bashirs chief job was to identify possible recruits, brainwash them and send them to Bilal in Pakistan for terror training, the ATS boss said. Bashir was in constant touch with one General Abdulla of the Jamiat-ul Mujahideen during his stay in Gujarat, he said. His job here was to set up a (Hizb-ul) network in the state.        
	The Mumbai duo had been tasked by Uncle to arrange for passports so that some of their associates could be sent to Pakistan, Raghuvanshi said. They had submitted the relevant documents to obtain the passports. Latif and Riyaz have been remanded in police custody till March 18.        
	In Siliguri, Manipur and Bengal police nabbed Ningthoujam Tomba alias Koireng, 57, commander-in-chief of the Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup.        
	The arrests cap a good week for security agencies following the arrests and seizures during the joint anti-Maoist operations on the Jharkhand-Bengal border.        
	This weekend, we have had three major successes. One module has been busted in Maharashtra. (and) another in Gujarat of the Hizb-ul Mujahideen, and the chief of the KYKL (armed wing) has been arrested. So its been good, Union home secretary G.K. Pillai said.

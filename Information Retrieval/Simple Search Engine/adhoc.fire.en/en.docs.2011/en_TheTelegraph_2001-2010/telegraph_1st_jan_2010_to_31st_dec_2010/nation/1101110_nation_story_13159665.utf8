          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 9: The Maharashtra Opposition today said the sacking of Ashok Chavan and Suresh Kalmadi was not enough and that the Centre must punish other ministers and bureaucrats involved in the Adarsh Housing Society and Commonwealth Games scandals.        
	It asked for a transparent probe into both controversies and warned the Congress against re-appointing Vilasrao Deshmukh or Sushil Kumar Shinde as chief minister.        
	Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray mocked the AICC as the All India Corruption Committee and said: Accepting the resignations of Chavan and Kalmadi is clearly not enough. The Congress should not pretend it is taking action against corruption.        
	He added: Action should also be taken against other ministers like Vilasrao or Sushil Kumar and senior government officials involved in the Adarsh society scam.        
	Uddhav cited how the Congress, after sacking Union home minister Shivraj Patil, chief minister Vilasrao and state home minister R.R. Patil following 26/11, had quickly rehabilitated them.        
	It should not happen again. The probe should be transparent and people should be convinced that the party had acted against those guilty. Kalmadis resignation has been accepted but people must be told where the money siphoned off from the Commonwealth Games went.        
	Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray echoed his cousin. If the Congress does not take action against anyone else.... Chavans resignation will be seen purely as a political sacrifice by the party to (erase) a blot on its image, Raj said.        
	The leader of the Opposition, Eknath Khadse of the BJP, demanded a probe by a retired high court judge covering all aspects of the Adarsh scandal. He said the Congress must not fall back on Vilasrao or Shinde as Chavans replacement.        
	If the Congress is trying to show that it has taken a moral stand to clean up corruption, it needs to appoint a clean chief minister, Khadse said.        
	Uddhav slammed the Congress leaderships silence on corruption at last weeks AICC session. I am wondering if it stands for All India Corruption Committee. If the Congress wants to clean up its image, it will have to take these steps, he said.        
	He criticised Chavan for claiming he had resigned on moral grounds. If he says he is not (in the) wrong, why has he resigned? He should have explained it to the high command.        
	Asked about Sena MP Suresh Prabhu, who is said to own a flat in Adarsh Housing Society, Uddhav said: Suresh Prabhu does not hold any post in the government, so there is no question of (him) exerting any kind of pressure on a transparent probe.

	Washington, April 13: Fourteen years after India ran foul of the international community by blocking the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) at the UN Conference on Disarmament (CD), prime minister Manmohan Singh today led the countrys partial rehabilitation at a multilateral non-proliferation gathering when participants at the Nuclear Security Summit here welcomed his proposal to host a Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership.        
	We welcome the announcement of the setting up of the Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership by India. This will be one more tool to establish best practices in our quest for nuclear safety, President Barack Obama, host of the Washington summit said within minutes of Singhs proposal for a one stop shop on nuclear safety studies in India.        
	I am happy to announce on this occasion that we have decided to set up a Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership in India, the Prime Minister said in his statement today to the 47-nation summit.         
	We visualise this to be a state of the art facility based on international participation from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other interested foreign partners. The Centre will consist of four Schools dealing with Advanced Nuclear Energy System Studies, Nuclear Security, Radiation Safety, and the application of Radioisotopes and Radiation Technology in the areas of healthcare, agriculture and food, Singh elaborated on the proposal.        
	The Centre will conduct research and development of design systems that are intrinsically safe, secure, proliferation resistant and sustainable. We would welcome participation in this venture by your countries, the IAEA and the world to make this Centres work a success, he concluded.        
	The warm welcome for the initiative by the summit, as described by external affairs ministry spokesman Vishnu Prakash, represented a dramatic turnaround for a country which created history in 1996 at the CD. It was only the first time since the creation of the CD that it failed to adopt a treaty text that it had been mandated to negotiate.        
	The Prime Minister announced at the summit that India has recently developed an Advanced Heavy Water Reactor based on Low Enriched Uranium and thorium with new safety and proliferation-resistant features.        
	The US has made the use of low enriched uranium one of the key elements in Obamas step-by-step efforts towards a world free of nuclear weapons.        
	The Washington summits final communique also called upon nations to convert reactors from highly enriched to low uranium.        
	Singhs announcement about Indias efforts to harmonise its practices with US objectives and the call in the summit communique promises to create more areas of convergence and co-operation between the India and the international community in the nuclear sphere.        
	The Prime Minister said India stands committed not to transfer reprocessing and enrichment technologies and equipment to countries that do not possess them.        
	The assurance is significant in the context of a reprocessing agreement recently reached with the US for the implementation of the nuclear deal and the readiness of France and Russia -- unlike the US -- to provide reprocessing technology to India.

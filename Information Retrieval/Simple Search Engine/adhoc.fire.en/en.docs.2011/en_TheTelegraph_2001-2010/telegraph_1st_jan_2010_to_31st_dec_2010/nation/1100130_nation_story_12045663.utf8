          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 29: The alleged rape of a Russian girl in Goa has prompted the Centre to ask states to set up tourism police by October or be blacklisted on its tourism website.        
	The Union tourism ministry had asked state governments to raise tourism police teams in 2008 but officials said half the states had ignored the directive and the rest had taken half-baked initiatives.        
	This time, the ministry may take serious measures such as blacklisting these states on the Incredible India website, an official said.        
	The ministry fears that the repeated attacks on tourists, especially women, would prompt travel advisories from foreign governments and hurt Indian tourism.         
	Under the guidelines, former armed forces personnel are to be recruited as tourism police after doing a training course drawn up by the Centre. They will be deployed at important tourist spots as well as railway stations, bus depots and airports, and will guide, advise and protect tourists.        
	They will not probe or prosecute but mainly protect tourists and respond to emergencies, giving them a sense of security and confidence.         
	Goa, ironically, has a tourism police as have states such as Kerala, Bihar and Himachal Pradesh. But these initiatives have mostly been half-baked, the official said.        
	For instance, the tourism police in these states are not ex-servicemen and have not been trained. Nor have these states opened any tourism police stations  they have just hired some personnel on contract, the official said.        
	He said the tourism ministry had promised to fund the training programme but no state had made use of the allocated funds. We had planned the same uniform for all states tourism police as that would have given tourists a sense of security. But the plan did not take off as many states did not care, the official said.

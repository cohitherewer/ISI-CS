          OUR BUREAU                               
	New Delhi, April 28: A laboratory instrument procured by Delhi University from Canada 42 years ago and lying unused for 20 years was the source of the radiation that has killed one person in the capital, Delhi police claimed today.         
	At least eight persons involved in the scrap business were exposed to gamma radiation from radioactive cobalt-60 earlier this month after they tried to process metal junk in their scrapyard in a Delhi suburb.         
	Atomic energy authorities had suspected that the cobalt-60 had slipped into India through the import of metal scrap, asserting that a rigorous inventory control and monitoring system would prevent a leak from domestic sources.         
	But Delhi police, who questioned the scrapyard workers, have traced it to the chemistry department of Delhi University, which bought it from Canada in 1968.         
	The scrap dealer had in February 2010 bought a gamma irradiator, which had cobalt-60, said Ajay Kashyap, the joint commissioner of police.         
	The university board decided to conduct an auction for the material after it was found lying unused in a room since 1985. When the dealer took the equipment apart and peeled off the cover, it led to radiation exposure, Kashyap said. A senior atomic energy official told The Telegraph tonight that the age of the instrument might explain why it never entered into the inventory maintained by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board.         
	The AERB was set up in 1983  and if the chemistry department stopped using it in 1985, the instrument might never have been registered, the official said. The age might also explain the strange wire-like shape of the cobalt-60 we found.         
	Investigations revealed that the source of radiation was a gamma cell used in experiments to analyse the effect of gamma radiation on chemicals, Kashyap said.         
	In the auction, it was picked up by a scrap dealer who dismantled it and sold its parts to other scrap dealers. The component containing the gamma cell reached Deepak Jain, who is now sick in a hospital after being exposed to radiation.         
	Jain and other workers in his shop were exposed to millions of times the background radiation. One of the exposed workers died in Delhi on Monday night after suffering from immune system failure.         
	A team of atomic energy scientists had removed the cobalt-60 to the Narora Atomic Power Station  the nearest site with human resources and facilities to handle open sources of radioactive material.

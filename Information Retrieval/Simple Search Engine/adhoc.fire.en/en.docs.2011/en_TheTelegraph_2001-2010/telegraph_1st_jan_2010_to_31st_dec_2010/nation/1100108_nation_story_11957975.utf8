	Srinagar, Jan. 7: A teenaged Kashmiri boy forced by poverty to drop out of school was at the heart of the 22-hour Lal Chowk siege, which the security forces ended today by killing both fidayeen.        
	Although the forces have so far killed more local militants than foreigners, Manzoor Ahmad Bhat alias Usman belonged to a rare breed  a Kashmiri suicide attacker. I cant say exactly how many Kashmiri fidayeen there have been  but they have been rare, a police officer acknowledged.        
	Relatives said Manzoor, who apparently took to the gun after the 2008 Amarnath land agitation, was just 17 while an officer claimed he was in his 20s.        
	The police said that Qari, the other militant holed up in Punjab hotel, which the forces stormed in the morning and reclaimed around 12.30pm, had turned out to be the usual suspect  a Pakistani.        
	The attackers had killed a police driver at the start of the siege at 2pm yesterday, and a civilian died today of his injuries, taking the toll to four (including the two militants). Nine people were injured.        
	An officer said Manzoor, from Seer village in separatist stronghold Sopore, was wanted in several militancy-related incidents. He was an active militant of the Harkat-ul Mujahideen and was involved in several attacks, he said.        
	A family member said: Manzoor would participate in the protests against the allotment of land to the Amarnath shrine board. He suddenly disappeared one day.        
	The months-long row left scores dead in Kashmir after security personnel used force to quell the protests.        
	Manzoor was one of the four sons of labourer Ghulam Rasool Bhat. His elder brother is a motor mechanic. Uncle Abdul Majeed Sheikh said poverty had forced Manzoor to give up school. He passed Class IX and took to painting (houses). Sheikh said hundreds had poured into the village for the funeral.        
	State police chief Kuldeep Khuda said both militants were from the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba and had been in constant touch with their Pakistani handlers. The Jamiat-ul Mujahideen has claimed responsibility, though.        
	Through the night and this morning, the security forces had rescued about 200 people trapped in buildings and shops around Lal Chowk, central Kashmir police chief H.K. Lohia said. Luckily, some of those inside Punjab Hotel had managed to escape last evening.        
	This morning, police and CRPF commandos breached the hotels rear wall and began firing. Some 15 commandos then stormed the hotel and secured it room by room, a source said.        
	Lohia said the first militant was killed at the staircase, after which the forces began clearing the floors from the top. On the second floor, we killed another militant. The operation was over by 12.30pm.        
	Around 11am, the hotel caught fire, possibly because of a gas cylinder blast. Fire tenders doused the blaze but the building suffered extensive damage.        
	Journalist shot at        
	Aman Farooq, a photographer with a local daily, was injured when a deputy superintendent of police allegedly fired to force photojournalists to leave a building close to Punjab Hotel. The police claimed the officers gun had gone off by accident, PTI said.        
	Farooq was injured in the thigh but the police said the bullet hit the ground and sent a stone chip flying that struck the journalist.        
	A medical examination showed no bullet inside (Farooqs) body, a doctor at a local hospital told PTI. The officer had also slapped another photojournalist, Yawar, before firing his weapon, a photographer alleged, adding that the incident took place after the encounter had ended.

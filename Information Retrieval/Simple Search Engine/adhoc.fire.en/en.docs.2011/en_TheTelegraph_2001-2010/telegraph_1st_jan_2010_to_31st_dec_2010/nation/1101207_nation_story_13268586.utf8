          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, Dec. 6: A senior Congress minister from Jammu has openly favoured azaadi for Kashmir and statehood for Jammu, embarrassing his own party and shocking ally National Conference.        
	Kashmir should get azaadi, state health and horticulture minister Sham Lal Sharma told a rally yesterday in Kathua, Jammu. Jammu should be made a separate state and Ladakh a Union territory.        
	A senior NC leader said his party would take up the matter with the Congress high command. He has gone too far on such a sensitive issue. Both azaadi and trifurcation are unacceptable, he said.        
	Congress leader Abdul Gani Wakil said: This is obviously not the partys point of view and the party should take note of it.        
	Sharmas speech came in the presence of state Congress president Saifuddin Soz. Party sources said his remarks had given ammunition to the Ghulam Nabi Azad faction to hit back at the rival Soz camp.        
	Sharma had claimed his solution was the best way to rid Jammu of the discrimination it allegedly faced. The discrimination is a major issue with both the BJP and the Jammu Congress leadership, but no senior Congress leader had ever before found a remedy in azaadi for Kashmir.

	Feb. 16: Nearly a thousand relatives and well-wishers of the slain Eastern Frontier Rifles (EFR) policemen surrounded a convoy carrying Bengal ministers at the forces headquarters today and banged on bonnets demanding Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee appear in person.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, who was leading the team of ministers to West Midnapores Salua, the EFRs headquarters, came out of the car and tried to pacify the people protesting against the lack of security.        
	The protesters also burnt effigies of chief minister Bhattacharjee and Kishan, the Maoist guerrilla wing chief who had claimed responsibility for last evenings raid at the EFR camp in Shilda.        
	Dasgupta had gone to the headquarters, near Kharagpur, with sports minister Kanti Ganguly, fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda, relief minister Mortaza Hossain and civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee.        
	Security at EFR camps and manpower should be increased. The eight-hour duty norm should be followed for the personnel (who often have longer hours). Our men dont get leave month after month. All demands must be met, yelled a woman.        
	Dasgupta tried to speak, but it was difficult initially. Many in the crowd, which included some EFR jawans, were shouting at the top of their voices. Later, when tempers cooled a bit, Dasgupta announced that the government would provide Rs 15 lakh to the family of each dead policeman and a job for a family member. In addition, their salaries will be paid to their families for the remaining years that the deceased would have served.        
	Dasgupta described those killed as brave jawans and said the ministers had come to Salua to share the grief of their family members. On my return to Calcutta, I shall brief the chief minister about your grievances. The state government will take utmost care to address them (grievances), he told the relatives.        
	The problems, including the lack of infrastructure at the EFR residential quarters in Salua, came up at the talks Dasgupta held with the relatives of the policemen in the commandants office till late tonight.        
	Basanti Chhetri, a relative of a slain policeman, complained that those over 40 were being posted in Maoist-infested pockets of West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura. Most of the personnel at Salua are also over 40. The suggestion was that younger men, who have better reflexes, should be sent to high-risk zones.        
	Hill bandh         
	The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has on February 19 called a 12-hour bandh in the area it wants as Gorkhaland to pay respect to the hill policemen killed in the Maoist raid.         
	The student outfit of the party has already called a 24-hour general strike in the hills on February 18 to demand permission to hold a rally in the plains.

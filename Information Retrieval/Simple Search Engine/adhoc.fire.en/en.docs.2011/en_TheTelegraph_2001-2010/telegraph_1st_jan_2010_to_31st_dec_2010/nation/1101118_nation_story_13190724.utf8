	Chandigarh, Nov. 17 (PTI): Punjab and Haryana High Court today pulled up the Haryana government over S.P.S. Rathore, asking how he was promoted as director-general of police while the Ruchika Girhotra molestation case was pending against him.        
	A division bench of Chief Justice Mukul Mudgal and Justice Rajan Gogoi directed the CBI to furnish notings on the service file relating to the elevation of Rathore. The file is currently with the central probe agency.        
	The CBI was also asked to furnish final probe reports in three fresh cases filed against the former top cop.         
	The agency had recently filed closure reports in an Ambala court in two of the three cases.         
	Two of the cases accuse Rathore of having doctored Ruchikas post-mortem report and got her brother Ashu tortured in custody after having him held on trumped-up charges.         
	In the third case, where the investigation is still under way, Rathore is accused of abetting Ruchikas suicide three years after the 1990 molestation.        
	The court also issued a notice to Sacred Heart school and directed the authorities to produce the inquiry report on Ruchikas expulsion allegedly at Rathores behest. The case will come up for hearing on December 24.         
	The court directions today came on a PIL filed by an advocate seeking a fresh case against Rathore for allegedly abetting the suicide of Ruchika.        
	The lawyer had filed the petition last December seeking a fresh case against Rathore under section 305 of the IPC (abetment to suicide of a minor or insane person). The punishment under this section can be a life term or death.        
	Rathore, serving an 18-month sentence in the case, got bail last Friday from the Supreme Court. He had been in jail for six months.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poisonous gases block NZ mine rescue
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Poisonous gases block NZ mine rescue
                            
	Wellington, Nov. 20 (AP): Anguished relatives voiced frustration as poisonous gases prevented rescuers from entering a New Zealand coal mine, partly owned by Indians a day after a powerful blast left 29 workers missing underground.        
	If I had my way Id be down there, Id go into the mine myself, said Laurie Drew, whose 21-year-old son, Zen, is among the missing.        
	Rescue organisers said the level of methane and carbon monoxide was still too high to send a crew into the Pike River Mine. Two miners reached the surface after yesterdays gas explosion, but there has been no word on 29 others. Police said the miners, aged 17 to 62, are believed to be about 1.2 miles (2 kms) down the main tunnel.        
	Unfortunately its just not as simple as putting on a mask and gown and rushing in there, the police search controller, superintendent Gary Knowles, told a TV channel. It does pose a danger to those guys underground and... a danger to the staff going in.        
	After a day of monitoring, air quality tests showed that gas levels had not dropped sufficiently and Knowles said the rescuers would remain on standby until the gases were next checked early Sunday.        
	He remained confident that the 16 mine employees and 13 contract miners had survived. This is a search-and-rescue operation and we are going to bring these guys home, Knowles said.        
	The blast was most likely caused by coal gas igniting, Pike River Mine Ltd. chief executive Peter Whittall said.        
	Electricity in the mine went out shortly before the explosion and may have caused ventilation problems and contributed to a buildup of gas.         
	The power outage continued to frustrate efforts today to pump in fresh air and make it safe for rescuers, though Whittall said air was flowing freely through a compressed air line damaged in the explosion.        
	We have kept those compressors going and we are pumping fresh air into the mine somewhere, Whittall said.        
	While Pike River Coal is a New Zealand-registered company, its majority owners are Australian. There are also Indian shareholders.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 16: When the BJPs prodigals want to return, they take to the skies to prepare the ground.        
	After Jaswant Singh, Uma Bharti may be the next to return amid a forget and forgive gesture from the party and its errant daughter.        
	The script for the sadhvis homecoming was again authored by L.K. Advani, who pursued a line similar to that followed in Jaswants case.        
	Uma accompanied Advani on a chartered flight today to Chhattisgarh. Along with Rajnath Singh and Ravi Shankar Prasad, they went to Kawardha to pay tributes to the departed father of chief minister Raman Singh.        
	Last month, Jaswant  expelled last August for his book on Jinnah that purportedly contained unflattering references to Sardar Vallabhai Patel  travelled on a private plane with Advani to attend the funeral of former vice-president Bhairon Singh Shekhawat in Jaipur.        
	The rediscovered mid-air bonhomie was seen as paving the way for the return of Jaswant. Asked if Umas comeback was imminent too, a source close to Rajnath said: It will happen, its a matter of time.        
	Apparently, Nitin Gadkari has endorsed the move. An aide of the BJP president said: Kal ki baat purani (bygones are bygones), when asked if Gadkari was ready to deal with Umas shenanigans at a time the party is buffeted with several problems.        
	The aide did not speak specifically about Uma but suggested the party was trying to leave old animosities behind. The presidents (Gadkaris) agenda is to consolidate and close ranks. We will not talk of individuals but the process is certainly on. He wants the BJP to put up a united front and bringing back the deserters is part of it. We have to forget the past and revive the party.        
	Asked how the BJP would explain Jaswants flattering allusions to Jinnah and the not-so-complimentary ones to Patel that had raised Narendra Modis hackles, the aide said: That expulsion has to be undone. Things flared up then in the heat of the moment. But we have not gained anything from the expulsion.        
	However, unlike Jaswant, whose proposed return has not been ostensibly opposed, the mention of Uma has got the Madhya Pradesh BJPs back up. State president Prabhat Jha said: There is no proposal (to get Uma back). She (Uma) was in Advanis home when he mentioned he was going to Chhattisgarh. She insisted she would go along.         
	Jha was evasive when asked if the state unit had reservations. Thats a hypothetical question, Jha said. It is learnt that Jha and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan  who earlier had differences on the whether Uma should be taken back have buried their differences and got together to prevent her re-induction.        
	Chauhans opinion counts. Since he won the state for the BJP a second time in 2008, his supporters see him like Modi in Gujarat.        
	Uma had floated a new party after breaking with the BJP in 2005 but drew a blank in the 2008 state elections. She was hailed as Madhya Pradeshs answer to Uttar Pradeshs Kalyan Singh  they are both backward caste Lodh-Rajputs  when she won the 2003 Assembly polls. But later, her detractors claimed Chauhan had consolidated the OBC base for the BJP and that Uma had nothing more to bring to the table any more.

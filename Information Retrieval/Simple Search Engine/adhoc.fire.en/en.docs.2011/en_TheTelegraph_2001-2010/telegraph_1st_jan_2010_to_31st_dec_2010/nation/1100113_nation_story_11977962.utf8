The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amar to party: No, thank you
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Amar to party: No, thank you
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 12: The one-day-old truce in the Samajwadi Party seemed to be unravelling today with Amar Singh publicly declining Mulayam Singh Yadavs invitation to a cultural festival and appearing to obliquely warn him about the price any final separation may carry.        
	In his latest blog, written in Hindi and posted this evening, Amar seemed to be sending a message to Mulayam and his son Akhilesh.        
	Some journalists asked me if I was privy to secrets about Netaji (Mulayam) and I replied that we shared a lot of things in confidence. On such matters, neither will he say a word nor will I. Rest assured that such things will be kept close to my chest till I die; they will die with me, Amar wrote.        
	He regretted, without explaining, that Mulayams cousin and Rajya Sabha MP, Ram Gopal Yadav, had made an issue of this comment as well. Amar signed off by declining Mulayams invite to be the chief guest at the January 24 closing ceremony of the ongoing cultural festival in Saifai, the Samajwadi chiefs hometown in Etawah district.        
	As soon as the blog appeared, Akhilesh phoned Amar. Akhilesh told The Telegraph: Amar Singhji and Ram Gopalji are members of our family. I spoke to Amar uncle. Its not proper to disclose our conversation. Netaji will make them sit together and hopefully thresh out the issues.        
	Asked about Amars refusal to attend the Saifai show, he said: Thats the least of the problems. The functions far off and I hope by then things will be sorted out.

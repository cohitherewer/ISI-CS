The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IITs, IIMs face crunch in shift
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      IITs, IIMs face crunch in shift
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: India has raised its national school education budget by over 30 per cent above last years expenditure, largely to implement its landmark right to education law that guarantees schooling to all children between six and 14 years.         
	But finance minister Pranab Mukherjees budget today also represents a shift in the governments financial focus away from higher education, and suggests that central universities, IITs and IIMs will need to tighten their belts.         
	The budget has reduced the allocation for running existing higher education programmes and institutions, reflected in a drop in the non-plan budget from Rs 6,437 crore spent last year to Rs 5,694 crore in todays budget.         
	This means that the countrys apex higher educational institutions will almost certainly need to either raise fees or levy extra charges on students in order to pay teachers and maintain their infrastructure.         
	The human resource development ministrys assessment suggests that the Centre and states will together need over Rs 170 crore over five years to implement the right to education law.         
	The budget today announced an allocation hike for school education from Rs 25,338 crore spent last year to Rs 33,214 crore this year.         
	Throughout the first term of the UPA and the first year in its second term, the government focused largely on higher education, promising new IITs and IIMs.         
	But the 2010-11 budget, while hiking the total allocation in higher education from Rs 14,389 crore spent last year to Rs 16,690 crore this year, has reduced the allocation on existing higher educational institutions. The non-plan allocation for the University Grants Commission has gone down from Rs 3,977 crore spent last year to Rs 3,450 crore.         
	This means that these universities will have less money to use on day-to-day expenditure.         
	The budget has introduced such a sharp decline in non-plan allocation for the IITs and the IIMs that even the hike in the plan component  for expansion  has failed to prevent a dip in the total allocation for these premier institutions.         
	This is worrying. We may have enough money to build new hostels but clearly will need to hike fees or charge students for facilities we are subsidising, in order to even pay our teachers, an IIT director said.        
	Besu funds signal        
	The Centre has allocated Rs 15 crore for the first time in the budget for converting the Shibpur-based Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) into an Indian Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology.         
	The allocation represents the first occasion that the Centre has made a budgetary allocation for the project that has survived several scares, and was almost called off last year after unrest on the campus. The allocation confirms that the human resource development ministry finally plans to take over Besu this year.

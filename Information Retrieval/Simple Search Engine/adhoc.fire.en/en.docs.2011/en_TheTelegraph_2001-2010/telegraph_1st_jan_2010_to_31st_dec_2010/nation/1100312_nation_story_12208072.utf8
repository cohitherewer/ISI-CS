          SANJAY K. JHA                       Sonia Gandhi                          
	New Delhi, March 11: Congress president Sonia Gandhi did not have to summon her political acumen and authority to drum into her male colleagues the importance of the womens reservation bill; they themselves drowned her in accolades for taking the revolutionary step.        
	The dinner she hosted tonight for her MPs, ministers and party office-bearers turned into a thanks-giving ceremony with no leader expressing reservations.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the Congresss principal trouble-shooter Pranab Mukherjee and Rahul Gandhi too received their share of praise.        
	By inviting the Congress leaders along with their spouses, Sonia had ensured that the MPs suppressed their misgivings well enough not to attract the wrath of their better halves.        
	Some disgruntled MPs who gave vent to their frustration before mediapersons in off-the-record conversations earlier in the day restricted themselves to devouring the spread of delicacies from Punjab, Rajasthan, Andhra and Malabar.        
	Very good step madam, excellent, wonderful, at least one MP was heard telling Sonia, a source said.        
	For almost an hour, Sonia sat at a table occupied by women colleagues, which was interpreted by Congressmen adept at picking up signals  imaginary or otherwise -- as a strong message of her intent.        
	But, a Congressman pointed out later, Sonia did move to other tables to ensure that the rest of the guests did not feel completely left out. She was jubilant and looking victorious. She told us how important the bill is. We also told her what she had done for empowering Indias women, an MP said after the dinner.        
	Matters were not so palatable earlier in the day. When Sushma Swaraj used the time after the Lok Sabha adjournment to try and turn around the bills opponents, the RJDs Raghuvansh Prasad Singh lost his cool and shouted: Kya sarkar ki dalali ke liye vipaksh hai (Is the Opposition here for brokering deals for the government)?        
	Sonia, too, reacted angrily when Sharad Yadav told her that she should think of poor, backward and Muslim women. The Congress leader said she was not anti-poor or anti-Muslim and she knew how hypocritical the sceptics stand was. Come for the debate and we will answer you, she said.         
	Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Sharad walked up to Sonia to request her not to push the bill in the Lok Sabha. Mamata Banerjee, too, joined in and egged Lalu Prasad on to convey his feelings. Instead of getting embroiled in a debate, Sonia asked these leaders to talk to Mukherjee.        
	Most male leaders are upset with the bill. One junior Congress minister felt that the era of three-time or four-time MPs was pass and the smaller parties would find it difficult to find suitable women candidates. It is going to help the Congress and the BJP, he said.

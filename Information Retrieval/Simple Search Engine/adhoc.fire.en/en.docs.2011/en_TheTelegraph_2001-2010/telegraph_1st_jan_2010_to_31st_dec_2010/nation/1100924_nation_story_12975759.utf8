The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ayodhya shadow on Bollywood lengthens
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ayodhya shadow on Bollywood lengthens
          PRIYANKA ROY                                    
	Calcutta, Sept. 23: The Ayodhya verdict has been postponed by a week. But Bollywood is considering plans to push back releases by weeks if the need arises.        
	Anjaana Anjaani, the Ranbir Kapoor-Priyanka Chopra romcom whose release was put off to next Friday in view of the verdict that was earlier scheduled to come tomorrow, may take longer to hit the screens.        
	After the Supreme Court today deferred the Ayodhya verdict, Anjaana Anjaani producer Sajid Nadiadwala is contemplating pushing back the film beyond October 1. Its (the verdict) an important decision for the country and is bound to affect almost everyone. We will review the situation over the next two days and take a call on Friday evening or Saturday morning. If the need arises, we will postpone Anjaana Anjaani beyond October 1, despite financial losses, Nadiadwala told The Telegraph this afternoon.        
	But the ripple effect of Anjaana Anjaani is being felt across a hit-starved Bollywood in the run-up to the festive season. Aakrosh, an Ajay Devgn-Akshaye Khanna action film scheduled for release on October 1, will now come two Fridays later, clashing with two other big films, John Abrahams Jhootha Hi Sahi and the Sanjay Dutt-Irrfan Khan-starrer Knock Out.        
	Originally set to release two weeks apart, Mallika Sherawats Hisss and Ram Gopal Varmas Rakta Charitra have set up an October 22 date.         
	Some feel that several other October films may spill over to November and, possibly, even December. There will be too many films to watch after October 8 but possibly too few takers, said trade analyst Komal Nahta.         
	The postponement of Anjaana Anjaani and Aakrosh has meant that every Friday in October will have a minimum of four to five releases. It is a very unhealthy trend with each film eating into the business of the other, said another analyst Taran Adarsh. Who has the time, money or inclination to watch so many films, irrespective of how big they are? he asked.         
	With the Dabangg rage slowly dying down, the postponements have revived memories of big-budget flops like Kites and Raavan. Its not a happy decision to make, especially with the festive season coming up. Postponing a film means continuing its publicity over a larger time, invariably denting the producers pocket, said Nahta.         
	With no Hindi releases for two weeks now and with the prospect of further postponements looming large, exhibitors are also feeling the heat.         
	As Dabangg is already in its third week and Hollywood content is niche, footfalls are at a low. Postponement of films will only make matters worse, said Virendra Marya, regional director, INOX.

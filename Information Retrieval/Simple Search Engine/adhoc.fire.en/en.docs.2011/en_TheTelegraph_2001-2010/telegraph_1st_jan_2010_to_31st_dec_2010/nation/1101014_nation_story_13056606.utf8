	Melbourne, Oct. 13 (PTI): An Indian-origin woman, who set fire to her husbands genitals, has been convicted of manslaughter.           
	Adelaide-based Rajini Narayan, 46, said she had set out to purify her husbands genitals because she suspected him of having an extra-marital affair but sprinkled petrol instead and set it alight when he abused her.

	Lucknow, Aug. 28: Two CRPF trainee jawans died after falling ill during drills this afternoon at a camp in Allahabad.         
	The two, who were among the 1,300 jawans recently recruited by the CRPF centre at Allahabad, were undergoing 44 days of training. One of the jawans was from Bihar, the other from Tamil Nadu.         
	It was extremely humid in Allahabad at noon today and during a 16km run on a circular track on the campus, four trainees fell ill, said an eyewitness.         
	The CRPF top brass has refused to explain whether norms were followed during the training that the jawans had done for 22 days. The force has not named the jawans yet.

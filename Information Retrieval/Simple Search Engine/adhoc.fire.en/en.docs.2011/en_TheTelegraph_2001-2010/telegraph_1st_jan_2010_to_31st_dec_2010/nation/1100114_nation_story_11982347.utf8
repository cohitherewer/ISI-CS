	New Delhi, Jan. 13 (PTI): An activist has complained to the Central Information Commission that it has not followed the mandatory norm under the RTI act of putting information about its functioning on its website.           
	C.J. Karira said the transparency watchdog had posted old information that had not been updated as mandated under Section 4 of the RTI law. At present, there are nine commissioners on the panel but names of six are missing from the list, Karira said. The website shows names of five commissioners, including two who have already retired. Chief information commissioner Wajahat Habibullah said it was good that the matter was brought to his notice and promised to get the information updated.                  
	Mumbai (PTI): A patch of grass near the runway at Mumbai airport caught fire on Wednesday afternoon when crackers were being burst to scare away birds. Two fire engines were rushed to the spot and the blaze was put off soon. Flight operations, however, were not affected, airport sources said.                   
	Chennai (PTI): Letika Saran, a 1976-batch IPS officer, has become the first woman director-general of police of Tamil Nadu. She will be the second woman to head a state police force in the country after Kanchan Chaudhry Bhattacharya in Uttarakhand. Saran became the first woman police officer to head a metropolitan city police when she took over as the commissioner of police of Madras in 2006.

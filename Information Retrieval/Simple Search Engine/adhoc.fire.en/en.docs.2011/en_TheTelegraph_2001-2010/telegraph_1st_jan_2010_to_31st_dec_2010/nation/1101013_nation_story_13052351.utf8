The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Debate rages on retest power
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Debate rages on retest power

	New Delhi, Oct. 12: Hans Raj Bharadwajs move has sparked a debate on whether a governor can ask a chief minister to face a second floor test after he has already cleared one by a voice vote.        
	However, the BJP may have saved everyone a lot of trouble by agreeing to have a second vote and thus setting a precedent.        
	The absence of rules, procedures or even conventions makes the issue particularly intractable, but two senior lawyers told The Telegraph the governor was within his rights in ordering a second trial of strength.        
	Bharadwaj has rushed in where another governor, Murli C. Bhandare, had feared to tread. After Naveen Patnaik passed a floor test by a voice vote amid Opposition protests in Orissa, Bhandare had called for video footage of the proceedings to satisfy himself that constitutional propriety had been observed.        
	Lawyer C.S. Vaidyanathan, however, defended Bharadwaj. The governor has to be satisfied that there was genuine voting and that the chief minister enjoys a genuine majority, he said.        
	Another lawyer, Altaf Ahmed, said: The House can have many floor tests.... The primary duty of a House is to give the people a government.        
	Vaidyanathan said footage of yesterdays House proceedings showed that no genuine voting could have taken place. He also questioned the rationale of a trust motion being decided by a voice vote.        
	Nobody even bothers to count the MLAs in a voice vote, he said. This is very wrong when the legitimacy of a government is in question.        
	Lawyers such as BJP leader Arun Jaitely have questioned a governors authority to direct a second floor test. Once the Speaker has ruled that a motion has been carried, his decision can only be challenged in the courts, the BJP has said.        
	But Vaidyanathan said that if a Speaker ignored an Opposition plea for a division of votes, the governor could step in.        
	If a chief minister refuses to have a second test, he does so at his own peril, he said. The governor can then report to the Centre that the government is not functioning in accordance with the Constitution, paving the way for Presidents rule.        
	The Sarkaria Commission, which went into the role of governors in the coalition era, has said the Constitution hands the governor a degree of discretion in testing a governments majority. But it is silent on how many floor tests a governor can order.        
	We have nothing to fear. We have a majority and we will prove it again, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said today.

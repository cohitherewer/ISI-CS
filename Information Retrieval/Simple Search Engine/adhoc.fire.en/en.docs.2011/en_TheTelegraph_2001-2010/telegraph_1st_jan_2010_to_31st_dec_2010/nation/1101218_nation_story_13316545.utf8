The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | God! Jimmy is big hit between covers   Google peephole across fields
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      God! Jimmy is big hit between covers   Google peephole across fields
          G.S. MUDUR                                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: Satyajit Rays Pratidwandi sparked many an ideological debate by posing this question: was the Vietnam war, which saw a communist-inspired resistance humble the mighty US, a more significant event than the moon landing?        
	Four decades on, scientific research may have provided a shot in the arm for the anti-capitalist camp with a tangential answer. The worlds largest analysis of digitised books, which has revealed trends embedded in two centuries of human culture, suggests Che Guevara has consistently been ahead of Neil Armstrong in popularity since the time both attained fame.        
	The Americans shouldnt feel too dejected. One of the most startling revelations is that former US President Jimmy Carter beats the likes of Che, Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein hollow in the fame stakes, showing theres no magnet like political power.        
	The findings, which appeared today in the US journal Science, also suggest that Charles Darwin is a lot more popular than Einstein but both lag behind Sigmund Freud. Perhaps the message is: sex sells.        
	Diet patterns reflected in the study show ice cream reigning over sausages, burgers, pizza and pasta.        
	One trend may not surprise too many people: the frequency with which the word God appears in books has declined after peaking around 1830. Since the 1950s, it has remained steady but only at half the peak value.        
	Researchers at Harvard University, Google, and two other institutions came up with the findings, having used the textual content of more than five million digitised books as a peephole to watch trends across diverse fields such as language, fame, technology and censorship.        
	They analysed the frequency of carefully picked key words or phrases in the database of digitised books to quantitatively track trends from the year 1800 to 2000.        
	We can now use numbers for the very first time to describe some suspected trends. This analysis also allows us to identify previously unknown trends, Jean-Baptiste Michel, a researcher and team member at Harvard, told The Telegraph.        
	He cited some of the broad trends: We forgot the past about twice as fast in 1950 than in 1850; new technological inventions (now) make their mark about three times as fast; and fame comes sooner in life, rises faster, and goes away quicker than ever before.        
	The fame analysis suggests that post-peak fame half-life (the period over which fame drops to half the peak frequency) fell from 120 years to 71 years during the 19th century.        
	It also suggests that top politicians gain more fame than the greatest authors, who surprisingly are way ahead of the best-known film stars and that great mathematicians remain the least known.        
	Google plans to release an online tool to allow users to explore the power of culturomics all by themselves. The online interface will enable users to type in a word or phrase and see how its frequency of use has changed over the past few centuries.        
	While browsing this cultural record (could be) fascinating for anyone interested in what has mattered to people over time, we hope that scholars of humanities and social sciences will find this a powerful tool, Michels colleague Erez Liberman Aiden said in a statement issued by Harvard.        
	The researchers found that the textual content also reflected historical events such as the suppression of communities or censorship and the rise of epidemics.        
	A Jewish artist, Marc Chagall, was mentioned only once in the entire body of German texts from 1936 to 1944. The analysis has also found similar evidence of suppression in Chinese in relation to the events at Tiananmen Square.        
	The analysis has also shown that frequency peaks for words relating to infections such as cholera, HIV or influenza correspond strongly to patterns of disease spread or pandemics over the past century.        
	Michel and Liberman Aiden, who had earlier investigated the evolution of English grammar through frequency analysis of texts, approached Google in 2007 seeking a collaboration to use the worlds books to explore trends in culture.        
	Google has digitised 15 million books so far, and the Harvard-Google collaboration used 5,195,769 of these books from English and six other languages to create a colossal database of 500 billion words, representing four per cent of all books ever published.        
	The scale of this analysis is stunning, said Narayanaswamy Balakrishnan, professor at the supercomputer education and research centre at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, who was not associated with the study but is involved in a digital books project.        
	The computational analysis tools that examine the frequency of words in different texts has been known for many years, but no one has ever applied the technique to such a large body of text, Balakrishnan said. The results are unique and original.        
	According to the analysis, the number of words in English has steadily grown from about 597,000 in 1950 to more than 1,022,000 in 2000. About 8,500 words are added to the language each year.        
	The results also show a mismatch with dictionaries: about 52 per cent of words used in English books is lexical dark matter, that is, they are not documented in standard references.        
	The researchers also found that about half the words added to the fourth edition of the American Heritage Dictionary in 2000 were already part of the English language a century ago. Some newly added words, such as gypseous (containing gypsum or like gypsum) and amplidyne (a kind of amplifier), have shown a steep decline in frequency.        
	Some things dont change, though. Mickey Mouse, most beloved by children, is still competing in popularity with the late Hollywood actress Marilyn Monroe, who has embodied sex appeal in the male imagination for generations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP claims poll edge over ally
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP claims poll edge over ally
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                               Nitish Kumar, Nitin Gadkari				                                 
	New Delhi, June 16: The BJP says its strike rate is better than ally Janata Dal (United)s in the Bihar polls they have fought together, the claim prompted by fears the partner might break away ahead of elections later this year.        
	The contention, part of the BJPs efforts to pitch its net worth before its ally, makes another debatable point. Even in polls they fought separately, the BJP was ahead of the Dal (United), a BJP source said.         
	In politics, strike rate, a sporting term, is used to signify percentage of seats won.        
	In 1995, when current chief minister Nitish Kumar fought his first election after parting ways with Lalu Prasad as the leader of the Samata Party  the Dal (United)s previous incarnation  his party picked up only seven of the 310 seats it contested. The BJP won 41 of the 315 seats it fought.        
	In 2000, the first election they contested as allies, the BJP registered a 40 per cent strike rate, winning 67 of the 168 seats it fought, while the Dal (United) won just 21 of the 87 seats it contested, a 24 per cent strike rate.         
	The situation improved marginally for the Dal (United) in the next election in February 2005. It recorded a 40 per cent strike rate by bagging 55 of the 138 seats it fought. The BJPs strike rate was 36 per cent: it won 37 seats of the 103 in its quota.         
	In the ensuing elections in October that year  after the February state polls threw up a hung verdict  the Dal (United)s strike rate was ahead of the BJPs by 9 per cent. It bagged 88 of the 139 seats it contested. The BJP won 55 of the 102 in its share.        
	To bolster its case, the BJP is flaunting other figures: in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, it bagged 12 of the 15 seats (strike rate 80 per cent) it contested while the Dal (United) won 18 of the 25 (strike rate 72 per cent) it was given.        
	But the trump card was the byelections last September that jolted chief minister and Dal (United) heavyweight Nitish because they were held within months of his partys thumping Lok Sabha success. The Dal (United) won just three of the 12 seats it contested, while the BJP salvaged two of the six it fought.        
	But the BJPs claims go beyond numbers. Camouflaged in the figures, the BJP source said, are social realities.         
	The source maintained that despite Nitishs achievements in law and order  that had purportedly endeared him to the law-abiding urban upper and middle classes  these sections were still with the BJP.         
	It is being stressed that the BJP is blessed with formidable upper-caste leaders: C.P. Thakur for Bhumihars, Kailashpati Mishra for Brahmins, Radha Mohan Singh for Thakurs and deputy chief minister Sushil Modi for the Vaish trading class.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Raid on rebel hub sets off fierce firing
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Raid on rebel hub sets off fierce firing
          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                              
	Bokaro, Dec. 24: A raid on a rebel camp tucked away in the forests of Jhumra triggered a fierce 90-minute encounter between CRPF jawans and Maoists this afternoon.        
	The heavy exchange of fire near Beltharwa village left at least three Maoists injured before they beat a hasty retreat, said Imran Mallick, the commandant of the CRPFs 26 Battalion. The injured rebels were taken to safety by their fleeing comrades.         
	The senior CRPF officer said the Maoist camp yielded a huge stock of chemicals packed in containers, apart from 27 detonators.         
	According to Mallick, the CRPF had received a tip-off that about 50 Maoists had set up a camp in the forest somewhere near Beltharwa in the red zone of Uparghat. More rebels were expected to join the camp.         
	After collaborating with intelligence sources, a group of about 30 CRPF men went hunting for the camp around 1pm while another team of 24 followed a few hundred metres behind.        
	As the first team neared Beltharwa, armed Maoists, apparently guarding the camp, started firing indiscriminately at the jawans, who retaliated immediately. The gun battle continued for some time after which the back-up team arrived. The second group took position on the opposite side of the camp and returned fire. More than 600 rounds were exchanged before the Maoists panicked and scaled down the attack, Mallick said.        
	However, firing continued for some time, though intermittently. After about 90 minutes, the volley of shots stopped altogether, which signalled that the Maoists had fled, he added.        
	The security forces did not chase the fleeing rebels as it was getting dark. Later, however, they combed the area and stumbled on the Maoist camp.         
	There was blood all around the camp, which suggests that at least three Maoists were critically injured, if not killed. Our men also recovered a huge stock of chemicals packed in containers, 27 detonators, wires, explosive sticks, four gas cylinders, dozens of batteries, switches and cooking utensils from the camp. Most of the seized items are used for making bombs, Mallick said, adding that the chemicals were being sent to the forensic laboratory for tests.         
	He also lauded the jawans for busting the well-stocked Maoist camp in the deep jungle. IG (operations) Raj Kumar Mallick confirmed the raid and the explosives haul.         
	Sources said an additional team of security forces had been rushed to encircle the entire zone following reports that Maoists were moving towards Bokaro after an encounter with CISF jawans at Pirtand in Giridih, where the final phase of panchayat polls was held today.        
	In another development, zonal commander of CPI(Maoist) Shibu Manjhi was arrested from Surih in Nawadih this evening. Police had been looking for him for 15 years.

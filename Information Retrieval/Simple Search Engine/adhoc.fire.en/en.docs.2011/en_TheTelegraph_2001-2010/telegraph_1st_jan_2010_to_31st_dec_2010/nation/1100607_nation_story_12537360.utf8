          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 6: With just one day left for filing nominations, the states main Opposition party, Congress, is still undecided as to whether it will project an Independent candidate for the Rajya Sabha elections after BJPs sudden decision to abstain from voting.        
	Earlier, it was assumed that the BJP would support eminent industrialist Tara Patanaik whom Congress had projected as an Independent candidate.        
	However, alleging that Tara has a Congress background, the BJP today announced that it would not vote for a dummy Congress candidate. If we vote for Tara, it will only consolidate the position of the Congress in the state, said state BJP president Jual Oram.        
	He added that the party would maintain an equi-distance from both the BJD and Congress.         
	After the saffron party formally made its stand clear, the Congress hurriedly called its legislature party meet at noon at the Assembly for nearly three hours to finalise its course of action in the wake of the BJPs announcement to abstain from voting. But it failed to reach a decision and called for another meeting in the evening.        
	An Independent candidate barely needs the support of 37 single preference votes to win the Rajya Sabha election. Congress, with its 27 members, hoped that it could give a blow to the BJD by getting the tacit support of BJP, which has seven MLAs. We could have roped in another three MLAs to our side. But as the situation was changed due to the sudden political development, nothing can be said at this moment, said a senior Congress MLA on the condition of anonymity.        
	Sources said the Congress had been divided over the issue. They have approached the central leadership to wriggle out of the dilemma. We will do whatever possible for the better interest of the state, Congress legislature party leader Bhupinder Singh said.        
	The sources said after the sudden change of political scenario, Tara was also not willing to jump into the fray.

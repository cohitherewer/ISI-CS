	New Delhi, July 17 (PTI): A motor accident claims tribunal has awarded a compensation of Rs 30.57 lakh to a man who lost his eyesight after injuries in a road accident with an autorickshaw last year.        
	The tribunals presiding officer, Gurvinder Pal Singh, has directed IFFCO Tokio General Insurance Ltd to pay the amount to Bali Ram Singh, holding the autorickshaw driver negligent for the accident.         
	A driver behind the wheels of a mechanically propelled vehicle is duty bound to observe necessary precaution to avoid hitting other vehicles, persons and the users of a road. Having failed to observe such duty and having struck the motorcycle of the petitioner, causing him grievous injuries, Rohtash (the driver) was thus negligent, the court said.         
	It asked the insurance firm to disburse the amount within 30 days as the autorickshaw was insured with it.        
	While computing the compensation, the court took into account the fact that the 46-year-old victim, who was employed as an assistant supervisor with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, became 100 per cent visually handicapped after suffering injuries in his eyes and forehead.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi in a fix over friends
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Modi in a fix over friends
          BASANT RAWAT                          Narendra Modi                                  
	Ahmedabad, April 20: Nar- endra Modi is in a dilemma, over the other, and now beleaguered, Modi.        
	The Gujarat chief minister has been dragged into the controversy over the IPL with reports suggesting that he was keen to have a franchise for Ahmedabad for which his industrialist-friend Gautam Adani had made a bid, but lost to Kochi and Pune.         
	Adani had met IPL chairman Lalit Modi and Amit Shah, the Gujarat home minister who is also the vice-chief of the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) headed by Narendra Modi.        
	Although the chief minister has chosen not to react, he is believed to be upset that his name is being mentioned in connection with a controversy that has corruption angles. Modi, under whose chief ministership hundreds died in the Gujarat riots of 2002, has, however, a clean reputation with even his detractors acknowledging his fiscal probity.         
	Sources said that Narendra Modi was in a fix on which side to take as backing Lalit, who he was said to be sympathetic to, could tarnish his clean image. Also, siding with the controversial IPL chief could come in the way of his friendship with BJP leader Arun Jaitley.         
	Jaitley, a close confidant of Narendra Modi, is said to be opposed to the IPL chairman who enjoys a good rapport with several BJP leaders such as Vasundhara Raje.        
	Home minister Shah admitted that they were still not sure of their stand since both he and the chief minister were new to cricket administration.        
	We dont know what we are going to do. At the moment there is no clarity. We are discussing and consulting (seniors in Delhi), he said.        
	In the states premier cricket body, sources said, the only person well-versed in running the sport is Parimal Nathwani, a Rajya Sabha MP. Nathwani, also a GCA vice-president, is said to be guiding Modi and Shah, who runs the show on behalf of the chief minister.         
	Both Modi and Shah were said to have been inspired by Jaitley and Sharad Pawar in jumping onto the cricket bandwagon.         
	Jaitley is president of Delhi and District Cricket Association, while Pawar is a former chief of the Indian cricket board and president-elect of the International Cricket Council.         
	Sources said that as with most things, the chief ministers stand on Lalit too would be decided by the position taken by Jaitley. The BJP leader has stood by Narendra Modi and offered crucial advice on legal matters concerning the riots cases.        
	Like Jaitley, who is a Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat, two IPL governing council members from the state  Chirayu Amin and Niranjan Shah  are also against Lalit.

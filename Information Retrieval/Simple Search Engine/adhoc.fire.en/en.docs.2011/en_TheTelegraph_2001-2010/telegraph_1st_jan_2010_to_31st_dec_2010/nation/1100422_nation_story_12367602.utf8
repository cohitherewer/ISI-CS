The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi went slow on real CM: Jaswant
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi went slow on real CM: Jaswant
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      Jaswant Singh                          
	New Delhi, April 21: Expelled BJP leader Jaswant Singh today said the Centres drive to nail Lalit Modi was too little too late.        
	Had the UPA government acted on the information given by Rajasthans Congress chief minister Ashok Gehlot last year, the IPL could have avoided the mess it is now in, the former Union minister added.        
	Singh, who is from Rajasthan and was closely involved in its politics until the BJP expelled him in 2009, said the IPL commissioners Rajasthan connection was correct, although he did not know Lalit personally.        
	I am from Rajasthan and what I know (about Modi) is not speculative. He was the real chief minister (when the BJP was in power). The present CM of Rajasthan also said this, the Congress CM. If this is what he felt, the Centre ought to have done something when he gave the details of the allegations of Lalits wrongdoing. When the Centre did nothing, I withdrew myself. I have got other things in life, Jaswant told The Telegraph.        
	In 2009, a few months after he had dislodged Vasundhara Raje from power, Gehlot had implicated Modi in cases of financial irregularities that included land and infrastructure deals.        
	He also disbanded the board of infrastructure development and investment, which Modi was supposed to have controlled in the Raje-led BJP regime.        
	But curiously, when Gehlot was close to fixing Modis culpability in corruption cases, he pulled his punches. Nothing was heard of those cases. The whisper in the corridors of power was the Centre had pressured the chief minister to go slow, although he denied it.        
	Jaswant refused to divulge details of what he knew about Modi. It appears as if we are breeding a variety of laissez-faire entrepreneurship in cricket. The (IPL) cricketing teams are totally a copy of the British/European caps. Chelsea, Liverpool buy and sell teams, their players are paid handsomely. The idea was transferred from football to cricket, from the UK to India. But the football clubs are not outside the bounds of rules and law, the IPL should not be free of the shackles of law, he said.        
	For Jaswant, the great tragedy of the spectacular spectrum of sporting activity in India was that those controlling sports federations and associations did not play the game. I have spent a lifetime on horseback. I was asked to be chairman of the equestrian society but I declined. We must have someone who knows the game, he said.        
	Asked if Modi had ever wielded a bat or thrown a ball, he raised an eyebrow. Modi? he asked. The former finance and foreign minister said a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) alone was competent to uncover the truth about the IPL.        
	There is a fine saying in Hindi, Hamam main hum sab nange hain (we are all naked in the bathroom), or, if you wish to put it elegantly, under the shower. I feel very much that in one fashion or another, perhaps all political parties represented in Parliament, other than the communists, have tentacles that reach out into this swamp of corruption. It is very important for the republic to address itself to it because ultimately what besmirches Indias good name globally is corruption that is rife, Jaswant said.        
	Asked if a JPC, that would have members from all parties, might compromise the truth to protect the interests of their leaders, Singh said: I have been a JPC member and I can assure you that committees never undermine their functioning that way.

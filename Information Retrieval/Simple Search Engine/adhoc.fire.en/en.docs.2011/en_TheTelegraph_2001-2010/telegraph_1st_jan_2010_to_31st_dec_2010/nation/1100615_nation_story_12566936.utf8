The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Message To Bengalis: If You Love Tagore, Buy His Paintings
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Message To Bengalis: If You Love Tagore, Buy His Paintings
          AMIT ROY                                            
	London, June 14: An Indian art dealer in London isnt especially fussed that 12 paintings by Rabindranath Tagore, which are offered for sale by Sothebys in London tomorrow, are not being gifted to the Bengal government.        
	Indians have the money these days, he said in a conversation with The Telegraph. But if the Bengalis want to claim their beloved Tagore, they can jolly well buy them.        
	He takes the view, shared by many others in the art world, that the Dartington Hall Trust, which is selling the paintings to use the money in whatever way the charity deems fit, has a perfect right to do so.        
	Behind this view is the deeper feeling that lobby groups in India wake up and protest only when Indian art treasures or objects of emotional value, such as the belongings of Mahatma Gandhi, come up for auction in the West.        
	Sometimes, the auction houses are bullied into cancelling the sales, while on other occasions, Indian tycoons living abroad, such as Gulam Noon or Nat Puri, are encouraged to rescue them for the nation.        
	In this instance, it seems Tagore himself gifted the paintings to his great friend and companion Leonard Elmhirst, an Englishman. With his wife, the American heiress Dorothy Whitney Elmhirst, the couple purchased the Dartington Hall in Totnes, south Devon, in the 1920s and introduced progressive programmes in education, social reform and rural regeneration.        
	The Elmhirsts quickly drew the leading thinkers and artists of the time to the estate.        
	Tagore visited Dartington on a number of occasions and, in addition to his paintings, Dartington holds a huge archive of photographs, letters and other ephemera relating to the artist and his relationship with Dartington, all of which will remain part of Dartingtons extensive archives, the trustees have promised.        
	But they do not see why they should not sell what is theirs, especially as they are currently organising a series of events in 2011 to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Tagore.        
	But Vaughan Lindsay, the chief executive officer of the Dartington Hall Trust, has issued a not entirely convincing statement: Finding the space to exhibit these beautiful works has been a challenge for us and we hope their sale will allow them to be enjoyed to their full potential by a wider audience and hopefully by art lovers in the sub-continent.         
	Sothebys principal task is to raise as much money as possible for their clients (and for themselves) and a protest or two generally helps to draw attention to auctions and possibly push up prices. It will be disappointed if the auction house does not exceed the 250,000 it thinks buyers will pay for the 12 paintings.        
	However, it recognises that not everything can be seen purely in financial terms. Both Sothebys and Christies, who are strengthening their links with India, realise they cannot ignore popular feelings, even if they are from Bengalis who always welcome an opportunity to tell the world Tagore belongs to them. They also have to respect Indian sentiment if they are to engage successfully with India.        
	But for now, the message to Bengalis on the eve of the auction is a blunt one: If you want the Tagore paintings so badly, bid for them.

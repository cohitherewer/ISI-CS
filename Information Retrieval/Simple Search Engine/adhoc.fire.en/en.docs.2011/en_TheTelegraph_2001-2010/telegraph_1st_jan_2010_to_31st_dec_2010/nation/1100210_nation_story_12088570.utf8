The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Varun burns hand again
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Varun burns hand again
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                        Varun Gandhi      
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Varun Gandhis latest outburst might defeat the plans of certain Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and BJP lobbies to get him an important party post.        
	At a rally on Saturday in Shikarpur, western Uttar Pradesh, the Pilibhit MP reportedly said he would stop cow slaughter even if our hands are chopped and contrasted the areas dilapidated temples with the gleaming mosque minarets.        
	The remarks revived memories of the 2009 elections when Varun allegedly threatened to cut off the hand that dared attack Hindus, polarising Uttar Pradesh Muslims towards the Congress.        
	A member of the BJPs minority cell, which is verifying the media reports, said: He has enough Sangh and BJP supporters who believe a Gandhi scion should get the status he deserves. But such people are doing irreparable damage to the party.        
	Varuns parivar backers want him to head the BJP youth wing. This is a safe job because as a youth leader, he can sound aggressive without offending sensibilities, a source said.        
	The minority cell member, however, argued: Varuns profile doesnt depend on a post. He draws attention also as an MP. Anything he says will have a huge impact.        
	Varun claimed party president Nitin Gadkari had offered him the Uttar Pradesh BJP chiefs job when he met him Monday. I said no because I dont have any experience, although on the ground I am the only one working (in the BJP), he said.        
	Like cousin Rahul, he said the only thing he wanted to do for the next three years was understand Uttar Pradesh as a mass leader and not a party functionary.        
	Uttar Pradesh BJP sources said a proposal to make Varun the state unit chief had briefly been considered before being shot down. We made it clear that all of us, Hindus and Muslims, would revolt if this was done, a Brahmin leader said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 2: The Union environment ministry has cracked down on the Polavaram dam project in Andhra Pradesh, questioning the state about certain activities initiated without environmental clearance and without public hearings in Orissa and Chhattisgarh.         
	The dam on the Godavari, designed to deliver 960MW hydroelectric power, support irrigation of 290,000 hectares and provide drinking water to 250,000 people in 540 villages in Andhra, has encountered opposition from Orissa and environmental groups.         
	The environment ministry on Monday asked the Andhra government why a showcause notice should not be formally issued to it as work was continuing without environmental clearance for additional components such as embankments, drainage sluices and pumping arrangements.         
	In a letter to the Andhra irrigation department, the ministry said that after the project received environmental clearance in October 2005, it was referred to the Central Water Commission in January 2009, with proposals for construction of embankments to avoid land submergence in Orissa and Chhattisgarh.         
	The environmental appraisal committee had asked Andhra to conduct public hearings in both states. However till date, public hearings in Orissa and Chhattisgarh have not been held, the ministry said. The ministry has asked Andhra to explain why it has not held the hearings 18 months after it was asked to.         
	This project did not deserve environmental and forest clearance at all, said Himanshu Thakkar, an environment activist with the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People. The process has been completely vitiated.         
	Thakkar said the large dam will submerge 60,000 hectares in Andhra, including about 3,500 hectares of forests and 2,500 hectares each in Orissa and Chhattisgarh.         
	The South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People had earlier this year written to environment minister Jairam Ramesh that the Polavaram dam should violate a condition stipulated by Ramesh that it should not lead to any submergence or displacement in Orissa or Chhattisgarh.         
	The environment ministrys clearance in October 2005 had itself indicated that the project would affect 190,000 people in Andhra, about 6,300 persons in Orissa and 11,700 in Chhattisgarh.         
	In his letter, Thakkar had pointed out the contradiction between the October 2005 observations and the stipulation by the environment minister. Thakkar had also pointed out that the construction of embankments would itself claim land in Orissa and Chhattisgarh, including sections of forestland which would mean displacement of people and their livelihoods.

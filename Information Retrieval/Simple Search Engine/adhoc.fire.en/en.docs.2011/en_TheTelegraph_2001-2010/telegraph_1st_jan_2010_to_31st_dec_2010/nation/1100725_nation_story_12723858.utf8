The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Minister resigns but hides
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Minister resigns but hides
  - Acolyte sends quit letter to Modi home, CM hits back at CBI pick-and-choose policy         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              Amit Shah      
	Ahmedabad, July 24: Junior Gujarat home minister Amit Shah today resigned his post but went into hiding to evade arrest, a day after a CBI chargesheet accused him of murder in connection with the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter.        
	Shah sent his resignation this morning to the residence of his mentor, chief minister Narendra Modi, for whom the developments are a personal blow. PTI reported later at night that Modi had forwarded the resignation letter to the governor.        
	Modi, who holds the home portfolio and therefore risks the probe spotlight turning towards him, said in New Delhi that his right-hand man was completely innocent but his resignation would be accepted.        
	CBI officials said the agency had been searching for Shah since 1pm yesterday after he failed to turn up for questioning for the second successive day.        
	Sources said Shah, 46, was exploring all legal options to evade arrest and might even get himself admitted to hospital. His lawyers apparently plan to approach Gujarat High Court following a CBI courts rejection of Shahs anticipatory bail plea yesterday.        
	If convicted, Shah faces the death penalty or a life term. The charges against him include Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (murder of Sohrabuddin and his wife Kauser Bi), Section 120B (criminal conspiracy for murder) 364 (kidnapping of the couple), 365 (wrongful confinement of the couple), 384 (using Sohrabuddin for extortion) and 201 (destruction of evidence, including Kauser Bis body).        
	Shah, till recently considered chief minister material, is the second minister in the Modi cabinet after Maya Kodanani to have been accused in a murder case. Kodanani, accused of inciting the Naroda Patiya massacre of 2002, had to resign and surrender in March last year after Gujarat High Court cancelled her anticipatory bail.         
	Modi never came out in Kodananis support but one reason he is backing Shah is that he handled the crucial job of looking after Modis legal affairs related to the 2002 riots that could still jeopardise the chief ministers political career.        
	Apart from this, Modis blue-eyed boy and trouble-shooter handled nine portfolios including jails, prohibition, parliamentary affairs and law. The chief minister will therefore struggle to find a replacement  no one else can be expected to be as loyal.        
	Former BJP chief minister Suresh Mehta said that Modi kept his hands clean by delegating all his dirty work to Shah who executed it with ruthlessness.        
	Party insiders said Shah had failed to make a mark as an activist of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs student wing, ABVP, in the 1980s. But he later showed his mettle by helping engineer the party revolt in 2001 that ousted then BJP chief minister Keshubhai Patel, paving the way for Modis ascendancy to the hot seat.        
	Modi rewarded him with the junior home ministers job in 2002, months after the riots. Shah later broke the Congresss stranglehold over the co-operative bank sector and the Gujarat Cricket Association.         
	Shah, who dabbles in the share market, was born to a family of businessmen in Mansa, Gandhinagar. After graduating, he opened his own printing business but continued his association with the Sangh. In the 1980s, he came in touch with Modi, then a full-time Sangh pracharak.        
	When Modi was banished from Gujarat in the mid-1990s at the behest of Keshubhai, Shah kept in touch with him.

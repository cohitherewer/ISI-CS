	Mid-June, it was still cold in Leh. Not a severe cold but a cold that wasnt supposed to be there. Everybody kept their woollens and jackets on. The Ladakhi sun, known to blast the world below with unadulterated light, played hide and seek.         
	There were other symptoms of a winter reluctant to quit. Water was not exactly plentiful. Unknown to tourists in hotels, early morning, Lehs main street was lined with large plastic barrels and smaller plastic vessels waiting to be filled with water.         
	Through the day, labourers pushed carts. Each cart had a large steel drum filled with water and covered with plastic; back-breaking load for the person pushing it up Lehs inclined roads. The water was meant for restaurants, already open for the tourist season but having difficulty sourcing water because the extended cold meant lesser snow melted than normal.        
	A few days later, the weather improved. Tonnes of sunshine appeared. Then it inexplicably became cloudy and light rain fell, lowering temperatures again. By end-June it was back to sunshine.        
	Travel operators, however, dwelt on the seasons lingering concern  an emergent unpredictability of Ladakhs weather.        
	According to them, the tourist season had begun more or less on schedule but thanks to the erratic weather two things had happened till mid-June.        
	First, the Manali-Leh highway which carries the bulk of tourists arriving by road had been inconsistent. It would open for a few days; then it would shut because of unseasonal snowfall at one of the passes. The few months of the tourist season account for the bulk of Ladakhs revenue.        
	Second, there were tourists who reached Leh during the windows of fair weather or by air. But while out sightseeing they got stranded in remote areas because suddenly something unseasonal occurred, like snowfall or an avalanche. For the tour operators, this has resulted in additional logistics expense.        
	Yet, nobody speculated anything worse. The only sign of furious water in Leh was in the aftermath of a warm day in the mountains or that rare drizzle, when drains busied noisily with water and the occasional overflow left wet patches in town.        
	I wonder if anyone in Leh dreamt that a tragedy like a flash flood would happen in the cold desert, where local wisdom knows how to build keeping freezing winter in mind. But rain?        
	On the other hand, the nature of the destruction can be easily imagined for Ladakhs fabled cold desert geography is composed of naked hills and soil baked in the sun with tree cover only as occasional oasis. Thats what showed up on TV  plenty of mud and mudslides.

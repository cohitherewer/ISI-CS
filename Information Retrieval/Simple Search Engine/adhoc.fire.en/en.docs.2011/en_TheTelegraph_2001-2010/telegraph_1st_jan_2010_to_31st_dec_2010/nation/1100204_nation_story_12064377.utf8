The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fake attack charge on Indian in Australia
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Fake attack charge on Indian in Australia
                            
	Melbourne, Feb. 3 (Agencies): An Indian man who claimed he was set on fire in a racial attack in Australia was actually burnt while torching his car for a spurious insurance claim, police said today.        
	Jaspreet Singh, 29, of Essendon, who reported the attack on January 8 after sustaining 15 per cent burn injuries, was today charged with making a false report to the police.        
	The police said Singh had purchased an opaque plastic container and filled it with nearly 16 litres of petrol, a day before he torched his seven-year-old car.        
	The container and other evidence were found at his home when he was arrested yesterday, the police said.        
	Inquiries have led us to believe that Singh is in some financial difficulty and he intended to sell his car but instead stood to gain $9,750 from insurance out of this particular incident, a senior constable said.        
	Singh, who is in Australia on his wifes student visa, had told the police a group of thugs had poured petrol on him and set him on fire when he was parking his car.        
	Keefe said police had obtained security footage of Singh buying a 15-litre opaque plastic container and 15.96 litres of petrol, a day before he claimed he had been attacked.        
	Australian politicians and diplomats today called for more balanced reporting by the Indian media, saying reports of racist attacks had done serious damage to Australias image in India.         
	The Indian public should be assured that the perpetrators will be punished, but please let the police and the courts get on with their work, Australias high commissioner to India, Peter Varghese, said in a statement.

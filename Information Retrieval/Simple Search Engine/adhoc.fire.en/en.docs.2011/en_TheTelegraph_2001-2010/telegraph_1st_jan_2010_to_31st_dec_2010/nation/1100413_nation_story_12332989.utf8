                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Economics to nail Pak
          K.P. NAYAR                               
	Washington, April 12: As expected, terrorism from Pakistan against India dominated the meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and US President Barack Obama.        
	The Prime Minister, whose expertise on economic matters is widely acknowledged and respected in the US, this time framed the problems arising from terrorism faced by India  indeed the entire South Asian region  in economic terms in his 50-minute conversation with Obama.         
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao told reporters after the meeting that Singh made it clear to Obama that in ensuring the architecture of high economic growth for countries like India, what happens in our neighbourhood is of crucial importance. The terrorist onslaught in our region, if it persisted, could affect our growth prospects.         
	It is a message which will create the right resonance in the US at a time Americans, looking for economic recovery, are banking on increased business interaction with the few countries, like India and China, which will have impressive growth rates this year.         
	When Obama told Singh that the US would like to see a reduction of tensions between India and Pakistan, the Prime Minister once again stressed the need for Pakistan to take convincing action against those accused for involvement in the Mumbai attacks of November 2008, the foreign secretary said.         
	Specifically, neither the composite dialogue with Islamabad nor Kashmir was ever mentioned in the course of the meeting.         
	Although Indian officials claimed that President Obama fully understood our concerns about the Lashkar-e-Toiba and other (similar) terrorist groups and told Singh that the US was engaging Pakistan on these issues, a White House readout on the meeting was pointedly silent on the Indian claims.         
	The farthest that the White House would go on Indian claims in this regard was merely to say that the two leaders... shared (a) vision for a strong, stable, and prosperous South Asia.        
	A point of convergence in the otherwise-differing Indian and US versions of the meeting was on Indias role in Afghanistan. The White House said President Obama welcomed the humanitarian and development assistance that India continues to provide to Afghanistan.         
	This represents a setback for a lobby within the Obama administration, led by the Presidents special envoy on Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, which wants India to be a benign power in Afghanistan and be more sensitive to Pakistani interests in Kabul.         
	Rao said Obama fully appreciated Indias interest in Afghanistan. But how far a President  who is severely limited in his room for manoeuvre by the need to constantly placate Pakistan and the Pakistani lobby within his own administration  will be able to translate such appreciation into anything concrete in support of Indias role in Afghanistan remains to be seen.         
	But the exchanges are important in the context of continuing attacks on Indian interests and facilities in Afghanistan resulting in deaths and destruction of property.         
	The White House acknowledged a robust relationship between the people of India and the US and predictably underlined the upcoming US-India Strategic Dialogue as the next step in that process.         
	The Obama administration preferred to underline the meeting between the President and the Prime Minister in terms of the need for India and the US to work together on global development issues, including economic infrastructure, food security and poverty reduction.         
	Equally predictably, the White House said President Obama reiterated his commitment to visit India in 2010.         
	While the White House was matter-of-fact in its readout on the Singh-Obama meeting, American officials were effusive about a meeting between the US President and Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani.         
	A statement by the Presidents press secretary said Obama began the meeting with Gilani by noting that he is very fond of Pakistan, having visited the country during college.         
	Obama spoke about our multi-faceted and long-term strategic relationship and pledged to work with Pakistan to address issues of mutual concern in the long-term relationship.        
	When Gilani brought up the issue of Pakistans energy needs, a euphemism for its demand for a nuclear deal so that it can import US nuclear power plants, Obama reiterated that we are committed to helping Pakistan address its real and growing energy needs.         
	The Presidents emphasis was on real, implying that the US was not yet ready to initiate a nuclear deal for Islamabad.

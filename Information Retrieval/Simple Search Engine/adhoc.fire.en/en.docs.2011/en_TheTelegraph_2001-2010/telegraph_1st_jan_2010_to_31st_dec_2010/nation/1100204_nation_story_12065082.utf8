The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | State panel with riot judge
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      State panel with riot judge
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: The Centre today constituted a five-member committee on Telangana under the chairmanship of former Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna, who headed the commission that probed the 1993 riots in Mumbai.        
	The BJP, however, dismissed the move as a ploy to buy time.        
	Other members of the committee are Ranbir Singh, vice-chancellor of the Delhi-based National Law University, Abusaleh Shariff, senior research fellow at Delhis International Food Policy Research Institute and Ravinder Kaur, professor of humanities and social sciences at IIT Delhi. Former Union home secretary V.K. Duggal will be the member-secretary.        
	The ministry of home affairs has formed the committee to hold wide-ranging consultations with all sections of people, political parties and groups in Andhra Pradesh. The terms of reference of the committee are being drafted, will be finalised in consultation with the chairman and announced shortly, a ministry spokesperson said.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram had announced on December 23 that the Centre would set up such a committee, and iterated the position at an all-party meeting on the statehood held in the capital on January 5.        
	The Centre was forced to put the issue on the back-burner after large-scale protests by pro and anti-Telangana groups. This followed Chidambarams December 9 declaration that the Centre would initiate the process of forming a separate Telangana.        
	BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said his party doubted the Centres commitment to the statehood. The committee, he said, is of little use as it does not have any terms of reference, a deadline or an objective.         
	The Centres purpose should be to create Telangana. There is a mechanism for this purpose. The Centre needs to introduce a Constitution amendment bill after getting a resolution passed by the state legislature. The BJP will support such an amendment but it looks like the Centre wants to buy time. The Congress and the Telugu Desam have done flip-flops on Telangana. The Andhra situation can be resolved by a political process, not a committee.

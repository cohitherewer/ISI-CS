The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Population help? Parsis can manage

          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 29: The minorities ministry last month came up with a plan to help finance infertility treatment for Parsi couples after a survey showed that the community recorded only about 200 births a year in the past decade.        
	But the Planning Commission shot down the proposed Rs 1-crore Fertility Support Scheme for Parsis, arguing that the community  one of the financially most powerful in the country  does not need monetary help from the government to tackle its population issues.        
	The ministry had pressed the panic button after a survey found that since 2001, the average number of births a year in the community has been around 200. The figure was 223 in 2001 and came down to 174 in 2006. The survey, which was conducted in 2006 and the results published about a year ago, put the total number of Parsis in the country at 60,000.        
	This would mean an annual birth rate of less than four per thousand.        
	The national annual birth rate is just over 21 per thousand. Apart from helping finance infertility treatment, the scheme also proposed screening of the girl child for infertility-related diseases, as well as awareness campaigns and other support programmes.        
	The Planning Commission has refused to give in-principle approval to the proposed scheme. Its argument is that the Parsi community is capable of fending for itself and does not need paltry financial assistance from the government, a ministry official said.        
	Although the Planning Commission agreed that the population fall among Parsis was worrying, it took the view that financial assistance would not solve the matter.        
	Parsi community leaders agree. Parsis are financially empowered enough to tackle the medical aspects of population fall. We really dont need any government money towards this purpose, said Mehroo D. Bengalee, a former member of the National Commission for Minorities.        
	Bengalee, who has studied the issue in depth, said late or no marriages, falling fertility, increasing divorces and migration are the main reasons behind the population decline. The total number of Parsis worldwide is 100,000, meaning 40 per cent of the community is abroad.        
	That more Parsi women are marrying outside the community is another reason for the dwindling numbers, Bengalee added. Once a Parsi woman marries outside her community, she is no longer considered a Parsi.        
	The survey has also found that the community is ageing, with 30 per cent of the population above 50 years old and just around 12 per cent children and adolescents. The proportion of those not marrying is highest among the Parsis, especially among the women, the survey said.        
	What the government can do is to run an awareness campaign highlighting the imminent threat to the communitys existence, Bengalee said.        
	Only timely marriages, joint family life and a big no to family planning can save the community, Bengalee believes. The dwindling numbers can be tackled only if community members, especially the youth, realise that the community is on the verge of extinction and that the trend has to be reversed at any cost, she said.        
	Parsis are followers of the Zoroastrian religion, the worlds oldest prophetic faith. They fled to India from Iran around the 8th century AD to escape religious persecution there. Most of them settled in what is now Maharashtra and Gujarat. Around two-thirds of Indias Parsi population lives in Mumbai.

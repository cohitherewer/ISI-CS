	New Delhi, March 2: Indian investigators hope to get access to Nannu Mian, the top Jaish-e-Mohammed militant arrested in Bangladesh and who is said to have played a key role in the Kandahar hijack.        
	Senior home ministry officials today said a team of Intelligence Bureau investigators could travel to Dhaka to question Nannu, alias Belal Mandol, who was held on Sunday with four other Jaish operatives. Nannu is also wanted in India for blasts in Surat and Bangalore in 2008.         
	The officials said Nannu, a Bangladeshi national from Sylhet, was married to an Indian from Bengal. We need to ascertain his role in the IC814 hijacking, said an official. The CBI is probing the case. External affairs minister S.M. Krishna said: If the identity of the person whom you (reporters) are mentioning is the same as we have been looking out after the hijack...we certainly would be taking it up with the government of Bangladesh.

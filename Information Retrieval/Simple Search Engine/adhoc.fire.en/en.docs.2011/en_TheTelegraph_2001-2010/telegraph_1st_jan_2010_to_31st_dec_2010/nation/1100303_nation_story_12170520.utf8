          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	March 2: Author Taslima Nasreen today said the Karnataka violence blamed on an article purportedly written by her was a deliberate attempt to malign her and foment unrest.        
	Mob violence today spread from Shimoga, the hometown of Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, to Mangalore, where one of the papers that published the article is based.        
	 Nasreen, the exiled Bangladeshi author, said in a statement to PTI that she never penned any article for a newspaper in Karnataka.         
	The incident that occurred in Karnataka on Monday shocked me. I learned that it was provoked by an article written by me that appeared in a Karnataka newspaper. But I have never written any article for any Karnataka newspaper in my life, she said.        
	The appearance of the article is atrocious. In any of my writings I have never mentioned that Prophet Mohammad was against burqa. Therefore, this is a distorted story. I suspect that it is a deliberate attempt to malign me and to misuse my writings to create disturbance in the society. I wish peace will prevail.         
	Two persons were killed in the violence in Shimoga on Monday. Nasreen has been staying in an undisclosed place since her return to India last month.        
	In New Delhi, Union home minister P. Chidambaram had said earlier in the day: The situation is under control, we have rushed in central forces.         
	This is an article she wrote in 2007. That article was translated in Kannada and published on Milad-ud-Nabi day. It is unfortunate. The article seems to have triggered some protests, he said.        
	Chidambaram said he was in touch with Yeddyurappa. I wait for the action to be taken by the government of Karnataka. The government of Karnataka knows its responsibility and it will take action, he added.        
	Late in the evening, a petrol bomb was hurled on the office of one of the Kannada dailies that had published it and an eveninger attacked in Mangalore.

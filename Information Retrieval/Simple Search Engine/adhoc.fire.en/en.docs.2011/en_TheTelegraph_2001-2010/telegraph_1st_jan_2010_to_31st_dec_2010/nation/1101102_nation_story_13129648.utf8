The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong set to bare coalition-allergy symptom 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong set to bare coalition-allergy symptom 
          SANJAY K. JHA                      Sonia Gandhi                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 1: Sonia Gandhi may reveal her disenchantment with coalition politics at tomorrows All India Congress Committee meeting and exhort the party to strive for full-fledged Congress rule.        
	The party has been gradually shifting its stance on coalitions over the past few years, moving away from its eager embrace of the secular forces before the 2004 general election when Sonia walked the extra mile to win over allies.        
	The Congress is now willing to clearly articulate that coalitions are born out of compulsion, not choice, sources said.         
	At tomorrows meeting, Sonia is expected to call for strengthening the party in the states so that the Congress can reclaim its old glory.        
	Although the party does not plan any political, economic or other kind of resolution at tomorrows event, the presidential speech may stress that the pan-Indian Congress alone can ensure equality and justice for all.        
	This is not a sudden turnaround. Rahul Gandhi has already got the party to go it alone in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. He and many other senior leaders would have preferred the same policy in Maharashtra too, but the party eventually went along with ally Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), although with some reluctance.        
	In the ongoing Bihar elections, the Congress is contesting all the seats. An All India Congress Committee general secretary said: It is not important how many seats we win. At least, we have moved on and there is direction in our politics.        
	While the leaderships unease with the NCP in Maharashtra is well known, the Congress is still in a dilemma about its options in Tamil Nadu, where its relations with the ruling DMK are far from cordial.        
	In Bengal, the party is not too confident about contesting independently and seems ready to play second fiddle to the Trinamul Congress.         
	Party leaders say that adopting an assertive tone on one-party rule does not mean ruling out alliances.        
	Every party tries to broaden its base. We believe the Congress can provide better governance (by following) its own agenda and we are determined to strengthen our base, a senior leader said.        
	In some places, where alliances are required for strategic reasons, we will opt for them. That is electoral tactic; but there is nothing wrong in articulating our belief that Congress rule is best for the country.        
	Tomorrows meeting will ratify Sonias re-election as party president and may also authorise her to reconstitute the Congress Working Committee.        
	Although the schedule for the working committee election has been announced, the dominant view in the party is that there will be no election and that a resolution will be passed authorising Sonia to pick her team.        
	According to the party constitution, half the working committees 24 members should be elected. Party general secretaries are selected from among the working committee members.        
	The Mumbai housing scandal and the Commonwealth Games muck have cast a shadow on tomorrows event, but that will not prevent the meeting from singing the Congress-alone tune. The party will hold back the planned 125-year celebrations for the plenary in December and restrict tomorrows session to the formalities of organisational elections.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh too will make a speech. All the senior leaders and around 1,200 All India Congress Committee members will attend the meeting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nakli PM steals the show
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nakli PM steals the show
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Manmohan Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 2: The Prime Minister hardly looks the type to crack jokes in public or leave Sonia Gandhi in splits. But his lookalike today did, that too without uttering a word.        
	Gurmit Singh Sethi, popular in Congress circles because of his resemblance to Manmohan Singh, livened things up at the AICC meeting when he showed up in white kurta-pyjama and blue turban soon after proceedings began. The sight of him set the crowd twittering, with most ministers, leaders and Sonia herself breaking into laughter as whispers of nakli Manmohan rose.        
	What made the ministers in the front row crack up was the Congress chiefs eyes carefully trailing Gurmit as he hunted for a seat. She kept smiling as she followed his every movement, leaving some wondering what was cooking. Finally, when the crowd figured she was engrossed in simply watching him, a ripple of laughter surged through the crowd.        
	Sonia joined in the laughter heartily; the only man who sat with his usual deadpan expression was the Prime Minister himself.                  Gurmit Singh      
	Gurmit, who got into political circulation after Singh became Prime Minister, is a transporter from Indore now settled in Delhi. Save the flutter he caused, the atmosphere at the AIIC meet was sombre as most members discussed the fate of Suresh Kalmadi and Ashok Chavan.        
	The craze for Rahul Gandhi among party workers was the most striking feature of the meeting; they repeatedly chorused that he should be seated in the front row alongside Sonia. But he kept sitting at the back, despite a scramble among lesser people to grab the prized seats.        
	Maharashtra leaders were present on the dais in unusually large numbers. While chief minister Chavan took his seat early, Vilasrao Deshmukh and Prithviraj Chavan were also seen. Asked what would become of Chavan, senior leaders said he should be allowed to celebrate Diwali happily.        
	Sonia took care to hail Singhs leadership, abilities and achievement in ensuring robust economic growth amid the global crisis, and clapped whenever any speaker praised him. Even Rahul praised him, saying economic growth was essential for welfare programmes.

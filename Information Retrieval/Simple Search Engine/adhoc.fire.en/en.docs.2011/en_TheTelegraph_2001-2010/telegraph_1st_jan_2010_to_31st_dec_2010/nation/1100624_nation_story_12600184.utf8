The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Eye on Chidambaram at Pak talks
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Eye on Chidambaram at Pak talks
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                          Chidambaram                                  
	Islamabad, June 23: This week could well spring a third angle to the chronically two-sided India-Pakistan story, an internal route to external breakthroughs.        
	Pakistani eyes are fixed far more keenly on home minister P. Chidambaram than anything the Indian foreign office could have on offer at the moment. South Block is familiar, even predictable, territory; its North Block where a new turn in ties could lie.         
	For better or for worse, theyd rather not guess yet, but Pakistani mandarins appear to have convinced themselves the Indian home minister could become the key playmaker and push diplomacy deadlocked midfield.        
	Chidambaram is a potential quantity, a senior Pakistani diplomat told The Telegraph. As your countrys chief point man on terror issues, he is someone whose position could make the critical difference this way or that.        
	There cant be anything to suggest that Chidambaram will assume a stance at variance with the foreign ministry  symbolic perhaps of the concert on the Indian side is that foreign secretary Nirupama Rao and home secretary G.K. Pillai arrived together here by special flight in the middle of a tempestuous squall  but he could bring a fresh nuance to the table.        
	Chidambaram is known to be a forthright, no-nonsense kind of person, said the Pakistani official. He may give to our mutual concerns a greater directness of approach.        
	A prospect that is already creeping out of the Indo-Pak back channel and urging itself onto the table is the prospect of a deal to formalise co-operation between Indias National Investigation Agency (NIA) and Pakistans Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).         
	The proposal is of recent vintage  no more than a week  and seems to have found a fair measure of favour on either side, though there are no commitments yet.         
	The FIA already has an informal relationship with the CBI on humanitarian issues like trafficking, drugs and fake currency; the idea now is to upgrade that to more structured ties with the NIA, which has spearheaded terror-related probes since 26/11.         
	New Delhis sense is that the FIA did a fairly honest job of conducting the Mumbai attack investigations on the Pakistani side and the idea behind establishing a formal relationship between the NIA and the FIA might be to upgrade the level of mutual trust.         
	But there lies a classical chicken-and-egg conundrum. Does enough trust exist to begin investing in more?        
	Co-operation between the NIA and the FIA would mean sharing intelligence if it is to be meaningful. The Indian establishment isnt persuaded that is an advisable thing with Pakistan just yet. There is a history, after all, of hot leads turning cold or dead after being handed to Islamabad.         
	For all the loftiness of the prime ministerial resolve at Thimphu to bridge the trust deficit, the Indo-Pak narrative remains more about deficits, less about trust. As one foreign office official said in Delhi: Trust is something that comes from experience; our experience with Pakistan hasnt promoted any such sense yet. Talk about trust, yes, but not trust itself, there is a long way go.        
	It would be a fine thing for the subcontinent if the many air miles being covered between New Delhi and Islamabad this week reduce some of that distance.

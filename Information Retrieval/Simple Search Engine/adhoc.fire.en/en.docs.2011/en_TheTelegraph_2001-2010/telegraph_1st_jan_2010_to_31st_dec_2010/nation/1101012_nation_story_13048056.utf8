The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fresh minority blow to CPM
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Fresh minority blow to CPM
          JOHN MARY                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 11: CPM-backed Independent Manjalamkuzhi Ali today became the third minority face to snap ties with the party when he quit as MLA saying he cannot carry on suffering insults any longer.        
	Former MP A.P. Abdulla Kutty had been thrown out. K.S. Manoj, another former MP, had left the CPM in the past year. Manoj, a Christian, had resigned following differences over the partys stand on religious belief.        
	Elected twice from the Muslim-dominated Malappuram district, Ali claimed at a news conference he had been targeted by some leaders for the past two years. Enough is enough. They have been vilifying me at party meetings. Im a victim of party factionalism, said Ali, who is close to chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan.        
	CPM leaders Paloli Mohammad Kutty and A. Vijayaraghavan had recently hit out against Ali, saying a businessman like him could not destroy the party. Ali has business interests in the Gulf and has been a film producer.        
	In July, Achuthanandan had himself claimed that fundamentalists, keen on making Kerala minority-dominated in 20 years, were luring youths to marry Muslim women. The chief ministers comments, said to have intended at wooing the majority community, were seen to have hurt the CPMs efforts elsewhere, such as in Bengal, to win back the support of the minorities.        
	Ali said he was also quitting as director of the department of non-resident Keralite affairs, the general secretary of Pravasi Sanghom and the president of Pravasi Bank, all three posts assigned to him by the CPM.        
	Ali said he did not want to be reined in by a party that practised double standards. It says one thing while in the Opposition and ignores it when it comes to power.        
	He cited as an example the CPMs opposition to receiving Asian Development Bank aid and its stand against private self-financing professional colleges when out of power. In power, it had displayed no such qualms, he said.        
	Kerala CPM secretary Pinarayi Vijayan said the party had treated Ali with respect.        
	The Opposition United Democratic Front could not hide its glee at the embarrassment to the CPM on the eve of panchayat polls. Congress leader Oommen Chandy invited Ali to join the UDF, saying he is an asset in public service.        
	Indian Union Muslim League general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty also welcomed him to the party. Ali thanked both but he said he had not decided his course of action. Many of those who worked for me during the Assembly elections are in the race for the panchayat polls. Ill work for their success, he said.        
	Fielding Ali to the Assembly had been a masterstroke by the CPM, which used a Muslim to defeat stalwarts of the Muslim League in Malappuram. In the 2006 Assembly election, Ali defeated former PWD minister M.K. Muneer, the son of late chief minister C.H. Mohammed Koya.

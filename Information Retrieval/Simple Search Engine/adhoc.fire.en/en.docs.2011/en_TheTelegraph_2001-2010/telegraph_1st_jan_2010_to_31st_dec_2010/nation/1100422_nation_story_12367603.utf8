The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shilpa gives Lalit support amp; credit
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shilpa gives Lalit support amp; credit
          PTI AND OUR BUREAU                           Shilpa                                   
	April 21: Actress Shilpa Shetty, one of the stakeholders of the controversial Rajasthan Royals team, today sprang to the defence of IPL chief Lalit Modi.        
	I support Lalit as someone who has been part of IPL. It is Lalits brainchild. Because of Lalit, IPL happened, said Shilpa, who is married to UK-based business tycoon Raj Kundra.         
	If there is something murky happening behind the scenes, I am unaware about it and in that case, let (the) law take its own course. However, people should not jump to conclusions. Till you are not proven guilty, you are not guilty, she said.        
	The Kundra family is said to own a little over 11 per cent stake in Jaipur IPL Cricket Pvt Ltd  which owns the Rajasthan Royals  through Kuki Investments, a company registered in the Bahamas.         
	The Jaipur franchise has come under the scanner as the majority stakeholder is the Nigeria-based Suresh Chellaram, Modis brother-in-law, who owns 44.15 per cent in the company.         
	The IPL chiefs detractors say Modi holds a silent stake in the Rajasthan Royals through Chellaram, but the cricket administrator has rebutted all such allegations.        
	The franchise is also on the radar of the revenue and income-tax investigators for its complex ownership pattern and web of companies floated in tax havens to push investments. The funds are routed into EM Sports Holding, Jaipur IPLs Mauritius-based parent.        
	Shilpa asserted that the Rajasthan Royals was above board.         
	I dont understand what is happening. Every day, new things are coming out. As far as our (the Rajasthan Royals) papers are concerned, we have all legal documents. About the remaining teams, I have no idea. I dont know who is involved and from where the money has come, the actress said.        
	Shilpa is the second franchise owner after liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who runs Royal Challengers Bangalore, to publicly back Modi.        
	We must not forget that it was Lalit who made IPL successful in the overseas market. We must give him that credit. It is all because of his effort that IPL has become successful across the world, she said.         
	 As an Indian, I think we all should be proud of IPL. It has generated not just a lot of revenue but also pride in the sporting space and created job opportunities. IPL has been good in a lot of ways.        
	Daredevil stake        
	The GMR-owned Delhi Daredevils today disclosed its shareholding pattern on its own, joining the Deccan Chargers which did so on Thursday and the Mumbai Indians on Tuesday.        
	 GMR Holdings has 51 per cent in Daredevils, while group chairman G.M. Raos four family members hold the rest of the stake, according to a company release.        
	 The Royal Challengers Bangalore said it had filed its shareholding pattern yesterday in response to a notice issued by the Registrar of Companies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sweating it out, shopping
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sweating it out, shopping
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                      Team officials from Jamaica hit Connaught Place on Friday for last-minute shopping. Picture by Prem Singh                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 15: The Commonwealth Games over, Ugandas Grace Mubiru was drained  of cash.        
	I love saris and would wear them to parties. Although it seems difficult to wrap, I have learnt it from the shop-owner. It was a great experience to be in Delhi during the Games, the official accompanying Ugandas contingent to the Games said, struggling to clutch more shopping bags than her hands could manage.        
	She wasnt the only Games member criss-crossing Connaught Place, Delhis favourite shop-till-you-drop destination, as the hunt for medals at Indias showpiece event gave way to a rush for saris, bangles and knick-knacks.        
	Others in Ugandas 69-member contingent of officials and athletes were also on a buying binge before taking the flight back home on Saturday. We bought lots of clothes. Its much cheaper here, said a colleague of Grace.         
	Juma Muwowo from Zambia wasnt happy that his country had not won any medals but he couldnt afford to return home without gold. I bought ornaments for my girlfriend, the table-tennis player who lost in the quarterfinals said.        
	Jumas coach Mubanga Kaite and other team members splurged on watches, clothes, saris and other items. We want to buy as much as we can. We still have some more money left, said Kaite, holding two shopping bags.         
	The fun would have gone further but security played spoilsport. We have never seen Hindi films and wanted to watch one. Indian actresses are very good-looking, chuckled a Ugandan athlete who was told a movie trip wasnt possible.        
	When it came to food, chicken tandoori and kebabs appeared to rule the roost. The food is excellent but its very spicy, said Maureen Spence Campbell from Jamaica, with compatriots nodding away in agreement.        
	Malaysian athletes Nur Suryani Mohammed Taibi and Nur Ayuni Farhana said they had too much to choose from in shops. We are spoilt for choice as there are so many things to buy, said Taibi, who won gold in shooting.        
	Some of those who had thrown a shield around the Games were celebrating, too. All of us were under tremendous pressure. Our colleagues have organised a party tonight, said Delhi police sub-inspector S. Tiwari.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 15: Vishwa Hindu Parishad international president Ashok Singhal today accused chief minister Naveen Patnaik of oppressing innocent Hindus in order to appease the minority communities.        
	Naveen has betrayed the Hindu community, who constitute 95 per cent of the states population, alleged Singhal at a news conference today.        
	The VHP leader said Naveen had promised him to arrest the culprits who had killed Swami Laxmananda Saraswati on August 23, 2008. But the real culprits and conspirators are yet to be arrested, he rued. Rather, false criminal cases had been registered against more than 11,000 Hindus in connection with the 2008 communal violence following the killings of Swami Laxmananda and four of his associates, alleged Singhal.        
	According to official records, 11 Hindus lost their lives during the communal violence, but no Christians were arrested for the killings, lamented the VHP leader. It seems the British rule has not ended in Orissa. Its continuing through Naveen, remarked the veteran.        
	Foreign forces were carrying on religious conversion in Orissa by luring poor and illiterate tribals and thereby snatching their religion, which was a human crime. When people like Swami Laxmananda tried to check it, the missionaries eliminated him with the help of Maoists, he alleged. The Bible and rifle now go together, he said.        
	Singhal lambasted Sonia Gandhi and Naveen for allowing the delegation of European diplomats to visit Kandhamal, compromising the sovereignty of the country.        
	Opposing the proposed Indo-Pak talks after the terrorist attack in Pune, VHP also asked the Centre to stop the dialogue. Those who are supporting the talks to appease the minorities are shameless, said Singhal.        
	He also rejected the recommendation of the Ranganath Mishra Commission for earmarking reservation quota for Dalit Muslims and Christians.

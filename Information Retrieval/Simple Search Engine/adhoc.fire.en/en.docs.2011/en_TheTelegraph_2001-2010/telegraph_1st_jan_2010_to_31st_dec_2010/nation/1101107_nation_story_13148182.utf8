The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hint of ease on dual-use tech exports
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hint of ease on dual-use tech exports
          OUR BUREAU                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 6: President Barack Obama today signalled that the US may further relax its export restrictions that deny certain dual-use technology items to Indias missile production laboratories, and launch vehicle and rocket fuel centres.         
	My commerce secretary Garry Locke will be leading another trade mission to India in the next few months, and we are reforming our export control system, Obama said in Mumbai today. Even as we strengthen our national security, we make sure that unnecessary barriers do not stand in the way of high-tech trade between our countries.         
	He said the US will work with India to fundamentally reform its control on exports which will allow greater co-operation in a range of areas. The US had clamped export restrictions on Indias atomic energy and defence research laboratories and Indian Space Research Organisation centres in 1998 after India tested nuclear weapons.         
	But data from the US department of commerce suggests that the US already approves a vast majority of exports that require a licence. Even as far back as in 2003, the US had approved about 90 per cent of applications needing export licence.         
	Applications for controlled items are reviewed on a case-by-case basis  there is no longer any policy of denial, the US department of commerce has said in a document on US-India dual-use export control procedures.         
	The US has in recent years removed many institutions from the entity list. The restrictions currently apply to atomic energy establishments and reactors, but only to four of Isros six major centres, and four of 50 defence research laboratories.         
	The four Isro centres include the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre where launch vehicles are designed, the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre where a powerful cryogenic engine is under development, the launch complex and a solid propellant booster plant in Sriharikota.         
	Life will become a bit easier if the export restrictions go, Isro sources said. Our space programme has evolved despite these restrictions. Weve found solutions to the technology denials  sometimes they are expensive, or complicated, but they worked.         
	One example is special high-resolution sensors for remote-sensing satellites. We need something called time delay integrated charge couple detectors, but when we couldnt get them, we relied on an alternative, but slightly complicated, technology, one source said.         
	Any relaxation in the US export rules would also benefit US suppliers, sources said. US suppliers can currently provide items from a set of restricted dual-use components  which have the potential to be used in civilian as well as defence systems  only through a case-by-case review.         
	The Bharat Dynamics Laboratory, Hyderabad, Indias missile production house, and four defence laboratories involved in missiles, lasers, and weapons systems, are also currently under the US entity list that need a case-by-case review of restricted items         
	But Isro sources declined to specify the status of negotiations relating to the Commercial Satellite Launch Agreement  a pact that would allow India to launch satellites containing significant US components without permission from the US government.        
	Over the past decade, Isro has launched several satellites for Asian and European customers. But each time the satellite contained significant US components, the country that built the satellite had to take permission from the US, a source said.         
	In a scenario like this, neither side should make concessions merely for making a visit appear successful, an international affairs analyst said. It is the toughness of negotiations that will protect each others interests even if decisions are delayed.

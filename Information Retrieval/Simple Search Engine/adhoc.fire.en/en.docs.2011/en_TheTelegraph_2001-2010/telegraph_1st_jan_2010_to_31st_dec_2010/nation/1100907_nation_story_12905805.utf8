                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Omar signal on lifting army act
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Sept. 6: Omar Abdullah today said the Centre had begun the process of identifying districts in Jammu and Kashmir where the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) would be withdrawn.        
	The chief ministers words came as four more protesters were killed in alleged firing by security forces in the Valley, taking the toll to 69 in the three-month-long unrest.        
	On the special powers act, Omar spoke of two options. One is to soften the stringent clauses in the AFSPA. Second is to withdraw the AFSPA from those areas where militancy or its influence is negligible and where the armys role is probably negligible. In this direction, work is on to identify these districts in both Jammu and the Valley, he told reporters on the sidelines of a rally at Budhal in Rajouri district of Jammu.        
	The act had been extended to Jammu and Kashmir at the start of militancy in July 1990, when M.M. Sayeed was Union home minister. Ironically, he is now one of the foremost advocates of its abrogation.        
	Omar also touched on the dialogue process to solve the Kashmir issue but stressed the need for a unique solution.

	Siliguri, Feb. 21: The police outpost in north Bengals Sukna was set on fire this evening by a group demanding that a youth arrested for the murder of a girl from Sikkim be brought from Siliguri.         
	An impounded car parked on the compound of the outpost, a wooden structure that houses 15-20 police personnel, also went up in flames.         
	Since morning, people had been demonstrating at the police outpost, demanding the immediate arrest of Amit Lama, accused of murdering Pemkit Lepcha, 28, a native of Makabazar in East Sikkim. The body of Pemkit, who ran a school in Sikkim, was found at Sukna, 10km from here, on February 14.         
	The crowd dispersed around 1.30pm after being informed that Lama had been arrested, said K.L. Tamta, inspector-general of police, north Bengal. However, as Lama was sent to Pradhannagar police station in Siliguri, the protesters reassembled at the outpost around 6.30pm, demanding that he be brought to Sukna. Around 8.15pm, the mob set the outpost on fire.        
	Sources said the mob took control of the outpost as policemen posted there, including the officer-in-charge, stood outside helplessly. After the arson attack, the people retreated to their homes.        
	Tamta said he had to face protests from Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters at Sukna around 3pm while he was on his way to Tindharia with some guests. I had no other alternative but to return, he said.        
	Morcha leaders have distanced themselves from the arson but urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya blamed the outfit.

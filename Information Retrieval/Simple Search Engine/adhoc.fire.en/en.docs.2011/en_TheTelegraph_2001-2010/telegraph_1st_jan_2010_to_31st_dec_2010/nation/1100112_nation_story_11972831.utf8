The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hands tied, truce signals in Samajwadi
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hands tied, truce signals in Samajwadi
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Mulayam Singh Yadav at the launch of the festival in Saifai                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh have called a ceasefire as their options seem limited now.        
	The Samajwadi Party chief spoke to his former confidant for the first time today after he quit his party posts and invited him to be the chief guest at a cultural festival in Saifai, Mulayams hometown in west-central Uttar Pradesh.        
	Amar agreed, saying that as it was a non-political forum, he had no problem attending the event.         
	The fortnight-long cultural show near Etawah usually showcases Bollywood actors, dancers and singers. It was started by Amar some years ago to de-Mandalise the Samajwadi, which was born out of a movement to empower the backward classes.        
	Cut-outs of most senior Samajwadi Party leaders, barring Amar, adorned the gates to the venue. This is the first time since Amar joined the Samajwadi Party 14 years ago that his cut-out has been missing.        
	Around 10km from the venue is an airport that was upgraded in 2005 to enable Mumbai stars to fly down and participate in the festival. Amars Bollywood family Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt and Jaya Prada  have participated in the festival.        
	Samajwadi insiders explained that if Amar ran the risk of finding himself unemployed as no other party was enthusiastic about welcoming him, Mulayams plight was no better, though for different reasons.        
	Those who met Mulayam recently said he had been perceptibly rattled by some comments his right-hand man had made on his blogs about senior colleagues Janeshwar Mishra and Mohan Singh.        
	Mercifully, Amar spared the Yadav family. But in his heart, Mulayam knows he will not stop at anything. If he unspools the unsavoury details, Mulayam may have to run for cover, an insider said.        
	The Congress and the BJP didnt sound keen on having Amar in their ranks, although he has friends in these parties. Even the NCP, which was thought to be a convenient nesting ground for him, was non-committal.        
	Despite his camaraderie with leaders such as Farooq Abdullah, observers believe a free spirit like Amar would feel stifled in the National Conference.        
	Asked if Mulayam would accept certain conditions  such as taking action against Mishra, Mohan Singh and even his cousin Ram Gopal Yadav  that Amar might broach before peace is declared, a parliamentary board member said: That will be Mulayams test. He stands at the crossroads: he has to choose between his family and his general secretary if it comes to that.        
	Mulayams son and MP Akhilesh Yadav is said to be insisting that all outstanding issues be resolved before a decision on rejecting Amars resignation from party posts is taken.         
	However, lasting peace appears a long way off. The fragile nature of the current truce was apparent when some Muslim Samajwadi MLAs, including Iqbal Mehmood from Sambal and Shahid Manzoor from Kithor, demanded the expulsion of Amar. He has damaged the partys credibility and is inaccessible to the leaders, Manzoor told journalists in Delhi.        
	Amar told a news channel that he would neither withdraw his resignation nor slog for the party as he used to. He, however, stressed his decision was not a revolt against Mulayam. Mulayam Singh has consistently given me due recognition, he has given me preference over Ram Gopal. I do not want to force him to choose between his family and me, said Amar.        
	Amars estranged brother Arvind Singh, who is in the BJP, empathised with him. Arvind said Amar was humiliated by the Samajwadi leaders.

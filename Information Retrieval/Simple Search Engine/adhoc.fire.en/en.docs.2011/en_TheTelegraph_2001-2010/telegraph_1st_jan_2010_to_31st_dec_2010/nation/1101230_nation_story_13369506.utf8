	Mumbai, Dec 29: The Maharashtra Congress today sent a six-member delegation to visit Jaitapur, the site of a nuclear plant, to look into the complaints of farmers after a recent report spoke about health and other risks to residents.         
	Today, Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan dismissed the opposition by farmers as misunderstanding.        
	He said he would soon convene a meeting to remove the misconceptions about the project. There is a lot of misunderstanding about the project which need to be cleared, he said at the post-cabinet briefing today.        
	He also clarified that the six-member delegation of Cong leaders from Konkan which visited Jaitapur today was sent by the State Congress, and not by his government.         
	Chavans comments come in the wake of a Social Impact Assessment report released by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences recently which warned the government that the implementation of the project would have a strong negative social and environmental impact on the concerned region in coastal. The 40-page reported compiled by TISS researchers in August this year is based on interviews with all the stake-holders in the region including elected representatives, government officials, agriculturists, horticulturists, fishermen, women.         
	I will convene a meeting to clear all apprehensions about the project at which a team of experts would also be invited. After this meeting, I will personally visit the plant site, Chavan said. After taking over as the Chief Minister from Ashok Chavan, Prithviraj Chavan had earnestly pursued the environmental clearances from the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and got conditional nods from Jairam Ramesh for the Navi Mumbai Airport project and the JNPP last month.         
	At the formal announcement of the environmental clearance on Nov 28, Chavan had pointed out that misconceptions prevailed about the JNPP, and his government would make efforts to clear them before implementing the 9900 MW nuclear power project. At the function where Jairam Ramesh as well as the French Ambassador to India were present, Chavan had also said that his government would further increase the Rs 15 crore compensation awarded to the 2,335 project affected people to their satisfaction. Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd chairperson SK Jain, also present at the function, had also offered to allocate a certain percentage of profits generated by the JNPP through nuclear commerce for the long term local area development.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Aug. 2: Tirupati temple authorities have closed night treks up a 10km wooded path to the shrine after a female panther pounced on visitors twice in the past week.        
	Yesterday, the panther attacked a 10-year-old girl near a deer park, around 3km from the top, but was scared away by other devotees.        
	Last Wednesday, the same panther attacked a seven-year-old girl at the same spot, but the childs father grabbed her before the wild cat could maul the kid.        
	Following the attacks, both close to midnight, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD), which manages the Andhra Pradesh shrine, ordered the walkway to be closed from 4pm to 6am.        
	Since the majority of devotees walk to the Tirumala shrine, we want to secure the path before it is thrown open once again, TTD executive officer I.Y.R. Krishna Rao said.        
	The restriction will stay in place for a week. The road motorists take to the temple would, as usual, remain closed from midnight till 3 in the morning, Rao added.        
	TTD chairman D.K. Adikeshavulu met forest minister P. Ramachandra Reddy this morning to discuss precautionary measures needed to secure the walkway, which passes through the Sri Venkateswara National Wild Life Sanctuary.        
	Apart from some 22 panthers, the sanctuary is home to tigers, bears and elephants released from circuses across the country.        
	The minister later said the deer park would be permanently shifted. The 270 deer in the park, built for the entertainment of devotees, attract the wild animals, he said.        
	Hitesh Malhotra, principal chief conservator of forests (wild life), who also attended the morning meeting, said the TTD had been advised to put up high fences along the walkway.        
	Rao said the TTD had plans to organise aerial surveys during the day besides patrolling by mobile squads of police and forest officials to instill confidence among devotees.

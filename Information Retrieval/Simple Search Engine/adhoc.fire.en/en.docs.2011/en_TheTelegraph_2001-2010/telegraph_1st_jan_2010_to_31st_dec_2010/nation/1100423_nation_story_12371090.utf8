	Srinagar, April 22 (PTI): The CBI has approached Jammu and Kashmir High Court seeking dismissal of criminal charges against four policemen arrested for alleged destruction of evidence in connection with the death of two women in Shopian.        
	The agency gave details about a lie-detector test on the four and said no deception was found on their part in reply to any of the questions put to them. The CBI added that no criminality could be attributed to anyone of them and as such they have been sought to be discharged from this case.        
	The case relates to the death of two women whose bodies were found in a stream in Shopian in May last year.

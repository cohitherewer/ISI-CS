The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Only stakeholder, not bidder: Pawar
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Only stakeholder, not bidder: Pawar
  - Minister clears air on IPL involvement        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Sharad Pawar                                        
	Mumbai, June 6: Sharad Pawar today said his 16 per cent stake in City Corporation Ltd didnt mean he was part of the decision to bid for the Pune IPL team, as the NCP leader tried to clear his name amid calls to step down.        
	The fresh clarification came a day after a leaked resolution indicated that the board of the Pune-based firm had on January 31 authorised managing director Aniruddha Deshpande to bid for the franchise on the companys behalf.        
	In Delhi, ally Congress made it clear that the Union minister would have to fend for himself in the latest controversy involving the money-spinner cricket league.        
	Pawar told NDTV he was a company shareholder but not one of the directors. I own shares in City Corporation, but it does not mean I am part of the decision to bid for the IPL, the NCP leader said. I may have shares in Baramati Grape Industries, a subsidiary of (Vijay Mallyas) UB Group, but it does not mean I have a stake in Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	Pawar had earlier said Deshpande had bid as an individual, though Indian cricket board chief Shashank Manohar had said yesterday that the bid had come in the name of City Corp and the documents submitted included the companys memorandum and articles of association.         
	Pawar today maintained that the failed bid was in an individual capacity but admitted that it was indeed in the name of City Corporation, though the company had opted out before the bidding process began.        
	The Union minister said the board of directors had met on March 19, but decided that the company wouldnt bid for the team as the venture wouldnt have been profitable.        
	Deshpande echoed Pawar. He told reporters in Pune that the authorisation by the City Corp board on January 31 was to get the IPL tender document but, after examining the tender, the board had decided not to participate in the bid.        
	The January letter authorised me to get the tender document which cost Rs 5 lakh. In the case of a large tender like this, it takes six to eight weeks to study it. In the March board meeting, the company told me that it was not interested in bidding, but I could bid as an individual. Pawar and his family has nothing to do with the bid, Deshpande said.        
	Deshpande also said he had declared his intent to the IPL authorities that he would form a new company if he won the bid.        
	Known to share close business links with Pawar, Deshpande also suggested that the allegations against the minister were politically motivated to tarnish his image.         
	The Congress remained non-committal and put the ball in Pawars court. As you are aware, there is a probe on. It is up to the NCP and Pawar to comment on this. The Congress party has nothing more to comment upon, spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi told reporters in Delhi.         
	The BJP demanded Pawars resignation from the Manmohan Singh cabinet. Pawar has been repeatedly misleading the country and misrepresenting the facts on his role in the IPL bidding, senior leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said in Thane.         
	BJP ally Shiv Sena demanded an impartial probe into Pawars links with the league and urged the Prime Minister to sack the agriculture minister if he did not resign on his own.        
	There cannot be different parameters for Shashi Tharoor and Pawar, Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray said, referring to Tharoors exit from the cabinet after allegations of his involvement with the Kochi IPL team.        
	The Sena, which has been critical of the IPL formula of marrying cricket, glamour and entertainment, has filed a public interest petition in Bombay High Court against the Congress-NCP Maharashtra governments decision to exempt the IPL from paying entertainment tax. The petition is scheduled to come up for hearing later this month.        
	At the last hearing, a high court bench had asked the Centre to clarify if a member of the Union cabinet could hold an office of profit in a cricket board and if there was a code of conduct for ministers.

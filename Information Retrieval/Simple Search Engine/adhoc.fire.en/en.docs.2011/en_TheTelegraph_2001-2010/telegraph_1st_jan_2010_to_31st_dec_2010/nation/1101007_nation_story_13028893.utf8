	New Delhi, Oct 6: The Congress leadership has barred spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi from briefing the media till the party takes a final view on his decision to appear in a case involving a lottery mafia.        
	The partys Kerala unit had lodged a complaint against the lawyer, saying he had appeared in the case ignoring its advice.         
	Sources said the matter had been referred to the AICC disciplinary committee headed by A.K. Antony and the defence minister was unlikely to easily exonerate Singhvi because of his association with Kerala politics.        
	Singhvi was in line for a promotion but the controversy appears to have come as a setback, at least temporarily, as Kerala goes to polls next year.         
	The party, however, may not take serious action against Singhvi as he has emerged as a spokesperson with experience in dealing with the media.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Its not cricket, PC tells talk team 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Its not cricket, PC tells talk team 
  - Kashmir interlocutors advised discretion        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 1: P. Chidambaram today gave a new meaning to the dictum that sport and politics dont mix by frowning on the Kashmir interlocutors controversial remarks following their visit to the Valley.        
	I think the interlocutors should not give a ball-by-ball commentary about their dialogue. This is interlocution. This is not a cricket match, the Union home minister told reporters.        
	Chidambaram was answering a question on interlocutor Dileep Padgaonkars claim that a terrorist had promised to present to him a peace plan for the Valley.        
	Neither should the media ask such questions nor should the interlocutors answer them, the minister said, adding that such talk could lead to controversy.        
	Chidambaram had began a quiet dialogue with Kashmirs politicians last year but failed to keep it under wraps. As word of the engagement got leaked to the media, there was an adverse reaction in Pakistan, sources said. Todays rap for the interlocutors probably came in this context, they added.        
	Padgaonkar and a fellow interlocutor, academic Radha Kumar, had recently stirred controversy by saying Pakistan should be involved in the attempts to find a solution to the Kashmir problem.        
	Home ministry sources said such statements could be used by vested interests in Kashmir and Pakistan during US President Barack Obamas India visit.        
	Chidambaram, however, acknowledged that the interlocutors had made a positive difference. They had, to an extent, changed the discourse in the state, he said  a sentiment that was echoed by chief minister Omar Abdullah in Srinagar today.        
	I sincerely hope that the people in the state will give peace a chance and give dialogue a chance, the Union home minister said.        
	Chidambaram returned this morning from a weekend visit to Srinagar, Baramulla, Kargil and Leh. He said there was a sense of expectation that the political problem of Kashmir would be addressed with the seriousness it merited.        
	The minister advised the BJP to show restraint, refrain from making completely baseless allegations, and to give the dialogue process a chance to succeed.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, April 9: At the insistence of groom Shoaib Maliks family to stick to the date set originally, the nikaah was hurriedly arranged today by bride Sania Mirzas parents only to be called off.        
	Sources said the Pakistan cricketers relations were upset over TV channels showing photographs of Shoaib partying with some other girl, coming as it did after a nerve-jangling week of controversy over Ayesha Siddiquis claim that he had married her first.        
	A family source said: The TV broadcasts also disturbed and dampened the mood at the party at our home. The arrangements were made for some of the pre-nikaah rituals and all the close relatives were summoned to gather at home before lunch. Caterers were asked to deliver food for 100 people.        
	It was around 3pm that the qazi who had drafted the nikaahnama noticed that the families had not kept at hand a copy of Shoaibs passport that police had impounded after Ayeshas claim.        
	Although Ayesha has withdrawn her complaint and a divorce has been gone through, the passport could not be recovered in time for the nikaah to take place as the investigating officials were away from town on some other work.        
	The qazi, Azmattulah Jafri, who was to conduct the nikaah, said: Usually, foreigners keep a copy with them whenever they travel. So we thought they might be having one.        
	When he realised one was not available, he consulted his superior, Nazuddin Hussian, who put his foot down. We can be jailed and sentenced for performing such a nikaah, Hussain said, admonishing his deputy, who was enthusiastic about carrying it out today.         
	Sources said the police commissioner was ready to issue a no-objection certificate, but the qazis were still not prepared to go ahead. Sanias father Imran Mirza consulted Shoaibs family and, realising they had no choice, put off the nikaah.

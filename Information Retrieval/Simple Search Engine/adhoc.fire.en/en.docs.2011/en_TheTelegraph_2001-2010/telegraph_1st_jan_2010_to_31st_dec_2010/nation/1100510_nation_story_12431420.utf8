The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Obama takes Singhs cue on Karzai fate
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Obama takes Singhs cue on Karzai fate
          K.P. NAYAR                                  Barack Obama, Manmohan Singh and Hamid Karzai                                 
	Washington, May 9: For a Prime Minister whose strength is economics, Manmohan Singh is having an impact here on an unlikely issue: Americas potential quagmire of involvement in Afghanistan.        
	On the eve of a crucial visit by Afghanistans President Hamid Karzai to Washington, his first since Karzais controversial re-election last November, Singhs advice to Barack Obama over three meetings since September 2009 appears to have been taken on board by the US President on how to deal with his troublesome, but indispensable, partner from Kabul.        
	The Prime Ministers assessment of Karzai was bolstered a month ago by a tutorial on Afghanistan by national security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon to his US counterpart, Gen. James Jones, on the margins of a Nuclear Security Summit here and Menons remarks at a collective meeting of national security advisers from several countries which took part in the nuclear summit.        
	A turning point that made the Obama administration sit up and consider Indias repeated views on Afghanistan in the middle of preparations for Karzais visit, however, appears to have been the Afghan Presidents talks with Singh and other Indian officials in New Delhi two weeks ago in the run-up to his planned journey to Washington.        
	Because New Delhi was the last of his stops on a tour that took him recently to Tehran, Islamabad and Beijing as well, Obama realised that the US could not cast Karzai aside the way the Americans used to dismiss the Ngo Dinh Diems of Vietnam in another era.         
	This, despite the fact that Obamas special envoy to Afghanistan, Richard Holbrooke, studied Vietnamese and was brought up precisely on those practices during his first six years as a foreign service officer in the 1960s on various jobs dealing with Vietnam.        
	During his state visit to the US last November, about a fortnight after Karzai was declared the winner of a second presidential term, the Prime Minister publicly advised the Americans that democracy in an ancient land like Afghanistan will take time to take root and to come to terms with the countrys history and tribal traditions.        
	That was when Holbrooke and several others in the Obama administration were plotting a regime change in Kabul and hoped to dump Karzai as soon as a suitable replacement could be installed through any charade of a democratic change that would pass muster.        
	In the course of his state visit, Singh firmly and openly announced his support for the embattled President in Kabul by saying that it is vitally important that all major regional and international players put their weight behind the government of Afghanistan. The Prime Minister warned that this is the only way that Afghanistan can meet the daunting challenges it faces.        
	At the same time, he resisted, on the one hand, suggestions by some of his aides that New Delhi should make common cause with countries which disfavour a continued US and Nato presence in Kabul and, on the other, rejected Washingtons hints that India should only be a benign power in Afghanistan.        
	When the foreign ministers of India, Russia and China met in Bangalore about a week before Karzai was re-elected, Russia was keen on a regional initiative on Afghanistan. But Singh felt that the time was not ripe for such a move. This pleased the Americans because Obamas Afghan policy was still an internal mess at that time.        
	It has emerged from a combination of sponsored news leaks here in the last few days and the administrations latest spin that Obama has changed course and firmly, but privately, instructed his officials just what Singh said here in public in November: That Karzai is there to stay, that they better extend to him the treatment that is due to a head of state and learn to work with him.        
	Graciously, Karzai has reciprocated. In an op-ed article in The Washington Post today, Karzai set the tone for his visit by conveying my deepest condolences to (American) families of those who lost their lives in Afghanistan.        
	But this rapprochement, which Singh strongly advised, did not come easily. Obama was nearly singed by the Afghans rage after he made his first trip to Kabul as President in March and those who travelled with him, especially Gen. Jones, made condescending remarks about Karzai. Two days later, Karzai made a public threat to join the Taliban, which brought relations between him and the White House close to breaking point.

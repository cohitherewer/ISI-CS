          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 8: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would have wanted to go a little slower but had to announce the quota for backward Muslims today because his coalition partners could not wait to be one up on the Opposition alliance.        
	Some of the allies were nudging the chief minister to move fast so that the Left Front could accuse Delhi of sitting tight on the Ranganath Misra commission report and wrong-foot the Congress-Trinamul.        
	Sources said Bhattacharjee had wanted some more time to examine all the pros and cons before taking the final call.        
	He had skirted the subject at yesterdays front rally despite being prodded by the Forward Blocs Ashok Ghosh, who wanted him to send the correct message to the minorities. He had, however, assured Ghosh that he would satisfy him.        
	Bhattacharjee announced the quota at Writers Buildings after hardly mentioning the subject at todays front meeting.        
	Front leaders, however, said the chief minister had been ready to discuss the subject at the meeting but could not do it because CPM state secretary and front chairman Biman Bose preferred to chalk out the price-rise campaign first.        
	After Bhattacharjee left the meeting, Bose broached the subject and said the CPM leadership had given the chief minister the go-ahead on the quota.        
	Ghosh and CPI state secretary Manju Mazumdar then insisted that the state government declare its intention to introduce the quota in principle before the Centre took any stand.        
	But the RSPs Biswanath Choudhury, the jails and social welfare minister, said the matter should first be discussed at the state cabinets core committee. Bose overruled him, citing an earlier decision that the front would take the policy decision.        
	Bose later told the media that the front had asked the government to take an immediate initiative to implement the recommendations of the Misra commission in all possible manners.        
	At the previous front meeting on February 1, the CPM had bought time by persuading the allies to put the Misra ball in Delhis court. It had also asked the partners to write to the government with any concrete suggestions they might have on the subject.        
	Bose today admitted that the allies had not written to the government but said an informal exchange of opinions had been on. He said: All the partners have agreed that the government should take steps to ensure reservation for socio-economically and educationally backward communities among Muslims.        
	Ghosh, the first to write to the chief minister demanding reservation for Muslims, was visibly elated after Bhattacharjees announcement. I called up Buddha and greeted him. It is a historic decision by the LF government, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Couched in Sonia thrust, Tharoor thumbs-down 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Couched in Sonia thrust, Tharoor thumbs-down 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              (Top)Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi on Wednesday (Prem Singh); Shashi Tharoor				                                 
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: Sonia Gandhi today asserted that Manmohan Singh is 100 per cent above board but the strongest-ever defence overshadowed what is being seen as an epitaph to Shashi Tharoors comeback chances.        
	Among the three resigned persons specifically named by Sonia today was Tharoor, the junior foreign minister who lost his berth after the IPL scandal.        
	You have all seen how we deal with matters of corruption. Starting from the issue of Volcker deal in which Natwar Singh was involved, we asked him to resign immediately and we set up a judicial inquiry. Shashi Tharoor, we asked him to resign. The chief minister of Maharashtra, immediately, as soon as United States President (Barack) Obama left, we asked him to resign, Sonia said.         
	Few expect Natwar to work his way back in and Chavan to bounce back any time soon. But a perception had hung around the suave Tharoor that no illegality had been established and he had got sucked into the IPL controversy because of indiscretion.         
	However, if Tharoors supporters were looking for clues to his possible comeback to the Congress ministry, Sonias statement has sunk such hopes.        
	After such an explicit reference by the Congress president, Tharoors name is unlikely to figure during the upcoming ministry shuffle or during the rest of the innings of UPA II.        
	If Sonia dealt with Tharoor and Chavan with clinical precision, she went all out to defend the Prime Minister.        
	In an unusual rebuttal, she termed the Opposition propaganda against Singh shameful.        
	She said: It is shameful that a person of the integrity of the Prime Minister should be targeted in this manner. Everyone knows the Prime Minister is 100 per cent above board. Everyone knows that kind of person, what kind of individual he is.        
	Sonias advocacy of Singhs integrity is significant in view of Opposition attempts to drag him into the 2G spectrum row and the cloud cast on his image for the first time in his career as bureaucrat and politician. Sources said Sonia had taken the BJPs description of Singh as a suspect and the Lefts attack on his silence very seriously.        
	The Congress leadership is aware that Singhs clean image had come to the partys rescue when the rash of corruption charges could have sunk the government. But for Singh, it would have been impossible for the party to fight the Opposition onslaught and negative public opinion.        
	Sonia also did not want any doubt to arise within the bureaucracy and the political class about Singhs continuance, particularly after the demand for a joint parliamentary committee that could be used to summon him for questioning.         
	Recalling how the BJP had lost in the 2009 parliamentary elections after trying to destroy Singhs image, she said: The Opposition BJP should learn a lesson from that.        
	Sonia, who dropped by the AICC office today after a long time and talked to the media despite the Congress flop show in Bihar, also confronted the perception that the Congress was tolerant to corruption.        
	Sources said Sonias visit to the AICC had not been planned and that she decided to drop by after the depressing news from Bihar. The scheduled media briefing in the evening was cancelled after she spoke to reporters in the afternoon.        
	She contrasted the departure of Natwar, Tharoor, Chavan and A. Raja with the BJPs shielding of Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa. The Congress had a better record of taking action against corruption, she said.        
	Sonia hoped the people will judge us more positively than other parties. Corruption is shameful and a bimari (disease) in our system and we have to find ways to fight it, she said.        
	Sources revealed Sonia had been upset by the attempt to paint the Congress as corrupt and had felt the need to speak out after party spokespersons words failed to cut much ice.

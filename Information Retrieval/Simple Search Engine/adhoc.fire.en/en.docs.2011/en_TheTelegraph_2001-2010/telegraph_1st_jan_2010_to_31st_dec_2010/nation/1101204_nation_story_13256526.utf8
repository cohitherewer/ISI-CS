          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: Delhi police have arrested a Nepalese national who allegedly supplied explosives and detonators to Maoists in Bengal and Bihar.        
	Officers said some 498 non-electronic detonators were seized from Loknath Panth, 42, who was arrested last night on his way to New Delhi railway station. He apparently meant to hand the detonators over to a contact at the station.        
	The police suspect that the resident of Nepals Gulmi district has links with the Maoists of that country, or is himself a Maoist.        
	We have seized his cellphone and have got some numbers of Maoists. We are questioning him to find out more about his links and how long he has been supplying explosives, an officer said.        
	The police allegedly found 150 detonators in the pockets of Panths jacket, and another 348 in a specially designed belt that he wore.        
	Officers claimed that Panth first visited India as a teenager in 1985 and worked in a factory in Ludhiana, Punjab. He returned to Nepal after his fathers death and may have started working for the Maoists there.        
	The police arrested him near Karol Bagh late last night on a tip-off.

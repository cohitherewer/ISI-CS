	Jaipur, Oct. 24: Singer Katy Perry and comedian Russell Brand were set to leave Rajasthan today, armed with the prediction of a long and happy married life by a parrot fortune teller who also assured them of successful careers.         
	Russell Brand and Katy Perry are overjoyed to confirm that they were pronounced Mr and Mrs Brand on October 23, a spokesperson for the couple said.         
	Although sources here said the couple had a Hindu wedding and sat patiently through an hour-long havan, the spokesperson said: The very private and spiritual ceremony, attended by the couples closest family and friends, was performed by a Christian minister and long time friend of the Hudson (Perry) family.         
	Perrys parents, Mary and Keith Hudson, and Brands mother Barbara Brand were present.         
	After the religious rites were over, the bride and the groom gave speeches  Perrys lasted 30 minutes, in which she heaped praise on Brand and even sang to him, sources said.         
	Brand gifted his bride a ruby with protective powers, sources said, adding the reformed addict kept alcohol out of the menu.         
	The wedding mandap and the ornate golden thrones were decorated with marigolds. Tent No. 5 at the Aman-i-Khas tented camp, reserved for the couple, was also done up with flowers.         
	Sources said although the bookings at the resort on the edge of the Ranthambhore tiger reserve are until tomorrow, many of the guests checked out today and headed to Jaipur, 145km away, Agra or Delhi before leaving the country.         
	British comedians David Baddiel and David Williams and British musician Noel Gallagher were among the guests at the wedding where fire eaters, snake charmers, dance troupes, folk singers and drummers performed.         
	Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot today asked the Sawai Madhopur district administration to probe alleged violation of noise pollution rules during the wedding.         
	Journalists had drawn attention to the noisy celebrations just outside the tiger sanctuary that went past midnight when Gehlot was in the district this morning to discuss the infrastructure and facilities at the Ranthambhore National Park.         
	Though no specific complaint was made by locals but as per the directive of the CM following inputs from some journalists at the airstrip here, forest and district administration officials have been asked to probe the matter, district collector Ravi Kumar said.         
	It was a private event and we have nothing to do with it but the resort will be penalised if they are found guilty of violation of any rule, he added.

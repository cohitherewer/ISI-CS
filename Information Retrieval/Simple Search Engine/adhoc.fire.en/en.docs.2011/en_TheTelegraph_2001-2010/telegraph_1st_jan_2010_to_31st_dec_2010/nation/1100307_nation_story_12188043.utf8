	 Calcutta, March 6: An apparently mentally challenged man clambered up a 50ft-high Howrah Bridge beam on Saturday afternoon.          
	Sheikh Samsur, 36, a resident of Sujapur in South 24-Parganas, refused to budge even after he was offered money by firebrigade personnel. The firemen had to climb up the beam and bring him down because their ladder was not high enough. Samsur was taken to a local police station where he gave his name and address. He has been admitted to hospital.                   
	 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court has held that people who migrated to Maharashtra after 1950 are not entitled to Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe reservations. The verdict was delivered last week by a three-judge bench, set up after two benches had differed on the subject.The state of Maharashtra was created only in 1960, so the court made it clear it was referring to the areas that now fell under that state.                   
	 Coimbatore (PTI): An NRI who taught at a US varsity fell unconscious and died on a railway platform in Coimbatore on Friday while waiting to board a Chennai-bound train. Srinivasa Suresh, 58, had come to Chennai with his wife on a personal visit.                  
	 Ahmedabad (PTI): The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, said on Saturday that it would not be announcing admissions to its post graduate programme in Public Management and Policy, primarily offered to Group-A civil servants. Review of the course fee structure could be one of the reasons behind putting it on hold, a source said.                   
	 Kochi (PTI): A Maltese bulk carrier passing about 200 nautical miles off the Laskhadweep islands foiled a pirate attack on Saturday. The Navy rushed its warship from Kochi to help the merchant vessel but before it could reach the site, the pirates had been beaten back. It is unclear how the merchant vessel thwarted the attack.                  
	 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi police launched a website, www.dpjju.com, on juvenile justice on Saturday.

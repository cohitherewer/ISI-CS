          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: Any public servant, individual or NGO will be able to report government corruption to officials in every central and state office and seek protection of identity if the Public Interest Disclosure and Protection to Persons Making the Disclosures Bill, 2010, becomes law.        
	The bill, introduced in the Lok Sabha today, says an official specified by the Central Vigilance Commission would be present in each government office.         
	There are some riders, though.         
	The armed forces and intelligence agencies are out of the bills ambit, as is the private sector. A person can be jailed for two years and fined Rs 30,000 for a false complaint.         
	Complaints can be filed only on events that have taken place in the previous five years. The identities of the complainants would be protected unless they wish to waive the privilege.         
	Anyone revealing the identity of a whistle-blower faces a three-year jail term and a fine of up to Rs 50,000.         
	Once the competent authority in an office receives a complaint, the official will discreetly investigate the charges. If nothing is found, the case may be closed.         
	The official conducting the probe will have the powers of a civil court to summon and demand evidence from a department. Any department or official giving incomplete or wrong information would be fined Rs 250 a day till complete information is furnished. But the fine will not exceed Rs 50,000.         
	The authoritys decision can be challenged only in a high court within 60 days of the formal announcement of its decision.

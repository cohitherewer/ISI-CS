The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pawar bats against CBI probe overdose
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pawar bats against CBI probe overdose
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    Sharad Pawar (top), Ratan Tata                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 30: Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar today said the government should take note of Ratan Tatas statement that India risked turning into a banana republic and cautioned against the excessive use of the CBI.        
	Pawars statement came in the middle of a CBI crackdown on an alleged bribes-for-loans scandal involving several top financial officials and real estate players in Maharashtra. Another real estate project, which was once associated with Pawars relatives, has been served a showcause by the environment ministry.        
	Asked about his reported comments at the UPA meeting yesterday about the unease among corporate leaders and Ratan Tatas comments, Pawar said: When a person like him makes a statement, I think we should take him seriously.        
	Pawar added: He (Tata) is not an ordinary man. I am not saying he is a rich man but he definitely commands respect not only in India but also outside.        
	Tata had said in an interview last week that tactics such as leaking tapped phone conversations could turn the country into a banana republic. He was speaking against the backdrop of the leak of the Niira Radia tapes.        
	Asked if the CBI investigations into business activities could impact the governments relations with India Inc, Pawar said: There will not be any impact. If somebody has done wrong, the governments duty is to investigate into it. If the CBI or the state has serious information, it is their responsibility to investigate the matter.        
	But he cautioned against excessive use of the CBI. If the agency started investigating every case where concession was made, my worry is banks and bank officials will not take any decision (on granting loans)... I could not understand what is the responsibility of the finance minister and what is the responsibility of the CBI.        
	He added that while detailed investigation was mandatory if something had gone wrong, simultaneously we have to see that the situation should not go to that level where nobody will take any decision.        
	Lavasa row        
	Pawar said he saw nothing wrong with the environment ministry seeking clarification from Lavasa on the hill city project being developed in Pune.        
	 They (the ministry) have the authority to do so and people concerned with the project should comply with it, he told PTI and voiced hope that a decision would be taken on merit.        
	Pawars daughter and son-in-law were once associated with the project but they withdrew from it six years ago.        
	The BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, Gopinath Munde, said the Maharashtra government should ensure that all files concerning Lavasa remained in its possession.        
	Environment minister Jairam Ramesh today said there was no prejudice involved in his ministrys showcause notice to Lavasa.        
	Lavasa is attacking me personally. It is unfair and unfortunate, he said. The company had said the showcause notice was issued under pressure of political activists like Medha Patkar without following any principles of natural justice.        
	The ministry had said construction was carried out above 1,000 metres of sea level against the permitted range of 640-900 metres.        
	Lavasa today filed a writ petition against the showcause notice, accusing the ministry of ulterior motives.        
	Social activist Anna Hazare, who was slated to start a hunger strike demanding a probe into the Lavasa project, has deferred his agitation by three months after meeting chief minister Prithviraj Chavan in Nagpur. But the new chief minister remained non-committal on a probe.

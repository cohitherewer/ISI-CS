The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ticket ploy leaves seats vacant 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ticket ploy leaves seats vacant 
          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 6: The mystery of the empty seats at the sold out Commonwealth Games opening ceremony has been solved: the Suresh Kalmadi-led organising committee was sitting on hundreds of tickets till the last minute, sources said.        
	The tickets, which the organisers had hoped to distribute as favours, eventually went to office boys, peons and attendants working at the committee headquarters, the sources added. Some were priced at Rs 50,000 each.        
	Kalmadi, Commonwealth Games Federation chief Mike Fennell and Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit have had a fractious meeting over the empty stands at the stadiums, the sources said. Fennell and Dikshit are upset at the way the organising committee has handled the sale of tickets, sources in the committee and the government said.         
	The interest in the events is huge, particularly among youngsters. We are inundated with queries about tickets, said a government official, suggesting that mismanagement by the organisers and not apathy of Delhiites was to blame for the poor turnout.         
	Fennell asked Kalmadi to sort out the issue, and Dikshit said she had asked the organising committee for free tickets to school and college students who could show their identity cards.         
	At a news conference today, Kalmadi was at a loss for words when questioned about the mismanagement.         
	But Fennell, sitting by his side, interjected: We have discussed the issue with the organising committee, we have raised the question on how to get people packed at the stadium. Only the organising committee and Mr Kalmadi can answer all these questions ... we have put this on the agenda for further discussion.        
	 Kalmadi claimed that 50,000 tickets were sold yesterday and that the boxing and wrestling stadiums were packed yesterday.        
	Now public interest is high with India picking up five gold medals. There are queues in the stadiums. It will improve everyday, he said.         
	However, Fennell seemed dissatisfied with the reply and repeated that the organising committee needed to do more.         
	Ticket counters have been opened outside the Games venues only after Fennells intervention. So far, tickets were being sold only at Central Bank of India branches, retail outlets of an automobile manufacturer and a fast food chain.         
	The people at the bank behave as if they are doing us a favour. Why couldnt they have kept these tickets at Mother Dairy booths? One has to wait for up to 30 minutes to buy tickets and then they want to see your identity proof, said Varun Bhambri, a software professional.

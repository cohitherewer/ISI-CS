The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Carrot to join new campuses 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Carrot to join new campuses 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, April 9: Teachers who join the new IITs, IIMs and central universities launched over the past two years may benefit from special incentives under a novel government plan to attract talent to fledgling institutions.         
	Cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekhar today held a meeting of top officials to discuss a proposal to offer differential incentives to teachers and administrative staff who join these new institutions, top government officials told The Telegraph.         
	Senior officials of the department of expenditure and the human resource development ministry participated in the meeting aimed at preparing a blueprint of the incentives to lure teachers to these institutions.         
	The move follows concerns that a shortage of qualified human resources could stunt the governments efforts at an unprecedented expansion in higher education, sources said.         
	The fear is that the brick and mortar campuses of our new IITs, IIMs and central universities may remain bereft of top faculty and qualified administrators unless we offer special incentives, a government official said.         
	Unlike many of Indias initial set of institutes, IITs, IIMs and even central universities, which were deliberately set up near industrial hubs and in major cities, the traditional neglect was the criterion for selecting the location of the new institutions.         
	The eight new IITs, seven IIMs and 15 central universities that have started since 2008 have all been allocated to states which did not have these institutions.         
	Earlier, we wanted our institutions to gain from being in the proximity of developed locations. Now, we want traditionally deprived states to benefit from being in the proximity of our best institutional brands, an officer explained.         
	But the change in approach has come at a cost, said officials.        
	An IIT in Patna, IIM in Uttarakhand and a central university in Kashmir are unlikely to attract top teachers and administrators as easily as if the same institutions were located in a metro.         
	While some may be attracted by the challenge of starting new institutions under difficult circumstances, others are likely to need other material or intellectual incentives, the officials argued.         
	Though the ministry has sought proposals from the new institutions on the kind of incentives that could be offered, sources said that the government has not yet finalised a blueprint.         
	There are also sections within the government that are concerned about the move to provide differential incentives to faculty and administrators for a few select institutions.         
	Their concern stems from the overall shortage of faculty in Indias higher educational institutions and the fear that special incentives may only lead to a reshuffle of the same faculty among institutions.         
	I am not yet convinced that such special incentives will help solve the faculty shortage problem. If teachers flee existing institutions to join new ones, it does not solve the faculty crunch problem. It merely accentuates the problems at existing institutions, an official said on condition of anonymity.         
	The older IITs for instance typically suffer from a faculty shortage of between 25 and 30 per cent of sanctioned posts.

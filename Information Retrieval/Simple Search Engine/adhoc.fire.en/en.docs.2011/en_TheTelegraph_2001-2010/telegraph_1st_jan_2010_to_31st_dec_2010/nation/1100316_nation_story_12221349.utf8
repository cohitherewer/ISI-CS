The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Age excuse for bomber
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Age excuse for bomber
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                           A copy of the school examination marksheet that Salman Ahmed has shown to prove he was a minor when he allegedly planted the bombs. The certificate mentions his name as Mohd Salman, not Salman Ahmed		      
	New Delhi, March 15: A youth who allegedly planted explosives in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and in the capital in 2007 and 2008 has claimed he was a minor when he committed the acts of terror  a line of defence also taken by Ajmal Kasab, the 26/11 terrorist.         
	Salman Ahmed, produced in court by the special cell of Delhi police, is suspected to have planted bombs in a Varanasi court room on November 23, 2007, in Gorakhpur on May 22, 2007, in Jaipur on May 13, 2008, in Ahmedabad on July 26, 2008, and in Delhi on September 13, 2008. He was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh anti-terrorist squad this month.         
	In court, Salman said: I was a minor during the said blasts and should be tried in a juvenile court.         
	In his defence, Salman produced a Class X marksheet issued by the Board of High School and Intermediate Education Uttar Pradesh.         
	The certificate, a copy of which is with The Telegraph, said he was born on October 3, 1992, which makes him 18 years in 2010 and 16 when he allegedly triggered blasts in Delhi.         
	The name in the certificate, however, is Mohd Salman, not Salman Ahmed, which could be one of the aliases the youth uses. Often, when the police file cases, they use the aliases to identify the accused. The special cell has, so far, not said the certificate is fake.        
	The court initially said Salman should be sent to a juvenile home and a dental test should be done to establish his age.         
	But the officer in the special cell, who was present during the hearing, said it was dangerous to put Salman in a juvenile home as he might flee. So he was sent to judicial custody.         
	However, the special cell stuck to its plea that Salman was 21 years old and should be tried in a regular court.         
	The Jamia Teachers Solidarity Association of Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh, has come to Salmans rescue. The association has written to the special commissioner on juvenile justice, Harsh Mandar, saying the youth was a minor and producing him in a regular court would be a violation of his rights as a minor.         
	We object to the remand of the boy granted to Delhi police, especially since the specific purpose of the remand is for interrogation, the letter said.         
	A minor cannot be left unprotected in the hands of an agency which has unbridled powers of inflicting violence  we are only too aware how interrogation routinely involves brutal mental and physical torture, the association wrote.         
	Kasab, the only 26/11 terrorist to be caught alive, had claimed that he was a minor in May 2009 while pleading his case in Mumbai.

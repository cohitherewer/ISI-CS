          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Ahmedabad, March 11: Investment banks are back to where they belong, shopping for students and ratcheting up the average salary at the countrys premier B-school.        
	The average domestic salary at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) has gone up from Rs 12.17 lakh last year to Rs 14.94 lakh this year. The average international salary on offer is $1.10 lakh, up from $83,000 last year.        
	Investment banks, most of which stayed away last year after the financial bloodbath across global markets, have returned, extending offers both through PPOs (pre-placement offers) and final placements.         
	Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup were among the major recruiters to extend offers through the PPO route. JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, HSBC and Nomura participated in the final process, said Mansi Chitalia, a student on the placement committee.        
	As many as 292 students, including three returning from a placement holiday, were made offers.        
	Among the other recruiters this year were Deloitte Consulting, A amp;M, Yes Bank, TSMG, Cognizant, Aditya Birla Group, Amazon and Philips. Mckinsey and Boston Consulting Group picked up eight students apiece. Goldman Sachs offered multiple roles in London while banks like Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank offered jobs across Asia Pacific. IT firms Cybage and Syntel Inc made offers for US operations.         
	Last year, when investment banks were reeling from the impact of the meltdown, public sector organisations had recruited as many as 41 students.         
	The PSUs were there this year as well, but made fewer recruitments.

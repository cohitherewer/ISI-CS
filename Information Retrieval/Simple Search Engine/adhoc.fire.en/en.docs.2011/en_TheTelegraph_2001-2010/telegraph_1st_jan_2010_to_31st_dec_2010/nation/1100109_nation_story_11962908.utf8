The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pawar and prices make Cong twitch

          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: The Congress is worried that rising food prices are undermining its aam aadmi plank.        
	Although the increasing global prices and a deficient monsoon are being mentioned as factors, many Congress leaders allege that Sharad Pawar has failed as food and agriculture minister.        
	The Congress is unsure how to respond to the crisis since explicit criticism of the governments failure to bring down prices and even working committee resolutions have yielded little in the past. The party has been restrained in its public response but an anti-Pawar sentiment is slowly gaining strength at its different levels.        
	Chief Congress spokesperson Janardan Dwivedis remarks today appeared to betray an unease behind his diplomatic defence of the governments performance.        
	Asked about Pawars periodic pronouncements that prices would rise further, he said: Any government or ministers job is not merely to point to the problem but to find a solution and provide relief to the common man.        
	Dwivedi argued the government should work both on short-term and long-term plans to meet the food security challenge. He recalled the special missions to boost the production of pulses in the past and asked the government to adopt policies to control price rise, give incentives to farmers, and take immediate relief measures for consumers.        
	He conceded that the party was worried and hinted that the governments management was far from satisfactory.        
	The party has been grilled at recent news briefings on the prices of food, particularly that of sugar which has almost touched Rs 50 a kg.        
	Although the prices of vegetables and pulses, too, have been abnormally high for a long time, just a mention of sugar is enough to trigger wild speculation in the Congress about Pawars complex relationship with sugarcane farmers, co-operatives, mill owners and exporters.        
	Although few party members can cite any substantive evidence that Pawar mismanaged sugar prices, their responses often come wrapped in suspicion.        
	Even senior Congress leaders wonder why Pawar makes bald announcements that prices would rise further, and ask if this does not encourage the hoarders, black marketers and unscrupulous traders.        
	Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed was questioned today on Pawars role in the poor price management but tried to laugh off the insinuations. He, however, acknowledged that the Congress leadership was concerned.        
	Ahmed, however, tried to pin the blame on the NDA government which legalised futures trading, state governments that have not acted against hoarders, and natural factors. He pointed to the difference between wholesale and retail prices and asked the states to take steps. He hoped that the arrival of the rabi crop would partially ease the crisis.        
	Sources said the food prices would figure prominently at tomorrows cabinet meeting and the government might soon announce steps to provide relief to consumers. The meeting, originally scheduled yesterday, was postponed because of the Prime Ministers Calcutta trip to visit Jyoti Basu.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RSS sings Modi paeans
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      RSS sings Modi paeans
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Narendra Modi                                  
	New Delhi, July 5: The RSS apparently wants to make up with Narendra Modi after a fairly long spell of mutual acrimony.        
	The outfit signalled its intent recently in its English mouthpiece, the Organiser. The weekly, brought out from the RSSs campus in the capital, ran three articles copiously praising the Gujarat chief minister and carried a news report highlighting his speech in a BJP rally at Patna on June 13.        
	BJP national executive member and former Sangh functionary V. Shanmuganathan wrote the pro-Modi articles. Also a BJP parliamentary party office secretary, Shanmuganathan had been invited to Gujarat by Modi in May.         
	The first piece, published in the June 13 issue, was on the Modi governments soil-testing programme that apparently helped farmers plan their crop mixes based on the health of their land.        
	The second  June 20  quoted farmers testimonies to buttress the claim that Modi had given a greater boost to agricultural growth than industries and services and improved its share of contribution to Gujarats economy.        
	The last  July 4  sang paeans to Gujarats inclusive and sustainable development facilitated by Modis initiatives such as inter-linking of rivers and uninterrupted power supply to villages, which had resulted in a decline in migration to cities and ensured the highest per capita income of Muslims.        
	Asked if the Organiser had commissioned his writings, Shanmuganathan said: I offered to write and the editor gladly agreed. I was horrified when I saw farmers committing suicide in Vidarbha. That prompted me to do a study on the peasants of Gujarat, which is Maharashtras neighbour. The (Modi) government helped me.         
	The report on the Bihar Swabhiman rally in Patna, which took place against the backdrop of serious tension between the BJP and its ally, the Janata Dal (United), over Modi, waxed eloquent on how the crowd cheered each and every sentence of Modi. It is learnt that the original copy was even more expansive and had to be toned down in the interest of editorial objectivity.        
	Modi and the RSS fell out during his first term as chief minister after he arrested activists of the Sanghs farmer federation for protesting a power tariff hike. He had riled the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) after cracking down on an Ahmedabad swami, Asaram Bapu, for his alleged involvement in criminal offences.        
	The Sangh wanted to stay neutral towards Modi in the 2007 Gujarat elections. But pressure from its cadres and its NRI constituency, which benefited hugely from the chief ministers reforms agenda, had forced the RSS to eventually come out in his support.        
	A Sangh source explained that while certain leaders of his organisation had ego clashes with Modi  who is not known to suffer dissenters with a smile  they realised he had the backing of the cadres. Not for nothing is he our Hindu hriday ka samrat (monarch of the Hindu heart). We dont care about the personal problems our seniors might have with him. We hero-worship him because he is upfront about all that we care for. Does any other BJP leader aggressively take on Sonia Gandhi and her son? asked a middle-rung swayamsevak.

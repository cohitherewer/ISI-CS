	Bokaro, July 17: A Class XII student in Bokaro was beaten to death last night allegedly by teenaged brothers of his girlfriend after they found him in her room.         
	Seventeen-year-old Virat Vaidya was thrashed by the four boys, all high school students, when he went to meet the girl, who was a classmate.        
	The bruised body of Virat, the son of a Bank of India official, was found this morning at his house.        
	Virat and the girl joined Bokaro Public School last year. The boy, whose family hails from Begusarai in Bihar, and the girl, whose family stays in Purulias Jainagar, resided barely 300m apart in Bokaro.         
	Virat lived alone in the steel city as his father was posted elsewhere. The girl lived with her grandparents, her own brother, Rakesh, and three cousin brothers.        
	This morning, when police were in Virats room, the girl called on his cellphone, unaware that he had died. She blurted out about the previous nights incident when told about the death.        
	Around midnight, the girl had called Virat on his cellphone and asked him to visit her. He sneaked in somehow. But an hour later, Rocky, one of the girls cousins saw Virat in her room.         
	He called Pintu and Hari  two other cousins of the girl  and Rakesh. They barged into the room and allegedly thrashed Virat with whatever they could lay their hands on.         
	The police said that after over half an hour, the four took Virat to his house on a motorcycle and left him there with a warning that he must never meet their sister again.        
	This morning, a security guard at Virats house found his body.        
	The police arrested the brothers. They confessed that they had beaten up Virat. The four will be kept in jail till a court confims their minor status. They can then be sent to juvenile homes.

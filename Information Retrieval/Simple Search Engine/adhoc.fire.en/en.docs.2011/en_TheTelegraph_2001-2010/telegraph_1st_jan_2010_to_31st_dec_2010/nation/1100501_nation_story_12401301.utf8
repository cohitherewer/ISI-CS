The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi ready for Ulfa talks
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi ready for Ulfa talks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      GK Pillai                          
	New Delhi, April 30: The Centre has made up its mind to hold a dialogue with Ulfa with or without Paresh Barua, the commander-in-chief of the outfits military wing.        
	The government arrested the bulk of the Ulfa leadership last year, including its chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa, who are ready for talks but Barua has been holding out from his foreign hideouts.        
	Talks will be there with or without Paresh Barua, Union home secretary G.K. Pillai said today, making it clear that Barua was in no position to put forward conditions for his participation.        
	Pillai said Delhi was waiting for a response from Dispur on the subject. Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi had said last week that the government cannot wait indefinitely for Barua to return before talks could begin.        
	Observers believe that both Assam and the Centre are ready to go ahead with Rajkhowa and the other arrested leaders and leave out Barua altogether.        
	Just as Ranjan Daimary (leader of the anti-talks faction of the Bodo militants) is now left out of the whole Bodo issue, so is Barua, a government source said.

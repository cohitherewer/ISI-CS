          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, June 30: The three-week-long agitation over civilian deaths in Kashmir has begun to re-ignite regional tensions with Jammu.        
	Two events today served as pointers. First, the Omar Abdullah government briefly halted the Amarnath Yatra, which began today. This was done because the authorities feared that the pilgrims could be targeted by stone-throwing mobs in Kashmir where 11 youths have died in the past few weeks in alleged firing by security forces.        
	Jammus oil tankers decided to stop supplying fuel to the Valley for fear of attacks. Officials later claimed the tankers association had relented after it was promised security.        
	The twin disruptions revived fears of a face-off between the Hindu-dominated Jammu and Muslim-majority Kashmir, like the 2008 conflict over the then governments move to allot land to the Amarnath shrine board.        
	The first batch of nearly 1,300 yatris was stopped in Jammus Udhampur. The group was later allowed to go ahead, albeit at a snails pace. The strategy was to ensure that they entered the Valley in the evening and pass restive Anantnag  where three youths were killed yesterday  after dusk when the protestors were expected to be indoors.         
	The route leads to Pahalgam and Baltal, two base-camps from where the pilgrims have to walk to the cave-shrine.         
	Official sources the Centre had flown in 3,000 BSF troopers for the safety of the pilgrims. These will be in addition to the thousands of police, paramilitary and army personnel who are already guarding the yatra.        
	The tankers protest move only added to the yatra security ache. Anand Sharma, president of the Jammu Oil Tanker Owners Association, alleged that vehicles were stoned and drivers thrashed. We will not cross the Jawahar tunnel (connecting Jammu with Kashmir) until fool proof security is provided, he said. Around 200 tankers enter the Valley everyday from Jammu, carrying 24 lakh litres of oil.        
	A compensation of Rs 25,000 was given to a driver injured in one of the attacks by some of the protestors in the Valley.        
	Jammu divisional commissioner Pawan Kotwal claimed the issue was resolved. They have decided to resume their supplies to Kashmir and Kargil from Thursday after we assured them proper security, he said.        
	The tankers had announced a similar protest during the economic blockade of the Valley enforced in response to Kashmirs 2008 Amarnath land agitation. Dozens had died during protests in the Valley against the blockade when they tried to force open an alternative supply route to Muzaffarabad, across the LoC.        
	Police officials in Srinagar said the protests had not yet acquired communal overtones, though they admitted that some tankers may have been targeted. A lot of vehicles belonging to the locals (owners from the Valley) also came under attack and it was because of a call by separatists for a shutdown, an officer said.

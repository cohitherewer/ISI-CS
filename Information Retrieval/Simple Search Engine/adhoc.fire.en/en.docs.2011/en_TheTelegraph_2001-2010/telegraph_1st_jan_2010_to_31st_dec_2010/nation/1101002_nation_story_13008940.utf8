          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 1: Mamata Banerjee today accused Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee of neglecting the hills and dared him to visit Darjeeling, hours after the chief minister alleged that the Trinamul Congress chief had gone to Darjeeling to join hands with those who want to divide the state.         
	Mamata, who had gone on a two-day trip to the hills earlier this week, alleged Bhattacharjee had not visited Darjeeling in the past 10 years.         
	At a rally in Calcutta today, Bhattacharjee said: The Trinamul Congress leader visited the hills and waved her hand at people who want to divide the state. She went there to join hands with those who want to divide the state.        
	Mamata had met Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leaders, including Bimal Gurung, during her visit.        
	They are saying she had gone there on railway business. But railway work is being done only through advertisements in papers by spending lakhs of rupees, the chief minister alleged.        
	When told about Bhattacharjees remarks, Mamata said: I am tired of reacting to Buddhababus nervous outbursts. Now he is attacking me for visiting Darjeeling. If he had any love for the hills and the people there, he would have visited Darjeeling. But why didnt he go there in the past 10 years? Is Darjeeling outside India?        
	Accusing the Left Front government of neglecting the hills for over three decades, Mamata said: The state government is trying to create a divide between the people of the hills and the plains. Buddhababu is jealous because I got a warm reception from the people of the hills. He cannot tolerate the people there as they dont like the CPM.        
	However, the district administration said the chief minister had visited Darjeeling in February 2006 to lay the foundation stone for the Balasun drinking water project. He had met Subash Ghisingh, the then caretaker administrator of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, during the trip, the officials said.         
	Mamata said the people of the hills wanted peace. I will not forget the reception I got from them. It was heart-warming. The hill people want peace, which the CPM doesnt.         
	Jibesh Sarkar, the CPM Darjeeling district secretary, said: The chief minister can always visit the hills if he wants to. But he doesnt want to create problems by coming here as the Morcha will create problems.        
	PCPA cloud on rally        
	Peoples Committee activists are going from door to door in Jungle Mahal, warning villagers against attending the chief ministers rally in Midnapore town tomorrow. The local CPM leadership is, however, eager to marshal as many villagers as possible for the meeting.

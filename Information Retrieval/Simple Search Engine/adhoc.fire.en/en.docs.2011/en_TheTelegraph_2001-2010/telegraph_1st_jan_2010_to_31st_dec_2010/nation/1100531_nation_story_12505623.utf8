  - Limited role for technology in preventing track sabotage, say railway engineers         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           An armed guard at the Rajabandh crash site on Sunday. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	New Delhi, May 30: Technology will have a limited role in preventing sabotage on railway tracks, the best solution for which now appears to be alert human eyes, senior and former railway engineers have said.         
	The tragedy caused by the derailment of the Howrah-Kurla Jnaneswari Express on Friday has triggered speculation on how much technology can aid the railways in detecting tracks sabotage ahead of a speeding train.         
	An electrical device called a track circuit, primarily used to detect the presence of a train ahead could in principle alert train drivers about a breach in the tracks ahead. But a smart saboteur could easily dislodge the tracks while leaving the track circuit intact, two railway electrical engineers said.        
	There is no perfect defence against sabotage of tracks, said an electrical engineer who was formerly an adviser to the railway board. Someone may cut off a track segment but shunt the portion to maintain the circuit.        
	In any case, railway engineers say, track circuits are used along suburban segments of tracks where trains pass one after another within minutes. It would be prohibitively expensive to install track circuits for automatic signalling along the entire length of tracks where there is a long distance between stations, said an engineer in Mumbai.         
	Surveillance technology to look out for track-tampering would take years to implement, but it would take only minutes to subvert it and render it ineffective, said the former adviser.        
	For instance, in theory, cameras equipped with night surveillance capacity may be placed along vulnerable sections to look out for anyone trying to tamper with the tracks, but this means thousands of cameras would need to be constantly monitored.        
	It is absolutely impractical. Besides, a camera could be stolen or destroyed in minutes, the Mumbai-based engineer said.         
	The best option for now is intensified human patrolling of tracks. This could be put in place within days or weeks, the former adviser said.        
	The railways already have a patrolling system under which its staff inspect tracks with the help of motorised trolleys or pilot engines or other trains that might be passing along a section of the tracks. The engineers say a higher frequency of patrolling along the 3,000km length of tracks lying in Maoist areas may increase the chance of detecting problems. The catch, though, is the lack of security that has actually reduced patrolling in Maoist zones.        
	However, even patrolling is not foolproof, an engineer said. Ten or 15 people with sledgehammers could dislodge the clips along tracks in five minutes, he added.        
	The removal of clips could derail the next passing train. Derailment may also be achieved by placing wedge-shaped steel ramps along a track. These ramps are sometimes used to re-rail a derailed train, but if the engine wheels climb over the steel ramp, they may drop outside and cause derailment, an engineer said.        
	The engineers said poor track maintenance might cause a bumpy ride but usually not a derailment.

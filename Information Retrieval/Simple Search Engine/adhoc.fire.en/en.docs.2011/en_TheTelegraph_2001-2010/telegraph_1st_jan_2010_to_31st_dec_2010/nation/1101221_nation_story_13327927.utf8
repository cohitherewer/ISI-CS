	Dhaka, Dec. 20 (PTI): India was concerned about turmoil in Bangladesh ahead of the 2008 elections because of the fear that the situation could be used as pretext by the military to step in and take political control, according to a secret US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks.         
	Cables released by the whistleblower website show that a top Indian foreign ministry official had suggested to the US and the UK that they, along with Delhi, ask the interim government in Bangladesh to hold credible elections and insist that the army remain out of politics.         
	Mohan Kumar, then joint secretary in the ministry of external affairs, during a meeting at the US embassy in New Delhi with political counsellors Ted Osius, of the US, and PolCouns Alex Hall-Hall, of the UK, said they agreed on a core message to the Bangladeshi caretaker government that it remains on a path toward credible elections but clarifies that the military needs to remain out of politics.

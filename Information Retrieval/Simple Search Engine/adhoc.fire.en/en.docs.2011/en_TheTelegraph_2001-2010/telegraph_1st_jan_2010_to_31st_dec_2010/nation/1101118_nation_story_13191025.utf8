          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Manas Bhuniya		    
	Calcutta, Nov. 17: Bengal Congress chief Manas Bhuniya today said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should conduct a probe into the Rajarhat land allotments but added that the townships development should not suffer because of political battles.        
	Without naming the Trinamul Congress, the state Congress chief said: Since allegations have been made with regard to land allotments in Rajarhat, the chief minister should conduct an inquiry and unearth details about plot distribution there. But it has to be kept in mind that major initiatives have been taken to develop this township. Moreover, a financial centre is also being planned and the foundation stone has already been laid there. So, Rajarhats development should not be a victim of the ongoing political battle.        
	However, Bhuniya added: I had been to Rajarhat as chairman of the Assembly assurance committee to find out how plots there were procured without a single incident happening like that in Singur or Nandigram. I found that land procurement committees had been formed that included CPM, the Congress and Trinamul representatives. Still, an inquiry needs to be done.

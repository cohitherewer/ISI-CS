The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre frowns on anganwadi politics 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Centre frowns on anganwadi politics 
          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 20: The Centre has asked states to keep politics out of the selection of anganwadi workers  primary health workers responsible for children up to the age of six years.         
	It has come to the notice of the ministry that certain states include MLAs as members/chairmen of the anganwadi workers selection committee, the women and child development ministry has said in a circular issued to the states asking them to re-constitute the committees without the politicians.         
	According to the rules, the selection committee should include the district social welfare official, the block development officer and the medical officer of the primary health centre.         
	The ministry believes the states have been misusing the provision for a non-official member to accommodate the local MLA. That provision was meant to include a subject expert or a member from the weaker sections like the SCs/STs or the minorities. But most states use this provision to include a political member, a ministry official said.         
	A process is on at present to recruit over 1 lakh anganwadi workers across the country, under the Integrated Child Development Services scheme that was started in 1975 for the holistic care of children up to six years old.         
	The responsibilities of anganwadi workers  there are 6 lakh anganwadi centres across the country  include keeping track of childrens growth, giving them supplementary nutrition, assisting in the immunisation programme and organising pre-school activities.         
	Although the salary is a pittance  Rs 1,500  the post is seen as influential locally and has many takers.         
	The ministry official said politicians use their clout to get their own nominees the job while deserving candidates without political support or the money to bribe politicians get left out.         
	Local power politics comes into play during the appointment of anganwadi workers and helpers and this very often leads to inter-political rivalry, which in effect blocks the recruitment process. There are a number of anganwadi centres which are lying vacant simply because politicians clash over selection, the official added.         
	As many as 69,924 posts of anganwadi workers and 1,21,896 posts of helpers, who cook and clean, are lying vacant, the official said.         
	The educational qualification required for an anganwadi worker is Class XII pass in non-tribal areas and Class V pass in tribal areas.         
	But many states have been following different norms. Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have relaxed the norms and appoint even illiterate women as they were finding it impossible to find women who had passed Class XII or even Class V in several districts.         
	Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda recently announced that widows, women deserted by their husbands, divorcees and the wives of convicts serving life terms would be given 15 per cent and 25 per cent weightage respectively for selection as anganwadi workers and helpers to help them support themselves and their children.

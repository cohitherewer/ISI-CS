	New Delhi, June 17: The ministerial group set up on the Bhopal gas tragedy will focus on the future course of action rather than getting stuck in old controversies, sources said today.        
	The sources said the group of ministers (GoM) had decided to meet every day from tomorrow so that it could submit its report to the Prime Minister on Monday, but complexities involving some vital issues had limited its options regarding concrete recommendations.        
	The four issues the GoM plans to concentrate on are: a bigger compensation package for the victims, cleaning up the site, strengthening the legal framework to deal with industrial disasters and studying whether Dow Chemical, which has bought Union Carbide, can shrug off financial responsibility for cleaning up Bhopals environment.        
	Although the GoM would try to address controversies like then Union Carbide chief Warren Andersons release, the issue is not part of its core concern.        
	Sources said the government was working on a huge compensation package that would be one of the main recommendations of the GoM.

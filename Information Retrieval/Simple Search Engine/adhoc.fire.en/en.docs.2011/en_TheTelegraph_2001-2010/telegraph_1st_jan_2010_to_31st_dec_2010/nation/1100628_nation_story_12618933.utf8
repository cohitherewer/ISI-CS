The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India joins mission telescope
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      India joins mission telescope
  - Worlds most powerful eye in Hawaii has experts from home        G.S. MUDUR                                                  
	New Delhi, June 27: India has joined an international telescope project as an observer, a first step towards full partnership to help develop and use the worlds most advanced astronomy observatory on the top of a volcanic peak in Hawaii.         
	The Thirty-Meter Telescope at Mauna Kea in Hawaii, is expected to be the most powerful optical telescope in the world when completed by 2018, and help in the search for planets outside the solar system and the study of the earliest galaxies.         
	Science and technology minister Prithviraj Chauhan announced Indias decision to join the project as an observer on Friday during his visit to the US, after a panel of Indian astronomers recommended that India should join the TMT effort.         
	We believe India could contribute substantially to various components of the TMT project, Ajit Kembhavi, director of the Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, told The Telegraph.         
	Astronomers from IUCAA, the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore and the Aryabhata Research Institute of Observational Sciences, Nainital, have pencilled a proposal envisaging Indias contribution to TMT through hardware and software.         
	US scientists leading the project have welcomed Indias entry.         
	We can now begin exploring the specific areas where India can contribute to the project, said Edward Stone, vice chair of the TMT Board and professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology.         
	India is well recognised and respected as one of the top-ranking countries in the field of basic research, said Henry Yang, chairman of the TMT board, who is also chancellor of the University of California, Santa Barbara.         
	Site work on the TMT is expected to begin late next year and astronomers are hoping to make their first observations in 2018. The TMT will be the first of the next generation ground-based observatories with innovations for precision control, sharper images, and special optics to correct the blurring effect of the Earths atmosphere, the project consortium said in a statement from Pasadena, California.         
	The TMTs 30m primary mirror will give it nine times the collecting area of todays largest optical telescopes and three times sharper images, the consortium said.         
	The larger the telescope, the further we can see, and the fainter objects we can study, Kembhavi said. The TMT could be used for a variety of studies, he said, including the hunt for extrasolar planets and observations of the earliest galaxies in the universe.         
	The astronomy panel from IUCAA, IIA, and ARIES picked TMT after assessing three next generation observatories  the TMT, the Giant Magellan Telescope, and the European Extremely Large Telescope, all three of which are expected to become operational around 2018.         
	Astronomers are also relying on space-based observatories  such as the Hubble Space Telescope launched in 1990 or the Chandra X-ray Observatory launched in 1999, and named after Indian-American physicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. But we still need large telescopes on the ground, said Ram Sagar, director of ARIES, Nainital. We cant send giant telescopes into space.         
	The Indian government is yet to commit funding for the TMT project which is expected to cost several hundred million dollars to build, a member of the Indian astronomers panel that picked the TMT project said.         
	The astronomer said the European Extremely Large Telescope also seemed an attractive option, but India might have had to pay substantially higher to join the European effort. We need to distribute funding for activities in India and such international projects, the panel member said.         
	The TMT is an international partnership involving a consortium of US academic institutions and Japans national astronomical observatory. China had joined the TMT as observer in 2009.

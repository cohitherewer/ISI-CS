          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 13: Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy has been quietly chipping away at the Congress support base on the weekends and doing a pretty good job of it.        
	Two weeks after exiting the Congress in a huff, his campaign against the high command seems to have gained momentum with a series of party workers coming out in his support.        
	Last weekend, Machilipatnam Congress MLA Perni Nani joined Jagan as he toured the coastal Krishna and Guntur districts consoling farmers whose crops had been wrecked by unseasonal rain. This weekend, Nani has opted to join Jagan on his Odarpu yatra, likely to resume from Thursday.        
	Many loyalists of Jagans father, late Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, are also believed to have voiced support for him. Several MLAs from the two districts, including Krishna zilla parishad chairperson Kukkala Nageswara, are reported to have met him. So has a former mayor of Vijayawada city, T. Shakuntala.        
	Jagan is also believed to have motivated Congress leaders from the Kapu community, including M. Padmanabhan, to switch sides.         
	Sources said Andhra chief minister Kiran Kumar Reddy, who was in Delhi on Saturday, instructed trusted lieutenants in Krishna and Guntur districts to mount a damage- control operation as reports of Congress MLAs meeting Jagan began streaming in. He also asked L. Rajagopal, the Vijayawada MP, to hold talks with Nani but little came of it.        
	The farmers from the coastal districts are reported to have responded well to Jagan as he stopped at various points. At most of the meetings, Jagan is believed to have repeated YSRs favourite statement that when farmers shed tears, it is always a bad omen for the state.        
	Jagan said it was the states duty to take steps before the farmers committed suicide. But the Kiran Reddy regime was still busy with the nitty-gritty of government formation.        
	My father would have acted by now. I wish his successors follow suit for the sake of the poor farmers.        
	Experts said Jagan gameplan as of now appeared to be to wean away Congress workers without openly challenging the state government. But during the Odarpu yatra, Jagan will totally expose the underhand dealings of the Congress, a source said.

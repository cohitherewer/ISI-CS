  - Six IIM students plan to sit for civil service exams         BASANT RAWAT                                                  
	Ahmedabad, Nov. 2: For a small band of B-school buddies, it isnt only about the money.        
	Around six final-year students of IIM Ahmedabad, the premier management school thousands of students would give their left hands to get into, are mulling giving it all up to join the civil services.        
	Its all hush-hush yet but the gang of six is considering opting out of campus placements that start next March to take a shot at the civil services prelims.        
	They are already secretly preparing for the exam, said Ashok Bharadwaj, one of the final-year students. If things work out as they would like it to, they wouldnt bat an eyelid before giving up a high-paying job as an investment banker and go for the civil services, another added.        
	A third said they would take the final decision only at the start of campus placements next year because by then we will know where we stand.        
	If our confidence level is very high, we will opt out of placements. But if we are not sure, we will take up a job and after a few years experience, quit the job to prepare for the civil services, said Manish Agarwal (name changed), another final-year student who is also a graduate of IIT Delhi.        
	Without going into the specifics, Manish said he belonged to a particular Rajasthan community that was known for its craze for the civil services. But thats not why I am preparing for the Union Public Service Commission exams. Its all about choices, the 23-year-old said.        
	Manish said he had already interned with an investment bank for two months and had found the job boring.        
	After coming here, I realised that I didnt want to get into marketing, finance or any other (related) job. Maybe the desire to become an IAS officer has always been dormant inside me. It has surfaced and now I can clearly see what I want in life, he said.        
	To his mind, the challenges of being a civil servant were bigger than those of being a company CEO, Manish said. While he would have a chance to to turn around a PSU if he were a civil servant, as a CEO he would only be dealing with a company. Obviously, restructuring a PSU would have a larger impact on people than turning around a company that would benefit only its shareholders, he said.        
	That (being a CEO) is not what I want to do, Manish said. Money becomes notional after a point of time.

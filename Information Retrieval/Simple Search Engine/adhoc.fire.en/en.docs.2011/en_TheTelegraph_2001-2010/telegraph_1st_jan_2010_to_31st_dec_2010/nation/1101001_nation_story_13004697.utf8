The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Happy Sangh tries to hide its glee
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Happy Sangh tries to hide its glee
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                        Mohanrao Bhagwat in   New Delhi on Thursday. (AP)    
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: The Sangh fraternity tried hard to mask its sense of triumph on the Ayodhya title suit verdict with an appeal for Hindu-Muslim amity and Muslim magnanimity.         
	The running thread in the responses of the RSS, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and BJP was that this was an opportune moment for Muslims to forget past rancour and become active collaborators in building a temple for Ram.        
	The RSS and the BJPs call to observe restraint went unheeded by their cadres. The BJPs headquarters was littered with remnants of crackers, sweet boxes and party flags while the familiar holler of Jai Shri Ram echoed from the VHPs office.         
	We have to grant this much space to our workers. But none of our leaders endorsed the celebration, claimed a political aide of BJP chief Nitin Gadkari.        
	The VHP demanded that the Sunni Central Wakf Board should relinquish its claim over the one-third land outside the disputed 110X90 feet land that the court upheld.         
	All the 67 acres acquired by the Centre is Rams birthplace. We need it for a grand temple. Our sadhus and sants passed a resolution (last week) enshrining this demand, said VHP general secretary Praveen Togadia.        
	It is believed that the VHP will launch a campaign for this land even before the matter is settled by the Supreme Court in case either or both sides go in appeal.        
	Togadias colleague, Acharya Giriraj Kishore went a step further and asked Muslims to hand over two other contentious structures in a spirit of goodwill: Mathuras Shahi Idgah mosque and Varanasis Gyan Vapi mosque that stand cheek by jowl with functioning temples and have never been popularly a subject of bitterness.        
	While the RSS sarsanghachalak Mohanrao Bhagwat parried queries on how he proposed to take the process of temple-building forward, saying they would be answered by the clergy, he spoke in two voices on the issue. Building of the Ram temple signifies the identity, honour, independence and valour of our country. Sri Ram is the epitome of the eternal, inclusive culture of our country. The movement for the temple is not a reactionary one, nor is it against any particular community, Bhagwat maintained.        
	Hence this verdict, that facilitates building of a magnificent temple for Maryada Purushottam Ram, should not be seen by the society as a victory to any group or defeat to the other, he said adding our joy and happiness should find expression in a controlled, peaceful manner, he added.        
	The BJP too harped on the amity theme. A statement that was read out by L.K. Advani to the press said the verdict opened a new chapter for national integration and a new era for inter-community relations.         
	Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, who is widely blamed for one of the worst communal riots that had its roots in an aborted kar seva in Ayodhya in 2002, stressed it was time to look forward to build a nation based on the principles of love, brotherhood and bonhomie.        
	The BJPs reaction stemmed from the need to keep its secular Bihar ally, Janata Dal (United), on its side by downplaying Ayodhya. In a political outreach to Muslims, Modi has fielded several members of the community for the October local bodies elections.

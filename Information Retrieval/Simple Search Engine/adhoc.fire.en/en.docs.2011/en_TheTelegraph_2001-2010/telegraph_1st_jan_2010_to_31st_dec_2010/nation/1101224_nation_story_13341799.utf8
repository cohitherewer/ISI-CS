The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court no to Adarsh water plea
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Court no to Adarsh water plea
          SADAF MODAK                               
	Mumbai, Dec. 23: Bombay High Court has rejected a petition by Adarsh Housing Society that civic authorities resume the supply of water and electricity to the scam-hit building.         
	The Mumbai municipal corporation had revoked the buildings occupation certificate, stopping water and power supply amid allegations that most members of the society, meant for veterans of the Kargil conflict, had taken no part in the battle in 1998.         
	The division bench of Justices B.H. Marlapalle and U.D. Salvi found that no occupant had to vacate the flat because of the disconnection. The court also directed the environment ministry to pass an order as judiciously as possible after hearing Adarsh on December 29 and asked for an affidavit within three weeks.        
	Darius Khambatta, additional solicitor general, told the bench that the building violated environmental rules that forbid construction in protected coastal areas. He said the environment ministry had written to the state government about giving Adarsh permission under the Coastal Zone Regulations. But the letter, considered by Adarsh as a certificate, was in fact only a clarification.         
	The bench observed that the society misconstrued the letter and that at no point in time the authority had communicated their no-objection for the construction.         
	Khambatta also pointed out that the defence ministry had written to the Urban Development Department and other state authorities in 2010 before the scam broke out over the security threat posed by the building.

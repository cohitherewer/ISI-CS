The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Somalis seize ship off Kochi
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Somalis seize ship off Kochi
          ANANYA SENGUPTA AND AGENCIES                              
	Dhaka, Dec. 6: A Bangladeshi ship has been hijacked by suspected Somali pirates in the Arabian Sea, some 550km off Kochi, in what is being seen as a wake-up call for India.        
	For the first time, a Bangladesh-owned ship has been hijacked. The ship is now moving towards the Somali coast, so we suspect Somali pirates have captured it, Captain Jashimuddin Sarker, the chief nautical officer in the Bangladesh department of shipping, said today.        
	Heavily armed pirates chased MV Jahan Moni and attacked it twice within 90 minutes on Sunday before managing to get on board, officials said. Anti-piracy teams from Dubai and Singapore, as well as the Indian Coast Guard, have been requested to help retrieve it.        
	The ship, carrying 43,000 tonnes of nickel ore and a 25-member Bangladeshi crew, was heading towards Europe with merchandise from Singapore. It is owned by Brave Royal, a Bangladeshi shipping company.        
	We lost contact with the ship at 5.38pm Bangladesh time. All symptoms are there that pirates have taken control of the ship. It was chased for over an hour. It sent stress signals and then raised a security alarm, Bangladesh shipping department chief Rear Admiral Bazlur Rahman told agencies on Sunday.        
	Officials said the hijack could be a cause for concern for India because it happened 550km off Kochi and over 2,000km to the east of the Somalian coast. This could be an indicator that the pirates have begun prowling in the Arabian Sea close to the Indian coastline. Another official said it was a fact that the pirates had begun operating farther away from their country but they had never before struck so close to India.        
	Somali pirates have been making tens of millions of dollars in ransoms from seizing ships in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden. According to the European Union Naval Force, they are currently holding 23 ships, with 546 crew members, hostage.        
	Sundays hijack comes a week after Malaysias International Maritime Bureau warned India that Somali pirates had begun venturing close to the countrys west coast.        
	The pirates are now rampant along the west coast of India and the Maldives. Their favourite haunt used to be the Gulf of Aden in the Arabian Sea, Noel Choong, the head of the International Maritime Bureaus piracy-reporting centre, was quoted as saying in the New Straits Times in Kuala Lumpur.        
	In November, a Malaysian ship was hijacked near Seychelles, some 900 nautical miles east of the Somali coast. The ship, with 23 crew members from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Iran, was headed for Kenya from the UAE.

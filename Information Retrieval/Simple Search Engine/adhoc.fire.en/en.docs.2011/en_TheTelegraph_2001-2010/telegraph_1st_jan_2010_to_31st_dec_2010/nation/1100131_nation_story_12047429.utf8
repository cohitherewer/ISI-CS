          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 30: Maoist-hit Koraput region will soon find a place on the international map, but for a different reason.        
	The region is going to be recognised by the Food and Agriculture Organisation as a globally important agriculture heritage system on the pattern of world heritage sites declared by the Unesco, said eminent agro scientist M.S. Swaminathan here today.        
	Considering the extraordinary biological and agricultural diversity of the Koraput region, which needs to be protected as heritage for humankind, FAO has taken an initiative in conservation and adaptive management of globally important agricultural heritage systems.        
	The region, located at an altitude higher than the Western Ghats, has a rich assembly of unique floral and fauna. It is a reservoir of rich angiosperms, well-known gymnosperms and 30 species of ferns and is also conceived by the rice researchers as a centre of genetic diversity and secondary centre of origin of rice.        
	Fifty years ago, at least 3,500 paddy varieties were being cultivated in the Koraput region. Now the number of varieties has come down to barely 350, lamented Swaminathan, underscoring the need for conservation of bio-diversity.        
	Its a challenge before us how to conserve bio-diversity by converting bio-resources to jobs and income in an ecologically sustainable way, said the universally acclaimed scientist, who has set up a regional centre of his research foundation in Koraput.        
	Describing Orissa as a genetic paradise, Swaminathan called for concerted efforts with community participation to see that it does not become a paradise lost.        
	Highlighting the rich bio-diversity of Orissa, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the state had 86 species of mammals, 4,073 species of birds, 2,720 species of plants, 110 species of reptiles and 20 species of amphibians enumerated so far.        
	Stating that the livelihood of the vast majority of the rural population in India, particularly in the agriculture dependent states like Orissa were linked to natural resources and elements of bio-diversity, Naveen said: Our effort has, therefore, been to protect our important eco-systems while supporting livelihood opportunities through a number of developmental projects.

	New Delhi, Feb. 15: Cricket Australias security adviser Reg Dickason, who is in India, is expected to investigate the repercussions of the Pune blast and file a report by this weekend.        
	The explosion came barely a month before the scheduled March 12 start of IPL III, where several Australian players are planning to take part.        
	Sources assisting Dickason said Cricket Australia was also waiting for an advisory from the players association and had left the decision to visit India to the cricketers. The association is expected to issue an advisory to the players after Dickasons report.        
	What will also be playing on the cricket boards mind is the fresh threat by Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray today. We would not allow them (Australians) to set foot on Indian soil, Thackeray told party workers today.

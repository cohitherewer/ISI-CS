The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Supplier sop back in nuclear bill
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Supplier sop back in nuclear bill
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: The Centre has sneaked in a sop for suppliers in the nuclear power sector in the amended nuclear liability bill through subtle semantic jugglery.        
	The sop virtually re-introduces a concession to the suppliers that the government had yesterday appeared to scrap by deleting an offending and in Clause 17 of the bill under political pressure.        
	The and would have forced a nuclear power plant operator, while seeking damages from a supplier for a nuclear incident, to prove wilful act or gross negligence on its part as well as an intent to cause nuclear damage (unless the nuclear-supplier contract said something else).        
	Removal of the and meant the operator had to prove just one of the two charges. But the amendments circulated among MPs today removed the wilful act or gross negligence provision, keeping only intent to cause nuclear damage, which the operator must now prove.        
	Unlike what the and had proposed, the latest amendment does not make it incumbent on the operator to prove both wilful act and intent, but not many would be convinced there is any substantial difference between the two.        
	So, the clause limits an operators right of recourse.         
	The latest amendments were ostensibly drawn largely from the proposals made by an all-party parliamentary panel. But the Centre chose not to accept the panels recommendation on suppliers liability in its entirety.        
	Clause 17 of the draft bill had said: ...The operator of a nuclear installation shall have a right of recourse where (a) such right is expressly provided for in a contract (supplier-operator) in writing or (b) where the nuclear incident has resulted from the wilful act or gross negligence on the part of the supplier of the material, equipment or services and (c) where the nuclear incident has resulted from the act of commission or omission of a person done with the intent to cause nuclear damage.        
	The standing committee had said wilful act or gross negligence was quite vague and that in an accident, it would be difficult to prove and establish... that it was a wilful act on (the) part of the supplier. Hence there should be clear-cut liability on the supplier....         
	The panel had suggested dropping wilful act. But the latest amendment has also knocked off gross negligence that might legally be easier to prove than an act of intent or wilfullness. Sub-Clause 17 (b) now reads: ...The nuclear incident has resulted as a consequence of an act of (the) supplier or his employees, done with the intent to cause nuclear damage....         
	Sub-clauses 17 (c) and 17 (b) are now virtually the same, both making it incumbent on an operator to prove that an act of commission or omission (by a supplier) was done with the intent to cause nuclear damage.        
	A Congress minister conceded the tweaking was done as a balancing act to find a middle ground. He admitted to immense pressure through industry delegations to negotiate easier terms for the suppliers. We were told they would otherwise be deterred from doing business with the government.        
	Nuclear power plants in India are now operated solely by the government and government-owned companies. But the private sector, including Indian firms like L amp;T, is already in the supply trade.        
	Yesterday, science and technology minister Prithviraj Chavan said: We have many Indian suppliers who will be just as interested in a liability law as the foreign suppliers.         
	Apparently, the suppliers had conveyed to the government that no country had a law as extreme as the one the House panel had proposed. However, the minister had said that if the BJP wished to beef up the clause through an amendment, the government might be open to it.        
	S.S. Ahluwalia and Rajiv Pratap Rudy, BJP members on the House panel, were unavailable for comment.

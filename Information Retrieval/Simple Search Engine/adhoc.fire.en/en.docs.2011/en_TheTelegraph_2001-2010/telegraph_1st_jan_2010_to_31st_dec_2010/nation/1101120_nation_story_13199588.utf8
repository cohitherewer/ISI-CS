The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Climate pledge purse fails to open up
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Climate pledge purse fails to open up
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: The developed countries appear to be failing to keep their promise made last year to provide fast-track finance to help the worlds poor countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, a UK-based non-government research organisation said on Thursday.         
	The International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) said the most concrete commitment to emerge from the global climate change negotiations in Copenhagen last December was $30 billion as fast-track climate finance for developing countries.         
	But the total amount pledged to meet the adaptation needs of developing countries so far appears to be about $3.1 billion, a meagre 11 per cent of all promised climate funds, the IIED said in a paper released on Thursday.         
	Our research shows that developed countries have failed to meet their responsibility to help poorer nations, said Achala Chandani, a researcher at the IIED and co-author of the paper.         
	India and other developing countries had argued during the climate change talks that the developed countries should facilitate the flow of technology and provide financing to help developing countries adopt environment-friendly technologies and adapt to climate change.         
	The IIED paper also cautioned that it is still unclear how these funds will be disbursed, what projects would it be used to support, and how the global community can track whether the funding is indeed new funds, an addition to existing aid budgets.         
	The UN framework for climate change talks has nearly two dozen different definitions of adaptation. This, the IIED paper suggests, is another problem.         
	The danger is that existing development projects that are not specific responses to the threat of climate change will simply be relabelled as climate adaptation projects, said J. Timmons Roberts, director of the Centre for Environmental Studies at Brown University, a co-author.         
	Climate change analysts have in the past suggested that developing countries will need up to $100 billion per year by 2030 to adapt to the impacts of climate change. The IIED has said the adaptation finance should be disbursed as grants and not loans.        
	The slow build-up of fast-track finance despite pledges at the Copenhagen conference is expected to be raised by developing countries during the next global climate change talks to be held in Cancun, Mexico, next month.

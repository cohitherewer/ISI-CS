          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Home minister P. Chidambaram with Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh (left) during the 40th All India Police Science Congress in Raipur on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Raipur, June 2: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today confessed that in many Maoist-hit districts across the country, police stations exist only on paper.        
	I do not wish to name the states or the police stations, Chidambaram said while addressing the inaugural session of the three-day 40th All India Police Science Congress that began here today.        
	But believe me, the home minister said, there are police stations where the station house has been blown up; there are police stations where there are no more than eight men; and even these eight men or less do not hold any weapons, fearing loot of the weapons.        
	Citing the Lalgarh example to substantiate his claim, Chidambaram said: You will recall the case of Lalgarh police station in West Midnapore district in Bengal. The police station was closed and locked from the inside for several months until the CRPF liberated it.        
	The 40th All India Police Science Congress  to be attended by 80 IPS delegates from across the country  has been organised by the Bureau of Police Research and Development, New Delhi, in association with the Chhattisgarh police.         
	The home minister said policing a country of over 1.1 billion people was not an easy task. Policing a country in a troubled neighbourhood makes the task more difficult, he said, adding that policing a country with insufficient police stations and inadequate and ill-equipped police forces made the task almost formidable.        
	Chidambaram said 12 states had not responded to the Union governments transparent recruitment process related to police reforms. Of the 30 states, only Uttar Pradesh had actually implemented the transparent recruitment process, he added.

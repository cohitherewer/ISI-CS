          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: The railways will head towards 2020 at lightning speed.        
	At least that is what the Vision 2020 document unveiled by Mamata Banerjee today for the utility suggests.        
	The paper, being held up as her road map and guiding force, spells out the short, medium and long-term goals.        
	Within five years of the UPA government, I think a larger section of the population will get connectivity, if we get special support (funds), said Mamata while presenting her budget in the Lok Sabha.        
	The railways plan to lay 1,000km of tracks in a year as part of the short-term goal. In 10 years, the figure should total 25,000km. That suggests a pace never seen: 180km of lines were added each year on an average in the last 58 years. The speed picked up, though, in the last five years, when the annual average stood at 219km.        
	On unmanned level crossings, too, Mamata intends to set a scorching pace. Plans to man 3,000 such points have been approved in the current financial year, and another 1,000 will be taken up next year (2010-11). Over five years, the plan is to convert all 13,000 unmanned level crossings into manned ones, Mamata said.        
	She made it a point to declare she keeps promises: of the 121 new trains announced in the last budget, 118 will be flagged off by the end of March this year. The remaining three would be started after gauge conversion.        
	Mumbai, where millions commute daily in coaches bursting the seams, will get 101 more local trains. Six more Duronto Expresses will start rolling in 2010-11, with the non-stop train catching the fancy of passengers.        
	Among the long-term goals is one to set up e-ticketing centres at hospitals, universities, courts, IITs, IIMs, district headquarters and village panchayats. Bottling plants will be set up in six towns to provide bottled drinking water at stations at cheaper rates. And, dont be surprised if you get an airport-like feel at some stations: luggage trolleys will be introduced for senior citizens and women.        
	Over the next 10 years, the railways also plans to provide house for all  that will provide residences to all railway employee. To help women employees, 50 creches will be set up along with 20 hostels.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IITs flaunt Hindi high, grey areas stay

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                             
	New Delhi, May 26: The number of candidates who cleared the IIT Joint Entrance Examination after taking the test in Hindi is three times the number last year, apparently bucking a trend of poor performances despite question paper errors disadvantaging them.         
	As many as 554 candidates who took the test in Hindi have qualified, compared with 184 last year, the IITs said while declaring their results today after over a month of controversy over instruction errors.        
	The IIT decision to declare the number of Hindi qualifiers was a first and was a direct outcome of concerns that the errors in question papers selectively hurt students who took the test in that language.        
	But two crucial caveats must be considered for any complete comparison of performances of Hindi candidates between last year and this year.        
	First, only a detailed study of all qualified candidates will reveal whether many of the successful Hindi candidates have received low ranks and have entered the merit list because of an increase of about 1,000 seats.        
	Second, all qualified students need not necessarily earn seats in the IITs. The JEE admits students to the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University and the Indian School of Mines University, Dhanbad, along with the IITs.        
	While most top rankers opt for the IITs, the qualification merit list ranks students up to a number which is 1.3 times the total seats available in the IITs, IT-BHU and ISM Dhanbad together. So receiving a qualification rank does not mean a seat in the IITs  or even in ISM Dhanbad or IT-BHU.        
	As was reported by The Telegraph on May 1, students who took the test in Hindi had a far lower success rate than counterparts who appeared for the JEE in English, suggesting a possible disadvantage.        
	Concerns over the errors in the question papers this year and their impact on Hindi candidates triggered fears that students who took the test in the language would this year have to battle a double disadvantage.        
	The papers this year had a set of questions with an actual weightage of eight marks each. But the instructions in the Hindi papers mentioned that each of these questions would carry a maximum of three marks.        
	In a highly competitive test like the IIT JEE where students need to pick the questions worth maximum marks that they can answer within the limited time available, this incorrect information could have hurt Hindi students.        
	Many may have opted against pursuing these questions or may have attempted them half-heartedly because of the relatively low marks they thought they would earn, critics have said.        
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar wrote to human resource development minister Kapil Sibal asking him to hold a retest. Sibal asked the IITs to evolve a mechanism to overcome any disadvantage faced by Hindi candidates.        
	The IITs merely accepted their error but did not evolve a mechanism to compensate students who did not attempt these questions in the manner they would have had they known the true weightage of these questions.

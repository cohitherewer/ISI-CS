The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MCI mulls single test for docs

          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: Indias apex panel of doctors regulating medical education is now discussing a single, common exit examination for all medical graduates in the country.         
	The idea, which has not been pitched to the government yet, involves a single examination that MBBS students across the country will have to clear before they receive their degrees, a panel member said.         
	Were thinking about creating a brand  call it MBBS India. Every Indian doctor will carry the same brand irrespective of which medical college he or she has studied, said Ranjit Roy Chaudhuri, one of the six doctors who make up the board of governors set up by the Centre earlier this year to oversee the Medical Council of India.         
	A senior medical faculty member not associated with the MCI board cautioned that while the idea appears attractive, it is likely to encounter fierce and legitimate resistance from states and medical colleges.         
	The MCI board had last month proposed a common entrance examination for admissions to undergraduate MBBS programmes across the country, arguing that it would ease the burden on students.         
	The proposal for a common entrance exam has encountered opposition from Tamil Nadu and has also drawn criticism from within the medical community.         
	Some medical faculty have questioned the wisdom of using a single test in a land with wide variations in standards of state school boards as well as in the quality of education in medical colleges.         
	Several states offer their own common entrance tests for medical seats.         
	Roy Chaudhuri said a single exit test would inject uniformity in the standards of MBBS qualifications.         
	Right now, a doctor from one institution may be valued higher than a doctor from another institution  why should this be so?        
	Roy Chaudhuri said members of the board had discussed the idea of the exit test and indicated that it was likely to be sent to the government after more consultations within medical circles.         
	Two years ago, a task force set up by the National Knowledge Commission had made an almost identical proposal for a common exit examination for MBBS students.         
	But the proposal has made no progress towards being implemented.         
	The idea does appear attractive because there is this great diversity of standards of medical education in the country, said Marthanda Sankaran Valiathan, a senior cardiac surgeon who was a member of the task force.         
	But centralisation need not a panacea for solving problems of diversity, Valiathan told The Telegraph.         
	The final degree is part of the process of MBBS education, he said, and states and other institutions which currently hand over degrees are likely to object to a single centralised system that supersedes their authority, Valiathan said.         
	History has shown us how centralised institutions dont always function in the manner they should, Valiathan said. I think this proposal for an exit examination will also face objections.         
	The Medical Council of India itself, he said, provides an example of how the functioning of a central institution had deteriorated to a level where it had to be disbanded.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In Sikkim, an infant varsity bucks trend
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      In Sikkim, an infant varsity bucks trend
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	Gangtok, April 20: Bank officer Dorjee Lepchas hopes of providing quality higher education to his twin daughters had always clashed with the heartbreak of sending them to a faraway city to pursue this dream.         
	But the past year has given roots to a new hope  that his daughters, currently in school here, can pursue quality higher education he can afford right in their home state.        
	An infant just 32 months old, the Sikkim Central University here, has spawned dreams and expectations from Gangtok to Delhi, where Kapil Sibals human resource development ministry is closely following the progress of a rare success story.        
	Our youths had to travel to Delhi, Calcutta or at least to Darjeeling for good higher studies. Now, I dream of sending my daughters to Sikkim University, said Lepcha, himself an economics graduate from Delhi University.         
	The university, which celebrated its first convocation last Friday, is a part of Indias unprecedented higher education expansion aimed at ensuring access to quality higher education in traditionally neglected regions.        
	The UPA has started or taken over 20 central universities since it came to power for its first term in 2004, doubling the countrys central varsity count from 20 to 40 over less than six years.        
	But most of the newly set up universities have struggled to take off yet and the existing universities that the Centre took over have largely failed to adapt to wide-ranging reforms which the government is pushing in higher education.        
	Having seen all the new universities, it is crystal clear that Sikkim University alone appears to holding aloft a beacon of hope, said a senior official at the HRD ministry in Delhi who has been closely associated with the start of the new universities.        
	At the helm of the varsity is economist Mahendra Lama who taught for 15 years at Jawaharlal Nehru University before becoming the founding VC of Sikkim University  and the youngest ever VC of a central university in India.        
	The new university started with just four departments but will offer as many as 17 postgraduate programmes from the academic session. It also has nine affiliated colleges  which were earlier affiliated to North Bengal University.         
	We are trying our best. The university represents the hopes of the entire people of the eastern Himalayas. And we want to live up to those hopes, said 49-year-old Lama.         
	The university is among a handful in India that conducts a nation-wide entrance examination to pick students for its postgraduate programmes and allows students to study courses across streams.         
	While old-timers like Delhi University battle to put in place a semester system, Sikkim University has convinced all affiliated colleges to overcome their initial reluctance and shift to an academic year consisting of two terms.         
	Lamas team declared results for all students last year within 20 days of the completion of examinations  a move that students say was a welcome change from having to wait for months earlier for results.         
	I dont know of a single university in India that has achieved so much in so short a period, said former foreign secretary Muchkund Dubey, who was also once deputy chairman of the Sikkim Planning Commission.         
	But the university faces serious challenges as well, and some within the universitys administrative structure are questioning Lamas decision to affiliate local colleges.         
	The university has such strong prospects in postgraduate education and research, and these colleges are still of fairly poor standards. They may pull our standards down, said a member of the university academic council.         
	The university has to battle local competition from the privately-run Sikkim Manipal University that at present has incomparably superior infrastructure to the government varsity that is operating out of eight rented buildings.         
	The shortage of teachers that plagues most Indian higher education institutions is a problem for Sikkim central university too.        
	Foreigners need the Inner Line Permit to enter Sikkim  a major deterrent to the universitys plans to attract students from Nepal and Bhutan.         
	But Lama remains confident. We can do this, he said.

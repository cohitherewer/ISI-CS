The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC notices on Tata privacy plea
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      SC notices on Tata privacy plea
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the government and two magazines that published transcripts of the Niira Radia tapes in a case related to a petition by Ratan Tata to protect his privacy.        
	The tapes feature purported conversations between the lobbyist and journalists, industrialists and politicians.        
	Representing Tata, senior counsel Harish Salve said his client was not seeking to restrain the media from using those transcripts that deal with public affairs. But those which feature clearly private conversations should not be published, he said.         
	He, however, placed the onus of preventing such leaks on the government which had possession of the tapes. He said his client was also not challenging the legality of the right of the statutory authority to tap his phones.         
	Tata was assuming it was done legally with due authorisation under existing laws, Salve said. He was also not challenging the right of an authority like the CBI to use these recordings for purposes of investigation, the counsel added.         
	However, Salve said, his client was against any mass disclosures of audio files in the manner in which they had come out recently in some magazines. He referred in this context to the excerpts of the conversations carried in Open and Outlook magazines.         
	Salve said the media was claiming that 5,000 hours of such tapes would be put in the public domain. I can understand that you glean certain information from the tapes related to public affairs, but are you going to put all those files in the media? Salve wondered.         
	He urged the court to balance the rights of the media with the private right of an individual to privacy.         
	Private conversations cant be placed in public domain, he said.        
	Five thousand hours of conversation. One can understand if there is a filtering mechanism that takes out that which has a bearing on public interest, he said. But mass disclosures violate privacy, he said.         
	He accused the government of having failed to protect his clients privacy.         
	Salve cited several earlier court decisions which have held that the right to privacy was part of the right to life and sought a court directive to the government to balance the publics right to know with his clients right to privacy.         
	The court sought to know the views of the magazines and directed Salve to implead the two publications in the case. The next hearing is held on December 13.

          MANINI CHATTERJEE                       Manmohan Singh with wife Gursharan Kaur at the G20 Summit in Toronto on Saturday. (AP)                          
	Toronto, June 27: India, long used to homilies from the West on how to run its economy and manage its finances, paid back in full measure at the G20 summit held amid mass street protests here today.         
	In a speech that almost seemed he were lecturing at the Delhi School of Economics once more, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned the developed world that their economic recovery was still fragile and that it wasnt yet time to give up efforts to stimulate the economy in the name of fiscal consolidation  a euphemism for cutbacks and austerity measures that some European nations are seeking.         
	The Prime Ministers intervention, observers felt, drew great attention for two reasons. First, Manmohan Singhs standing as an economist and the architect of Indias growth story has become something of a legend over the years, which even newcomers to the Big Boys (and Girls) Club such as Britains David Cameron and Naoto Kan, the Japanese Prime Minister, are aware of.         
	The second is that India has managed to weather the global economic crisis better than most major economies of the world  and that provides much more ballast to Indias word at various world fora.         
	The Prime Minister made it a point to mention  as though in passing  just how well India had managed to do at a time of gloom and doom in much of the developed world. Commenting briefly on how we in India are handling the situation, the Prime Minister said: Thanks to an effective fiscal and monetary stimulus, we were able to contain the effect of the global crisis on our economy. After growing at 9 per cent for four years before the crisis, our economy averaged about 7 per cent growth in the last two years. We expect to grow by 8.5 per cent in 2010-11 and we hope to go back to 9 per cent by 2011-12.         
	But the substance of his speech was directed at the western powers which are sharply divided on the next stage of recovery. While Europeans led by Germany and France are pressing for fiscal consolidation, the US does not want to withdraw its stimulation efforts just yet.         
	In a nuanced approach to the issue, Manmohan Singh backed the US view of the matter while at the same time appreciating the concerns of the Europeans.         
	The central problem, Singh said, was how to ensure and protect global growth in a situation where markets have become very nervous about debt sustainability, especially in some countries in the Eurozone.         
	Although a debt crisis normally called for a fiscal contraction, the circumstances today are not normal, the Prime Minister said. Elaborating, he pointed out that the recovery is still fragile and private demand in industrialised countries is likely to remain weak. Contractionary policies, if followed by many industrialised countries simultaneously, could provoke a double-dip inflation. We must, therefore, give primacy to consolidating the recovery, while also taking measured steps to deal with sovereign debt problems.         
	Sounding very much like a professor who wants to give his students both sides of the argument before drawing a conclusion, the Prime Minister said: I recognise that there are uncertainties and it is difficult to strike the right balance. But on the whole, I feel the risks of destabilising the recovery are too great. We have a much greater risk of deflation than inflation. We must, therefore, give primacy to consolidating the recovery, while also taking measured steps to deal with sovereign debt problems.         
	Recognising that the same-policy-fits-all approach would not work in the light of very different experiences of countries within the developed world, he said: Fiscal consolidation must obviously have high priority in those advanced deficit countries that are experiencing exceptional fiscal stress and where markets have signalled serious concern. However, other advanced countries should opt for a much more calibrated exit from stimulus.         
	In other words, Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, was welcome to go in for an austerity drive but others  and Barack Obama certainly  should not follow suit.         
	That this was not just an academic prescription but very much in the interest of Indias own growth became clear in the latter half of his speech.         
	Although he did not mention India by name and spoke generally of developing countries, the Prime Minister outlined Indias own strategy. Broadly, it was based on less dependence on exports and more on domestic demand which meant more investment in infrastructure which in turn would generate larger current account deficits.         
	But such higher deficits required an expansion of capital flows from the developed world and international financial institutions. As the Prime Minister baldly stated: Growth in developing countries would be greatly helped if threats of new protectionist measures in industrialised countries are firmly resisted and existing barriers to trade, especially those affecting developing counties, are reduced.         
	The Prime Minister held a series of bilateral meetings over the weekend, including with Obama, Cameron, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Kan.         
	These were more to establish or reaffirm a warm, personal rapport at the apex level that invariably facilitates more meaningful nation-to-nation ties, officials said.

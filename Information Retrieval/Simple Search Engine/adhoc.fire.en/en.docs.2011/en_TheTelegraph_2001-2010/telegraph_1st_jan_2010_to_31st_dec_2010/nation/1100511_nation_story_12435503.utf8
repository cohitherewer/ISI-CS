The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Frown for Ramesh before Chinese talks
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Frown for Ramesh before Chinese talks
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, May 10: Home ministry officials today described Jairam Rameshs remarks as a breach of protocol and revealed that home secretary G.K. Pillai was scheduled to meet the Chinese ambassador and executives of Chinese telecom company Huawei next Wednesday.        
	On Saturday, Ramesh had said the home ministrys policies towards Chinese companies was paranoid and alarmist, referring specifically to the bar on the import and installation of Huaweis telecom equipment.        
	Pillai denied any discrimination against Chinese firms and asserted Indias right to take decisions in the interest of national security. He said China was Indias largest trading partner and the annual bilateral was worth $38 billion.        
	The balance of trade in favour of China is $24 billion. Therefore, there can be no cause to say there is discrimination against China. (Chinese companies) are working in a variety of sectors (in India), including telecommunications, he said.        
	Our policy is to ensure that national security is protected irrespective of the foreign country involved.        
	Sources said Pillais meeting with Chinese ambassador Zhang Yan had been scheduled after an earlier request from the envoy and was unrelated to Rameshs comments. Pillai will meet top Huawei officials separately.        
	A climate-change negotiator present at the Copenhagen talks said Rameshs comment about India preventing Chinas isolation at the summit was puzzling.        
	India and China have been co-ordinating our positions over the past five years, the negotiator said.         
	About six months before the Copenhagen meeting, this process of co-ordination was extended to cover Brazil and South Africa. This group of four was in Copenhagen with a very careful co-ordination of policies.        
	In this context, he said, it is unclear how China could have found itself isolated.

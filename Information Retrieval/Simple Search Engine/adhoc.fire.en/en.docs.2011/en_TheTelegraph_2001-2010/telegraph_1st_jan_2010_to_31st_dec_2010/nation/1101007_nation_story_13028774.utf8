  BJP questions intellect          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul Gandhi arrives at the news conference in Bhopal on Wednesday. (PTI)                                        
	Bhopal, Oct. 6: Rahul Gandhi today called the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh a fanatical organisation and said it was in no way different from the banned terror outfit Simi as both held fundamentalist views.         
	The comment, which came at a time the Congress is preparing to grapple with perceived dormant Muslim anger in the wake of the Ayodhya verdict, drew terse rejoinders from the Sangh fraternity, with the BJP calling him mentally disabled.        
	The Congress general secretary, on a three-day visit to BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh, had yesterday told a group of youths in Tikaramgarh district not to consider the Indian Youth Congress as an option if they had extremist religious or fanatical views.        
	Today, at a media conference in Bhopal, he said: I know only that both Simi and the RSS are fanatical and hold fundamentalist views.        
	When pointed out that Simi has been linked with terrorism, Rahul, declared a state guest by chief minister Shivraj Chauhan, insisted that he considered both the RSS and the banned outfit similar in nature for their hard-line ideology.         
	He, however, avoided mentioning that the RSS had been banned thrice  in 1948, when Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated, during the 1975-76 Emergency and after the December 1992 demolition of the Babri mosque.        
	The Sangh hit back fast, advising Rahul to understand India better. What can we say about statements that have no meaning? People who make such statements should first understand India, its society and the organisations doing work here, spokesperson Ram Madhav said.        
	It is not enough to just know about Italy and Colombia, Madhav said, without explaining the Amethi MPs possible link to the Southern American country. Only mentally disabled people can compare Simi with the RSS, said BJP national spokesperson Prakash Javadekar. Simi is a terrorist outfit.         
	State BJP chief Prabhat Jha said the comment reflects Rahuls level of intellect. Rahul Gandhi does not know the difference between the sense of nationalism-patriotism and terrorism. There are so many Simi activists in jail for declaring war against the country.         
	The young Gandhis comment bracketing the RSS with Simi harks back to his great grandfather Jawaharlal Nehrus stand that majority communalism was equally, if not more, dangerous than minority communalism. While minority communalism was by and large defensive, Nehru always maintained that majority communalism, besides being aggressive, was politically reactionary in character.         
	Rahuls comment came at a time the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) said to be thinking of moving the Supreme Court against last weeks Allahabad High Court verdict on the Ayodhya title suits.        
	The apex body of various Muslims sects in the country is reportedly not so much worked up over the dismissal of the Sunni wakf boards title suit as the primacy of faith accorded in a judicial pronouncement. Hawks within the AIMPLB have informally told some Congress leaders they would consider launching a public movement if the UPA fails to check the trend.         
	The Congress is, therefore, caught in a bind. With the Bihar Assembly polls round the corner and elections in Uttar Pradesh due in 2012, it wants to tread cautiously. Rahuls stand equating majority and minority communalism came in this backdrop.         
	Asked about his chances of becoming Prime Minister, Rahul said he had never worked under the assumption that he would one day occupy the chair. It may be your assumption that I will become the Prime Minister but it is certainly not mine, he said. Told that perhaps it was his destiny to become one, he said: I dont believe in destiny.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 12: The Koraput administration has initiated an inquiry into misappropriation of wages of 16 illiterate workers of the district employed under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme by the supervisor in charge of the project        
	In September last year, the soil conservation department launched a project in Koraput that required planting of cashew trees in over 80 acres. Thirty villagers from Kharsapada of Lamtaput block were put to work for 11 to 43 days under the supervisor-in-charge Debiprasad Jena. When the project ended, Jena asked the workers for their post office passbooks where they would receive their wages. Jena also managed to take their thumb impression on withdrawal forms of the Machkund post office.        
	On February 28, the villagers were returned the passbooks only to find their dues  ranging from Rs 980 to Rs 3,870  were deposited and withdrawn on December 19. A departmental inquiry has been ordered, said District Rural Development Agency project director Rupa Roshan Sahoo.

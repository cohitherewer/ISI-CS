The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India seeks access to Lakhvi in 26/11 probe
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      India seeks access to Lakhvi in 26/11 probe
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: In whats a counter to a long-pending Pakistani request, India tonight sought access to top accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, including Lashkar-e-Toiba commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, for interrogation and collection of critical voice samples that it wants to match with phone taps made during and after the strike.         
	Sources said New Delhi had officially conveyed to Islamabad that it wanted to send a commission to Pakistan to quiz Lakhvi and other associates like Zarar Shah, Abu al Qama, Hamad Amin and Shahid Jamal Riaz. All are currently lodged in the high security Adiala Jail near Rawalpindi and being tried in camera.         
	The trial has proceeded at snails pace and Pakistan has consistently hedged Indian requests for voice samples of the accused. Home minister P. Chidambaram had made a specific request on voice samples with his Pakistani counterpart Rahman Malik during his Islamabad visit in late June.         
	On the other hand, a Pakistani request for a similar commission to visit India to question prime accused Ajmal Kasab and Mumbai additional chief metropolitan magistrate R.V. Sawant Waghule and investigating officer Ramesh Mahale of the Mumbai police who recorded Ajmals confession, has been pending for months.         
	At one stage, New Delhi had offered video interface to the Pakistani commission but nothing came of it. India is also firm that it will not allow any cross-questioning by a Pakistani commission.        
	New Delhis latest request could have two motives  to somehow rekindle a dialogue that died after the public spat between external affairs minister S.M. Krishna and his counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi in July, and in the absence of that, score fresh propaganda points on the Pakistani reluctance to cooperate in the 26/11 attacks probe.         
	While the Prime Ministers Office remains keen that dialogue with Pakistan be resumed, India is desperately looking for its neighbour to yield some ground or show positive progress on the 26/11 investigations before it can make a diplomatic move.         
	The Prime Minister has repeatedly said he is prepared to meet Pakistan more than half way provided they offer concrete results on the 26/11 probe and demonstrate they are willing to dismantle the terror infrastructure that works out of Pakistani soil.        
	The sense of both the PMO and the ministry of external affairs, though, has been increasingly pessimistic. Senior officials have spoken of strong unwillingness on the Pakistani side to address Indias concerns on the export of terror, especially the 26/11 terror attacks. They have stonewalled us at every stage despite the huge burden of evidence against not only Lashkar and Jamaat-ud-Dawa operatives but also of influential elements in the Pakistani military and intelligence establishment, a top official said.         
	Todays move, they suggested, was an attempt to open up a deadlock that has virtually put relations on the freeze. And while the request has gone out, officials remain pessimistic about a positive response from Pakistan.

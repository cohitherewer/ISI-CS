	New Delhi, April 8 (PTI): A mild radiation leak in a west Delhi industrial area triggered panic in the capital when a scrap dealer and his three employees suffered burn injuries and fell unconscious after coming in contact with a shining object.        
	The incident was reported from the Mayapuri industrial area, which has been cordoned off, police said today.        
	Deepak Jain, the scrap dealer who suffered serious burns, was yesterday rushed to a hospital which informed the government that he had suffered radiation, officials said.        
	Immediately, a team was requisitioned from the Mumbai-based Atomic Energy Regulatory Board which found during screening that radio-active emissions were coming from the scrap.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister P. Chidambaram have been informed about the incident.        
	Jain had found the bright, shining object among medical waste he bought from a hospital. When he and three of his workers opened the bag, they noticed their hands were turning black and they fell unconscious, the police said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cup saviour tossed around like a ball
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cup saviour tossed around like a ball
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                               
	New Delhi, March 11: The man whose save in the dying moments helped India beat Pakistan in the 1975 hockey World Cup final has been running from pillar to post for the past two days.        
	By now, Olympian Ashok Dewan must have realised that standing between the goal and marauding Pakistani forwards is much easier than getting a copy of an FIR from Delhi police.        
	Dewan was about to leave for Major Dhyan Chand Stadium to watch a hockey World Cup match on March 9 when he realised that his car was missing.        
	He immediately dialled 100. The cops arrived, took a copy of his car registration certificate (RC) and told him to come to Surendranagar police station in the evening for a copy of the FIR.         
	Thats when the harassment started. When I got there in the evening, the senior inspector wasnt present, the 57-year-old said.        
	I called him on his cellphone, but he refused to speak to me. He spoke to the cop on duty instead and I was told to come back again at 9pm. I told them I didnt have any hope of getting my car back and only wanted a copy of the FIR so that I didnt land into any trouble if the car was misused. They refused and its been two days now.         
	The apathy comes just three months after the Delhi police commissioner conceded that it was neither robbery nor murder, but motor vehicle thefts that dominated crime figures in 2009.         
	Some 27,000 cases of car theft were reported in the city last year.        
	Police sources said there had been a 25 per cent increase in the number of vehicle thefts, compared with that in 2008, and that these thefts accounted for about 15 per cent of all crimes committed in Delhi.        
	Dewans car, a Maruti 800, remains untraced and  police sources say  so do 80 per cent of vehicles that go missing in the city.         
	The cause for concern in case an FIR isnt registered arises from the fact that many such stolen vehicles have often been used for illegal activities and are traced back to the owners. If the owner doesnt have a copy of the FIR, it becomes difficult for him to establish his innocence, said a senior police officer.         
	A harried Dewan has done everything he can.        
	I called 100 again, they came, took another copy of the RC, but I am yet to get a copy of the FIR. I told them I would complain to the commissioner, it didnt help.         
	What more can a man do? I will go again today. I know I wont get my car back, but I need the FIR, said Dewan, who turned to coaching after his playing days were over.

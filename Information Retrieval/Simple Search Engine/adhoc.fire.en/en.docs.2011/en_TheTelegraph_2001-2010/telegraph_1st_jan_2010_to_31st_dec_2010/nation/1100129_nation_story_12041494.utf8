The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | R-Day flutter in US

	Washington, Jan. 28: With David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Hussain Rana fresh on their minds, police have launched a hunt for a man, ostensibly of Fijian-Indian origin, who made a vain attempt to disrupt a Republic Day function in San Francisco and convey a threat to India.         
	Police sources in San Franciscos Bay Area said they had traced a threat call placed to the Indian consulates emergency services number to Raj Naicker.        
	The call was made at the precise moment when a large audience was engrossed in a magic show on India through the ages at San Franciscos Palace of Fine Arts.         
	Acting swiftly on the threat, San Francisco police pulled up Naickers identification as a Fiji Indian and has made available his photograph to the consulate so that they can be on the lookout if he ventures to approach the consulate.         
	But names and antecedents can be misleading as India has learned from the Headley episode, where the American citizen who converted to Christianity hid his South Asian Muslim name at birth and his half-Pakistani parentage while applying for an Indian visa.         
	Officials of the consulate in San Francisco declined to discuss the case, but other sources in the Bay Area said a somewhat hysterical Naicker wanted to convey details of a terrorist plot against India.         
	It is understood that the details were immediately passed on to New Delhi. Naicker told the Indian official who answered his call that he had previously attempted to visit the consulate to personally give details of the terrorist threat to India, according to police sources.         
	Although the Bay Area police swiftly caught on to details about Naicker, they have since been unable to find him for questioning. But they are hopeful of being able to catch up with the man soon.         
	The celebration of Republic Day was an event of special significance to Bay Area Indians this year because San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom conveyed a proclamation to Indian consul general Susmita Gongulee Thomas at the function at the Palace of Fine Arts declaring January 26 every year as India Day.        
	San Francisco Indians who became aware of Naickers call later said consulate officials handled the entire episode with calmness and aplomb.         
	In New York, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon attended a reception hosted by the permanent representative to the UN, Hardeep Singh Puri and said the UN very much appreciated Indias help to Haiti in the aftermath of its recent earthquake.         
	In Houston, too, a reception hosted by consul-general Sanjiv Arora, went well, but not so the flag-hoisting ceremony followed by a cultural programme at the Indian embassy in Washington.         
	The missions chancery building here is one of the most vulnerable of Indian diplomatic properties anywhere in the world and edgy security officials, paranoid over recent terrorist threats, resorted to indiscriminate racial and religious profiling.         
	Shaan Fannwar from Meghalaya had been invited by the embassy to sing a Khasi song at the cultural programme, but he went on the stage to reveal that he and his accompanying singers had been questioned at the entrance, obviously on suspicion that they were subversive Chinese.

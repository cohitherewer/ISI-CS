          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          David Cameron with Manmohan Singh in New Delhi on Thursday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                  
	New Delhi, July 29: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today gently chided the Pakistan foreign minister but renewed the invitation to visit India, addressing audiences on both sides of the border.        
	Singh used a joint media conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron this evening to put in perspective the July 15 talks between India and Pakistan that were overshadowed by Shah Mehmood Qureshis potshots.        
	 I believe there was agreement on a large number of issues. But the way the press conference was headed at the end of this visit by the Pakistan foreign minister could have been avoided because it detracted from the large number of agreements reached between the foreign ministers of the two countries, Singh said.        
	The comments were the first reaction in public by the Prime Minister to the talks between Indian external affairs minister S.M. Krishna and Qureshi.        
	Singhs measured criticism of Qureshi came shortly after Camerons assertion that Pakistan needed to do more to control the terror groups in its territory.        
	If Singhs intention was to address criticism that the government let Qureshi have his say without being challenged, the Prime Minister also indicated that he stays focused on the initiative launched a year ago in Egypts Sharm-al-Sheikh.        
	Singh said he sincerely hoped that the invitation extended by our foreign minister to Qureshi to visit India later this year will be taken up.        
	With his comments, Singh also seemed to have ended a tug-of-war between the home and foreign ministries. Weeks after his talks with Qureshi, Krishna had said that Union home secretary G.K. Pillais comments on the eve of the Islamabad talks about the ISIs alleged role in 26/11 were ill-timed.         
	The Prime Ministers remarks today are being seen as an indirect pat on the back for Krishna for his handling of the Islamabad news conference. Krishna had refused to be drawn into a slanging match, saying many serious issues remained to be discussed.        
	We believe Pakistan should be as serious in tackling terrorism on its western border (along Afghanistan) as on the eastern borders. I sincerely hope the world community would use its good offices to promote this, Singh said.         
	British Premier Cameron also dwelt on the theme, saying he would take up the need to eliminate terror when he met Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari next week.        
	Cameron showered praise on Singh. I would also like to take this opportunity to praise your wise, essential and thoughtful leadership that you have given to us and myself in the G20 and the great way you are leading this incredible country and this massive democracy, he said.

	Calcutta, Sept. 19: Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and sports marketing company Gameplan have agreed to settle their dispute through arbitration. Justice Sanjib Banerjee of Calcutta High Court had suggested that both parties go in for arbitration as it was purely a commercial dispute.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 19: Even 48 years after the India-China war in the Northeast when Chinese forces overran Arunachal Pradesh before withdrawing unilaterally, the Centre has no intention to make public a report on the military failures of the Indian army and the security establishment.        
	Defence minister A.K. Antony today ruled out making public the inquiry report compiled by a lieutenant general and a brigadier. The government does not propose to make public the Henderson Brooks Inquiry Report on the Sino-Indian conflict of 1962. The report is a top secret document, based on an internal study by the Indian Army, contents of which are not only extremely sensitive but are of current operational value, Antony said in a written reply in Parliament today.        
	Lieutenant General T. Henderson Brooks of the Indian Army with the brigadier, commandant of the Indian Military Academy at that time, were asked to make an operations review of the war.        
	Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister, V.K. Krishna Menon was the defence minister and General V.N. Thapar was the chief of army staff at that time. Mao Tse Tung was in power in China.        
	Military historians and researchers have been seeking the de-classification to analyse what went wrong for India. Former British journalist and author, Neville Maxwell, claimed he had summaries of the report. Some of that content went into his book, Indias China War, in which he said Indias political and military leadership were guilty of persisting with an aggressive border policy that was one of the main reasons for provoking the war.        
	Antony said the Centre had compiled official histories of the 1947 war with Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir, the 1965 war with Pakistan, the 1971 war with Pakistan and the 1999 Kargil conflict. The official history of the 1947 war was made public in 1987.        
	The defence ministrys history division has taken up the compilation /publication of other historical records, starting with the 1965 war.        
	MiG-21 phase-out        
	The government today said it was phasing out the MiG-21 fighter aircraft that make up a bulk of the Indian Air Forces combat fleet.         
	The MiG-21 is a very old aircraft. It is now in the process of being phased out, Antony said in reply to questions in the Lok Sabha today. The normal life of an aircraft is 30-34 years, he added. India began inducting the MiG-21s from Russia in the mid-1960s.         
	The air force currently flies more than 200 MiG-21s. Of these, 121 have been upgraded. The upgraded aircraft are called Bisons and are likely to fly till 2017. The balance will be phased out by 2013.         
	At its peak, the IAF had more than 650 MiG-21s. The aircraft accounts for the maximum number of crashes in the air force. Aamir Khans Rang de Basanti was loosely based on the true story of a MiG-21 pilots mother who went door to door seeking justice after her son was killed in a crash.         
	The MiG-21s might have been phased out earlier had the IAF been able to induct newer aircraft. But the delay in commissioning the Defence Research and Development Organisations light combat aircraft (Tejas) project and tardy imports has meant that the IAF has continued to depend on the MiG-21 for the air defence role.         
	The air force is currently evaluating six medium multi-role combat aircraft from foreign firms. It plans to buy 126 of these aircraft for an estimated $12 billion, making it one of the most lucrative orders for which global aviation majors are competing.

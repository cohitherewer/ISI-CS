  - Dumped JMM faces floor test        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                                   
	Ranchi, May 24: Frustrated with an unpredictable ally like JMM, the BJP today acted on a decision it took about a month ago and withdrew support to the 146-day-old Shibu Soren-led government, reducing it to a minority and plunging Jharkhand into another round of political uncertainty.         
	Around noon, a 45-member delegation led by party state president Raghubar Das and national general secretary Arjun Munda submitted a letter to Governor M..H. Farook, formally withdrawing support. Farook asked them to have the letter signed by all 18 party legislators.         
	Farook, thereafter, summoned Soren at 5.30pm to the Raj Bhavan and asked him to prove his majority in the House within a week, by May 31. Soren was accompanied by his son Hemant and nine party MLAs.        
	The BJP and the JMM both have 18 MLAs each in the 82-member Assembly. Their ally, Sudesh Mahto-led All Jharkhand Students Union (Ajsu) has five members and the Janata Dal (United) two.         
	The JD(U) too acted in consort with the BJP and asked its minister in the government, Sudha Chaudhary, to withdraw support, confirmed party president Jaleshwar Mahto.         
	As of now, no other party has come forward to try and form an alternative government, though back channel discussions were on in the Congress, claimed local party leaders.        
	Its ally, JVM leader Babulal Marandi declared yesterday that he wasnt interested in stepping in now since the process invariably involved horse-trading, something he and his party would not indulge in.        
	Clarifying his stand today while talking to The Telegraph, Marandi said: We are strongly opposed to Presidents rule and fresh elections at this juncture. We are willing to take the initiative only if the new government is led by our party. There will no horse-trading, and blackmailing will not be tolerated.        
	Ajsu chief Mahto held his cards close to his chest. We will clear our stand after a meeting of party MLAs, he said.        
	After meeting the governor, Soren held a meeting with his legislators. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Hemant said he still could not figure why BJP withdrew support. However, we are committed to saving the state from Presidents rule, he added.         
	Maintaining that the party was not afraid of mid-term elections, Hemant said the JMM would work out a formula to save the government within two days. His father has been authorised to take a decision, he added.         
	Twelve out of 18 MLAs attended the meeting. Those who could not make it were Simon Marandi, Nalin Soren, Lobin Hembrom, Sita Soren, Vishnu Bhaiya and Paulus Surin.        
	Significantly, the BJP blamed the Congress for plunging the state into political instability and not Soren. The Congress has been tirelessly trying to destabilise the government, luring several JMM MLAs to Delhi and Calcutta, alleged Das, adding that the BJP would continue to work among the people for the development of the state.         
	The Congress destabilised the BJP-led government in 2006 and installed a government led by Independent MLA Madhu Koda, who is now cooling his heels in jail, he added.         
	Asked why he was sparing Guruji, whose defiance and flip-flops precipitated the crisis a day before the D-Day of May 25, the state BJP president alleged that the Congress move to woo JMM MLAs prompted Soren to issue absurd statements. Soren feared a split in his party, he asserted.         
	Asked if there was a possibility of the allies coming together again, Das said: All possibilities remain open in politics.         
	Munda, who was BJPs chief minister-in-waiting till now, also played along.         
	When asked why the BJP waited so long to dump the JMM, Das replied: The electorate had given us a fractured mandate, which implied that a coalition government was the need of the hour. We wanted to give stability.         
	The state has been facing a political crisis since April 27, when Soren voted against the BJP cut motion in the Lok Sabha. This led the BJP to announce withdrawal of support to the JMM-led government on April 28. Two days later, BJP put its decision on hold when JMM legislature party leader Hemant Soren apologised to BJP chief Nitin Gadkari for the human error and pledged support to a BJP-led government.         
	The episode, however, exposed the split within the BJP and the partys image took a beating after it decided to put on hold its decision to withdraw support to the JMM-led government.         
	After Hemant announced support to a BJP-led government, the party decided to choose a new chief minister. But again, the party appeared divided, with one faction supporting Das for the post and another favouring Munda.         
	Meanwhile, JVM general secretary Praveen Singh said the 11-member party would not support Soren on the floor of the House. We have already requested the governor to dismiss Soren, an MP, for continuing in the chief ministers chair by misusing constitutional provisions. We will not support him during the confidence vote, he added.        
	RJD state president Girinath Singh said his party would not support a government that could be propped up by the Congress.

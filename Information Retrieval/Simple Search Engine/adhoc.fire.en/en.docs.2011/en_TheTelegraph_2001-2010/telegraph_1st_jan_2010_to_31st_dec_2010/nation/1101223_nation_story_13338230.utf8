	New Delhi, Dec. 22: The UPA is considering a proposal to convene a three-day Parliament session before the budget round to discuss if a joint parliamentary committee needs to probe the 2G spectrum allocation scandal.        
	If the Opposition agrees to the proposal, the issue will be debated for three days and the Prime Minister is likely to reply. The final decision on the need for a JPC will be taken after that.        
	Sources said the government has already sounded out Speaker Meira Kumar on a special session. Depending on the response of the Opposition, she will take a decision.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee confirmed that such a plan has been mooted. If they (the Opposition) assure that there will be a debate, I am ready to call a special session of Parliament before the budget session so that this issue (setting up of a JPC) is debated, Mukherjee said at a CNN-IBN award event.        
	He said the Opposition should discuss the issue on the floor of Parliament and not destroy the institution itself.        
	BJP president Nitin Gadkari has said that his party was ready to co-operate with the government in the budget session if a JPC was appointed.        
	The UPA strategy reflects the Congress leaderships preliminary assessment that the tide of public perception on corruption was changing after the steps taken on several fronts and that the BJPs attack on Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs integrity would eventually boomerang.         
	Congress sources said the party was actually happy after the BJP finally called today for the Prime Ministers resignation. The Congress can now accuse the BJP of playing a destabilisation game and hope that the focus will stay firmly on Singh, on whose clean reputation his party is depending to ride out of the season of scandals.        
	A senior Congress minister told The Telegraph: We always said the BJP was playing the destabilising game and they were not interested in punishing the guilty what we are doing. We declared a war on corruption at the plenary. The Prime Minister made an exceptional offer for appearing for questioning (before the public accounts committee). The public perception is changing now. We dont mind the endgame being played on the Prime Ministers personal integrity.         
	Even the partys official line reflected this line of thought. Spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said: Let them ask for the Prime Ministers resignation. We welcome this campaign. This is not for the first time they have done this; the people gave them a political slap in the 2009 general elections and they will get it again. It is ironical that the BJP which created new paradigm, new milestones, new icons and new images on corruption is trying to malign an honourable man.         
	Singhvi reeled off scandals  ranging from Tehelka to illegal petrol pump and land allotments  and asked the BJP to compare NDAs PMO with Manmohans.        
	He targeted the BJPs Achilles heel by saying the champions of inaction on corruption should have held this anti-corruption rally in Bangalore, instead of Delhi, where all ministers, including B.S Yeddyurappa, are facing charges.        
	He said the BJPs paper tigers were fighting the Congresss real leaders who had taken comprehensive action even against those guilty of only misconduct.         
	The Congress leadership was worried after the winter session washout and wondered if the graft blot would stick on the Prime Minister. But the mood has changed after the plenary and majority of leaders admit the feedback they are receiving from all over the country was encouraging.        
	We might not have achieved much in terms of organisational boost at the plenary but Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh managed to tilt the battle of public perception on corruption in our favour, an AICC general secretary said.         
	In a calculated risk, the Congress leadership decided to make corruption the central theme of the plenary. Although the party had decided not to touch upon corruption at the AICC meeting in November, Sonia devoted seven paragraphs to the topic at the plenary. No Congress president had spent so much time on this issue before.         
	There were murmurs in Congress circles about the sagacity of Prime Ministers offer to appear before the PAC as the Congress had built its argument against this possibility.        
	 Even Sonia Gandhi had said the party did not agree to the JPC because it could have been used to denigrate the office of the Prime Minister. But Congress leaders today explained the Prime Minister walked the extra mile under extraordinary circumstances as he was worried about the deadlock and wanted to ensure that it did not become a precedent in Parliament.         
	Asked about the allies silence on the Congress anti-corruption charter at the plenary at a time when the NDA had demonstrated its strength, Singhvi said: It for the allies to respond.

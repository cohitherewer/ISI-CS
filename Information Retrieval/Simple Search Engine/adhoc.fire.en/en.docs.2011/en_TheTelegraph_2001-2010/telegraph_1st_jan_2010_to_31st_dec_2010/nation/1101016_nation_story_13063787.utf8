          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                            
	Raghopur, Oct. 15: Lalu Prasad yawned on stage. Ram Vilas Paswan gathered furrows on his forehead. Rabri Devi ducked away to send for bananas and mineral water for the days hard ride and young Tejaswi begged off his launch pad saying he was an underage trainee at the game and the approaching cricket season beckoned him.         
	Such was the debut of the challenge to chief minister Nitish Kumar in a little school-ground north across the Ganga from Patna this morning.         
	It left very few astride the rickety podium inspired on the prospects of the dare they were collectively mounting, Lalu Prasad least of all.        
	The trigger to his desultory demeanour was not far to seek. There were very few off that podium to inspire, the tiny dustbowl of a school-yard barely even sprinkled with attendance. Hed lost interest  and his famed humour  within a trice of arriving; he asked for a hand-towel and moped with it for length of the listless proceedings.        
	This morning Lalu Prasad hadnt even the luxury of rebuking the local candidate for subjecting him to such a poor show; that person happened to be his wife.        
	The first few minutes of his turn at the lecturn, Lalu Prasad spent taking it out on the chaps managing the sound system: Clear karoji, clear karo, he scolded them, his voice booming out quite clear. Sound nahin hai, sound nahin hai, time bhi nahin hai, burbak aadmi sab (Theres no sound, no sound, and theres no time, you fools).         
	The sound system was just right, but little else was; the sound boys suffered collateral damage soundlessly.        
	Kahan hai log ji (Where are the people)? Lalu Prasad reproachfully asked a local partyman shortly after stepping off his chopper. Puja hai sir, Maha Ashtami, the partyman stuttered, pandal mein hai. (This is puja day  Maha Ashtami  they are in the pandals.)         
	Bak! Lalu retorted with a dismissive swing of his arm and carried on, Puja hai! Aur election nahin hai ka? (Its puja, but isnt there an election too?)         
	Saying that, he turned surly as he has seldom appeared on dais, and remained that way till it was time to depart, swatting sweat and dust with that same placebo hand-towel of his.        
	He had come expecting better for this was to be no ordinary platform. This was Raghopur, about 20km from Patna, Rabri Devis seat, no less. And here was a line-up as high of voltage as he can manage in these elections: his chief ally in Paswan, the former chief minister in Rabri, the would-be chief minister in himself and the future beyond the verdict of this battle in Tejaswi, the anointed successor, gawky in khadi and nervy of tongue. Here they were unveiling themselves together for the first time, all dressed up with no one to watch.         
	Or too few.         
	Lahar hai, lahar hai samoocha Bihar mein hamara lahar hai (Theres a wave for us, theres a wave all across Bihar), Rabri Devi monotoned like a wound-up toy that has lost lure and lustre. There werent enough people abutting the stage to even create a ripple.        
	There was a time Lalu Prasads stage remained forever imperilled by the surge of the faithful. They would close in, tide upon tide, breaking through barriers and trampling over cordons to get a closer look  to catch his eye, to earn a wave, to somehow get a touch or a word in.         
	Lalu Prasad would often shoo securitymen aside, dismantle the bandobast and churn up proceedings like only he could, crowd-pleaser par excellence. He would crack a joke and send the audience in raptures. He would issue a command and they would roar in compliance. He would wave and it would be a signal for a thousand hands to flutter about in response.         
	Today, there was no crowd to please. No tide to tidy, no disorder to order, no one breaking the barricades to reach out., he cried out, struggling to get his usual pitch, There is a grand conspiracy against me, they have all ganged up to finally finish the rule of the masses, the poor. I am here to return your government to you, give me a chance, else you may lose it forever.         
	He may only have been talking about himself. This is the third successive election that the madding crowd he once held in thrall Pied Piper-like has not returned his call.         
	And if he began it yawning this morning, there perhaps lies something dire in its empty echo.

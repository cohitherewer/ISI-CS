	New Delhi, Oct. 14: Those who cant decide if the Games were a success or not need not look further than Delhi: a tussle has broken out to claim credit for what was once a hot potato.        
	Delhi lieutenant-governor Tejinder Khanna has written to the Prime Minister, saying chief minister Sheila Dikshit was taking all the credit for cleaning up the Games Village.        
	Dikshit, who had been directed to take over the maintenance, dismissed Khannas allegation. She said the euphoria she saw in people was enough and it didnt matter if any cynic said anything.        
	The rush to claim credit is in sharp contrast with the hot potato syndrome that was in evidence in the run-up to the Games when allegations of corruption and other controversies used to sprout almost daily.        
	 However, the turn in the tide since the inauguration seems to have sired many guardians.        
	The task of maintenance and housekeeping had earlier been assigned to the Delhi Development Authority, which is under the ministry of urban development. The lieutenant governor is the DDAs controlling authority.        
	In the October 7 letter, copies of which have been sent to the home ministry and the urban development ministry, Khanna said statements by Dikshit that the turnaround was achieved by a single agency was incorrect.        
	Dikshit, however, stuck to her stand.         
	She said when the Village was handed over to her, it was in a frightening condition and what her team had achieved was remarkable.        
	But the chief minister added that she didnt want to take all the credit as it was teamwork that made the turnaround possible.

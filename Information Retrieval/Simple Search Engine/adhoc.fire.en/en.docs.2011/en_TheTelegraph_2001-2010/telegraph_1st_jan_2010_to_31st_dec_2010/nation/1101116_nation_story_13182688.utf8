          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      TS Darbari after his arrest (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 15: The CBI today arrested two former officials of the Suresh Kalmadi-headed Commonwealth Games organising committee on corruption charges, and filed two cases implicating the entire committee in conspiracy, fraud and graft.        
	The agency also searched the committee headquarters and the homes of the two arrested men, T.S. Darbari and Sanjay Mahendroo, and claimed to have seized incriminating documents.        
	The two FIRs registered today specifically named three committee officials  Darbari (joint director-general), Mahendroo (deputy director-general) and Raj Singh (director)  but mentioned all of Organising Committee as accused. This would include Kalmadi, whom the Congress recently removed from his party post.        
	Both the FIRs relate to alleged corruption in organising the October 2009 Queens Baton Relay in London. CBI sources said they hoped to question Kalmadi after his return from China, where he is watching the Asian Games.        
	Organising committee sources said Kalmadi had handpicked Darbari and Mahendroo, and that they wielded enormous power in the committee. Kalmadi, however, was first forced to suspend them and later to sack them a month before the Games following media reports of baton relay-related corruption.        
	Government sources alleged it was Darbari who had plotted the forgery of an email, sent by an Indian mission official in London, to try and shift the blame for the relay irregularities.         
	A CBI spokesperson said the first FIR alleged that committee officials, in conspiracy with the London-based firm (AM Car amp; Van Hire) and its director (Ashish Patel), awarded work to AM at exorbitant rates without following the standard tender process.        
	 The work was awarded on the false premise that the firm was on the panel of the Indian high commission, London, the spokesperson said.         
	The second FIR accuses committee officials and Patel and his firm AM Films, which dealt in audio-visual equipment. The spokesperson said the officials, in conspiracy with Patel, awarded the work of installation of video screens at the venue... at exorbitant rates... purportedly on the basis of fake quotations.        
	Darbari and Mahendroo have already been questioned by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with a foreign exchange case, registered after UK authorities cited the transfer of a huge sum by the organising committee to AM Films.

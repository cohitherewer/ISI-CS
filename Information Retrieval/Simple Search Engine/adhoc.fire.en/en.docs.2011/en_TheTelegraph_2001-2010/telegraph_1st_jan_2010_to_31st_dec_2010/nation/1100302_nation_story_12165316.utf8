The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RSS cloud on minority drive

          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, March 1: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwats assertion that every Indian is a Hindu may upset Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhans plans to court Muslims in the BJP-ruled state.        
	At a gathering of Hindus in Bhopal yesterday, Bhagwat had said: He who is an Indian is a Hindu and he who is not a Hindu is not an Indian.        
	The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief had also said Christianity and Islam were alien faiths in the sense that they originated outside India.         
	Jesus Christ was a revered figure and so was Prophet Mohammad, but India could not be united in their names, Bhagwat told the 50,000-plus gathering at the Hindu samagam (congregation) in the Madhya Pradesh capital.        
	The Sangh boss, however, qualified his Hindu India remark by saying: For us, the word Hindu does not mean any religion but a way of life.        
	A galaxy of BJP leaders, including state home minister Uma Shankar Gupta, were present at the meet, wearing khaki half pants and white shirt, the traditional attire for an RSS drill. They carried a lathi, too.         
	Without naming any religion, Bhagwat went on to say: They talk of peace and service but force their deities down the throats of others.         
	Bhagwat then said Hinduism was the only religion that respected diversity, while other religions preach that only we will go to heaven while the rest will end up in hell.        
	They also say unity is impossible without uniformity, and thrust their ideology on the rest, Bhagwat added.        
	Targeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Bhagwat said: How can someone of the level of the Prime Minister say, in violation of the Constitution, that they (minorities) have the first claim over resources?        
	It was an allusion to Singhs statement sometime back that minorities had the first right to resources, but then Singhs comment had come in the context of the widespread socio-economic backwardness among minorities.        
	The RSS chief also wondered why Singh was ignoring the plight of the displaced Kashmiri Pandits while offering pardon to separatists and militants who, Bhagwat said, were killing innocent Muslims in the Valley.        
	The criticism was aimed at the recent amnesty scheme for youths who had crossed over to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.        
	Peace talks (with Pakistan) only helped extremists to regroup, Bhagwat added. I dont know if its nasha (intoxication) or vote ki asha (hope for votes). Baki sab ke liye ek nyay aur Hinduon ke liye anyay (theres injustice for Hindus but a separate yardstick of justice for the rest), Bhagwat said.        
	Minutes after Bhagwats speech, BJP leaders were heard discussing its implications. Some ministers, who didnt want to be named, wondered whether it would affect Chauhans sustained bid to woo the minorities.        
	In the Lok Sabha polls last year, the BJPs 29 candidates from Madhya Pradesh got about 30 per cent Muslim votes  almost 10 times that of the national figure of 3.7 per cent Muslim votes the party got.        
	In the recent civic polls, as many as 82 Muslim councillors won on the BJP symbol.        
	Some leaders feel Muslim support for the BJP has more to do with the chief minister than the party. Chauhan has been consistent in saying that he does not believe in Moditva  a dig at fellow BJP chief minister Narendra Modi  or a strong anti-minority posture.        
	I believe in carrying all sections of society for the greater good of society, Chauhan had said at a minority meet, pointing out that most of his successful schemes  like funding marriages  were inclusive in nature.        
	A substantial number of the 1,00,000-odd newly-weds who have benefited from the Kanyadan project are Muslims.

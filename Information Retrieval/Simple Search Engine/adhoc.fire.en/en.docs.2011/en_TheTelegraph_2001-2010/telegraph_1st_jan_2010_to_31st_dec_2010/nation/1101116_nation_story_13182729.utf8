The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Floodwater theory in Delhi building collapse
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Floodwater theory in Delhi building collapse

	New Delhi, Nov. 15: A four-storey building, probably weakened by accumulated floodwater from the nearby Yamuna, collapsed in east Delhi tonight, killing many people.        
	As many as 19 people were confirmed dead late tonight. Unofficial estimates put the toll at 32. Many residents of the building in Lalita Park of Laxmi Nagar, a congested locality teeming with people who take care of the capitals chores, are said to be labourers from Bengal, Bihar and Assam.        
	Police said 50 people were still feared trapped till close to midnight in the debris of the structure which collapsed around 8pm. Sixty people were pulled out and rushed to hospitals.        
	A senior Delhi police officer said the rescue would be completed only by Tuesday morning. Over 100 families stayed in the building. The cave-in occurred when most of the residents were inside their flats.        
	Preliminary investigations appeared to point to poor upkeep for the tragedy, which Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit dubbed unprecedented and blamed on negligence. Some blamed the age of the building and put it at 15 years.        
	But an official said his information was that it was only seven years old and was built illegally. The buildings owner, a cement trader, could not be contacted.        
	 The scale of the tragedy is unprecedented. I dont think such a tragedy has taken place in Delhi in the recent past, Dikhit said. A magisterial probe has been ordered.        
	Police officers said an adjoining building also faced the risk of collapse and people there had been evacuated.         
	The area was flooded in September when the Yamuna overflowed after unusually heavy rain in northern India. The ground floor of the collapsed building was under water, a source said, suggesting that the moisture could have weakened the structure.        
	Delhi finance minister A.K. Walia said the foundation of the building could have been weakened by the flood. Residents complained that water had accumulated in the basement and had had not been drained out for months.        
	Dikshit also pointed to the accumulated water and said the investigation would try to find out why it had not been removed for over two months.        
	Some residents claimed, however, that an extra floor was being added to the building but it was not clear whether the construction was authorised. Such a large building just went down in minutes, an eyewitness said. Dikshit said this allegation would also be probed, too, and appropriate action taken if wrongdoing was found.        
	A fire brigade official said: The building was structurally weak. It was not being maintained well.        
	Officials of the fire brigade, police and Municipal Corporation of Delhi are engaged in the rescue and removal of debris with the help of residents, but congestion in the narrow bylanes was hitting the efforts.        
	The injured have been admitted to Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital and Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital, said Delhi health minister Kiran Walia.        
	R.A. Gautam, medical superintendent of Shastri hospital, said four of the injured to his hospital were in a critical condition.        
	Eyewitnesses said they heard shouts for help from under the debris. Some residents complained that power cut and absence of cranes hampered the rescue efforts. Dikshit said the cranes took time to reach there because of the narrow bylanes.        
	Two of the buildings floors housed the offices of a cloth exporting firm and a snacks distributor.        
	Announcements were made asking people to be careful as there were gas cylinders in the debris. A 250-member disaster management team was deployed to help in the rescue operations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihar BJP leaders flay Gadkari team
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bihar BJP leaders flay Gadkari team
          NALIN VERMA                          Shahnawaz Hussein and Shatrughan Sinha have shown resentment against Nitin Gadkari                                  
	Patna, March 21: Mere months before the state goes to Assembly polls, resentment against BJP president Nitin Gadkari is rising fast among party members, especially after some senior leaders from the region were ignored in the national executive.        
	The leaders have also started pouring venom against the high command. Former Union civil aviation minister Shahnawaz Hussein did not attend a meeting called by the newly appointed BJP chief spokesman Ravishankar Prasad on Friday and got admitted to a Delhi hospital yesterday complaining of chest pain.        
	I will go to Mecca and Medina to know my gunah (mistake) and pray that Allah punishes me for the same, the Bhagalpur MP said, sulking for being demoted as a junior spokesman under Prasad.        
	Our leader is more pained by the treatment from Gadkari than the chest pain, said an aide of Hussein.        
	Probably, God appears to have heard Shahnawazs prayers, as Gadkari called him telling: You should speak to me if you have complaints and not to the media. I will try to address your issues if you keep yourself confined to party forum.        
	Apparently, sensing resentment among the election-bound Bihar leaders, Gadkari has revised his list of office-bearers. Yesterday, he included two more sulking leaders  state party chief Radhamohan Singh and state health minister Nandkishore Yadav  in the list of the special invitees to the national executive.        
	But Gadkaris damage-control exercise seems futile, as many senior leaders, including Shatrughan Sinha, C.P. Thakur and Yahswant Sinha, are feeling ignored.        
	Many of these disgruntled leaders are openly speaking to the media for ignoring the meritorious party workers from Bihar by Gadkari whom they alleged even biased towards Maharashtra.        
	Thakur, before leaving for Geneva to attend a convention of the World Health Organisation, said: Senior leaders from Bihar have been ignored. There is a dominance of Marathis in Gadkaris team. Thakur, who represented the Patna Lok Sabha seat thrice and is currently Rajya Sabha MP, went on saying: My contribution to the party is no less than anyone in the BJP.        
	Shatrughan, who represents Patna Saheb in the Lok Sabha and billed to be the star campaigner in the coming Assembly elections, said: Leaders like Thakur, Udai Singh and Yashwant have been ignored. I have apprised the Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj about how Gadkari has made mistakes in making his team.        
	The disgruntled leaders said around 15 leaders from Bihar had found places in Gadkaris team against over 40 from Maharashtra. Gadkari is yet to select the Bihar BJP president to replace Singh, who had completed his tenure.        
	All these senior leaders, including Hussein, Thakur and Shatrughan, are apparently opposed to the elevation of a relatively junior leader, Prasad, as the partys general secretary and chief spokesman at their cost. Experience and merit have not been taken into consideration, while forming the team. The winners and mass leaders have been ignored while those who have not won a single election have been promoted, said Shatrughan.

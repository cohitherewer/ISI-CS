	Mumbai, Sept. 22 (PTI): A serving major has moved Bombay High Court seeking a directive to the army to allow him to marry an Indian-origin US citizen or grant him voluntary retirement without pay-related benefits.        
	Major Yogesh Chandra Madhav Sayankar has alleged that the army brass are dragging their feet on the clearance.        
	According to rules in the armed forces, a serving officer requires permission from the authorities if he or she wishes to marry a citizen of another country.        
	Sayankars lawyer Anand Grover told the high court that the major had written to the authorities four times to allow him marry Shruti Kulkarni but each time, his applications were returned with a request that he should attach documents.        
	Shruti works for an advertising agency in the US.        
	Sayankar, who is getting ready to marry Shruti on December 10, said the wedding date had been fixed and that he had no other option but to approach the court as the army had not responded.        
	However, the armys lawyer opposed Sayankars plea, saying the major should approach the Armed Forces Tribunal if he had any grievance.        
	The forces counsel also argued that the high court did not have the jurisdiction to redress a serving officers complaints.         
	Chief Justice Mohit Shah and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud have asked the army to file a reply by October 19.

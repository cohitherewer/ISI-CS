          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Oct. 25: Congress leaders in Andhra Pradesh have warned party ministers from Telangana against hoisting the national flag on November 1, the 54th anniversary of the states formation day, scared that it might antagonise those seeking a separate state.        
	Party leaders from the region have also denounced all celebrations in the run-up to the day, clearly jittery that the Telangana wings of all Opposition parties, including the Telugu Desam, were planning to boycott events related to the anniversary.        
	It is the Congress party which is giving Telangana but the credit is being claimed by all others, including the TDP which had campaigned to delay and subvert the cause of a separate Telangana, said Congress Working Committee member K. Keshava Rao.        
	Kamalakar Rao, the official spokesperson for Andhras ruling Congress, has appealed to all 15 ministers from the Telangana region to abstain from hoisting the Tricolour on November 1.        
	If you fail to do so, the people of Telangana will teach you a lesson, he warned the state ministers.        
	Except for three ministers, none of the others has condemned the PCC leaders statement.        
	Pro-Telangana agitators have already upped the ante, blocking political tours and conventions of non-Telangana leaders and ministers in the region. Last week, three non-Telangana ministers were told to stay off the region.        
	Desam boss Chandrababu Naidu, too, was stopped from visiting Mahbubnagar, one of the 10 Telangana districts. The former chief minister had to return without addressing any meetings as a blockade greeted his entourage on the districts outskirts.        
	Aware that pro-Telangana activists might organise protests in state capital Hyderabad, the government has decided to enforce from next week Section 144 around the secretariat, the Assembly and other important government buildings as a precaution. Hyderabad is one of the Telangana districts.        
	This morning, chief minister K. Rosaiah discussed security initiatives with the state police chief and the city police commissioner following an attempt by students to blockade the secretariat on Saturday.        
	The Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS), a key player in the movement for a separate state, has threatened to demolish statues of non-Telangana leaders in Hyderabads Tank Bund if the statue of Telangana tribal leader Komaram Bheem is not installed immediately.        
	Tank Bund, on one side of Hussain Sagar Lake, hosts about 35 statues of state icons.         
	TRS leader K.T. Rama Rao said if Hyderabad could not host statues of Telangana leaders, statues of other leaders shouldnt be there, too.        
	The BJP said it was waiting for municipal clearance to install a statue of the tribal leader who had fought for the liberation of Hyderabad state.        
	We have a ready statue, said Vidyasagar Rao, a former National Democratic Alliance minister.        
	Telangana leaders of the Congress, which had put up statues of former chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy after his untimely death in an air crash, are now suddenly opposing the installation of any more YSR statues in the region. YSR, after all, was against a separate Telangana.

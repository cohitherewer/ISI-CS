The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amar tastes revenge in heartland bypoll

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Amar Singh                          
	New Delhi, June 8: Amar Singh finally drew blood from his former political patron Mulayam Singh Yadav after ensuring that the Samajwadi chiefs candidate was pushed down to fourth place in an Uttar Pradesh bypoll.        
	Amar had two reasons to celebrate: Sachidanand, the Peace Party nominee who he tacitly supported, came third, ahead of the Samajwadis. The Samajwadi candidate polled poorly with Muslims despite being one himself.        
	The Dumariyaganj bypoll, held last week, had become nearly as significant as a Lok Sabha election with each party, barring the BJP and the ruling BSP, pulling out all stops to win. Despite their low-key campaigns that drew largely on local leaders, the BJP came second. The BSP retained the seat, which had fallen vacant after the death of party MLA Toufiq Ahmad. His wife Begum Khatoon was fielded this time.        
	The Samajwadi had pitched its top leaders, including Mulayams son and MP Akhilesh Yadav, during the campaign for the seat in the eastern Uttar Pradesh town. The Congress, too, had huge stakes in the contest because its MP Jagdambika Pal represents the Dumariyaganj Lok Sabha constituency.        
	Pal and the Congress general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, Digvijay Singh, co-ordinated the campaign that saw MPs Raj Babbar and Mohammad Azharuddin alongside actors Nagma and Ravi Kishen step up the political-cum-glamour quotient.        
	Despite their colourful presence, the Congress, which had polled 43,863 votes in the 2009 Lok Sabha election from this Assembly segment, was down to 19,206 votes. The BSPs tally, by contrast, went up from 33,797 to 44,765. Amars candidate polled 26,336 votes.        
	Amar celebrated his success in his blog. Mera sundar sapna toot gaya (My sweet dreams have broken), the expelled Samajwadi leader wrote in his latest post in an apparent dig at Mulayam.        
	Amar described the byelection as a dress rehearsal for the Assembly poll, due in 2012. He claimed that if the votes of the Samajwadis and the Peace Party were pooled, the BSP would have been defeated. If those of the Peace Party and the Congress were combined, the BSP would have faced a tough challenge, he said.        
	Dumariyaganj has nearly 30 per cent Muslim voters. If they vote en bloc for a party, its candidate sails through, as MP Pal did last year. If they split, the BJP might have an advantage, although it did not happen this time.        
	In a warning to the secular parties, Amar wrote: In Uttar Pradesh, a moribund BJP will get life if the non-BJP forces do not get their act together. Indeed, if there is no alternative, it will be advantage BSP and then BJP.

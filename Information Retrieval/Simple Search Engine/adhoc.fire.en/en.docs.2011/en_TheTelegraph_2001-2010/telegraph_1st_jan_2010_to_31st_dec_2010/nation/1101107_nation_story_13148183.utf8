	Mumbai, Nov. 6: Barack Obama has something to show for his three-day visit to India, his longest to any country since assuming presidency two years ago: 20 deals worth $10 billion that will create over 53,000 jobs in America.        
	The deal size may be small but for a President coming off a major election setback in the US where unemployment is hovering at 9.6 per cent, the creation of jobs is a little salve for a bruised economy and battered egos.        
	But lets put that job creation number in perspective: in October, the American economy created 151,000 jobs. By that token, the promise of creating 53,670 jobs on the first day of his 10-day waltz through Asia isnt going to be seen as too modest an achievement. He goes next to Delhi before travelling to Indonesia, South Korea and Japan.        
	The deals were largely confined to the aviation, power and other infrastructure sectors.        
	The biggest deal was a preliminary agreement worth $4.1 billion between Boeing and the Indian Air Force for the purchase of 10 C-17s, a military transport aircraft. This deal alone will support over 22,000 jobs in the US.        
	Boeing also struck a $2.7 billion deal with SpiceJet  the low cost carrier in which SUN TV founder Kalanidhi Maran acquired a controlling interest recently  for the sale of 30 Boeing 737 aircraft.        
	This is a win-win situation for both companies: the deal is expected to support over 12,900 jobs at Boeing. SpiceJet, which reported a Rs 10-crore profit in the second quarter ended September 30, hopes to expand operations in India and start international flights.        
	Reliance Power Ltd, the flagship company of the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group, signed a $2.2 billion deal with General Electric for supply of gas turbines for the 2500MW Samalkot power project in Andhra Pradesh.        
	According to Reliance Power, the deal will create nearly 5,000 jobs in the states of South Carolina, New York and Milwaukee.        
	Reliance Power and the Export-Import Bank of the United States also announced a memorandum of understanding. This MoU will indicate Ex-Im Banks willingness to provide up to $5 billion in financial support to Reliance Power for the purchase of US goods and services to be used in the development of up to 8,000MW of gas-fired electricity generating units and up to 900MW of renewable (solar and wind) energy facilities.        
	Addressing a galaxy of corporate CEOs from India and the US at the US-India Business and Entrepreneurship Summit organised by the US-India Business Council, CII and Ficci, Obama said several of these deals had been agreed on before his arrival.        
	Several landmark deals have been done shortly before my arrival here. Boeing is going to sell dozens of planes to India and GE is going to sell hundreds of electric engines. The deals are worth $10 billion and will create more than 50,000 jobs in the US, he said.        
	Separately, the ministry of railways also announced the pre-qualification of two US firms  GE Transportation and Electro-Motive Diesel  for a venture to manufacture and supply of 1,000 diesel locomotives over 10 years.        
	Obama told the gathering there was no reason why India could not become Americas top trading partner; it currently ranks at a lowly 12th, lower than the Netherlands that has a population the size of Mumbai.        
	I have no doubt that we can do much better, he added.  
	THE KEY DEALS  
	 Boeing sale of 10 C-17s  to IAF: $4.1 billion

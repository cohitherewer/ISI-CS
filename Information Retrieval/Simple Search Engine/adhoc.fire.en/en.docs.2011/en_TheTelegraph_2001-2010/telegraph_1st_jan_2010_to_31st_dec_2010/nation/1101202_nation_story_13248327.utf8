  - Three Punjab villages tremble as army begins detonating live munitions going back to the 1991 war; children shifted to schools in safer places, villagers told to leave home during day          GAJINDER SINGH                          Children board a Punjab police bus which will ferry them to a school away from the three villages. Picture by DPR, ministry of defence                                        
	Mattewara reserve forest (Ludhiana), Dec. 1: Gurmeet Kaur, a Class VI student, has to wake up really early to catch the Punjab police bus that ferries her to school. Till a month ago, she would have taken her time to get ready, eaten breakfast leisurely and walked a couple of minutes to reach her classroom.        
	But that was before the army landed in Kalewal village with four huge containers of lethal war scrap that needs to be destroyed immediately. Left unattended, the unexploded rockets, bombs, mortars, grenades, shells and other projectiles going back to the 1991 Gulf war could wreak havoc.        
	Ive never heard any explosion since weve been shifted to another school a safe distance from the destruction site, Gurmeet chatted, as her mother told her to hurry up so she didnt miss the bus.        
	But we do hear stories about the loud bangs and how the earth shakes when bombs are bundled together and blasted in deep pits. But its ok. We dont mind going to another school if that keeps us safe.        
	While the children of Shekonwal, Kalewal and Haider Nagar villages, on the outskirts of Mattewara reserve forest, are ferried to school every morning, over 700 residents are told to evacuate their homes by 7.30am and put up at a couple of gurdwaras some 5km away.        
	They are allowed back into their villages, which fall within the danger zone of the scrap detonation exercise codenamed Operation Saiyam, only after the days operations end around 5pm.        
	It is a hard existence for us. We thought the Sutlej flooding in August was a nightmare. Now, it is hard to even sleep at night as we fear there is a huge amount of munition in our backyard that can blow us to smithereens. We are living on the edge, lamented Kulwinder Kaur, also of Kalewal village.        
	The children dont understand how dangerous it is living here. But in a sense it is good they dont know much about it, the mother of four said.        
	The armys 202 Bomb Disposal Company, led by Lt Colonel Vinod Bhatt, is heading the operation. Steel and metal-rolling companies in Punjab imported the scrap between 1999 and 2004 for melting and recycling into other products but refused to take possession when they found live munition within it.        
	Our jawans are working very hard to destroy the arsenal. They are taking great risks, and it shows on the faces of those who get out of their bomb suits. The suits are worthless if a shell explodes within four feet of their bodies, Bhatt said.        
	Of the 17,000 pieces of scrap found at the dry port at Dhandari Kalan near Ludhiana, the army has destroyed around 1800 pieces so far.        
	We just cannot bundle them together and ignite them. Some rockets and shells can create an immense amount of destruction and have to be destroyed properly so they dont misfire and land in the villages, Bhat said.        
	A peek inside the scrap containers revealed that the heavier and the more dangerous pieces, such as multi-barrel rocket launchers with shells inside them, were stacked very close to each other on sandbags at the rear. With tonnes of smaller munitions in front, the disposal squad has yet to access them.        
	We have to first be able to access them to take them out. We hope to destroy them by the middle of December, so we can allow the villagers to stay home while we destroy the smaller projectiles, an officer said.        
	The unit has so far conducted 60 detonations. The scrap is assembled in a firing pit that is about 10 feet deep and detonated from an underground bunker about 300 metres away.        
	The armys 201 Bomb Disposal Company, which is based in New Delhi, has arrived for training. There are some containers of war scrap in the capital that have to be destroyed.        
	The army is liaising with the civil administration to ensure the evacuated villagers do not face hardships. They are provided meals and milk and fodder for the cattle. Some are even taken for medical checks.        
	Getting the villagers to leave their homes was difficult but they have understood the danger. The area is patrolled by police when they are away, Ludhiana deputy commissioner Rahul Tiwari said.        
	A senior officer, Lt Col Ashish Katoch, is doing the liaison work between the army and the civil administration. This is the biggest operation of its kind in the country. Every small detail not only has to be worked out but carried out with to precision, he said.

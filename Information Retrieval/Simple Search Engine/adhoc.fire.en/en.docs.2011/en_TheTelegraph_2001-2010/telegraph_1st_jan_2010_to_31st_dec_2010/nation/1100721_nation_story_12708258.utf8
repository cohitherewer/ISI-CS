          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Purulia, July 20: Suspected Maoists shot dead a father-and-son duo in a Purulia village last night, accusing them of being police informers.        
	Hrishikesh Kumar, 55, was a CPM local committee member. His 32-year-old son, Kashinath, was also a member of the CPM. This is possibly the first time that a father and son have been killed in the same attack.        
	Firing in the air, a group of some 45 men and women entered Sindurpur village, in Purulias Arsa area, around 9.30 last night. They then barged into Hrishikeshs home, thrashed him and Kashinath and demanded to know the names of the policemen they had passed information to.        
	While some of the group members looted money, provisions and livestock from the house, others dragged the two men away to a spot on the outskirts of the village, about 300km from Calcutta. After a few minutes, four gunshots rang out, the sources said.        
	Soon after, Hrishikeshs younger son Soumen, 32, informed the police. The bodies were found on the road, about 300 metres from the house.         
	District police chief Rajesh Yadav said: It is the handiwork of Maoists.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Missing minister link puzzles tax police

	Mumbai, April 20: The income-tax department is running around in circles over the lost documents pertaining to the crucial Videocon and Adani bids in this years IPL team auction.        
	Tax sources fear the papers have either been removed or destroyed prior to the raids last Thursday on the IPL office in Mumbais Wankhede Stadium and also on premises used by Lalit Modi, who runs the cash-rich tournament.        
	The IPL and BCCI have got us into a loop. They say they have a policy of returning all failed and cancelled bid documents to original bidders. When we ask the bidders, they say the papers have not reached them  it is a bizarre situation, said a livid senior income-tax official in Mumbai.        
	The Telegraph had reported in its Sundays edition that the vital documents, which purportedly link two powerful Union cabinet ministers from Maharashtra with the bids, had gone missing.         
	Tax department sources believe the papers had been taken out of Modis suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in Parel, which he used as an office. CCTV footage had shown a young girl  later identified as Laila Mallya, in charge of IPLs public relation services  spiriting away documents from the suite minutes before the tax team visited the hotel.         
	Laila, part of Modis core staff group, is the stepdaughter of UB group chief and IPL franchise owner Vijay Mallya, who has backed the beleaguered cricket administrator.        
	Tax sources said the failed bid documents would have exposed the high level of involvement of the ministers.        
	Revenue sources, investigating alleged links of several people with the bidding process, said they had tapes of conversations related to some of the deals that may have been hatched, but refused to divulge details.         
	Eight income-tax investigation wings spread across the country will coordinate the probe into the source of IPL funds and bidding.        
	The speculation surrounding the failed bids prompted at least two Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders to deny any involvement with the IPL.        
	Whispers had been rife that Pawars son-in-law Sadanand Sule had a stake in the Videocon bid. NCP MP Supriya Sule, Pawars daughter and the husband of Sadanand, said neither her family nor her husband had any association with the IPL bidding process.         
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel, also a senior NCP leader from Maharashtra, similarly rejected suggestions that he or his relatives had any stake in any consortium.        
	The BCCI has decided to send Modi and his close aide Sundar Raman, the IPL chief executive, to answer the income-tax summons on April 23.        
	Modi returned today from Dubai where he had gone for an ICC meeting. Sources said the IPL chief met the Kochi franchise chairman, Harshad Mehta, in Dubai.        
	BCCI sources pointed out that Modi has a lot of aces up his sleeve, which can cause inconvenience to powerful people in and outside the IPL.        
	He will bargain for a plum ICC post and follow his mentor Sharad Pawar to the ICC, said a top BCCI source.

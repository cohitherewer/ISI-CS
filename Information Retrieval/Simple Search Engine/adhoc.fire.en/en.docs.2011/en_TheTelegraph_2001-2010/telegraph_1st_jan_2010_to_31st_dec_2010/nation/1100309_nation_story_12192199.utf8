	Bhubaneswar, March 8: Governor M.C. Bhandare voiced his concern over the growing Maoist menace, while delivering his customary address in the Assembly today.        
	Left-wing extremism is one of the greatest problems the country is facing today. Last year, 32 security personnel and 28 civilians were killed in 266 reported incidents in the state, said Bhandare.        
	Stating that sustained efforts were being made by the state government to counter Left-wing extremist activities and its spread, the governor said anti-extremist operations had resulted in the arrest of 182 Maoists, neutralisation of 11 and surrender of eight rebels last year.        
	Attempts by the Maoists to replicate a Lalgarh type campaign in Narayanpatna of Koraput district had been dealt with firmly and the growing menace of Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangha, a frontal organisation of Maoists, in Narayanpatna and adjoining areas had been effectively restrained, he said.        
	The government has also focused on capacity build-up by raising Special Operations Group (SOG), special intelligence wing, four special security battalions, five India reserve battalions and Orissa Special Security Force to counter the Naxalite, said Bhandare.        
	More SOG units had been deployed in a more focused way in the core operational areas of Maoists, he said.        
	Besides, the government has embarked upon massive infrastructure upgrade by construction/fortification of police stations/marine police stations/outposts and armouries.        
	In the past few years, Maoists had attacked several police stations in Koraput, Gajapati and Nayagarh districts and looted arms from armouries.        
	With the upgrade of training infrastructure and other initiatives, operational efficacy of the police had now been taking shape well and sustained efforts had brought improvement in the situation in districts like Sambalpur, Sundergarh, Mayurbhanj, Jajpur and Keonjhar, said Bhandare.

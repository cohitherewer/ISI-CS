The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shivaji guru statue standoff
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shivaji guru statue standoff
  - Sena-MNS alignment over midnight removal          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                                     
	Mumbai/Pune, Dec. 27: Elected representatives smashed glass panes, overturned tables and fought each other as protests over the removal of a statue of a 16th-century swordsman widely considered to be Shivajis tutor erupted into a free-for-all at Punes civic headquarters today.        
	The conflict also led to an alignment of the Shiv Sena-BJP and the breakaway MNS inside and outside the Pune Municipal Corporation.        
	The Sena has called a bandh in Pune district tomorrow. The MNS later declared its support for the Sena-BJP sponsored strike.        
	The trouble started after the corporations anti-encroachment department and police removed the statue of Dadoji Kondadev from Lal Mahal around 2 in the night and temporarily shifted it to a club where it was kept under heavy police security.        
	As news of the late-night shift spread, Sena, BJP and MNS councillors marched from Lal Mahal to the headquarters of the Congress-NCP-ruled Pune corporation where a general body meeting was scheduled.         
	Anticipating protests, Congress mayor Mohansingh Rajpal adjourned the meeting as soon as it began. Upset at this, Sena-BJP councillors led by Sanjay Bhosle and Vikas Mathkari overturned tables and chairs, smashed glass panes, and damaged microphones. The councillors later entered Rajpals office and damaged furniture.         
	The chaos continued for nearly an hour as NCP councillors retaliated and barged into the Sena office on the corporation premises, damaging chairs, tables and glass panes. They also tried to enter the BJP office next door, but were held off. Late in the night, Pune police lodged cases against 23 Sena, BJP and MNS councillors.        
	Last Thursday, the general body of the Pune civic body had passed a resolution on removing the statue of Kondadev, a Brahmin, from Lal Mahal, where it stood next to the statues of Shivaji and his mother Jijabai.        
	The Sena, BJP and the MNS had opposed the move, but the ruling Congress-NCP managed to push the resolution through with a 54-37 vote.         
	According to legend, it was Lal Mahal where the encounter between Shivaji and Shaista Khan  Aurangzebs Mughal officer  took place. In 1660, Aurangzeb had sent Khan with a large army to defeat Shivaji. By 1663, Khan had seized Pune and had made his residence in Lal Mahal, once Shivajis home.        
	Shivaji, the story goes, took Khan by surprise. Khan escaped by jumping out of a window but not before Shivaji had chopped off three of his fingers.         
	Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray slammed the Congress-NCP for removing the statue of Kondadev in the middle of the night as if he was a terrorist. He said the Sena would try to reinstall the statue at Lal Mahal.        
	Will councillors now decide what should be in the pages of history? said Uddhavs cousin and MNS leader Raj Thackeray. Gaga Bhatt (a renowned Pandit from Varanasi) who presided over Chhatrapati Shivajis coronation was also a Brahmin. So do you want to brush him out of history books? Will you now paint Shivaji Maharajs history with caste-based politics?        
	BJP general secretary Vinod Tawade accused NCP deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar of instigating the controversy to divert focus from scams. Ajitdada Pawar said he wants to do developmental politics, but he has used an emotive issue, Tawade said. Pawar, the guardian minister for Pune district, remained mum through the day.        
	Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, who spoke on the dangers of cultural terrorism at a Thane meet, refused to be drawn into the controversy when reporters tried to get his reaction.         
	The event, where Chavan was the chief guest at the closing ceremony, was held at a stadium named after Dadoji Kondadev.

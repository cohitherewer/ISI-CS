	Bhubaneswar, March 12: It was a rare sight at the auditorium of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Research and Training Institute here today. Seated firmly on chairs were 56 students listening keenly to lectures on land rights, forest act, government policies and laws.        
	Learning the lessons were primitive Dongria Kondh tribal youths living in the remote hamlets of the Niyamgiri range in south Orissa. For the next few days, the institute  generally frequented by anthropologists, educationists and research scholars  will groom a new breed of change-makers to be formally called tribal ambassadors.        
	In a special drive by the state government, young tribal youths  both men and women  are being nurtured to understand tribal laws, policies and various development programmes being implemented.        
	The institute is organising the training session in association with Vasundhara, an NGO working on forest rights.         
	At least 145,000 tribal families in Orissa have already been given pattas. The government, through video-conferencing, has been monitoring serious implementation of the forest rights act, said A.B. Ota, the institute director. However, with patta, the game is not over. The real work begins after it. The youths are being taught how to ensure coverage of various schemes and to implement the forest rights act in their respective areas in a manner that it can be of optimal use, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitishs test: marrying development to caste equations
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitishs test: marrying development to caste equations
										      SANKARSHAN THAKUR IN LALPUR (DARBHANGA)                                    
	As we left, done with our conversation with chief minister Nitish Kumar, an aide bounded up from behind politely seeking a submission. The D-word, he said, as if to annotate the burden of his bosss worldview, is very important, sir, but dont underestimate the C-word, it matters, especially in Bihar.         
	Development, or the talk of it, was all very well, he meant, but caste remains a more insistent reality. A given, youd think, in these parts, as accepted as the notion of the sun rising in the east.        
	But its not far to understand why Nitishs men have begun to feel the need to underline the fact of caste being inalienable to the politics of the state.        
	Its a truism they probably require to constantly remind themselves of as well. So much of the projection of Nitish  and Bihar  over the past couple of years has focused on development and governance, so much of it about the creation of a new, overarching Bihari identity, that there is palpable concern about losing touch with harder ground reality.        
	There is some danger here of falling between two stools, cautions a retired bureaucrat who would not be named because he considers himself part of Nitishs advisory council. Development has not matured into a phenomenon big enough to override other concerns, it has certainly not neutralised the caste factor. Perhaps in little bits of Patna, but not beyond. Nitish should be wary of being deluded by the idea he has already created a new Bihari identity of pride; it is very embryonic.        
	This crossroads in the depths of rural north Bihar is a fair stage to get a measure of just how fragile the noble construct of Bihari identity based on development at the expense of caste identity is.        
	Lalpur has been newly visited by the intimations of change and its manifold possibilities. New roads, narrow but concrete, have cut through it, drastically reducing distances to Patna and district towns closer up like Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga.         
	The local school has been infused with life, its walls plastered and painted, its compound swept and prim. Students have begun to arrive in droves early morning, like vanished migratory birds on a course correction.        
	Its like a revolution, says Jivanand Chaudhary, who teaches arithmetic and Sanskrit. Girls, and now boys, have been given free cycles and uniforms, and theyve taken to school like ducks to water. Its happening everywhere, a new wave of learning.        
	The local block office is abuzz with attendance, the cobwebs of dereliction wiped out by a top-down get-to-work directive. The impasse over the river  the British-era overpass was swept in floods over a decade ago  is being bridged. There is excited talk about a new power sub-station, although it is only excited talk at the moment; electricity came to these parts in 1969 but thats been mostly an on-paper thing, so its imminent arrival remains a tough thing for folks to believe.        
	But things are happening, nods Ajit Prasad, ensconced member of the pantheon of Lalpur bazaar, nobody can deny the change, Nitish Kumar is a man who works, slowly, but he works.        
	His companions on the bench, strips of bamboo nailed to wooden stilts, grunt approvingly, each fanning off flies and heat with respective gamchhas. You see, offers one of them, after Lalu, whatever happens looks good because under Lalu nothing happened.        
	But throw the vote question and it scatters the placid accord on the Lalpur bench. Ah, that well have to see, recoils Ajit Prasad, as if to correct some misunderstanding hed created. Voting is another thing, other factors come in.        
	Teacher Chaudhary enters the conversation, swatting the pretence off it with a swing of his own gamchha. But dont you understand, he says sardonically, his barb directed at Prasad, yahan to jaat par baat hai, kaam lega Nitish se, vote dega Lalu ko (Caste is the truth here, hell get work done by Nitish and vote for Lalu).        
	And so? Prasad retorts, stung. It is the job of governments to work, Nitish is not doing anyone a favour. Vote mein apne-paraye ka bhi khayal karna padta hai (When you vote, you have to think of mine and thine).        
	Hes suddenly acquired bench-strength with what he said. Truly spoken, says another elder, so far quiet. Hamra raaj bhi chheeniyega aur kahiyega ki vote bhi do? So kaise hoga? Sadak-school to sab banata hai, samman bhi to koi cheej hai (Youll take power away from me and then ask me to vote for you? How will that happen? Everybody makes schools and roads, but theres also something called self-respect).         
	The drift quite clearly running his way, Prasad delivers what he believes to be his knockout punch to master Chaudhary. And what about corruption? he asks, articulating what has become a general grassroots clamour in Nitishs Bihar. It is officer-raj under Nitish, everyone wants a greater bribe, you pay more for work than you ever did.        
	Ah, says the schoolteacher, but the work does get done. And let me tell you, there is corruption because money is flowing down, it is not stuck in Patna in the hands of a few.        
	Such discourse will get livelier and sharper across Bihars listening posts as elections draw near. But to think that Nitish has turned deaf to the ground rules in his pursuit of higher things  to credit him with eschewing caste and embracing development  is to do his political instinct great discredit.         
	There is smart subterfuge to what Nitish is attempting. Parallel to what the outside world  from the hallowed columns of The Economist to op-ed eulogies in The Wall Street Journal  congratulates him for, he has also chiselled away at an electoral base much his own: the extremely backward among the backwards, the most deprived among the Dalits, the underprivileged among the Muslims.        
	Exclusive concessions and incentives have gone to this constituency under Nitish, and married to acute urban elite/upper caste concerns of keeping the Lalu Prasad years firmly behind, they could well mean a vote bank sufficient enough for Nitish to encash an electoral victory from.        
	Adversaries  even Lalu Prasad who constructed his platform much the same way  might call it cynical identity politics but for Nitish, it is a key survival strategy. Hes no babe in these woods; on the contrary, he has roamed it long enough to figure his way out.        
	Development, as his current Vishwas Yatra through the state suggests, remains the core of his call, but he is too rooted of soil to forget what goes into the making of a secure turf. It is how well he ties in the C-word to the D-word that will make the difference between fresh lease and losing. You can tell from his five years in office, he knows. His aide was unduly anxious.

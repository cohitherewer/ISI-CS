The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nuke bill dilution plan off
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nuke bill dilution plan off
                            
	New Delhi, June 15 (PTI): The Centre today dropped plans to dilute a key provision in the nuclear liability bill as its top officials were grilled by a parliamentary committee amid stiff opposition from the BJP and the Left.        
	Department of atomic energy secretary Srikumar Banerjee, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao and several other senior officials were grilled during a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on aspects like the liability of the supplier of a nuclear plant or material and a cap of Rs 500 crore on compensation.        
	Banerjee expressed regrets before the committee for circulating a note at the last meeting, which contained a proposal for amending clause 17(b).        
	The clause proposes the operator would have legal recourse in case of a nuclear accident because of wilful act or gross negligence on the part of the supplier of the material, equipment or services, or of his employee.        
	According to the note circulated at the last meeting of the standing committee on June 8, clause 17(b) had been deleted while clause 17(a) and (c) had been retained.        
	At todays meeting, the committee was informed that the government was withdrawing that note and the original clause stood as part of the bill, sources said.        
	The clause 17(a) provides that the operator could have legal recourse if such right is expressly provided in the contract in writing while 17(c) says the recourse could be taken if the nuclear incident has resulted from the act of commission or omission of a person done with the intent to cause nuclear damage.        
	The decision to drop the amendment assumes significance as it coincides with the uproar over handling of the Bhopal gas tragedy in which the then government is accused of allowing the operators of Union Carbide to go scot-free.        
	During the day-long meeting, members of the committee grilled Banerjee and other officials, questioning the intent behind the amendments and wondering whether the consent of the cabinet had been taken for it, the sources said.        
	The government officials are understood to have told the committee that the amendments were only suggestions.        
	After the proposals were moved at the last committee meeting, the government had come under sharp attack from the BJP and the Left, which questioned whether it was being done to help American companies.        
	Another area of contention was the Rs 500 crore-cap on the compensation to be paid by an operator of a nuclear power plant in case of an accident.        
	There were strong demands that the cap be raised.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Buddha relics panel stirs controversy
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Buddha relics panel stirs controversy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Subhash Chandra                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 18: A government-appointed committee has recommended that relics of Buddha and his disciples be handed over to a private religious trust but two panel members association with a possible beneficiary has stirred a controversy.        
	The row follows allegations that the proposals suit the interests of a foundation headed by Zee boss Subhash Chandra, a member of the panel. The foundation has built a pagoda (stupa) near Mumbai with the professed aim of enshrining such relics. It was recently thrown open to visitors and expects over a lakh followers each year. The foundation is described as a non-commercial organisation which propagates the Vipassana technique of meditation. Its 325-foot-high pagoda, on Gorai Island, was built at a cost of Rs 80 crore.        
	The relics, dating back to 6th century BC, have been classified into three categories  sharirika, paribhogika and votive. Sharirika are relics in the nature of skeletons, bones or teeth, ashes and hair belonging to Lord Buddha and his disciples. Paribhogika includes objects used by them. Votive covers articles offered by pilgrims. They are now kept and displayed in Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) museums.        
	The committee, set up by the culture ministry, also includes academic Mridula Mukherjee, ASI director-general K.N. Srivastava, Shantam Seth of Ahimsa Trust and Seema Aggarwal, the other member from Vipassana Foundation.         
	The panel was split on the handover plan. Those who favoured the move argued that the existing system of preserving the relics in government museums was not in tune with the wishes of Lord Buddha who, they claimed, wanted them kept in stupas. They also contended that private trusts would do a better job of the upkeep.        
	Others disagreed. It is clear that the recommendations have been made to favour the foundation. All suggestions are tuned to suit Vipassana Foundation, said one member who has filed a dissent note.         
	According to him, another member had also argued against the plan, saying the relics were considered national properties. He had apparently said it would open a Pandoras box as other religious groups could stake similar claims.        
	An ASI official echoed the sentiment. It (the proposal) is against accepted practices to remove the relics from the sites of recovery. They are part of our collective history and it is wrong to hand it over to any private trust.        
	A culture ministry official sought to douse the controversy, saying the government would not take any decision in haste because the matter involved religious sentiments. All that the ministry is keen on ensuring is to protect and preserve the relics in a better manner. No decision has been taken so far, the official said.        
	Sixty-four relics have been dug out by the ASI at 12 sites, most of them in Bihar, Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Delhi. These have been kept in the National Museum in Delhi, the Indian Museum in Calcutta, the Sarnath Museum near Varanasi, and in museums in Nalanda, Bodh Gaya and Patna in Bihar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish, Lalu cross swords at mentor function
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitish, Lalu cross swords at mentor function
  - Bihar CM, RJD boss pay tribute to Karpoori on birth anniversary          NALIN VERMA                          Lalu Prasad pays tributes to Karpoori Thakur in Patna on Sunday. Picture by Deepak Kumar                                        
	Patna, Jan. 24: Both Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad celebrated the birth anniversary of Karpoori Thakur in style. And both owed their existence and rise in politics to their common mentor that the socialist icon was.        
	But the two Bihar satraps used the occasion to attack each other. While the Bihar chief minister preferred sweeter words to take on his arch-rival Lalu Prasad, the RJD boss ridiculed Nitishs claim to development and relief to the poor in his signature style.        
	Walking on the path shown by Thakur, the RJD has decided to carry out nationwide movement against the state government as well as the Centre for the spiralling price rise of essential commodities, Lalu Prasad said, adding: Bihar has suffered more because of price rise for it has a large section of people living below the poverty line. Nitishs development claim is farce.        
	Poor people are suffering from starvation in various districts, while Nitish is taunting on them by reeling off false figures related to development. The fruits of development have been confined to contractors, traders and middlemen in the NDA rule, the RJD boss said. Thakur was a real messiah of the poor. He would have been hurt to see the prosperity of the elite middle class at the cost of the poor in Bihar.        
	Nitish, too, described Thakur as the real messiah of the poor, explaining how he was running the government in accordance with the path shown by the Jan Nayak (peoples leader) that Thakur was reverentially referred to.        
	The RJD has called Bihar bandh on January 28 against price rise and hoarding.        
	My government has given reservation to the extremely backward classes and women in panchayat bodies. We are working for the uplift of the maha-Dalits and poor among the Muslim communities. We are moving along while taking interests of all section of society as part of our inclusive politics, Nitish said.         
	Without naming Lalu Prasad, Nitish added: Some people are attacking me for they have forgotten the ideals of Thakur.        
	The chief minister pointed out that how his steps to ensure 50 per cent reservation to women in panchayat bodies had inspired the central government to ensure 50 per cent reservation for women in local bodies across the country by amending the Constitution.        
	Nitish also tried to put in place the JD(U) leaders, who had launched revolution against him.         
	For instance, Nitish did not even turn attention towards his ministerial colleague Narendra Singh sitting on the dais with him. Instead, he called the partys Rajya Sabha MP and Pasmanda Muslim leader, Ali Anwar, from the back row to sit close to him. Narendra had recently joined the Rajput rebellion meeting organised by dissident party leader Prabhunath Singh recently.

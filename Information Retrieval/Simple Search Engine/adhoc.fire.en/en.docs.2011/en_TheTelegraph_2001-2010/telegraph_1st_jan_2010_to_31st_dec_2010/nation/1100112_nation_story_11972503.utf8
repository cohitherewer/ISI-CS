          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 11: Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama today urged Maoists to shun the path of violence as it was not a solution to their problems.        
	Of course, there is still exploitation in the society and due to frustration and anger, people become violent, said the spiritual leader.        
	Staging demonstrations or dharnas was all right for solving problems but violence was not the proper way to solve problems, he said.        
	The spiritual leader flew to Chandragiri, a Tibetan settlement in Gajapati district affected by Maoist violence. Asked whether he was afraid to visit the Maoist-hit district, the Dalai Lamas reply was an emphatic No.        
	On the importance of peace and non-violence, he said: Disagreement and conflict among people is always there. But we need a method to solve it and that method is through non-violence.        
	Every one wants peace. Even former US president George Bush tried to restore peace in Iraq, but he applied the wrong method of restoring peace through force, said the Tibetan leader.        
	India had a tradition of non-violence and it was a democracy that stood for equality and freedom, he said.        
	Stating that there were vast underdeveloped areas with a huge tribal population in Orissa, Dalai Lama underscored the need for education, health and training for the overall development of the state.        
	Real change should take place in rural India and not in some cities, said the leader, asking people to develop themselves and not wait for government measures.         
	During his stay in the Tibetan settlement, the Dalai Lama will inaugurate a five-storeyed Buddhist monastery named Padma Sambhav Mahavihara, billed as South Asias biggest monastery.        
	The monastery has been built in Atanpuri style of architecture of Nalanda over 10 acres and at a cost of Rs 8 crore.         
	It has been named after Acharya Padmasambhav who was born in Orissa and believed to have spread Buddhism to Tibet in the seventh century.

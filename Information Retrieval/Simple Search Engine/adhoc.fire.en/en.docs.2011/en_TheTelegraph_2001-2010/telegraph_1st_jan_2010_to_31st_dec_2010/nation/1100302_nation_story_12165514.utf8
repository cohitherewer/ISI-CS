The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Terror camps a concern: Antony
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Terror camps a concern: Antony
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Pokhran, March 1: Defence minister A.K. Antony has said dozens of terror camps are still intact in Pakistan, voicing Delhis biggest concern on a day India demonstrated its air firepower.        
	Antony said Delhi had already conveyed to Islamabad that 42 terror camps were functional across the border but he didnt expect any miracles from the recently concluded foreign secretary-level talks with Pakistan.        
	Forty-two terror camps across the border are intact. Its our biggest concern. There is no serious attempt (on the part of Pakistan) to dismantle them, the minister said yesterday on the sidelines of a day-dusk-night firepower demonstration by the Indian Air Force in Pokhran.         
	Antony said the resumption of dialogue was only a beginning. We took a conscious decision to hold talks (at the foreign secretary level). We did not expect any miracle. Asked about Indias response to last weeks Taliban attack in Kabul that killed 17 people, including nine Indians, Antony said: The Prime Minister has already expressed his concern. I am sure the Afghan government will make a proper inquiry.        
	Antony was cautious when asked about junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoors statement on Saudi Arabias role as interlocutor to ease tensions in the subcontinent. The Prime Minister is in Saudi Arabia on a very, very important mission. When the Prime Minister is abroad, it is not proper for a member of his cabinet to comment, Antony said.        
	Asked about the 3.98 per cent rise in the defence budget for 2010-11, Antony said: Dont read too much into it.... I am not concerned (at the nominal rise in the budget). He (finance minister Pranab Mukherjee) has assured us that if we want more money, he will provide it.

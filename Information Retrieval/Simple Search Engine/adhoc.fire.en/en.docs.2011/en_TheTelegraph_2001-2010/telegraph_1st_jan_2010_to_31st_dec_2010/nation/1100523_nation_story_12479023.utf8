          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, May 22: Mangalores Kasturba Medical College where the eight survivors of todays plane crash were brought for treatment may itself not have survived two years back, had the health ministry had its way.         
	The ministry had withdrawn recognition to courses offered by the college in September 2008 after a probe by the Medical Council of India (MCI) concluded that the institution was admitting more students than it was allowed to.         
	Kasturba Medical College or KMC was admitting 500 students a year as against its sanctioned intake of 250 students annually, the MCI report had said.         
	After loud protests from students and the college management  the institution is a part of Manipal University  the health ministry buckled and in October 2008 once again asked the MCI to recognise its courses.         
	The college hospital offers the largest and best burn facility in the region, and the survivors of todays crash were treated for burn and other injuries here.         
	Today, government officials in Nirman Bhavan  headquarters of the health ministry  could be excused if they were quietly relieved that they re-recognised the courses.

          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                                    
	Bokaro, Aug. 8: A joint operation by Bokaro police and the CRPF led to the arrest of Maoist leader J. Narsimha Reddy and four others in Jharkhand today.        
	Reddy, a CPI (Maoist) central military commission member, carried a reward of Rs 10 lakh on his head and was wanted by the police in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Orissa.         
	He was arrested from a hut in Rallivera village, 76km from Bokaro city. He had shifted to the house about a week ago.         
	A laptop, a 9mm pistol, 10 cartridges and some documents related to Naxalite operations in Jharkhand, Bengal, Orissa and Chhattisgarh were seized from him.        
	Although the police said he was arrested late last night, CRPF sources said the 45-year-old Maoist and his aides were caught four days ago after a two-month hunt by Bokaro police.         
	Reddy had been difficult to track down as he changed hideouts often and almost never used any communication device.

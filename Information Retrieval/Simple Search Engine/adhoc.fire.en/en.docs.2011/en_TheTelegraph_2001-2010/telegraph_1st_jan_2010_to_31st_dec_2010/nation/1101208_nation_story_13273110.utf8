  - Indian scientists show how bacteria exploit body stem cells          G.S. MUDUR                           Gobardhan Das in his laboratory at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi                                         
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: A team of scientists in India has deciphered a key mechanism through which tuberculosis bacteria hijack the bodys machinery to evade the immune system, resolving a puzzle that has baffled scientists for decades.         
	Biologist Gobardhan Das and his colleagues at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) in New Delhi have shown that TB bacteria exploit the bodys own stem cells to escape the immune system and lie dormant for years.         
	The findings may help researchers design new drugs against TB, a disease for which the last drug to be successfully commercialised had emerged some four decades ago.         
	About one-third of the global population is believed to be infected with TB bacteria, but the majority of infected people have no symptoms. It is only after a fall in immunity  and a resulting spurt in bacterial population  that people develop symptoms.         
	Now, the ICGEB scientists have carried out experiments on laboratory mice that suggest that TB bacteria recruit the bodys mesenchymal stem cells which are drawn to the site of the TB infection in the body. These cells, which have the capacity to turn into bone or cartilage cells, have a tendency to migrate towards sites of inflammation or injury in the body.         
	The mesenchymal stem cells form a protective shield around the site of infection, said Das, principal investigator of the study. The studys findings appear today in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.         
	Das said the stem cells play a Janus-like role in TB infection, citing a two-headed figure from Roman mythology  one head looking forward, the other backward. The experiments suggest that the mesenchymal stem cells have dual, but opposing roles in TB infection. They sit in between the site of the TB infection and the bodys T cells which could help destroy the bacteria, Das said.         
	The study has shown a compound called nitric oxide produced by the stem cells on one side prevents the bacteria from proliferating wildly, while on the other side, it leads to a suppression of T cells, thus protecting the bacteria.         
	The stem cells neither kill all the bacteria nor do they completely suppress T cells, Das said. They maintain an equilibrium that may be tipped towards disease when the immunity of a person falls.         
	Medical researchers have long known that TB bacteria quietly persist in the body for years, a puzzle because most infective organisms are cleared by the immune system. Public health specialists believe that India may have up to 400 million people living with dormant infections.         
	There are probably multiple mechanisms the bacteria uses to protect itself from the immune system, said Krishnamurthy Natarajan, a scientist at the BR Ambedkar Centre for Biomedical Research at Delhi University, who was not involved in the study.         
	Natarajan and his colleagues had shown earlier this year that infection by TB bacteria activates a set of immune system cells called the dendritic cells in an unusual manner that protects the bacteria rather than harms them.         
	A knowledge of molecular mechanisms the TB bacteria use could help in identifying new molecular targets for drugs in the future, said Natarajan who was earlier at the ICGEB.         
	Some mice used in the experiments at the ICGEB had come from the laboratory of Luc Van Kaer, a biologist at the Vanderbilt University of Medical Sciences in Nashville, US.

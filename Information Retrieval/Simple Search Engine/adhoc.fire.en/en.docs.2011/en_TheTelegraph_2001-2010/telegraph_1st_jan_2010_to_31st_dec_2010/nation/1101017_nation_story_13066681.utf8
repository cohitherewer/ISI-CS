	New Delhi, Oct. 16: Maharashtra Congress chief Manikrao Thakre could lose his job after being caught on camera discussing how lakhs were collected from ministers to fund Sonia Gandhis rally in the state yesterday, sources have said.        
	Most central leaders in the Congress feel Thakres indiscretion was unforgivable. Sonia today discussed Thakres future with the central leader in charge of Maharashtra affairs, A.K. Antony, and her political secretary Ahmed Patel.        
	TV cameras had picked up parts of a conversation between Thakre and Nagpur-based leader Satish Chaturvedi at an unguarded moment at a media conference in Nagpur on Thursday.        
	The duo were purportedly discussing how Rs 2 crore was collected from chief minister Ashok Chavan for the rally at Sewagram in Wardha district, while cabinet ministers paid Rs 10 lakh.        
	The Opposition has demanded Chavans resignation and a judicial probe into what it is calling a money-for-rally scandal.        
	After a TV channel began beaming the conversation on Thursday, there was speculation that Sonia could cancel her Maharashtra tour, sources said. But the party high command decided she should go ahead with the visit, since a cancellation would blow the incident up. Sonia addressed the Sewagram rally without making any reference to the controversy.        
	Party sources said the central leadership had pulled Thakre up immediately after the controversy broke and asked him to try and control the damage before the rally. Chief minister Chavan too stepped in to douse the fire, saying that the funds for political rallies were always collected from party workers and not the government or ministers. Now, with the rally over, the focus is back on Thakres lapse.         
	The state unit chief had been a strong contender for a second term and was being backed by the chief minister but now seems to have spoiled his case. General secretary Mukul Wasnik, Thakres biggest supporter in Delhi, is himself in a mess after bungles in candidate selection for the Bihar Assembly polls.        
	The powerful Union minister from Maharashtra, Vilasrao Desmukh, is opposed to Thakres continuation and the other influential lobby in the state, led by Narayan Rane, too wants a change at the helm of the state unit.

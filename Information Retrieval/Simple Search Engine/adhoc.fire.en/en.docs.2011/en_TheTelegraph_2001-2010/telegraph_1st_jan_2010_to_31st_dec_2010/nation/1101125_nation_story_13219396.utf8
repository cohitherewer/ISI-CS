          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                              Kiran Kumar Reddy.

	Hyderabad, Nov. 24: Nallari Kiran Kumar Reddy, a 50-year-old with a clean image, was tonight named chief minister of Andhra Pradesh in place of Konijeti Rosaiah who had resigned earlier in the day.        
	An extraordinary meeting of the Congress legislature party in the evening, attended by Pranab Mukherjee, A.K. Antony, Veerappa Moily and Ghulam Nabi Azad, unanimously authorised Congress president Sonia Gandhi to choose the new chief minister.        
	Later, Mukherjee announced that Reddy, the Assembly Speaker and four-time MLA, was Sonias choice.        
	Reddy is not a mass leader but is seen as clean and non-controversial, like Prithviraj Chavan who took over as Maharashtra chief minister earlier this month. Like Chavan again, he belongs to a powerful caste group and a political family  his father N. Amarnath Reddy was a state minister and known to be close to Indira Gandhi and P.V. Narasimha Rao.        
	Rosaiah had taken cabinet colleagues by surprise with the announcement of his resignation at 1.30pm, with the ministers not seeing it coming even after he called a news conference.        
	Before he drove to Raj Bhavan to put in his papers, Rosaiah said he bore no ill-will to anyone. My only goal was to set right the cart and avert a financial disaster in the state. The Telangana agitation had cut short state revenues by almost 25 per cent and the schemes and programmes of YSR needed huge funds, he said.        
	Sources said the party high command had asked Rosaiah to step down, tired of his incessant complaints against rebel Kadapa MP Jaganmohan Reddy and his inability to handle the dissidence locally. A channel owned by Jagan had last week telecast a show attacking Sonia and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	Ahmed Patel, a close aide of the Congress president, informed Rosaiah that Sonia had decided it was time for change of leadership in view of the challenges coming up  a reference to the Telangana movement and the leadership challenge thrown by the Jagan faction.        
	We had to decide in favour of a new leader at this juncture as Rosaiah was not keen to take on both the challenges, an AICC observer said.        
	The party decided to complete the transition this month to allow the new chief minister to settle down before the Srikrishna Commission submits its report on the creation of Telangana in December.        
	The choice of a Reddy as chief minister will signal to Jagan  son of late chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy  that his chances of grabbing the top post are over.        
	Senior Congress leaders said Rosaiah, who spent over 14 months in the top job but was seen as a stopgap even by himself, was told to hold the meeting of the legislature party yesterday.        
	Patel and Veerappa Moily had taken a serious view of his outburst that he himself and the government have to jump into Husseinsagar Lake on the issue of written tests for police recruitment. Students from Telangana wanted the tests, scheduled in December, to be postponed but the chief minister was unwilling.        
	A few months ago, Rosaiah had sarcastically said: I am not a rising son, but a sinking sun. On another occasion, he said: I had become chief minister by mistake (parapatuno) or misfortune (grahapatuno).        
	Of the 156 Congress MLAs, 148 attended the legislature party meeting today along with 40 of the 52 MLCs.        
	Reddy, who belongs to a prominent agriculturist and political family from the sugarcane belt of Chittoor, edged out Union urban development minister Jaipal Reddy.        
	A keen cricketer, Reddy captained the Osmania University cricket team and played for the Hyderabad Ranji team.                     WITH INPUTS FROM SANJAY K.

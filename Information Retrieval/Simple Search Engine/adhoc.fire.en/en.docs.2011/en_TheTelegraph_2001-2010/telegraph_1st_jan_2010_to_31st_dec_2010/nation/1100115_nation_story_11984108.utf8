                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Villagers hold Posco officials hostage
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Protest path                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 14: Agitators opposing setting up of a steel plant by South Korean giant Posco today took hostage four Posco officials who were carrying out a survey near the proposed project site.        
	The incident took place around 2pm at a village near Dhinkia of Kujang block in Jagatsinghpur district. The district police are trying to negotiate their release from agitators protesting under the banner of the Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti.        
	Sub-divisional police officer of Paradip Shantanu Das said that the officials were led by some 12 to 15 locals into the interiors of the village where they were kept hostage. We are trying to hold talks with activists for the release of officials and are expecting positive results, said Das.         
	Those taken hostage include Arun Mohapatra, Prashant Rout, Nihar Das and Debasish Swain. The officials were held hostage as they deliberately entered the restricted area, said samiti president Abhay Sahu.        
	The state government said that there would be no land acquisition in Dhinkia and Gobindpur. So why did the officials come here? asked Sahu. There will be no negotiation. We will not allow any company official inside this area. We will continue to take officials hostage in future if they try to venture into this restricted zone, said Sahu.        
	A visit to villages was a very routine affair as our employees cover the project-affected villages daily. We hope the matter will be resolved soon, said Posco India GM (external relations) Simanta Mohanty.

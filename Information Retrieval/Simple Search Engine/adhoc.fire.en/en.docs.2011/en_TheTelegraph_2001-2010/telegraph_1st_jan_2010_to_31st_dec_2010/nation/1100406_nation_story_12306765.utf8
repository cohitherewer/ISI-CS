          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Cuttack, April 5: The backlog of cases in Orissa High Court numbers over 3 lakh even as additional ones are piling up at an alarming rate.        
	While nearly 1,900 cases are being instituted on an average in a week, the number of cases disposed of remains restricted to not more than 1,500. Consequently, about 400 additional cases are piling up and accumulating as pending cases every week.        
	According to sources, there were 352,151 cases pending in the high court and the sanctioned number of judges is 22, while the working strength presently is 16. Available details indicated disposal of 73,343 cases against filing of 92,252 cases in 2009, prior to which around 333,162 cases were already pending. In 2003, the backlog was around 2 lakh.         
	A study, undertaken by the Centre on the backlog of cases in the high courts, had figured out that 11 additional judges were expected to clear the backlog in Orissa High Court within three years.        
	Accordingly, on October 30, 2003, the Centre had given clearance for 11 new posts of additional judges. Subsequently, the number of sanctioned posts of judges for Orissa High Court was increased to 22. But at least six of the sanctioned posts have remained vacant for long. The Orissa High Court Bar Association had already blamed the state government for lack of concern.        
	Officials in the high court administration, on the other hand, said inordinate delay in receiving replies to notices from the government was equally proving to be a bane.

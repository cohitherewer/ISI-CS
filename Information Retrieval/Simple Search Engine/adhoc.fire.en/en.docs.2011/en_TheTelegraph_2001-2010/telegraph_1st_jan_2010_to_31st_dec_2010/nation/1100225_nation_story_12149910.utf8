The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mantra hinges on private moolah
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mantra hinges on private moolah
                                          
	After having managed to successfully throw out the Tatas from Singur, Mamata Banerjee is now going all out to embrace the private sector in her attempt to achieve all-inclusive growth through the all-India vehicle of the railways.        
	PPP or public-private partnership  the buzzword in the Planning Commission  will be her mantra to achieve an ambitious programme of adding no less than 25,000km of new lines to the existing 64,000km of Indian Railways network by 2020.        
	A master list of 114 new lines has found a place in her strategy for this inclusive growth, under the rubric Socially Responsible Rail Connectivity Proposals. Some of these lines may be unviable today but she reckons that they will turn profitable in due course as the backward areas open up to opportunities.        
	Of course, this grand 2020 vision is subject to availability of funds and the PPP initiative will take off only if the private sector is prepared to put in money where Mamatas mouth is.        
	In her scheme of things, Mamata has not left out even smaller inputs such as health centres and other staff welfare measures. Her master plan includes 383 new outpatient departments (OPD) and diagnostic centres, 101 secondary-level general speciality hospitals and 41 tertiary-level multi-speciality hospitals, and a total of 7400 stations on the 64,000km rail network.         
	In due course, these will become a major resource base for the healthcare of the 1.4 million strong employees and their families and other dependants.         
	Unhappy with the performance of Railway Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO), the railways in-house R amp;D wing at Lucknow, she has decided to revamp it and bring it in line with modern research organisations. Towards this, the railways have signed an MoU on February 13 with IIT Kharagpur to establish a centre for railway research. She also proposes to establish more such research partnerships with other IITs, NIT, and DRDOs, making the railway R amp;D a more meaningful exercise rather than a facility for giving design approvals, certification, inspection and, in a few cases, improving existing designs.        
	Not one to miss an opportunity to take care of her constituency, Mamata had already announced a new electric loco facility at Dankuni, and now plans a new coach factory at Singur, proposed by the Bengal government which has been holding on to the land it acquired for an aborted Tata initiative.        
	A diesel multiple unit (DMU), as a joint venture (JV) or a PPP factory at Sankrail, a centre for excellence in wagon prototyping at the Kharagpur workshop of South Eastern Railway, a rail axle factory at New Jalpaiguri, again through the JV/PP route, a heavy axle load wagon POH (Periodic Overhaul ) facility for the eastern leg of the Dedicated Freight Corridor at Dankuni, and a coach mid-life rehabilitation (MLR) workshop at Anara in Adra Division of South Eastern Railway are some of the other goodies promised by Mamatadi.        
	A little worrisome for the wagon builders, a large number of whom are based in Bengal, could be Mamatas proposal to set up no less than five state-of-the-art new wagon manufacturing facilities in Secunderabad, Burdwan, Kalahandi, Guwahati and Haldia.        
	On the other hand, it could also be an opportunity for them if they could tie up with major world-renowned builders using the JV/PPP route. The choice of stations would in all probability have been based on the availability of surplus railway land, or readily available land for quick acquisition by the private players at relatively cheap rates.        
	All in all, an extremely interesting budget, if nothing else, for the vast ground it has covered in Mamatas effort to reach out to all stakeholders. It is undoubtedly a gigantic road map and its implementation will be highly dependent on the success of the much-hyped PPP mantra.        
	Or, will it end up as a subject matter for another white paper a la Nitish Kumar who, as minister of railways about a decade ago, was faced with a backlog of projects that were worth more than Rs 30,000 crore with no end in sight for aeons to come. He had asked the Lok Sabha to discuss it and find a workable solution, in other words drop a few of the low-priority projects, which of course was asking for the impossible.                     R.C. ACHARYA IS A FORMER MEMBER (MECHANICAL), RAILWAY BOARD

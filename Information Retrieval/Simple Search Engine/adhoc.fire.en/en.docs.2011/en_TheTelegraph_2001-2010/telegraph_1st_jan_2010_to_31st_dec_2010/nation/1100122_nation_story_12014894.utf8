The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Strategic focus with Menon in hot seat
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Strategic focus with Menon in hot seat
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Menon                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 21: Former foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon, who formally replaced M.K. Narayanan as national security adviser (NSA) today, is expected to restore strategic international issues as the focus of the key post in the Prime Ministers Office.         
	A distinguished diplomat who specialised in Chinese affairs and was also, for a time, adviser to the Atomic Energy Commission, Menon is seen as an advocate of Manmohan Singhs talks-are-the-only-way line on Pakistan.         
	He was among the authors of the Sharm-al-Sheikh agreement which came for harsh criticism from sections that opposed the unprecedented mention of Balochistan and the de-linking of talks from Pakistans role in containing terrorist outfits and the export of terror to India.         
	Menon retired as foreign secretary on July 31 last year.         
	Although suggestions that the NSAs office be re-designated as one with purely foreign policy functions has not found favour with the Prime Minister, it is possible that with Menons arrival in the job, internal security matters will find reduced attention.         
	Menons predecessor, Narayanan, came from an IPS-intelligence background and, therefore, invested a lot in internal security affairs.         
	Menons role would sit more comfortably with Union home minister P. Chidambarams plans to restructure his ministry in a manner that all internal security matters become the domain of his office.         
	The NSAs relatively new office  it was created in 1998  has been held by top foreign policy hands with the exception of Narayanan. Brajesh Mishra was NSA during the Atal Behari Vajpayee years and was succeeded by J.N. Dixit when the UPA came to power.         
	Government insiders see Menons appointment as NSA to be a signal from the Prime Ministers Office that it wants a man well versed with Indias neighbourhood. Menon as a diplomat had served in Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and more importantly, in both China and Pakistan.         
	Insiders also attribute Menons elevation to the post of NSA to his enjoying the Prime Ministers confidence. In 2006, Menon had superseded 12 foreign service officers to be appointed the foreign secretary.         
	A well-placed source in the government said Menon had maintained a low profile since his retirement. He kept himself away from the media and resisted the temptation of coming out with any bare-all memoirs.         
	In a rare gesture, Singh will host a farewell dinner for Narayanan on Saturday. All cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats have been invited to the dinner. Narayanan will take oath as Bengal governor on Monday.         
	The NSAs office comes under the purview of the PMO and enjoys the rank of minister of state.         
	The NSA is not answerable to Parliament. Of late, there have been demands, chiefly by Brajesh Mishra, that the NSAs office should either be held by a minister responsible to Parliament or be replaced by the post of diplomatic adviser, like in the UK and France.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Suri, July 20: Twenty bodies from the Sainthia train accident today began what may turn into a long wait for identification at the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital morgue.        
	Of the 61 bodies at the Suri Sadar Hospital, 41 have been identified and were handed over to their families today after post-mortem, Birbhum chief medical officer of health Asish Mullick said.        
	The remaining 20 bodies are yet to be identified. We have limited space in our morgue, so we have sent these bodies to the Burdwan Medical College. If any DNA test is required later, it will be done there.        
	The bodies released to families were taken away in coffins provided by the railways. Railway officials handed over Rs 25,000 in cash  from the Rs 5 lakh compensation announced by the ministry  to the families of 19 of the dead and 30 of the injured from a hospital counter.        
	Ranjay Kumar, 20, who lost elder brother Manjay in the accident, said the railways should give him a job. My brothers soul will rest in peace if any of us from the family get a railway job.        
	Mullick, the chief medical officer of health, said 32 injured passengers were still admitted at the Suri hospital. Fifty-one injured had yesterday been referred to the Burdwan Medical College. From there, 21 were later taken to the SSKM Hospital and the Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta and the Howrah Orthopaedic Hospital.

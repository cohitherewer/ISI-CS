                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rahul like JP? Cong annoyed 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, Oct. 22: Days after the Congress lost its most experienced spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi, who had angered the partys Kerala unit by appearing in court for a lottery king close to the CPM, the man brought in as his replacement looks set to be shown the door.         
	Mohan Prakash has annoyed the whole party by comparing Rahul Gandhi with Jayaprakash Narayan, who was Indira Gandhis worst enemy and whom the Congress blames for the imposition of Emergency.         
	After Pandit Nehru, (former President) Abdul Kalam addressed the children of the country. Similarly after Jayaprakash Narayan, Rahul Gandhi has addressed the needs, concerns and the future of the youth of the country, Prakash said yesterday.         
	Party leaders found the comparison odious and said it revealed the new spokespersons flawed understanding of both JP and Rahul, which would make his continuance in the media department untenable. The extent of unease was reflected in the cancellation of todays scheduled briefing.         
	We obviously would like this controversy to die down soon. We dont want to answer questions on this topic at a time when we are fighting Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad  both products of the JP movement  in the Bihar elections, a leader said.         
	Prakash, a senior leader from Rajasthan, had crossed over to the Congress from the Janata Dal that counts JP among its icons.         
	The Congress line is that the JP movement encouraged anarchic tendencies in the country and created a situation when normal governance had become difficult, compelling Indira Gandhi to resort to extraordinary measures, including Emergency.         
	A party leader said today: JPs agenda for the youth was not constructive. How can we compare Rahuls work with his? Rahul is trying to create awareness among the youth and prompting them to realise their hidden potential.         
	Prakash was being propped up by media department chairperson Janardan Dwivedi to replace Singhvi as a full-fledged spokesperson. His name was on the list of spokespersons for a long time. Now that he has started off with a gaffe like this, it will be difficult for Dwivedi to protect him. The AICC shuffle is round the corner.         
	Prakash tried to explain his position today. My intention was not to compare any individual with somebody else. Rahul Gandhi is addressing the aspirations of youths and urging them to increase their social and political participation and the attraction of the youth towards him is on the rise. The interest of youths in politics has increased because of his efforts and no other politician in this age is doing this at this time, he said.         
	Prakash said the media did not present his remark in the right context.

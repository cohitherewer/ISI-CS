          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Dec. 4: A schoolboy had a narrow escape today when stone-throwing protesters torched a private school bus to enforce a shutdown in Srinagar.         
	Atif Saleem, 6, was the lone student on the bus when the protesters set it on fire after forcing the driver and conductor to get off.         
	Muzaffar Ahmad, the driver, said he risked his life to save the boy. I rushed inside the bus and jumped out, taking him in my lap, Ahmad said, adding he could not retrieve the childs bag.         
	The call for shutdown by Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani evoked little response, an indicator that the separatists sway is waning fast.         
	For five months beginning June 11, the protest calendars of separatists were followed in letter and spirit but hartal fatigue appears to have set in now and the response to shutdown calls has been generally poor for the past one month.         
	The Srinagar North superintendent of police, Showkat Hussain, said the protesters did not allow the student to get off and it was the driver who saved him.         
	We are on the job to identify the people responsible for the incident and already have some clues, he said.         
	The bus burning took place on a day an 11-member delegation of parliamentarians and civil society members met moderate Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umer Farooq at his residence.         
	The incident sparked panic and several schools that had ignored the shutdown call quickly closed down.

	New Delhi, Feb. 1 (PTI): Delhi High Court today extended till April 19 the stay on conducting a narco-analysis test on arrested Maoist leader Khobad Ghandy.        
	The court extended the stay in view of a case pending before the Supreme Court on the legal validity of the narco test. Ghandy had filed a petition saying he could not be forced to undergo the test until the apex court said it was valid.

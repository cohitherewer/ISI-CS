	Chandigarh, Aug. 18 (PTI): A teenaged NRI girl racing her car against another rammed a motorcycle here last night and fled, leaving the two-wheelers young rider and his five-year-old cousin to die of their injuries, police said.        
	Amanat Brar, 19, who studies in the US and whose parents are based in Dubai, gave herself up this evening after the media highlighted the accident which happened near the residences of the Punjab and Haryana chief ministers.        
	Booked on the bailable charges of rash driving and causing death by negligence, she was arrested and later released after a medical examination to ascertain if she had been drunk at the wheel.        
	Officers said Amanats uncle, B.S. Brar, was an army colonel posted in Ranchi and that she was probably driving the Honda Accord of another relative, a retired lieutenant colonel. She had arrived from the US a week ago.        
	Her family denied she had taken the morning flight to Dubai, where her father runs his own business, and flown back to India following publicity of the accident.        
	Officers said Amanat, also known as Sukhmani, was in the Accord with friends and was racing a Maruti Swift, whose occupants she may have known. She apparently lost control in the Sector 3 VIP zone and hit the motorbike.        
	Harpreet, the child victim, died on the spot and Sukhwinder, a 21-year-old engineering student, in hospital. The girls allegedly fled in the Swift, leaving the Accord behind.        
	Eyewitnesses have told the police the impact threw Harpreet several metres up into the air, the officers said. Both victims were residents of Kansal village near Chandigarh.        
	A sobbing Ravinder Singh, Sukhwinders father, said the accused must not be shown leniency because she had left his son and the child, both bleeding heavily, to die and fled.        
	Harpreets father Dalbir said his son would have celebrated his sixth birthday on August 25. He said the accused should not have been released on bail.        
	The teenager reached Sector 3 police station with two relatives this evening and surrendered. Asked why the police had charged the girl only under bailable sections, deputy superintendent of police Jagbir Singh said: We have followed the law and done nothing beyond that.        
	Amanat had done her Plus II from Vivek High School in Sector 38 here. His uncle, Col Brar, said: We are feeling sorry for whatever has happened. We are with the families (of the victims) in this hour of grief. Whatever they say I am ready to do.

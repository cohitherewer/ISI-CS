The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | New course focus on labs
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      New course focus on labs
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: The common science curriculum that all schools cutting across boards are likely to adopt from next year for Classes XI and XII will increase the focus on practical learning instead of theoretical knowledge.        
	The boards have agreed to increase the practical component of science learning in high school in the new common syllabus and curriculum, an official of the Council of Boards for Secondary Education (COBSE) said on Thursday.        
	There was a consensus that we need to increase the component of practical learning in science in Classes XI and XII under the new syllabus and curriculum, D.V. Sharma, the general secretary of the COBSE, told The Telegraph.        
	The COBSE, the apex co-ordination agency of Indias over 30 secondary education boards, and decided on Tuesday on a common syllabus  teaching content  and curriculum  teaching focus  in science and math.        
	Both the central boards  the Central Board of Secondary Education and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations  and all state boards are members of the COBSE.        
	The decision to increase the practical learning component of science education comes amid concerns that the traditional focus on textbooks may be dulling the ability of students to apply what they learn.        
	At the Tuesday meeting, different boards from diverse parts of the country repeated a request for an increased focus on testing a students practical understanding of the sciences, sources said.        
	Vineet Joshi, acting chairman of the CBSE, Indias largest board, recommended increasing the weightage of practical marks in the total score of students in school-leaving examinations.         
	In the Class XII qualifying examination at present, 70 per cent of science marks come from a theory test while the practical component of the test contributes a maximum 30 per cent. Joshi suggested changing the theory to practical ratio to 60:40, Sharma said.        
	While it is not necessary that all boards will accept the CBSE proposal, it will be seriously considered and debated, he said.        
	But the increase in the practical component of learning science in Classes XI and XII will not be reflected only in the marking mechanism, Sharma said.        
	Under the common curriculum, science teachers will be required to practically demonstrate, through classroom activities, what they teach.        
	Many boards suggested raising the standards of the experiments students are currently required to perform in science laboratories.         
	But schools in different parts of the country enjoy different laboratory infrastructure, a key reason the COBSE wants to stress on classroom activities as well, Sharma said.        
	Where good laboratories are available, we want schools to increase the component of experiments in their teaching. But classroom activities are essential to cover for the several schools which dont even have a laboratory, he said.

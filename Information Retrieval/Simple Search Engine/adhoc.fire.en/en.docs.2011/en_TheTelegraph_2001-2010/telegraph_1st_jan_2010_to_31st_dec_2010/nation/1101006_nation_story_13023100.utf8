The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Priests clash at Puri temple
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Priests clash at Puri temple
          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 5: Two groups of priests clashed over donation sharing in the sanctum sanctorum of Puris Jagannath temple today, leaving one person with a bloody nose.        
	Although fights between priests over donations are not unheard of, this is the first time such a scuffle has taken place in the shrines holiest zone, Lamidhar Puja Panda, a temple public relations officer (PRO) said.         
	The PRO, however, said it was a fight between two priests of two groups, and not the groups themselves.        
	Witnesses said the incident happened during the 10am rush hour when the temple was open to the public. An altercation between priests of the Puspalak and the Mekap groups suddenly turned violent, with some coming to blows.        
	A priest, Sankhamitra Puspalak, sustained injuries in the nose and face. I was attacked because I protested Mekap group priests overcrowding the sanctum sanctorum, he said.        
	Temple rituals were delayed because blood from Sankhamitras nose dripped on to the pedestal on which the deities are installed, officials said.

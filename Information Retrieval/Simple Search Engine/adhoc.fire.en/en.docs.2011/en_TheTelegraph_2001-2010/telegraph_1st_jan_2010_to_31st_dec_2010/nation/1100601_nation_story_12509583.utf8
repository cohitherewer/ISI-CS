	New Delhi, May 31 (PTI): Delhi High Court today told the Centre to form a committee of technical and medical experts to examine potential health hazards from mobile phone towers, saying the issue was more important than monetary considerations.         
	The court order said whether radio waves pose any serious health threat or not, and what precautions are required to be taken so that there are minimal chances of causing any threat to the health of the public at large appear to be still at the investigation stage. Also, various studies and researches in different countries are in progress but no final consensus has emerged as yet.         
	 This court is of the view that the telecommunication secretary and the MCD commissioner shall constitute a broad-based committee of technical and medical experts who can examine all these various studies and the technology and policy adopted by the developed countries in regulating the installation of cellular towers and antennas, Justice Kailash Gambhir said.        
	The court directed the telecom secretary and the MCD to convene a meeting of the committee within two weeks and submit the report of the panel within three months.        
	In an interim, the court allowed the cellular companies to operate their towers after depositing Rs 2 lakh instead of Rs 5 lakh as a fixed deposit with the Registrar General of the Delhi High Court for six months.        
	The court said the ministry of telecommunications, which is not a party before it, should be forced to resolve the issue effectively.         
	The MCD (Municipal Corporation of Delhi) had on February 9 raised the fees for erecting cellphone towers from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.        
	The civic authority started sealing the towers of service providers after the deadline to pay the hiked amount expired.        
	But on May 13, the high court restrained the MCD from sealing the cellphone towers after the cellular operators challenged the decision of the MCD.        
	During the arguments, the Centre and the MCD had said that the latest policy has taken due care of the health and public safety; and the citizens would not be exposed to harmful radiation emitted from the towers.         
	The MCD has been directed by the court to recognise structural safety certificate given by a qualified engineer from one of the five institutions--IIT, Delhi; Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee; Rail India Technical and Economic Services Ltd, Delhi; National Council for Building Material, Faridabad and IIT, Roorkee.

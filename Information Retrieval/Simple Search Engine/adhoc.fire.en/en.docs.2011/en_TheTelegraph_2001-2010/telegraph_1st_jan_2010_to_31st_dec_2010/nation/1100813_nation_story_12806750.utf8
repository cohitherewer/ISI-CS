          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, Aug. 12: Gujarat High Court today transferred the Ishrat Jahan encounter case to the Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team (SIT), which is probing the 2002 riot cases.         
	The court rejected the demand for a CBI inquiry and ordered the transfer of the case to the SIT headed by former CBI director R.K. Raghvan. The SIT will submit its report in three months.         
	In 2004, Mumbai girl Ishrat, 19, and three others were gunned down by Gujarat police, who claimed they were Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives on a mission to kill chief minister Narendra Modi. A division bench of Justices Jayant Patel and Abhilasha Kumari observed that there is no record to establish that the encounter was with malafide intentions and, therefore, the plea for a CBI inquiry by Ishrats mother was not granted .

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Jan. 11: Patna-based Central Potato Research Institute (CPRI) has developed three varieties of potato as a New Year gift for farmers and potato consumers who were hit by the rise in the price of the commodity last year.        
	The CPRI scientists have named the new varieties as kufary suya, pushkar and khyati. These offer better productivity and will be richer in protein and iron. They will have the average level of sugar.        
	The principal scientist of CPRI, R.P. Rai, said: Kufary surya, pushkar and khyati will also be better than the average varieties for preparing French fries and chips for they will have less water content.        
	These three varieties, according to Rai, could be harvested in 90 days from the sowing against 100 to 110 days that the average varieties take. The crops will be sown in the last week of September or the first week of October.        
	The soils of Bihar, Bengal, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have been found fit for producing the new varieties.         
	The invention of the new varieties will add to the prosperity of the farmers in these states, said a senior scientist.        
	Potato is produced in all 38 districts of Bihar. The state produces potato on its 3 lakh hectare of farmlands, according to sources in the agriculture department. CPRI scientists said that farmers from Bihar, Bengal, eastern UP, MP and Chhattisgarh would be supplied with the new variety of seeds this September.        
	The seeds of new varieties, scientists clarified, would first be made available to the agriculture departments of the state governments concerned which subsequently would supply them to the farmers for sowing and production.        
	The extremely high price of potato in October and November last year became a big issue in Bihar with Lalu Prasads RJD coining the slogan Lalu ko bulao, sasta aalu khao (Bring Lalu to power, get potato at cheap rate).         
	Potatoes were available at Rs 25 to Rs 27 per kilogram in Bihar markets in October and November. The price has now come down to Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kilogram, much to the relief of consumers. The scientists said that the new varieties would help augment the production, raising the availability and bring down the prices.

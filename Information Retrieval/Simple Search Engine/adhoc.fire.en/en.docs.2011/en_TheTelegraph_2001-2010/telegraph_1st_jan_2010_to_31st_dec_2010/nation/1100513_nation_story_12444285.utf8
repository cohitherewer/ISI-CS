The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pandits warm to govt job offer
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pandits warm to govt job offer
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, May 12: If their response is any indication, it could soon be paradise regained for Kashmirs migrant Pandits.        
	The displaced community, reluctant to go back to their homeland since the rise of militancy in the eighties triggered an exodus, has shown the first sign of wanting to return, thanks to a special recruitment package for migrant youths.        
	Government sources said thousands had applied for the 3,000 jobs on offer.        
	In the past, too, the government had come up with packages to draw the Pandits back, but the community chose not to return, once even backing out after initially showing interest.        
	The latest package involves 3,000 government posts the Omar Abdullah regime recently created for Pandit youths. Another 3,000 will follow. But there is a condition: only those willing to live in Kashmir permanently will be hired.         
	An official involved with the recruitment process said thousands of Pandits who left the Valley in the 1990s continued to draw their government salary and other benefits in Jammu without going to work. Now the government has made it compulsory for the fresh recruits to work in Kashmir under this drive.        
	A young migrant, who has applied for a job under the latest package, said it was high time the Pandits returned to Kashmir. We have been living in Jammu for the past 20 years in the hope that one day we will be back in our paradise, said Jammu resident Ajay Raina. I think the time has come. I have applied for the post of a teacher and am optimistic I will land the job.        
	Raina said many Pandits might never return. But a lot of us do want to go back. We expect the majority community to help us realise our dream.        
	Jammu and Kashmir Service Selection Board secretary G.S. Chib said the response to the recruitment drive had been excellent.        
	The government has referred 2,184 of these 3,000 posts to our agency. More than 12,000 have applied and we are in the process of making the appointments. The remaining posts will be filled by other recruiting agencies. We had set up collection centres at Jammu, Srinagar and Delhi, and the response was excellent at every centre.        
	Kashmir relief commissioner Vinod Kaul said 34,202 Pandit families  or 1.4 lakh Pandits  were registered with his department in Jammu. Some 20,000 more families live in Delhi and other states.        
	The response to the job package has been great. The recruits will be provided adequate security and once they go with their families, it will automatically boost the confidence of others, he said.         
	Earlier, too, the government had announced measures to woo the Pandits back, but most fell short of expectations.        
	In April 2008, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had announced a special package of Rs 1,618 crore, including a one-time assistance of Rs 7.5 lakh for every family to build or buy a home.         
	Kaul said 4,400 families volunteered to return but none finally did. They had to form co-operative societies to build colonies but no such society was formed.         
	Official sources said the 2008 Amarnath land protests played spoilsport, forcing these Pandit families to put off their planned return.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | No asylum for Gandhian from US
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      No asylum for Gandhian from US
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 13: The government has refused to grant political asylum to an American who burnt his US citizenship papers at Rajghat to protest his countrys war-centric policies and has asked him to apply for Indian citizenship instead.         
	Jeff Knaebel, 72, moved to India in 1995 and has been residing in Shimla ever since and working to propagate the Gandhian principles of non-violence and peace.         
	He wrote to the National Human Rights Commission and the Prime Ministers Office to draw their attention to his alleged harassment in the hands of police while he travelled to Kinnaur district in Himachal Pradesh.         
	He then sought the Supreme Courts intervention to seek political asylum in the country.         
	The court then asked the government to sympathetically consider his plea. However, attorney-general G.E. Vahanvati, appearing for the government yesterday, said Knaebel was not entitled to political asylum.         
	Asylum cannot be granted in a case where a person has voluntarily given up citizenship of another country, Vahanvati said. He instead suggested that Knaebel should apply for Indian citizenship if he wanted to stay on in the country.         
	A two-judge bench of Justices P. Sathasivam and Anil R. Dave then granted him two weeks to apply for citizenship.         
	The court also directed the government to dispose of his application as early as possible.         
	Till then, Knaebel was asked to stay put in Himachal Pradesh and obey the laws of the country. Knabel had pleaded for asylum on the ground that constant harassment by the police was interfering with his work.         
	He claimed that he had renounced his family and business in his idealistic quest to create a violence-free, peaceful world.         
	He said that though he was born in the US, he had decided to shun the materialistic, war-mongering policies of that country.         
	He had instead decided to adopt the peace-loving ways of Gandhi and his country India. Knaebel, an engineer, has commanded a US navy unit in the Vietnam War. I may say that I have seen war too closely, his emotional petition to the apex court said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 12: Students of a fake institute that was opened on the IIT Kharagpur campus have produced an identity card with the premier engineering colleges emblem, raising questions about the involvement of a former deputy registrar.        
	Officiating registrar T.K. Ghosal had issued the identity card in 2006 with the IIT Kharagpur emblem to J.K. Tiwary, who was running the Institution of Electrical Engineering (IEE), the fake institute.         
	A.K. Ghosh, the head of the aeronautical engineering department in IIT Kharagpur, was the president of the fake institute till 2008.         
	A former professor in the electrical engineering department, J.C. Biswas, was the vice-president of the IEE. From 2003 to 2007, the fake tech college was run from his quarters on the campus.         
	The ID card was issued in 2006 to Tiwary, who had nothing to do with the IIT, by Ghosal who was the deputy registrar then.         
	The card mentions Tiwarys name and carries the emblem of IIT Kharagpur on top and identifies him as the director of the IEE.         
	We have requested the vigilance wing of the ministry that all the IIT officials and faculty whose association with the fake institute has come to the surface should be investigated. They should be asked to go on leave so that they do not influence investigation, an IEE student said.         
	Ghosal, who has not been arrested yet, has admitted that he had issued the ID card but said the IEE was considered a genuine institution.        
	Nobody knew that the IEE was a fake institute at that time. I had issued the identity card to Tiwary so that he could come inside the IIT campus to discharge his duties at the IEE, he said.         
	The IEE did not have the approval from the All India Council of Technical Education to offer any diploma course.         
	Ghosal recently filed an FIR against Ghosh and some others allegedly involved in the case.         
	The matter of granting an IIT ID card did not figure in the FIR.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plan to yank league out of tax shelter
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Plan to yank league out of tax shelter
          JAYANTO ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, April 22: The taxman is planning to crack down on the Indian Premier League  yanking it out of the tax shelter it has enjoyed till now through its links with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	Amid all the controversy that has enveloped the money-making sporting event, the revenue department has finally come round to the view that the IPL is a commercial venture huddling under the umbrella of the BCCI.         
	The BCCI has traditionally enjoyed a tax-free status extended to charitable organisations  a tax break claimed on the ground that it promotes sports in the country. The IPL has enjoyed the same tax benefits because it doesnt have the formal status of an entity, preferring to operate as a sub-committee of the parent body.         
	The BCCI itself appears to have realised that the IPL needs to be given a formal independent status, if only to limit the liabilities that will pass on directly to the parent.         
	The revenue department doesnt plan to wait for such a formal separation. Officials say the IPL could soon be slapped with a hefty tax demand of Rs 300 crore that will cover current earnings and those in the past two seasons. Officials estimate IPL income at Rs 1,200 crore this year.         
	Tax officials in Mumbai investigating the BCCIs finances believe that the IPL has earned more than Rs 650 crore from its broadcasting deal with Sony-World Sports Group, another Rs 330 crore from franchisee fees and about Rs 170 crore from the IPLs share of sponsorship.         
	The franchisee fees include team sponsors payouts, money from merchandise, programme tie-ups and in-stadia advertisement. Profits from the IPL could be around Rs 500 crore, taxmen say.         
	Officials say the papers with them prove that the IPL was being run as a commercial operation and it can no longer be allowed to huddle under the tax shelter provided to the BCCI.         
	Officials say that until the IPL is given the status of a legal entity, the parent body will have to shoulder the tax burden of staging the lucrative sporting event.         
	Our surveys show that most of the teams are earning huge amounts and the profitability is increasing at a rate of 20 to 30 per cent. Rajasthan Royals is seen as the most profitable team, said one official. This, of course, has to do with the fact that the team paid the lowest franchise fee to the IPL.         
	Surprisingly, Mumbai Indians is seen as the least profitable team, but it should also earn a profit of nearly Rs 20 crore this season, officials said.         
	The BCCI recently sought renewal of a tax exemption given earlier to the IPL. This was withdrawn last year since the league was played in South Africa.         
	Sources said the revenue department had also sought over Rs 118 crore in back taxes for 2006-07. This tax demand is for the period before the IPL started.

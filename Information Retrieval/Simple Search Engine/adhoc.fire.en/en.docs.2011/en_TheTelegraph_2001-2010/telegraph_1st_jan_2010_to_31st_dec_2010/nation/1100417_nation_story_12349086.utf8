The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tax tentacles spread, reach Kings XI
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tax tentacles spread, reach Kings XI
  - Investigators visit offices of two IPL franchises where Lalit Modis relatives hold stakes         OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                                                Yuvraj Singh of Kings XI Punjab at a match in Mohali. (File picture)      
	April 16: Tax officials today expanded their cross-country probe into the IPL bidding process and funding source by bringing under the scanner Kings XI Punjab.        
	After night-long operations at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) headquarters and the offices of IPL chief Lalit Modi in Mumbai, investigators swooped down this evening on the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) hub in Mohali, which also houses Kings XI.        
	We are conducting a survey operation to look into and verify the IPL accounts which are suspected to be maintained here, said Pawan Parmar, income tax director (investigation), Panchkula.        
	PCA sources said sleuths from the Enforcement Directorate were also part of the 10-member team that was scrutinising the books, especially those relating to the Kings XI owners.        
	We are conducting an inquiry into anything connected with Kings XI Punjab and the IPL, a tax officer said.         
	The tax team arrived at the Mohali stadium around 6.20pm, catching the authorities unawares.         
	The Kings XI office has shifted lock, stock and barrel to Dharamshala where the team will be playing their last two matches. We do not know why they have come here, a PCA official said.        
	The search could be another blow to IPL chairman Modi, who is a vice-president of the Punjab association and is a member of its finance and marketing committees.         
	Modis relatives hold stakes in both the Mohali and Jaipur franchises. Modis step son-in-law Gaurav Burman and Gauravs brother Mohit  scions of the Dabur group  are among the stakeholders in Kings XI. The IPL chiefs brother-in-law Suresh Chellaram has the majority stake in Rajasthan Royals.        
	Modi, who flew to Dharamshala with the BCCI brass for the inauguration of a stadium ahead of an IPL match, sought to play down the tax probe.         
	We (the IPL) are a transparent body and we have nothing to hide, said Modi, who, after receiving backing from Union minister Sharad Pawar yesterday, got support from Farooq Abdullah today.         
	Modi, who confidently maintained he would continue to remain the IPL boss, stepped up his attack on Shashi Tharoor, saying the junior foreign minister had a hidden agenda of taking the Kochi franchise to Abu Dhabi.         
	This morning, I learnt from a colleague of mine that Mr Tharoor has told them he would like their support to move the team out to Abu Dhabi. I dont know which way they are going. The theme is to play in India, We will not allow any team to play outside India, he said.        
	Modi said the IPL would stay in India. We have a robust league and we will continue doing a good job irrespective of hidden agendas. We will not allow Mr Tharoor to try and shadow this up. Tharoor has a different agenda and it will be shut down, believe me, he said.        
	The probe extended to the south as well with tax officials in Bangalore recording the statement of Kerala industrialist Vivek Venugopal on his stake in the Kochi IPL consortium. Venugopal, who operates out of his office and residence at Harrison Road in Bangalore, is the lone investor from Kerala in the franchise.         
	There were also unconfirmed reports that a tax team had paid a visit to the Rajasthan Royals office, but it was not clear where.         
	Modi was himself questioned for over eight hours in the dead of night by tax officials in Mumbai, though he later claimed the actual quizzing lasted only 15-20 minutes. Tax sources said Modi could be called again for further questioning.        
	The sources said that during the operation in Mumbai  from 7.15pm yesterday to 3.20am today  they took copies of the bidding documents of all franchises, including the Kochi consortium.        
	Amid the grim operations surrounding cricket, the tax officials in Mohali got an unusual request.         
	Satirist Jaspal Bhatti, who had come with his family for dinner at the PCAs restaurant when the search occurred, said: Everything related to IPL is being revealed on Twitter. I request the income tax authorities to put everything they find on Twitter as well.

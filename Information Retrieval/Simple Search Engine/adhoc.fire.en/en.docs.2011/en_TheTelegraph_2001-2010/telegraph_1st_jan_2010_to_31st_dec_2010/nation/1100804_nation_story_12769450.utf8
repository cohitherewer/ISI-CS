The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trinamuls positive rap
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Trinamuls positive rap
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                         Sudip Bandopadhyay    
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: The Trinamul Congress today made its position clear on price rise but underlined that while it might speak like the Opposition on some issues, it wouldnt rock the UPA government.        
	As the second largest party of the UPA, we are firmly behind the government. There is not an iota of doubt about this, Trinamul chief whip Sudip Bandopadhyay said while participating in the debate on inflation in the Lok Sabha.         
	Sudip was responding to a remark by Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav that given its stand on price rise, Trinamul could be identified with both the Opposition and the government.         
	The Dal (U) leaders comment was prompted by Trinamuls notice for a discussion on price rise. The notice said the government had increased prices of petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG recently. This will affect the rate of inflation and put additional hardship on the common man.        
	Sudip said his party had given such a notice because their leader Mamata Banerjee had a habit of calling a spade a spade. He said the poor were fighting with hunger. He added that Mamata had put in a note of dissent and had asked the government to reconsider its decision to hike fuel prices.         
	The Trinamul leader went on to remind the government that it should keep its social obligations in mind but stopped at that and didnt say what his party would do if the government flouted it.         
	Sudip then suggested measures to contain price rise. Our positive suggestion is that the public distribution system is to be made more active and all the essential commodities, rice, wheat, atta, dal, tea, milk, sugar, oil, potato, onion and all sorts of vegetables and salt be sold to the BPL category people, Sudip said as Left leaders were seen trying to suppress smiles.        
	Sources said the positive suggestion was part of Mamatas effort to break out of the street fighter image and present herself as a mature leader ahead of the Bengal polls next year.         
	Mamata was not present in the House. She was scheduled to reach Delhi this evening and be in the Lok Sabha tomorrow morning when questions relating to the railways would be asked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shashi to Shastri, Cong needs a tweet
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shashi to Shastri, Cong needs a tweet

	New Delhi, June 28: After Shashi Tharoor, another senior Congress leader found himself entangled in the Twitter web.        
	Anil Shastri, late Prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastris son, today used the social networking site to dub the Congress-led governments hike in the prices of kerosene and LPG disastrous for the common man. He also appealed to Sonia Gandhi to immediately intervene and see if there could be a rollback.        
	But Shastri, a special invitee to the Congress Working Committee (CWC) and editor of party mouthpiece Congress Sandesh, was struggling for words after he made the entry on the popular site.         
	In public, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari reacted cautiously, saying as a senior leader of the party, Shastris views were acknowledged. However, behind the scenes, there was clamour from some sections to discipline Shastri for defying a recent party directive that forbids leaders from speaking out of turn.        
	Shastri insisted his criticism was not against the party line. Has the party welcomed the hike? he asked, minutes after Tiwari was seen justifying the increase at his regular media briefing at 24 Akbar Road, the Congress headquarters.        
	But sensing trouble, Shastri later appeared to go on the defensive, saying his tweet should be seen only as an appeal to Sonia.        
	Twitter has proved troublesome for the Congress after Tharoors posts kicked up rows. One leader had dubbed the site a Swiss army knife of awesomeness.         
	Tharoor, the Thiruvananthapuram MP, had to step down as junior foreign minister following a spat that began on Twitter with ousted IPL czar Lalit Modi over the Kochi franchise.        
	Shastri may have spoken out of turn but a section of Congress leaders feels they do not have a forum to air constructive dissent. The CWC, the partys highest decision-making body, has not met to discuss price rise since its last sitting on the issue on February 5.        
	The AICC session, too, should be held twice or at least once a year under the Congress constitution, but the last time 1,300-odd delegates had gathered was in November 2007. By contrast, the BJP holds its national executive and council meetings regularly.         
	In the absence of an appropriate forum to express views on key issues, Telangana and caste-based census, party leaders have resorted to tweets.         
	While Sonia, Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi are known to be patient listeners, middle-rung leaders such as Shastri do not get frequent appointments.

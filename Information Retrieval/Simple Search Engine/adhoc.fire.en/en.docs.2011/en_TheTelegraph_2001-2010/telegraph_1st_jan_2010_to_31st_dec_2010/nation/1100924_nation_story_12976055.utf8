          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Sept. 23: The Supreme Court stay on the Ayodhya verdict has dismayed the Sunni Central Wakf Board, which plans to tell the apex court that it wants a court judgment rather than another round of mediation.        
	We honour the Supreme Court verdict, but we dont want mediation any more. We have gone with that process for far too long without success, said the wakf boards lawyer, Zafaryab Jilani, who is also the convener of the Babri Masjid Action Committee. Now we want to go to the Supreme Court on September 28 to tell it that we want a verdict.        
	The wakf board is one of the parties in the title suits on which the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court was to deliver its verdict tomorrow. The Supreme Court has issued notices to all these parties to be present on September 28 when it hears the petition seeking a deferment of the high court verdict and a resumption of efforts at a negotiated settlement.        
	When the news of the apex court decision broke, wakf board members reacted with a sense of disbelief. We were not prepared for this. But we have waited a long time and will not be impatient now. Well wait another week, Jilani said.

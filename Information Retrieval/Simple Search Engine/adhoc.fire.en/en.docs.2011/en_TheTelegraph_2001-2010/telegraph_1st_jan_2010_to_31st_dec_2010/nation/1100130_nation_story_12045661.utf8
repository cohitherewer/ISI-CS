	Srinagar, Jan. 29: Muslims in a Srinagar locality today formally handed over a temple to Kashmiri Pandits after ridding it of squatters from their own community.        
	The centuries-old Puran Raj Bhairav temple in Sazgaripora was reopened after its hand-over to the Kashmir Pandit Sangharsh Samiti, which represents Pandits who have not left the Valley.        
	The gesture was made possible by days of heroics from Sazgaripora residents, all of whom are Muslims.        
	Some people had come to the temple with claims that they had bought it from a Hindu trust that was the shrines caretaker in the pre-militancy days. They even showed us some documents, said Asif Gani Sofi, 28, who led the drive against the encroachment.        
	This didnt satisfy us. We approached neighbourhood elders and all of us decided to resist them.        
	The residents said the squatters looked determined and dropped some timber and other material at the site.        
	We then approached the district administration, which directed the police to clear the temple of the encroachment. All the men from my locality supported the police. By returning the temple to those it belongs to, I think I have fulfilled my religious obligation, Sofi said.        
	Samiti president Sanjay Tickoo said todays event was historic. It displays the unbreakable bond between the two communities. This event will surely boost the morale of our men and set an example for others, he added.        
	Tickoo said the Muslim residents had approached his organisation with a request to take control of the temple. After consultation with the local Muslims, we decided to formally throw it open today.        
	The temples gates, though, had never been closed. After the Pandits began leaving the Valley, local boys would sit and play on its lawns and sometimes taste the sweet water of the spring inside.        
	This temple is as old as Kashmir but it is unlike others. Bhairav is another name for Lord Shiva, and such temples have no idols or structures, Tickoo said.        
	Inside the complex there is a mulberry tree that is venerated and worshipped by Pandits. There is also a sacred spring surrounded by a circular plinth platform where devotees would sit for prayers.        
	After Shivratri, we plan to clean the spring to restore its pristine glory. In the meantime, we have asked the local Muslims to take care of it and ensure nobody dumps garbage inside the complex, Tickoo said.        
	Sazgaripora residents said there was no Pandit in their locality who could have been entrusted with the job of the temples upkeep.        
	Even before militancy, there was no Pandit family living here. But I remember the shrine was thronged by Pandits from other localities, said Mohammad Aslam.        
	A few days ago, the Pandits had reopened the ancient Sheetleshwar Bhairav temple at Habba Kadal in Srinagars old city.        
	The Samiti has reopened 24 temples in the past 10 years and plans to reopen another 60 this year. According to a Samiti survey, Kashmir had 583 temples before the onset of militancy in 1990, of which 532 have been damaged in militancy-related incidents.

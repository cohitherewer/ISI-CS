  - Flash floods sink Rajasthan districts, parties fight mobile war        RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                          People stranded at a temple near Jaipur after a heavy downpour had triggered flash floods. (PTI)                                        
	Jaipur, Aug. 9: Desert Rajasthan is under water, with the three districts of Jaisalmer, Barmer and Jalore recording abnormal rainfall this year, but political parties are fighting an SMS war.         
	Twenty-four villages around Pokhran, Indias nuclear test site in the middle of Thar desert in Jaisalmer district, are 3-4 feet under water and more than 100 kachcha houses have been washed away.         
	Jaisalmer resident V. Bhatia said there was three hours of uninterrupted rain in Pokhran on Thursday. It had received 458mm rainfall till yesterday, surpassing the previous high of 421mm recorded in 2008.        
	Surrounded by rocky, sandy and salt ranges, Pokhran  the name means the place of five mirages gets as hot as 50 degrees Celsius in the summer.        
	Rajasthan water resources department figures say abnormal rainfall  60 per cent above normal  has been recorded in Barmer, Jaisalmer and Jalore. Excess rainfall  20-59 per cent above normal  has been seen in Bikaner, Churu, Hanumangrah and Sikar.        
	The total rainfall recorded from June 1 to July 31 this year in Barmer is 205.44 mm, 96 per cent above the normal 104.90 mm, in Jaisalmer it is 179.30, a deviation of 151 per cent, and in Jalore it is 327.08 mm, a deviation of 69 per cent.        
	Jaisalmer district collector R.N. Meena said the water does not drain easily because the area is sandy and rocky, causing the district to get flooded.        
	In June, Cyclone Phet inundated Lathi village near Pokhran, which is 110km from Jaisalmer city. Three hundred villagers had to be evacuated and 70 houses were washed away.        
	Thar desert, which gets sunshine for 320 days a year on average, has suddenly been seeing heavy rains and flash floods since 2006. An uninterrupted weeklong downpour in August 2006 in Barmer caused flash floods, the worst in at least a century, which rendered over a million people homeless.        
	The floods created at least three large lakes, each covering 7-8sqkm, in Kawas, Malwa and Uttarlai villages in Barmer. Experts involved in conservation and water harvesting estimate that there are more than 20 new water bodies in the Barmer-Jodhpur region. Several water channels or natural drains have also shown up. All this water will change not only the look of the desert region but also its ecology, they say.        
	However, Rajasthan Met department director S.S. Singh said: There is nothing unusual in heavy rains in the Thar desert. Rainfall has been increasing in the desert since 1973, though marginally.         
	Given the weather pattern  there are fewer rain spells now, but the intensity is higher  there could be floods in Indias desert state every third or fourth year, experts said. Floods are worse in the desert because the water mixes with the sand and becomes saline and, therefore, unfit to drink.        
	But for now, chief minister Ashok Gehlot is a happy man. Taunted as akaal purush by the BJP after his last tenure from 1998 to 2003 saw consecutive droughts, good rainfall across the state for the past 10 days has finally given him the opportunity to hit back.         
	The start of this season had appeared to follow his earlier dry years. Then when Gehlot was visiting the US from June 29 to July 10, it rained in Rajasthan. The BJP started an SMS campaign saying that as soon as the chief minister left the state, rains arrived. By the time he was back, the rains had stopped. Then Gehlot left for Mumbai on July 14 and it rained on July 15. The BJP was back text-messaging: Isnt it amazing?        
	Silent all these days, Gehlot has now found his voice. Wherever I go, it rains, the chief minister said at a public event in Jaipur on a recent rainy day. On Thursday, at another event, he asked the BJP to stop taunting him and start thinking about how the poor suffer because of rain failure.        
	The SMS campaign is still on, but this time it is Gehlots Congress that is sending the text messages.        
	After former chief minister Vasundhara Raje was made the BJPs Haryana in-charge, the Congress is messaging: During Rajes tenure, the liquor trade flourished, the land scams surfaced, the police firing on innocent people increased. But by Gods grace, Raje has now been handed Haryana Now that Raje is in Europe, rains have splashed across the state and public feel relieved to say Vasu goodbye.

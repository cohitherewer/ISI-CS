The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bose breathes steam

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Biman Bose                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 24: Persistent interruptions by MPs from other states may have kept the arc lights firmly focused on Mamata Banerjees Bengal bias in the railway budget but the state CPM could not afford to admit that it had taken note of what the rest of India was talking about.        
	CPM state secretary and Left Front chairman Biman Bose dipped into a quiver of familiar words ranging from absurd to gimmicks to describe the railway budget, evidently worried about Mamatas drive to harvest political mileage out of her plethora of promises in the budget.         
	Several crucial civic polls in Bengal are a few months away, to be followed by the Assembly contest in a year.        
	Its a politically motivated budget full of absurd, unrealisable gimmicks to hoodwink and mislead the common people. People may get swayed by the high-decibel propaganda over new trains and projects, but I cant welcome the railway budget, considering it in its entirety, Bose said, while grudgingly appreciating fare relief to cancer patients and other concessions to women and minorities.         
	What if passenger fares have not been hiked and train services will be increased? What about commuters security and safety, which have been compromised repeatedly as well as the quality of the catering-service in long-distance trains? Bose asked.        
	Although the CPM-led state government has welcomed the private sector under the public-private partnership model to build bridges, hospitals and shopping malls, Bose accused Mamata of selling off the railways to corporate groups in the name of building auto hubs, multi-storied parking lots, cold storage units and hospitals.        
	In the name of investor-friendly policies, she is moving towards the privatisation of the railways while denying it, Bose said, almost echoing Mamatas complaints against the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government during the Singur and Nandigram protests.         
	But Boses real grudge appeared to hinge on an alleged attempt by Mamata to sideline the Bhattacharjee government and corner credit for the rail development in Bengal. In the case of other states, she said the state government would be consulted on implementing projects on railway land. But in the case of Bengal, she said she had taken (or would take) the decision. What does it signify?         
	Bose took a swipe at that railways diversification into non-core areas. Having such a muti-faceted railway minister who can take care of jobs ranging from sports to education, Manmohan Singh should now wind up some other ministries. But it is an ominous sign, the CPM leader said.         
	Bose lost his cool when it was pointed out that the railways had always absorbed sportspersons. I know more than the younger journalists about the history of the railway services. But how can a minister who was born yesterday claim personal credit for providing jobs and facilities? he thundered and left the media conference in a huff.

          JOY SENGUPTA                          Voters line up outside a booth in Bodhgaya on the final day of the Bihar Assembly elections on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	Londa (Imamganj), Nov. 20: An attempt to defuse a 5kg cylinder bomb on the last day of elections in Bihar went horribly wrong when the device blew up, killing the bomb squad chief and a home guard.         
	The bomb had been planted by suspected Maoists.        
	This is the second time this month that such an attempt has misfired, raising questions about the expertise of such squads in the state.         
	Around 52 per cent voters went to the booths today.        
	On November 8, a pressure bomb exploded while being defused at Banke Bazar, just 30km from the site of todays incident, killing two personnel of the Bihar Military Police (BMP).         
	Anil Singh, the squad chief, belonged to the same BMP battalion. The identity of the home guard is yet to be established.        
	Another squad member, Ram Vriksha Singh, was wounded in the explosion that occurred around 2.15pm, as were three journalists. They were airlifted to Gaya for treatment.        
	The explosive device was planted under a culvert between the villages of Londa and Beninagar, which fall in the Maoist-dominated Imamganj Assembly constituency, about 80km from Gaya and 230km south of Patna.        
	Ratan Lal Thakur, the station house officer of Dumaria police station, said the bomb exploded after it had been taken out and was being defused.         
	Thakur said the police learnt about the bomb around 9.15am after some villagers spotted wires along the culvert. The bomb disposal squad was informed but they reached the spot about three hours later as they were escorting Uday Narayan Choudhary, the Assembly Speaker and JD (U) candidate from Imamganj.         
	Work on defusing the bomb began after 12.30pm with Singh and Yadav taking charge.         
	The duo had first decided to dig out the bomb but then came to the conclusion that the safer way was to blow it up. Police sources on the spot said nothing worked for a long time and the bomb did not go off by itself.         
	Then at last it was decided that it had to be dug out. Once that was done, it was found that it was a live cylinder bomb weighing around 5kg. The bomb was taken out and the wires were being disconnected when it exploded, the source said.         
	The bomb squad members were in full gear and had all the necessary equipment. The bomb was very powerful. Some media persons were very close to the site even after being repeatedly told by the policemen to move away. It is a shocking incident, something which we never expected. It was so shocking to see Anil Singh, who was working on the bomb for hours together, meeting his end like this, said Thakur.         
	Todays blast has raised doubts about the training of bomb squads in Bihar.         
	Senior police officers have often complained that while the state had all the necessary equipment to defuse explosives, the absence of trained hands in Maoist-affected districts was a cause for concern.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Decks cleared for IIM foreign foray
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Decks cleared for IIM foreign foray

	New Delhi, Oct. 13: The Indian Institutes of Management were today given the green signal to open campuses abroad.        
	IIM Bangalore was the first off the block, getting a three-year-old proposal to open an overseas branch approved at a meeting of IIM chairpersons and directors here today. HRD minister Kapil Sibal chaired the session.        
	The foreign forays will be possible after amendments to the memorandum of association (MoA) which governs the functioning of each IIM. As they stand now, such charters do not allow such campuses, except in the case of the Bangalore institute, which had amended its MoA in 2007 though the foreign plan had not been cleared then.        
	The amendments, to be carried out by the board of governors of each IIM, must get the HRD ministrys approval to take effect. There are seven IIMs functioning now and six are being opened.         
	IIM Bangalore had amended its MoA earlier. The amended MoA was today approved. Similar amendments to the MoAs will have to be carried out by the remaining IIMs, a ministry official said. He added that IIM Indore had made a similar amendment and sent it the ministry, which should approve it soon.        
	The overseas expansion, hanging fire until Sibal indicated in 2009 that the move was being considered, will help the IIMs become global brands. The international campuses will also generate more resources.        
	Another key decision taken at todays meeting was to allow the IIMs to top up the salaries of directors and faculty who are exceptional. The move paves the way for differential salaries at the same rank.         
	The aim is to encourage excellence. The expenditure on the hikes will have to be borne by the institutes. The boards of governors have been empowered to create additional faculty and non-faculty posts.         
	Also cleared was a proposal to reduce the size of each board of governors from over 20 to 14. This was done to ensure only serious members who can devote time and attention should be on the boards. At present, many eminent personalities from business and academics are members but dont attend meetings regularly.        
	Having smaller boards was part of the recommendations of a committee set up to suggest ways to improve the way IIMs are governed. Maruti Udyog chairman R.C. Bhargava headed the panel.         
	Todays meeting also accepted the committees suggestion that the IIM directors be appointed from a shortlist of three names given by the boards of governors.

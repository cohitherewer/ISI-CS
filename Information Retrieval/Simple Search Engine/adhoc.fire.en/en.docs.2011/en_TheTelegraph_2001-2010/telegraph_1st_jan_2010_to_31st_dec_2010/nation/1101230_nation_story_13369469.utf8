          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                         Varun Gandhi    
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: The BJP today came out in defence of Sanjay Gandhi saying that the Congress was responsible for Emergency excesses and was now refraining from owning up by seeking to shift blame on an individual.         
	This defence of Sanjay, who is widely believed to be responsible for the excesses during Emergency, came in reaction to the portrayal of the late leader in a book brought out by the Congress to mark its 125 years. Sanjays son Varun is now in the BJP.        
	We believe that the decision to clamp Emergency was a decision of the Congress and the government. The party is now trying to blame an individual, BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said.

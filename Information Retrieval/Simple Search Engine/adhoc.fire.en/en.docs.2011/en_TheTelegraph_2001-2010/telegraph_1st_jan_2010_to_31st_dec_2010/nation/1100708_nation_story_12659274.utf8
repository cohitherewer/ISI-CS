The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mumbai on edge over Delhi language stand
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mumbai on edge over Delhi language stand
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi/Mumbai, July 7: The Congress-led Centres blow-hot, blow-cold approach to statehood and territorial disputes has led to the threat of street violence in Maharashtra, months after aggravating the Telangana movement.        
	The government today refused to cede four Karnataka districts to Maharashtra just because they had a Marathi-speaking majority, telling the Supreme Court that language was never the sole criterion for the reorganisation of states.        
	The stand, corroborated by legal experts but at odds with accepted political wisdom, prompted angry comments from the Shiv Sena as it looked to exploit a half-century-old emotive issue that has triggered violence in the past.        
	Sena boss Bal Thackeray slammed the Nehru-Gandhi family as Maharashtra haters while his party leader Sanjay Raut said provocatively: People are bound to lose their cool do we have to become terrorists to demand justice?        
	Maharashtra parties are especially furious because the Centre, which initially appeared to back the states claim before backtracking following protests in Karnataka, has now gone to the opposite extreme of demanding the court dismiss Maharashtras petition and impose exemplary costs.        
	Worried at the reaction back home, Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan, who was in New Delhi, met Sonia Gandhi and home minister P. Chidambaram this evening.        
	The Centres stand will have consequences also for other states locked in boundary disputes over language, such as Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. Even the statehood demand in the Darjeeling hills has a linguistic-cultural component though it involves other factors, such as economic issues, too.        
	(The) language of the people has been one of the criteria, but not the sole criterion, for inclusion of any area in a state, an affidavit filed by the Union home ministry said.        
	Both Parliament and the Union government had considered all the relevant factors while considering the States Reorganisation Bill, 1956, and The Bombay Reorganisation Bill, 1960, and decided the village, taluka, municipal areas, towns, etc, which were to be included in the concerned states.        
	Constitutional expert P.P. Rao told The Telegraph the Centre was right that the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 did not make language the sole criterion. Sources said some of the other factors considered were size and access to resources.        
	Maharashtra accepts this but argues that the 1956 Act is unconstitutional because it fails to protect the right of linguistic minorities. It claims that Article 3 of the Constitution makes linguistic and cultural homogeneity, and the wishes of the people of the affected areas, paramount in re-drawing state boundaries.        
	The state has been demanding 865 villages and towns inhabited by Marathi speakers in Belgaum, Gulbarga, Karwar and Bidar districts of Karnataka.         
	These villages were merged with Karnataka (then Mysore) when Maharashtra was carved out in 1960. The Maharashtra government filed a court petition on February 12 last year challenging the 1956 Act.        
	If language is not going to be the criterion for states, then why not dismantle all states? Thackeray said sarcastically.        
	The Nehru-Gandhi dynasty is infamous for being anti-Maharashtra. Motilal Nehru once said Maharashtra was a rotten part of India and should be chopped off.        
	Ironically, the Maharashtra government that filed the petition is run by the Congress and ally NCP while Karnataka, which greeted the Centres statement with joy, is ruled by Sena ally BJP. The Maharashtra BJP too joined the Sena in slamming the Centres stand.        
	The embattled Chavan said: We will present our view in the court on July 12 when a discussion on the issue is scheduled.        
	He refused to explain why Congress-led governments in the state and the Centre were taking different stands on the subject. Its better that you clarify it from the (Union) home minister, he said.

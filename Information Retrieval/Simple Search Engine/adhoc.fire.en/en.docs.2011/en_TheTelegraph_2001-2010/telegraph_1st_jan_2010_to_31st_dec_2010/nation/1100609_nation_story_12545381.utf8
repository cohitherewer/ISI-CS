	Bonn, June 7: Presidents and Prime Ministers sat and bickered and couldnt agree, now mayors want a say.        
	Mayors and representatives from more than 50 cities across the world met last month in this German city to demand a stronger voice and presence in global climate negotiations, as cities joined the battle to save the earth.        
	Till now, cities have had no role in climate talks.        
	Nearly 500 participants attended the first World Congress on Cities and Adaptation to Climate Change, the delegates including the mayors of Howrah and Chennai, and their counterparts from across the globe, as well as environment experts and representatives of funding agencies.        
	We showcased our climate vision plan which has received extremely favourable responses, Howrah mayor Mamata Jaisawal said. Different funding agencies have assured us they would support our plans.        
	The Bonn Declaration, released at the end of the congress, said: Local leadership must be empowered to ensure global climate action (and) cities must have a stronger voice and presence in global climate negotiations.        
	The declaration also demanded financial freedom for implementing climate change-related programmes.        
	Six months back, several Presidents and Prime Ministers who met at a UN climate summit had failed to finalise strategies to reduce or curb global emissions of greenhouse gases. A political statement from the Copenhagen Summit, however, recognised the need to cap the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2050.        
	The Bonn congress, organised by the non-government organisation ICLEI, the city of Bonn and the World Mayors Council on Climate Change, underlined the need for adaptation at the local level.        
	Climate change is real, global and immediate. Our cities are at risk. Local level adaptation is essential. Local governments need direct access to financing mechanisms and technical resources from all levels  multilateral, national and local, the declaration said.        
	Mexico City mayor Marcelo Ebrard, who released the declaration on May 30, emphasised the need to involve cities in the fight to save the climate. Ebrard, whose country is scheduled to host the next convention (CoP) on climate change later this year, said many cities were the hotbed of climate impact and without their effort it would be difficult to achieve any significant success on the climate front. Still, they have absolutely no say in climate adaptation and mitigation. This should change.        
	The demand received a boost when Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), supported the initiative in the final plenary and asked cities to pressure states to take up climate adaptation programmes. Dont allow national governments to get away keep pressurising, Boer said.         
	At the congress, ICLEI secretary-general Konrad Otto-Zimmermann, who chaired the meet, said the failure of countries to come up with a solution at Copenhagen had opened the door for cities to play a role in the negotiations.

	Imphal/Kohima, Aug. 18: An army helicopter on a routine sortie today crashed on Japfu hill in Nagaland, killing all three on board, including a colonel.         
	The Cheetah, carrying Col P.K. Pal, the commandant of 7003 Electrical and Mechanical Engineering battalion, pilot Maj. Rakesh Sharma and co-pilot Maj. Nikhil Rana, took off from Rangapahar in Nagaland, the headquarters of 3 Corps, this morning. It lost contact with the ground around 8.30am, Col. R.K. Palta, the defence PRO, said.        
	Villagers at the site said they saw the chopper flying very low and suddenly crashing into the hill. The bodies have been sent to Naga Hospital in Kohima for post-mortem.        
	An officer at the Leimakhong army headquarters on the outskirts of Imphal, however, said it was not known why Col. Pal had gone on a sortie.         
	We do not have any idea about the purpose of the visit.         
	A state government source said he may have been travelling by chopper because a landslide had blocked the Imphal-Dimapur highway.        
	A source at the Leimakhong army headquarters first cited technical snag as the cause of the crash, but a release issued later by Rangapahar (3 Corps) stated bad weather as the reason.        
	Kohima has been experiencing heavy rain for the past few days. But there have been no reports of thick fog or poor visibility.        
	Lt. Gen. N.K. Singh, the GOC, 3 Corps, termed the incident unfortunate. A probe has been ordered.        
	Representatives from Naga organisations visited the crash site. K.V. Pusa, the MLA from the area, has conveyed his condolences to the bereaved families.        
	Soldiers die in Congo        
	Three Indian soldiers, who were part of the UN peacekeeping force in Congo, were killed and seven were injured when rebels attacked their base in Kirumba province of the central African nation on Wednesday.        
	Around 50-60 suspected rebels from the Mayi-Mayi carried out the attack, army officials said.

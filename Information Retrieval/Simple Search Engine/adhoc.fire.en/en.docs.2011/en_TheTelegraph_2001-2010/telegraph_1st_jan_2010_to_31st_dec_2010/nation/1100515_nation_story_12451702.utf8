The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US war veteran   wants asylum
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US war veteran   wants asylum
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, May 14: Jeff Knaebel, an American and Gandhian living in India for the past 15 years and who last year destroyed his American citizenship papers to protest the USs war policies, moved the Supreme Court today seeking asylum.         
	A two-judge bench, headed by Justice P. Sathashivam, referred his request to the attorney-general and adjourned the case till July 12.        
	Knaebel, a Vietnam War veteran, has been living in Shimla since 1995. In the worst-case scenario, if I were to be sent back to the US, I would be quickly prosecuted for sedition, he said.         
	Things are fairer now under Barack Obama than under George W. Bush, he said, but added that the change was not as radical as one would have liked it to be.         
	Knaebel, however, was unsparing in his criticism of some the Obama administrations measures. The first executive order that Obama signed sent 30,000 more troops to Iraq, he said. We are facing a war machine, not human beings a legal construct to make money. Whether we elect Bush or Obama makes no difference.        
	The American pinned his hopes on the Indian public instead to end what he said was the cycle of violence unleashed by the US war machine. I have hopes from the Indian people, their moral values, not the Indian government, he said.         
	Knaebel said he wished to travel freely throughout India to spread the message of Gandhi. There has been some harassment. My hosts have been asked to show that I have papers (to stay in India), he said.         
	I cant put fellow Gandhians and friends at risk. So I had to break my vow of not using a motor vehicle powered by petroleum which has destroyed the earth, he said.         
	I am hoping that the Supreme Court will do something which will allow me to live freely without fear of arrest, he said. It would also legally permit me to move freely and work to further my cause.        
	Knaebel, clad in white khadi, came to the apex court today to seek directions to the Centre to consider his case.         
	On June 19, 2009, Knaebel burnt his US citizenship papers at the Gandhi Samadhi in an act of renunciation. Since then, he has travelled extensively in India as a stateless person, preaching his doctrine of pacifism.         
	Speaking to reporters outside the Supreme Court, he claimed that the US was destroying the whole planet.         
	He said that he had walked over 1,300km, met over 20,000 people in India to spread his message of peace and non-violence.         
	Knaebel also writes on www.freeofstate.org and www.gandhipadyatra.com.         
	He has worked as a mining engineer, an entrepreneur and a pilot in Alaska and Canada.         
	Faced with the prospect of military conscription in his youth, he applied to the US Navy Officer Candidate School. He was commissioned and later served as a company commander of the US Seabees in the Vietnam War.         
	The war was horrible, he said speaking over phone to The Telegraph. There was so much of death and destruction.        
	The cycle of war destruction and wanton waste propagated by the US is impossible to end by political means, his website says.

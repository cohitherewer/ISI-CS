          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, March 15: Mumbai police have arrested 11 Maharashtra Navnirman Sena activists after film producer Ritesh Sidhwani complained that they had tried to extort Rs 25 lakh from his film crew.        
	The producers complaint came a month after Shah Rukh Khan refused to apologise to Shiv Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray whose party tried to stall the release of My Name is Khan.         
	Sidhwani, the producer of Dil Chahta Hai, Lakshya, Luck by Chance and Karthik Calling Karthik, and his film unit told Bandra police that the 11 MNS activists came to the set of the film Crooked at Mehboob Studio on Sunday afternoon and demanded to know why foreign artistes were being employed in the film and not local talent. Deputy commissioner K.M. Prasanna said the film unit explained to them that the foreign artistes were required as the sequence recreated Istanbul, Turkey. But the activists would not budge.        
	Prasanna said the MNS workers then allegedly demanded Rs 25 lakh for not using local artistes.         
	Ameya Khopkar, the MNS film wing chief denied the allegation of extortion. A blatantly false complaint of extortion has been filed against our boys. Our people had gone to the set after learning that the film was using 136 foreign nationals from Afghanistan, Iran and Russia though they did not possess valid work permits, he said.         
	The arrests happened after Sidhwani approached Mukesh Bhatt, the vice-president of the film producers association, and he called up Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan.

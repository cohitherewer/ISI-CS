	Bhubaneswar, May 31: Orissa will soon have a state tobacco cell in co-ordination with the National Rural Health Mission to fight its war against the peril that comes packed with both forms of tobacco  smoking and chewing types.        
	While the cell will also work at district level to sensitise and create a sustained campaign against tobacco, every government department will also have a notified officer to facilitate the campaign against tobaccos harmful effects.        
	Speaking at the World No Tobacco Day celebrations here today, health secretary Anu Garg said the campaign to make the capital tobacco-free did not mean that smoking can be totally banned, but under the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act, use of tobacco would be banned at public places.        
	As World No Tobacco Day, 2010, has the theme gender and tobacco, with an emphasis on marketing to women, health minister Prasanna Acharya said with both society and low-income group women constituting more than 5 crore in India alone as smokers, there is a need to refrain them from the habit, as it might lead to low birth-weight babies, spontaneous abortion, more bleeding during pregnancy, retarded growth and collectively contributing more towards higher infant and maternal mortality rates.        
	Bhubaneswar and Indore are currently under a Voluntary Health Association of India plan to become tobacco-free, said its director P.C. Bhatnagar, adding places like Jhunjunu in Rajasthan and Chandigarh had become tobacco-free. Also the entire district of Kottayam in Kerala had become a no-tobacco zone, he said.        
	Sikkim has also shown interest in going the tobacco-free way, Bhatnagar said, adding the recent strategy adopted by the World Health Organisation was to make the people aware about the findings that would force people to quit smoking.                          
	Scientific findings have identified more than 4,000 chemical substances in tobacco from which 60 are technically known to cause cancer, Bhatnagar said, adding even now it had come to notice that these chemicals had the tendency to change genetic materials in human bodies. Not only due to a longer spell, but even with just three smoking experiences could have a role in changing the genetic material in a human body, he clarified. Justifying more taxes on tobacco products, he said the situation had become so alarming that a study under Global Youth Tobacco Survey had found that in India the age to start tobacco has come down to 10-13 years.

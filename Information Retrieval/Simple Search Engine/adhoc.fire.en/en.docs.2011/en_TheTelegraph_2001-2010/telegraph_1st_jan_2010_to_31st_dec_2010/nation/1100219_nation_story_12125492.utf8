The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Security whip on Pune hotels
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Security whip on Pune hotels
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                      Pune residents at a march held in memory of the blast victims                          
	Pune, Feb. 18: Police today threatened to stop the renewal of licences of commercial establishments, including five star hotels and shopping malls, if they did not upgrade their security apparatus with metal detectors and frisking to prevent possible terror attacks.        
	Pune police commissioner Satyapal Singh, who had appealed to commercial establishments to improve their security two years ago, said: This (the blast) is a wake-up call. We will not renew their licences if hotels and malls do not install adequate metal detectors and upgrade their overall security infrastructure to protect their patrons.        
	Singh said the information technology companies had taken better steps towards improving security systems. We have written to IT companies to ensure that no one is allowed inside their campus without an identity-card check. We have also asked hotels to ensure they should take in customers with luggage after a thorough enquiry, he said.        
	The Pune police chief said he had also met municipal commissioner Mahesh Zagade regarding illegal constructions by commercial establishments A portion of German Bakery has been constructed reportedly without legal permissions.        
	Singh said cyber cafes in the city have also been directed to ask for photographs of their customers apart from identification documents like driving licences containing details like name, address and phone numbers.         
	He, however, continued to remain tight-lipped about the progress of the investigations. Five days after the February 13 explosion that killed 11 and injured 60, the police have issued no sketches of suspects yet based on information provided by eyewitnesses.         
	Our experts are working on it. Sketches would be released only when they feel they should be released, said Singh, who hinted at a possible local hand in the blast at a lecture at a city college yesterday.        
	Asked if the police had zeroed in on a local hand in the terror attack, Singh said it was possible a local group had assisted the blast conspirators but unless the investigators apprehend suspects, it was not possible to name any group or organisation.

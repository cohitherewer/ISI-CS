The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Obama reception signal on Delhi ties
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Obama reception signal on Delhi ties
          K.P. NAYAR                      Barack Obama                          
	Washington, June 1: Six months after Barack Obama decided that the first state dinner of his presidency would honour Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the US President is once again personally interjecting himself into Indo-US relations this week to dispel a notion that the present administration in Washington does not consider India to be a priority.        
	Several days of discussions went into Obamas decision that he will make a rare drive from his office on Pennsylvania Avenue to Foggy Bottom on Thursday to attend a reception by US secretary of state Hillary Clinton for external affairs minister S.M. Krishna on the occasion of the first Indo-US strategic dialogue.        
	Obamas aides had proposed to him that he should merely drop in at a meeting between Krishna and US national security adviser General James Jones in the White House complex earlier during the ministers visit, but the President rejected that suggestion.        
	Obama told aides that he wanted to do something that would demonstrate his personal interest in the strategic dialogue with India and also send a message that he is committed no less than any of his predecessors to a long-term partnership with New Delhi.        
	He, therefore, wanted to go beyond the routine drop in at the office of the national security adviser, which his predecessor George W. Bush had done with a host of visitors from India.         
	Clinton had already briefed Obama that Krishna was part of John F. Kennedys historic presidential campaign when the external affairs minister was a Fulbright scholar at George Washington University Law School and that he treasures a letter written by Kennedy thanking Krishna for his help during the campaign.        
	Obama was not even born when Kennedy was sworn in as President, but stories about the Camelot have been an inspiration for Obama in shaping his own political career.        
	The President was also intrigued that Krishna had given Clinton a Ganesha in sandalwood when she called on the minister in New Delhi last July, according to a source present during a conversation between the President and the secretary of state shortly after her return from New Delhi.        
	Obama carried a tiny statue of Hanuman with him during his presidential campaign trips for good luck.        
	A key input that went into the Presidents decision to attend and speak at the secretary of states reception for Krishna was that there would inevitably be comparisons in the coming days here and in New Delhi between the strategic dialogues that the US has had in recent weeks with India on the one hand and with Pakistan on the other.        
	Although the most powerful man in Pakistan, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, was part of the delegation which came here for the Pakistan-US strategic dialogue in late March, Obama did not meet the army chief or any of the Pakistani ministers on the occasion.        
	The White House is keen that despite a bigger and exhaustive interaction between the US and China which just concluded in Beijing under the rubric of a strategic and economic dialogue, there should be no apprehension that India is being treated here as a poor cousin.        
	A week-long calendar of events here on India which will run parallel to the strategic dialogue kicked off today with a speech by William Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, at the Council on Foreign Relations on Indias Rise and the Future of the US-India Relationship.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 27: Mamata Banerjee today dubbed pathetic Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees call to BJP supporters to vote for the Left, saying the chief minister was falling at their feet to win the civic polls.         
	What a pathetic condition the CPM is in. Its chief minister has to fall at the feet of BJP supporters to beg for votes in his desperation to win the civic polls, she told a gathering in Behala. She repeated the lines later at a Kalighat public meeting.         
	Bhattacharjee had urged BJP supporters not to waste their votes but to cast them in favour of the Left Front while giving a speech in Bansdroni yesterday.         
	The chief minister, who today spoke at two public meetings on the northern fringes of Calcutta, renewed his appeal to BJP supporters but added that the BJP was a dangerous force that should be shunned.         
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose defended Bhattacharjee, saying: The chief minister didnt seek votes from the BJP but its supporters. Those who support the BJP are not necessarily the partys members.        
	Mamata, against whom the CPM has lodged a complaint with the state election commission, accusing her of fomenting communal tension with her speeches, today asked: Now what would you say about this party that has to depend on the BJP to win the civic polls?         
	The Trinamul chief also recounted how the CPM had collaborated with the BJP in 1989 to form the Janata Dal government, but did not mention her partys tie-up with the BJP to form the NDA government at the Centre in 2001.         
	The state BJP also criticised Bhattacharjee. The CPM calls us untouchable. But Bhattacharjee is asking our supporters to vote for his party, state BJP chief Rahul Sinha said.

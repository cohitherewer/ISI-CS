          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 30: The BJP proposes to woo Bihars Muslims and try and undo the Narendra Modi effect.        
	The party will host a minorities convention on July 14 in Patna to tell the community that the BJP was grossly misunderstood as being anti-Muslim and that Muslims were actually better-off in the states it ruled.         
	Sources, however, said Gujarat would not be mentioned as one of them, not after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar was riled by the advertisements put out by Modi, trumpeting his pro-Muslim credentials in the Patna papers, including the Urdu ones, earlier this month.         
	Nitish feared the Modi over-drive might alienate the Muslims from the Janata Dal (United) and consolidate their votes behind the Lalu Prasad-Ram Vilas Paswan combine in the Assembly polls.        
	Nitish did everything to distance himself from Modi and his party and gave an impression that if push came to shove, he might part company from the BJP before the elections.        
	The convention will also propagate schemes reportedly initiated by the Bihar deputy chief minister and finance minister, Sushil Modi, for Muslims and make the point that he was second to none in funding them.        
	Bhagalpur MP and BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain  who is the conventions prime mover  has claimed it was planned before the Modi-inspired controversy.         
	Party sources said the event acquired a sense of urgency and significance after the BJP-Janata Dal (United) alliance nearly came apart. We understand and appreciate Nitishs concerns over the Muslim votes. This is our way of assuring him that we will do nothing to upset the apple-cart because we have as much of a stake in winning the (Assembly) elections as him, another Bihar MP said.

	Lucknow, Jan. 21: Four alleged kidnappers of a business executives 11-year-old son were killed near Lucknow today and the boy rescued within 24 hours, the swift police action coming after a spate of such abductions that ended with ransom payments.        
	Dinesh Mishra received a ransom call for Rs 1.5 crore last night, hours after the abduction the third in Lucknow this month  of his son Gaurav on way back from school.         
	The executive informed the special task force (STF) of Uttar Pradesh police immediately, unlike many of the parents who preferred to hide the kidnappings of their children and paid hefty ransoms quietly to get their kids back.        
	One of the four killed was Surendra Yadav, the driver of the family car in which Gaurav was being driven back home. He was allegedly in league with the three kidnappers.        
	Additional director-general of police (law and order) Brij Lal told reporters this evening that STF commandos shot the four dead in Rahimnagar area of Malihabad around 7am this morning and rescued the boy. The car has also been recovered, Lal added.        
	Senior superintendent of police Prem Prakash said his team tracked the abductors cellphones and traced them to Malihabad, an area on the outskirts of Lucknow known for its sprawling mango orchards.        
	The boy was gagged. The kidnappers did not stop anywhere. They kept moving around Malihabad. They had tied the boys hands and put him inside the cars boot. When we challenged them, they fired at us. After an encounter that lasted an hour, they were killed, said Prakash, adding the three kidnappers were yet to be identified.        
	Earlier, Prakash said the kidnappers had made at least 12 calls from various cellphones to the Mishras after kidnapping Gaurav, a Class VII student of City Montessori School in Lucknow, from the Aliganj area. One of the calls, made late last evening, was traced to nearby Sitapur.         
	Many of the (recent) kidnappers are newcomers without any criminal records, another officer said, adding that secret ransom payments by parents in earlier cases were encouraging fresh incidents.         
	Since 2007, when the Mayavati government came to power, 4,478 incidents of kidnappings have been recorded in Uttar Pradesh. This is more than the 2,530 such cases recorded in neighbouring Bihar, also trying to battle the menace.        
	Business hub Kanpur remains Uttar Pradeshs kidnapping capital  the city saw 45 children abducted between January and August 2009. The victims families often alleged that a section of the police was helping the gangs, the allegations fuelled by the forces failure to arrest or kill the culprits. Lucknow saw 13 cases in 2009.

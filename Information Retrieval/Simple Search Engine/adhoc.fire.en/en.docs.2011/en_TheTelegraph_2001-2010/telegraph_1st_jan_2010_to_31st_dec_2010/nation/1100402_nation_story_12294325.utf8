          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 1: The chief minister today expressed concern over the recent clashes between Citu workers and Trinamul Congress trade union members in the Haldia industrial belt.        
	Such clashes will be detrimental to the inflow of capital. I request both sides to restrain from fighting and hold talks to settle differences amicably, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gag order, whats that? Digvijay holds forth 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Gag order, whats that? Digvijay holds forth 
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Digvijay Singh,                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: When it issued its recent gag order to senior leaders, the Congress should have known from experience that it wouldnt work.        
	One of the usual suspects, Digvijay Singh, today spoke about everything under the sun to the media while defending party and government against the Oppositions corruption charges.        
	Digvijays name was missing from the 18-member committee that was supposed to interact with the media on the partys behalf while all others were warned to keep their mouths shut.        
	While announcing the committee a few days ago, Congress media department chief Janardan Dwivedi had clearly said that no one else would articulate the partys position before the media. Even MPs and ministers were asked not to speak to the media.        
	But Digvijay, who has violated previous gag orders with gay abandon, sent out a clear message that he did not believe that muzzling senior leaders would serve any political purpose.        
	Many in the Congress feel that the party had lost the battle of perceptions over corruption primarily because of its failure to articulate its viewpoint forcefully. While top BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley have been regularly interacting with the media, even L.K. Advani has jumped into the fray to attack the Congress over the recent scandals.        
	In contrast, the Congress has largely relied on its regular spokespersons and often cancelled even the regular briefings to try and escape the media heat. For instance, there was none from the party to rebut the BJPs charge of breach of privilege by telecom minister Kapil Sibal.        
	Sibal himself had to confront the BJP. He described the move to appoint a single-judge committee to probe the spectrum policies since 2001 as an administrative decision and regretted that the political agenda had clouded Jaitleys vision. Sibal is not on the media committee, which includes several cabinet ministers.        
	Then came Digvijay, hitting back at the BJPs double standards and doublespeak. He argued there was nothing to show that the Congress leadership had tried to protect anyone charged with corruption whereas the BJP had never acted against its tainted leaders.        
	The nation wants the truth to be out in the 2G spectrum case. We have given more than the JPC (joint parliamentary committee)  the CBI, PAC (public accounts committee), ED (enforcement directorate) and a retired Supreme Court judge are finding out the truth. Nobody has ever been punished on the basis of a CAG report, but we prevailed on our alliance partner to drop Raja, he said.         
	The BJP does not have the guts to touch the Reddy brothers for the loot of the Bellary mines; it cant remove (Karnataka chief minister) Yeddyurappa; it brought back the tainted Bangaru Laxman and Dilip Singh Judeo to Parliament. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has given false information to register his dumpers, which is a case of corruption. The people will again punish the BJP at the general election in 2014 for its doublespeak.        
	Asked what would happen if the parliamentary deadlock continued in the budget session too, he said: The only problem is that the budget will be passed without discussion. But the ruling party cannot run Parliament if the Opposition is adamant on disrupting it.        
	He dismissed the talk of snap polls, arguing: The people have given us the mandate to govern for five years. What can we do if the Opposition keeps Parliament paralysed? Why should we go to an election now? We will instead expose the Opposition.

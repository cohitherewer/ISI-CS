          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Calcutta, July 18: Maoist leaders Ganapati and Kishan visited Calcutta several times in the past six months on their way to Lalgarh and met at city bus stands and roadside eateries instead of safe houses, an arrested associate has revealed.        
	The leaders spent considerable time in the city, giving sleuths of the state intelligence branch and special branch a miss, Sachin Ghosal, who was held by the CID last month, has disclosed during interrogation.        
	They (the top rebel leaders) used to reach the city individually and stay separately. Ghosals job was to convey messages sent by one leader to another before their meetings. The leaders used to meet in public places like bus stands, roadside eateries, instead of using houses of their sympathisers and hotel rooms. They did this because it is easier to escape from a public place during a police raid, an intelligence branch official said.        
	According to the officials who have questioned Ghosal, the 43-year-old played a key role in setting up the meetings. He used to carry secret information from one leader to another after their arrival in Calcutta. He also purchased bus and train tickets for them and even provided them clothes, the official said.        
	Information on the Calcutta trips of the rebel leaders who are wanted by law-enforcement agencies across the country  has also emerged from the interrogation of other operatives, including CPI (Maoist) state committee members Telugu Dipak and Madhusudan Mandal. Both are known to be close aides of Kishan.        
	They have revealed that Kishan, the chief of the Maoists military wing, came to the city from the Lalgarh forests in February soon after the rebels attacked the Shilda camp and killed 24 state cops.        
	Ganapati, a founder member of Peoples War Group (PWG) in Andhra Pradesh, the outfits Orissa in-charge Sabyasachi Ponda, and Kishans brother Venugopal came to Calcutta at the same time. Kishan visited the city several times before. Earlier, he had come on way to Nandigram at least thrice, said a CID officer.        
	According to sources, CPI (Maoist) chief Ganapati visited Calcutta at least twice in the past year-and-a-half. In the beginning of last year, he came to Calcutta on way to Lalgarh where he delivered a speech to cadres. He spent a week in Lalgarh and then slipped out through the Bengal-Jharkhand border, said an officer.        
	Ghosal has also revealed the route the Maoist top guns took to reach Lalgarh. They did not take the direct route. Instead of going through Kharagpur or Jhargram, they travelled a longer way. They travelled through Burdwan, Birbhum and Bankura to reach Lalgarh, said the intelligence branch officer.        
	The police have admitted the top leaders coming and spending days in Calcutta undetected is a major intelligence lapse.

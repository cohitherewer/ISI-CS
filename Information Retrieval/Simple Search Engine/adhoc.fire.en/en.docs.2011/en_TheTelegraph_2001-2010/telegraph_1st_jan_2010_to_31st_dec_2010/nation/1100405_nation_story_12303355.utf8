          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 4: The RSS has risen full throated to defend Narendra Modi against the attacks on him by the secular media and pro-Islamic activists.        
	Lead editorials in RSS mouthpieces, the weekly Organiser and its Hindi counterpart Panchajanya, suggest that despite his run-ins with the Sangh and its front organisations, the Gujarat chief minister could count on them for support in a crisis.        
	The editorial in the Organiser (April 4) asks why Modi is being picked on though he is a popular chief minister, has a clean image and ensures Muslims are more well off in his state than they are in Left-ruled Bengal and Congress-ruled Andhra Pradesh.        
	...The Left-Islamic activists and a section of the media...want to demonise, defame and deny Modi his legitimate place in politics and history.... They simply want to declare him guilty and hang him. Because he is a Hindu? Because he does not go and try to charm and win over the professional masters on news manipulation who manufacture situations and events to suit the designs of the establishment?         
	Is it because he has no desire to misuse tax-payers money to cultivate the so-called media moghuls? Or because he is a BJP chief minister beyond reproach and humility? the editorial asks.        
	Panchajanya tells Modi baiters, who insistently built his anti-Muslim image, to remember that because of his governments global projection as clean and development-oriented, industrialists from Islamic countries lined up for his yearly Vibrant Gujarat investors summit to see if they could put in their money. In 2009, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Malaysia and Indonesia had evinced interest in investing in Gujarat.        
	But when this information was tom-tommed on a pro-BJP website, there were angry queries on why Muslims were relocating their businesses and homes to other states and why was it that Muslims, wanting to live in cosmopolitan areas, were denied housing?        
	The Organiser accused the media of pursuing double-standards and pointed out that nobody thought of saying or writing a negative word of the Congresss alleged patronage to Bareilly clerics who were alleged to have instigated the communal violence in the Uttar Pradesh town recently.         
	It wondered why the media did not condemn Congress leaders Digvijay Singh and Rahul Gandhis recent visit to Azamgarh to meet the families of youths who died in the Batla House encounter with Delhi police in 2008.         
	The RSS, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Kisan Morcha and others were upset with Modi for not obliging them with the perks and patronage they expect from BJP chief ministers.         
	In the last state elections, the RSS had directed its cadres to be neutral and vote for a candidate they liked as long as he was not anti-Hindu. However, they later called a truce with Modi and declared a Hindu government must be reinstated in Gujarat.         
	The same impulse worked this time too. The RSS is still unhappy with Modi but empathises with him on the issues on which hes fighting, an Ahmedabad-based office-bearer said off the record.

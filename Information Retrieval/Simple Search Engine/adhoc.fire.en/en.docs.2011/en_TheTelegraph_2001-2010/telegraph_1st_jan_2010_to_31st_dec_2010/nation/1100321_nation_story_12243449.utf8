	New Delhi, March 20: A Supreme Court bench today said the top court should not entertain appeals against every other order and laid down broad guidelines to deal with the problem.        
	In 2009, 70,000 cases were filed in this court of which an overwhelming number were special leave petitions under Article 136 (of the Constitution). All these cases have to be heard, whereas the US Supreme Court hears only 100 to 120 cases every year and the Canadian SC hears only 60 cases a year, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Markandey Katju said on Friday.         
	To deal with the problem of backlog, the bench suggested that the court restrict itself to matters relating to interpretation of the Constitution; matters of national or public importance; validity of laws, central and state; judicial review of amendments; and to settle differences of opinion between high courts. The court may also look into cases when it is satisfied that there has been a grave miscarriage of justice and where a fundamental right of a person has been violated.         
	The observation came while the bench was disposing of an appeal filed by Mathai alias Joby of Kerala against a high court order of November 11, 2009. The high court had dismissed his plea for a second forensic opinion on the genuineness of a will.         
	The court slammed litigants tendency to file special leave petitions without thought. For instance, if the trial court allows an amendment application, the latter is contested right up to this court. Similarly, if a delay in filing an application or appeal is condoned, the matter is fought up to this court, the bench said.         
	The apex court lays down the law for the whole country and it should have more time to deliberate upon the cases it hears. However, sadly the position today is that it is under such pressure that judges do not get sufficient time to deliberate over the cases, which they deserve, and this is bound to affect the quality of our judgments.        
	Pointing to the backlog of cases, the bench said this court has been converted practically into an ordinary appellate court which, in our opinion, was never the intention of Article 136. Under the constitutional scheme, the last court in ordinary cases was meant to be the high court.         
	Article 136, the bench said, only permits the Supreme Court to exercise discretion, to grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order passed by any court or tribunal in India. However, it does not say when this discretion should be exercised. Hence, some broad guidelines need to be laid down now. Otherwise, this court will be flooded (and is being flooded) with all kind of SLPs (special leave petitions), even frivolous ones, and the arrears will keep mounting and a time will come when its functioning will become impossible, the bench observed.         
	The top court, the bench observed, was meant to deal with key constitutional questions, questions of laws of general importance or where grave injustice had been done. If the Supreme Court entertains all and sundry kinds of cases it will not be able to deal with important questions relating to the Constitution or the law or where grave injustice has been done. After all, the Supreme Court has limited time at its disposal and it cannot be expected to hear every kind of dispute. Otherwise, the court will collapse under its own burden, the bench said.         
	The bench then referred the issue back to the Chief Justice to be placed before a Constitution bench.         
	The bench also issued notices to the Supreme Court Bar Association, Bar Council of India and the Supreme Court-Advocates-on-Record Association to place their views before the court on the matter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal tables foreign varsity bill amid protest
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sibal tables foreign varsity bill amid protest
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, May 3: The Centre today tabled in the Lok Sabha a controversial bill allowing and regulating foreign varsities in India and three other landmark education reform legislation amid Opposition din over allegations against telecom minister A. Raja.         
	The CPM, which had stalled the foreign varsity bill in the term of the first UPA government that it had supported, criticised human resource development minister Kapil Sibal.         
	But Speaker Meira Kumar allowed Sibal to introduce the four bills which could alter the face of Indian higher education.         
	The three other bills aim to punish institutions that cheat or mislead students and charge capitation fees, seek to set up special tribunals to settle education disputes and establish a new accreditation regime under which every institution must get itself rated.         
	The three bills are now likely to undergo the scrutiny of the parliamentary standing committee on HRD, headed by Congress leader Oscar Fernandes. Rahul Gandhi is a member of this panel.         
	HRD ministry sources said that they were hoping to obtain Parliament sanction for the bills in the monsoon session.         
	But the Foreign Educational Institutions (Regulation of Entry and Operations) Bill is likely to prove the most controversial for the government.         
	Allowing foreign direct investment and foreign teaching staff into the country will distort the already elitist educational structure in the country, CPM leader Basudeb Acharya told the House as Sibal introduced the foreign varsity bill.         
	With the introduction of this foreign education providers bill, higher education in this country is going to be further entrapped in the wave of money-minting institutions with the backing of an indulgent government, he added.         
	Activists of the Students Federation of India, the CPMs student wing, protested against the bill outside the House, shouting slogans against the UPA, and Sibal in particular.         
	This bill may first be sent to a select panel of MPs before being sent to the parliamentary standing committee.         
	The bill was first drafted in 2006.

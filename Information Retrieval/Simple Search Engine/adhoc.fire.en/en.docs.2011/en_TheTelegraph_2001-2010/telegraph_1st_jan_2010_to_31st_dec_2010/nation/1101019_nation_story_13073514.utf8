          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 18: The fate of the Karnataka government continues to hang in the balance after the high court today handed a split verdict on the disqualification of 11 dissident BJP legislators by the Speaker ahead of the October 11 trust vote.         
	Karnataka chief justice J.S. Khehar upheld Speaker K.G. Bopaiahs decision but Justice N. Kumar ruled against it, saying constitutional provisions were not followed. The matter has been referred to a third judge, who is expected to hear it on October 20.         
	The question of the disqualification of five Independent MLAs, who were part of the government but later withdrew their support, will be taken up by a division bench which is expected to hear the case on November 2.         
	The two-judge high court bench took cognisance of four issues: violation of rules, the principles of natural justice, a provision of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution on whether an MLA could be disqualified if he willingly relinquished membership of his party before voting on a confidence motion or defied the party whip while voting, and mala fide intention.         
	Justice Khehar and Justice Kumar agreed that there was no violation of rules or mala fide intention and that natural justice was followed while disqualifying the legislators. But they differed on the conduct of the MLAs in writing to the governor and withdrawing support. The letters were the basis of the disqualification decision.         
	Para 2 (1) (a) of the 10th Schedule states that a member belonging to a party would stand disqualified if he voluntarily forfeited his membership. The grey area was whether the dissidents letters constituted a voluntary surrender of their membership of the BJP.         
	The BJPs counsel had argued that it did. However, the disqualified legislators said their action only questioned the chief minister and did not amount to giving up their BJP membership.         
	I am upholding the order (of the Speaker), Justice Khehar said. I set aside the order, Justice Kumar stated.         
	The chief minister had won the October 11 confidence motion by voice vote, but the governor had rejected it and asked him to take another trust vote, which he won on October 14. Meanwhile, the dissident MLAs approached the high court against their disqualification. The court said the result of the trust vote would be subject to its verdict.         
	BJP spokesperson Tarun Vijay said the party was confident that the verdict on October 20 would have no ill-impact on the government.         
	The Karnataka Congress today alleged that the BJP was enticing its MLAs with offers of Rs 50 crore and ministerships. The leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Siddaramaiah, claimed 53 of the 73 Congress MLAs were approached by the BJP. The Congress will reveal the proof on horse-trading to the media and the governor, Congress working president D.K. Shivakumar said.         
	The BJP refused to react.

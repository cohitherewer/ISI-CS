The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CRPF camp of 900 but 1 water pump
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CRPF camp of 900 but 1 water pump
          PINAKI MAJUMDAR                               
	Jamshedpur, July 18: The CRPF jawan who killed six of his Maoist-fighter colleagues in Jharkhand had family problems, while the camp where he went on the rampage had only one hand pump for 900 jawans and hardly a proper toilet.        
	These are some findings of the initial probe into Friday nights mayhem when jawan Harpinder Singh sprayed bullets because he was apparently told to stop drinking in the camp in violation of rules.        
	Two probes are under way into the massacre at the CRPF camp at Kuchai in Jharkhands Seraikela-Kharsawan district. CRPF chief Vikram Srivastava has directed DIG Bhanu Pratap Singh to conduct a probe in three days. He, in turn, has ordered an inquiry, to be completed within a month.        
	Sources citing the initial probe claimed Harpinder, who was later shot dead, had been dogged by family problems for some time. He appeared stressed and lost his cool often. Lack of proper infrastructure at the camp and hectic schedules may have added to his aggression, said a CRPF officer who is part of the probe team.        
	The officer said the camp lacked proper toilets and its 900 jawans had to make do with only one hand pump. The personnel have to trudge miles in the heat wearing heavy bullet-proof fatigues to conduct anti-rebel operations in the forested area.         
	Shahnawaz Khan, the camps commandant, said jawans often turned aggressive when denied leave, though this wasnt true of Harpinder. He had returned from his native Amritsar in June.

	London, Sept. 21: A perceived Indian approach to cling on to life has been lobbed into the middle of a life-and-death question in Britain.        
	The poorest of the poor in India invariably want to cling on to life, according to a Scottish clergyman-cum-surgeon.        
	Reverend Dr Donald MacDonald, 66, from the Free Church of Scotland, made the impassioned plea as an attempt was being made to introduce a bill in the Scottish parliament to legalise assisted suicides.        
	Under devolution of powers, Scotland has jurisdiction on a wide range of domestic affairs but the question of assisted suicides is a troubling issue.        
	Everyone interested in the subject is watching the passage of the private bill introduced by Margo MacDonald, an independent member in the Scottish parliament.        
	A special committee has been set up to examine the legislation which would make Scotland the first part of Britain to change the law, which currently leaves Scots open to prosecution for culpable homicide.        
	Rev. MacDonald (no relation to Margo), who was among those who opposed the bill, said he had experienced treating the poor and needy while working in India but he had found they always wanted to cling on to life.        
	If we go down this road of hastening the end of life by whatever means, then we push on that whole idea that life does come to a line where its not worth living any longer and people should have autonomy to end their lives. It may be that thats extending it beyond whats proposed in this bill, but its an inevitable, logical consequence of such thinking.        
	From his home in Edinburgh, Rev. Macdonald, now confined to a wheelchair, told The Telegraph that as a 29-year-old old surgeon, he went to the Christian Hospital in Lakhnadon, Madhya Pradesh, where he worked for 15 years before illness forced him to return to Scotland and become a clergyman.        
	He retains fond memories of his time in India and the hospital., located not far from the Waingunga River, the heart of Kipling country.        
	He had treated desperately poor and sick people. There was death all around them but they wanted to live. Their relatives wanted me to do everything to keep them alive. If the patient died, there was much wailing but ultimately a stoic acceptance of death. The assisted suicide legislation in the West would make people less human, he said.        
	The reverends comments came as Prince Charles expressed concern about suicides among farmers in India.        
	Charles attended a UK-India polo match in Windsor which raised funds for the Bhumi Vardaan Foundation, a charity which he launched during a visit to India in March 2006 to promote sustainable agriculture in the Punjab.Charles said he was concerned about the high levels of suicides among landowners in the region after a downward spiral of debt, declining incomes and increased infertility of the land.        
	The money raised will be split between the princes own British Asian Trust and the foundation which seeks to ensure a viable way of life for todays farmers and future generations.        
	In Windsor, the British Army Polo team beat Indias Sherdills 4-3 for the inaugural Saragarhi Cup. in the match played at the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club.        
	The match was organised by the Anglo-Sikh Heritage Trail, which said it had united British and Sikh players in an effort to support the work of two charities bringing lasting change to disadvantaged communities in South Asia.        
	Manoj Badale, chairman of the British Asian Trust and also chairman of the IPLs Rajasthan Royals, added: Support from the proceeds of the Saragarhi Cup Polo Match will help the trust meet the greatest needs of the poorest communities.

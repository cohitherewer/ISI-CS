The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ulfa chief detention buzz returns 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ulfa chief detention buzz returns 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, May 19: A person returning from a business trip in China has been held in Bangladesh, prompting the Indian government to verify whether he is Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua.        
	Officials in India and Bangladesh are moving with extreme caution  almost a fortnight has passed since the detention  as several similar alerts had turned out to be false alarms earlier.        
	Unconfirmed reports also said Anup Chetia, Paresh Baruas close aide who had been in Bangladesh for over 10 years, was handed over to officials in New Delhi tonight.        
	Sections in the security establishment want to double-check the identity of the suspect in Bangladesh  a difficult task, considering the sketchy details about Paresh Baruas current physical description. Agencies in India so far were depending on a photograph of Paresh Barua that is more than 15 years old.        
	Another section in the Indian security establishment believes that the arrested man is Paresh Barua. Modalities are being worked out on how, when and where the suspect will be handed over to Indian authorities, a source said.         
	But the same source conceded: Even we are unaware when exactly he will be handed over. Usually, the authorities  in most cases, its the BSF in Meghalaya  are informed of an operation only hours before a handover.        
	If the suspect is indeed Paresh Barua, the chances of a transfer are brighter now because of the change of guard in Bangladesh. The Sheikh Hasina government had handed over Ulfa leader Arabinda Rajkhowa and NDFB chief Ranjan Daimary recently.        
	Last year, Paresh Barua went to China to buy arms from a local company and shuttled between Ulfa camps in northern Myanmar and the Yunan province of China.         
	Earlier this month, he is believed to have entered Bangladesh through Teknaf subdivision in the Coxs Bazar area of southern Bangladesh.         
	The sources said the person suspected to be Paresh Barua was lodged in a safe house and was being questioned by the Bangladesh intelligence agency, Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI).        
	The Ulfa commander-in-chief has been absconding since 1990.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nun rape trial shifted to Cuttack
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nun rape trial shifted to Cuttack
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 31: Orissa High Court has transferred the trial in the nun gangrape case from Baliguda in Kandhamal district to Cuttack.        
	The order came on a petition filed more than 11 months ago by the nun, who apprehended that a free and fair trial was not possible in the Kandhamal region.        
	Justice Indrajit Mohanty ordered for the inter-district transfer of the trial yesterday after the state counsel did not raise any objection against shifting.        
	In her petition, the nun stated that there could not be a free trial of her case in the fast-track judicial magistrate court at Baliguda. She also said she did not feel safe there anymore. There was always a threat to my life in Baliguda after the incident (of her rape amid riots) and the situation has not improved in the locality, she said.        
	She had sought direction for shifting of the trial in the case out of Kandhamal to any other part of Orissa, preferably to Cuttack, invoking inherent powers of the high court under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code.        
	On the victims plea, the high court had on April 15, 2009, imposed restrictions on proceedings involving deposition by the gangrape victim in the trial court at Baliguda and deferred the proceedings for an indefinite period.        
	The 29-year-old Catholic nun was allegedly gangraped at Nuagaon under Baliguda police station limits on August 25, 2008, during communal violence in Kandhamal district.        
	Earlier, the high court had allowed petitions filed by the nun seeking shifting of venue of two test identification parades from Baliguda to any other place in Orissa. Consequently, the two TI parades were held at the Choudwar jail near Cuttack. While 19 people had been arrested, three youths were identified by her during the two TI parades. The state CID-crime branch, which had been probing the case, has already submitted chargesheets against the persons identified by the nun.

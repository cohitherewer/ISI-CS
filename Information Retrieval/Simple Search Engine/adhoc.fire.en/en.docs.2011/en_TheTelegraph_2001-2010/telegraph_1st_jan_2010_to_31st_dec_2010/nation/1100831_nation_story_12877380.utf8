          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Rajendra Pachauri                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 30: An international review has urged fundamental reform in the management of the UN climate change agency that sparked controversy last year after, among other things, revelations that its predictions about Himalayan glaciers were unsubstantiated.         
	The Inter-Academy Council (IAC), an organisation of the worlds science academies, has called for greater scrutiny, improved procedures and changes in the leadership structure of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which is chaired by Indias Rajendra Pachauri.         
	Pachauri himself and UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon had requested the IAC review in March 2010 after mounting controversy over several issues, including disclosures that the IPCC forecasts on climate change may have contained unsubstantiated claims that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by the year 2030.         
	We were eager for a thorough examination. Our credibility had been challenged, and we realised that only an exhaustive, impartial, independent review would be acceptable, Pachauri said today at the UN in New York, after the release of the IAC report. We were prepared to accept whatever results were forthcoming.         
	The Himalayan glaciers problem arose after some IPCC authors tasked with reviewing scientific literature on the glaciers picked up material from non-scientific sources  so-called grey literature, non-peer-reviewed material  and included them in climate change assessment reports.         
	The IAC has said the current IPCC guidelines for inclusion of such non-peer-reviewed material are vague and need to be made more specific. It has recommended that such material be appropriately flagged in its periodic assessment reports.

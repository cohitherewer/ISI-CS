	Thiruvananthapuram, April 9: An airport worker quizzed over last months Kingfisher plane-bomb scare but let off as an insignificant link committed suicide today, apparently convinced he wouldnt get a Gulf job because the episode had tarred his record.         
	Sunil Lawrence, 24, left behind a note addressed to ACP Jolly Cherian, who had questioned him, congratulating him for eventually catching the culprit, a colleague who had planted the bomb to spite a duty manager.         
	Lawrence, who said he had been scared of police from childhood, called a friend before ending his life saying his Gulf dream was over.

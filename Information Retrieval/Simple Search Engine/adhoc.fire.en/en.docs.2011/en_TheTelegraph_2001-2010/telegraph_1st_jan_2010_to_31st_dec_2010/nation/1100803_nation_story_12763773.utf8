The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Partial gain for army women
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Partial gain for army women
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          First step                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 2: The army has agreed to offer permanent commission to all the eligible women officers now holding short service commission in its legal and education wings.        
	But it is not yet ready to admit women to combat corps at all, let alone grant them permanent commission.        
	Subject to training and qualifying, they (current women officers) will be offered permanent commission in education and law. This exercise will be completed within two months, the defence ministry today told the Supreme Court.        
	The exercise will cover only the 33-odd serving women officers in these two branches of the army, and not women officers who have already been released at the end of their short service commission.        
	The apex court is hearing the defence ministrys appeal against a high court order that directed the army and the air force to offer permanent commission to all women officers. The air force has complied with the order but not the army, prompting the high court to issue contempt notices against the army chief and the defence secretary.        
	The apex court rapped the government today when it argued that Section 12 of the Army Act did not allow women entry into any area of the army except non-combat spheres like law and education. The court asked if the army had complied with its own rules and granted women permanent commission in these non-combat areas.        
	If you grant them short service commission, why not permanent commission? You first grant women in these (non-combat) areas permanent commission, then we will decide on whether they could be allowed permanent commission in other areas, the bench of Justice J.M. Panchal and Justice Gyansudha Mishra said.        
	Appearing for the army, solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium opposed permanent commission for women in combat areas. He said the nature of the duties of short service officers and permanent commission officers were different, as also was their training.        
	Those who apply for short service officers category have to take only 29 weeks training but permanent commission officers have to go through a 46-week course, Subramanium said.        
	Those training to be permanent commission officers should be in a position to command troops into the battlefield. Those in short service commission do not have to lead troops.        
	Subramanium added that the permanent commission officers in the infantry, armed corps, artillery and the ordnance corps were trained for 15 to 20 years to lead troops into battle.        
	The court has stayed contempt proceedings till the army completes the exercise of offering women permanent commission in education and law.        
	It has asked the government to explain why women could be granted permanent commission in the air force but not in the army, and why women can be granted short service commission but not permanent commission.

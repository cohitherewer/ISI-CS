	Calcutta, Sept. 21: The Mamata Banerjee-led railways have not invited Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to tomorrows foundation ceremony of Calcutta Metros Joka-BBD Bag line to be presided over by President Pratibha Patil.        
	A cabinet colleague of the Bengal chief minister, transport minister Ranjit Kundu, was reportedly sent an invitation late this evening but he refused to accept the last-minute gesture, saying: It is a question of dignity.         
	Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is scheduled to attend the programme.        
	Bhattacharjee chose to stay silent on the matter. Asked if the omission of his name was a violation of protocol, the chief minister looked the other way as he was leaving Writers Buildings for lunch this afternoon.        
	But Kundu spoke out against the omission. It is unfortunate. This shows lack of basic courtesy. A gross violation of protocol, this could not have happened in (the case of) any other state. I dont know much about protocol, but the state government is part of the project, he said before his own office received the invite.        
	A senior official in the chief ministers secretariat said there is no well-defined protocol on the chief ministers participation in such events but it is a question of courtesy and convention. It is a convention when the President or the Prime Minister attends a programme, the chief minister should be invited, the official said.        
	Mamata reportedly told her aides tonight that she would not share the dais with the CPM ministers at any programme because they are attacking me and killing people with their armed cadres.         
	In August last year, too, Bhattacharjee was not invited to a railway event.

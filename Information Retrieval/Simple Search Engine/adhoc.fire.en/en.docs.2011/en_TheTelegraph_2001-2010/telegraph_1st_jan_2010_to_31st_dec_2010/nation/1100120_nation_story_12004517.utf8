The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karats half-smile draws a blank
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Karats half-smile draws a blank
          BISWAJIT ROY                          Brinda Karat                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 19: Sonia Gandhis warm feelings for Jyoti Basu today translated into courtesy for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Sitaram Yechury but failed to thaw the post-nuke deal frostiness with Prakash and Brinda Karat.        
	The UPA chairperson exchanged pleasantries with the chief minister and Yechury, as well as expelled CPM leader and former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, but did not speak to Karat or his wife and fellow politburo member.        
	Sonia even recognised former chief minister Bidhan Chandra Roy, who died half a century ago, from a photograph but showed no visible sign of recognition when the CPM general secretary gave her a half-smile.        
	Karat was not in the chief ministers Assembly chamber when Sonia was led there by Bhattacharjee after she had paid homage to Basu. With them were Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, CPM politburo member Yechury, Somnath and several others.        
	Brinda sat with Basus son Chandan and his family and a few senior CPM leaders. Sonia consoled Chandan and his family members but exchanged no greetings with Brinda.        
	It was state CPM secretary Biman Bose who brought Karat in after a few minutes, apparently in an effort at a thaw.        
	As Karat walked in, eyewitnesses said, he nodded and gave Sonia a half-smile and sat down at one corner of the sofa placed opposite the Congress president across a table.        
	Sonia, engrossed in conversation, took notice of his presence but did not nod back or speak to him.        
	She and Mukherjee left shortly, with Bhattacharjee, Yechury and Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim seeing them off.        
	Earlier, Brinda  the only politburo member who stood by Basus body, misty-eyed, almost through the day  had stepped off the dais where the body had been placed just before Sonia arrived to pay homage. She returned sometime later.        
	Sources said that at the chief ministers chamber, Sonia wrote a message in the Assembly condolence book. Then she, Mukherjee and Yechury reminisced about Basu.        
	Taking the cue from Mukherjee  who was talking about his memories of working with Basu and about the former chief ministers role in Bengal and national politics  Sonia too remembered Basujis long association with our family.        
	She recalled her meeting with Basu in 2004 when the CPM patriarch played a key role in the formation of the first UPA government.        
	At some point, Bhattacharjee pointed to a photograph of former Congress chief minister Bidhan Chandra Roy with whom the young Basu had a politically adversarial but personally warm relationship.        
	Yes, I know him, Sonia said.        
	The Congress presidents regard for Basu was evident from her condolence message.         
	On behalf of the Congress party and on my own behalf I mourn comrade Basu, a leader of vision and conviction, idealism and accomplishments, high values and practical realism who served his people, his country and his party with total dedication and absolute selflessness. He will be missed by us all, she wrote.        
	Many in the Congress and the CPM felt that her reference to Basus practical realism was a subtle way of underscoring the contrast between him and those at the helm of the CPM today.        
	Basu, who had fought bitter battles against the Congress all his life, preferred it to the BJP as the lesser evil and had disapproved of the CPMs withdrawal of support to the first UPA government. That move facilitated the Congress-Trinamul alliance in Bengal at the CPMs electoral expense.        
	Some in the Left were today desperately trying to read a political message in Sonias visit, clutching at what may be political straws such as Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs earlier visit to Basus bedside and Mamata Banerjees absence from the Assembly today.

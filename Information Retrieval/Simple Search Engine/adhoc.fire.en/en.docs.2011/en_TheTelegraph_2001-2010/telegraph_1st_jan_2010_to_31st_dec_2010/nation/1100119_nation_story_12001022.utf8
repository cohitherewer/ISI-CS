          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 18: Cupid did what the police could not.        
	Love for each other prompted a Maoist couple to shun their arms and live a life of peace and happiness.        
	The couple  Dharmarao Kumbulika, alias Srinu, and Kamanuguda Ramanna, alias Banaja  decided to surrender before the Rayagada police yesterday.        
	While Srinu belonged to Murtali village under Chandili police limits in the district, Banaja hails from Sitampeta Mandal in Srikakulam district in Andhra Pradesh.        
	Both are hardcore Naxalites and have been handling sophisticated weapons since 2003 during numerous attacks. The duo were members of the Koraput-Srikakulam area division committee of the rebels. Both are of area committee-member rank, Sanjiv Panda, the deputy inspector-general of police (south-western range) said.        
	The Naxalites surrendered with their arms after getting disillusioned with the Maoist ideology, he said.        
	The cadre decided to forgo arms and shed the Maoist ideology as they wished to marry each other and start a new life.        
	While Srinu was involved in Nayagarh, R. Udayagiri and Damanjodi attacks, Banaja was involved in the last two attacks. She was also involved in civilian killings and some other Naxalite-related incidents in Koraput district.                          
	The surrender took place in presence of Panda, Koraput SP Sanjeev Sahu and his Rayagada counterpart Anoop Krishna.        
	On December 30, the Rayagada police witnessed yet another surrender when Laxmi Pidika decided to lay down arms. Laxmi, too, was against the decision of her senior cadres who wanted her to marry a Chhattisgarh cadre instead of a tribal youth wih whom she had been in an affair for the past few years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Oldest militant was a beggar
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Oldest militant was a beggar
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, April 17: A man dubbed Kashmirs oldest militant and killed by the army on Wednesday has turned out to be a beggar, prompting the embarrassed security wing to modify its claim.        
	Defence spokesperson Lt Colonel J.S. Brar had said the army had killed an elderly militant in Pahaldagi village of Handwara in North Kashmir in a joint operation with police and seized an AK-47 rifle from him. The police had put his age at 65 but distanced themselves from the operation.        
	The army today altered its statement, this time claiming the deceased was being exploited by the militants. This was a group of terrorists and possibly the deceased was being exploited as a guide or human shield. It is believed that the weapon and ammunition recovered was possibly dropped by the fleeing terrorists, the spokesperson said today.        
	A family from Devar Lolaab in Kupwara has identified the slain person as Habib-ullah Khan, a beggar who had left his home a day earlier.        
	Tahir Khan, the nephew of the deceased, said the family became worried when he did not return home. We were later told that a picture has appeared in local dailies, bearing a stark resemblance to my uncle. He could barely walk and we were shocked to learn that he had been dubbed a militant, he said.        
	The family approached the district collector of Kupwara, Showkat Ahmad Mir, today with an appeal to exhume the body.        
	Mir said the administration gave permission and the body was exhumed. He was later buried in his native village. The police are investigating the matter and let us see what comes out of it, he said.         
	The police said they are likely to file murder charges against the troopers. An FIR describing him as a militant had been registered earlier.        
	Defence spokesperson Brar added that based on intelligence inputs indicating presence of a group of terrorists with guides, an operation was launched by troops of 6 Rashtriya Rifles, 21 Rashtriya Rifles and a special forces units in General Area Khurmur Forest.        
	He said on the intervening night of April 13 and14, a surveillance-cum-ambush party had noticed the movement of three to four militants.        
	On being challenged, a gun battle broke out. After the encounter which lasted 15 minutes, the terrorists managed to escape in the thick jungles. After daybreak, one body was recovered while one AK-47 with ammunition was found in close vicinity of the body, he said.        
	The officer had on Wednesday claimed that the armys patrol parties, along with the police, had an exchange of fire with a terrorist which led to his death.         
	The issue has kicked up a political storm. Sheikh Abdul Rashid, the MLA of Langate constituency, said it is atrocious that the army killed an innocent civilian and then dubbed him a militant.         
	The army officer who has made this false claim has insulted the law, and should be arrested, he said.

	Srinagar, July 19: A teenager was killed and more than 12 persons were injured when security forces fired at a funeral procession in Kashmirs Baramulla district today.        
	Fayaz Ahmad Khanday died after he took a bullet in his chest. He was taking part in the funeral procession of Farhan, a Class VII student who fell into a river and drowned while being chased by security forces two days ago.        
	Sources said some people in the procession threw stones at police and CRPF personnel posted in front of the district commissioners office. The security forces retaliated by firing and bursting tear-gas shells, the sources claimed.         
	A police release claimed that someone in the mob fired at them. The release said the security forces fired in the air in self-defence.        
	Earlier in the day, a 26-year-old boy died after his vehicle was accidentally hit by a police car in Srinagar.

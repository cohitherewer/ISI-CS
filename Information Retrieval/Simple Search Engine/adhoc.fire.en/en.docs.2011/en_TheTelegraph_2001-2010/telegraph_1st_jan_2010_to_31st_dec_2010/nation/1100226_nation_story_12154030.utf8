	New Delhi, Feb. 25 (PTI): The government today cleared the womens reservation bill, which seeks to provide 33 per cent reservation to women in the Lok Sabha and the Assemblies but has been pending for over a decade because of lack of political consensus.        
	A meeting of the Union cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister approved the bill, which had already been introduced in the Rajya Sabha and was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on law and justice and personnel.        
	The committee, which gave its report in December, had recommended passing of the bill in its present form and suggested the issue should not be left to the discretion of political parties.        
	Sources said since the bill is the Houses property, the Business Advisory Committee would decide on when to initiate a debate on the bill.

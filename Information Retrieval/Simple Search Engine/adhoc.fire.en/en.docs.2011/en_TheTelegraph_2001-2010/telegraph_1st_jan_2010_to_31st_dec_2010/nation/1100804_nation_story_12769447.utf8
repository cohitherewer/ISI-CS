The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong washes hands of Kalmadi
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong washes hands of Kalmadi
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Suresh Kalmadi                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: The Congress is deeply worried about the corruption allegations against the Commonwealth Games organising committee and has refused to defend its chairperson Suresh Kalmadi, who is also a party MP.        
	Who am I to give certificates? Congress spokesperson Shakil Ahmad said today, when asked if he would vouch for Kalmadi.        
	In response to queries about the corruption charges against the Games, Ahmad had minutes earlier said the personal integrity of (sports minister M.S.) Gill and (urban development minister Jaipal) Reddy is beyond doubt. He spoke in a similar vein about Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit. The three are directly involved in the management of the Games in their official capacity.        
	Grilled about how he could defend three out of four persons under a cloud, the Congress spokesperson responded: I know my ministers. But I am not involved with the management of Commonwealth Games. How can we say something without a proper inquiry. The person who is facing the charge will clarify himself.        
	This suggests the party has doubts about Kalmadis role.        
	Asked if the Congress was satisfied with the over- charging of items  almost 200 to 500 per cent more  Ahmad said: We are surprised. The rates appear unrealistic.        
	This is almost an admission the Congress thinks something is wrong with the conduct of the Games managers.        
	Asked about the Oppositions demand for a joint parliamentary probe, Ahmad said: Right now we want the Games to be held in a successful manner.        
	Many senior leaders flatly refused to answer questions about Kalmadi, saying any wrongdoers would be brought to book only after the Games are over. The leadership is wary of further derailing the preparations for the Games by asking for action against the organising committee now.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Chennai, March 13: If coalition politics is a journey, the preferred mode of transport, at least in Tamil Nadu, is a golf cart.        
	It offered a smooth ride to the ruling alliance trio of Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and M. Karunanidhi here today.        
	From the six-seater golf cart, the ailing chief minister showed the Prime Minister and the UPA chairperson around the new Assembly hall complex that the DMK-Congress combine hopes to continue to dominate after next years state elections.        
	For Karunanidhi, getting the Rs 450-crore edifice, his dream project, inaugurated by Singh in the presence of Sonia amounted to a political statement too.        
	The 86-year-old chief minister has been disturbed by reports that Rahul Gandhi was looking for new political partners in Tamil Nadu. Several state Congress leaders have been trying to convince the Gandhi scion about the winnability of a Congress-ADMK front in the May 2011 Assembly elections.        
	But Karunanidhi used todays meeting to underscore that the DMK-Congress ties were on a firm footing.        
	Many attempts were made through rumours and through the media to derail the smooth relations but the strength of our friendship overcame all that, he said amid cheers. He recalled the words of Indira Gandhi in the run-up to the 1980 Lok Sabha elections  when she had revived political ties with the DMK  that whether as an ally or adversary, Karunanidhi would remain unflinching.        
	It is the same steadfastness that characterises the DMKs present alliance with the Congress, Karunanidhi said, citing how the combine had won the last three elections: to the Lok Sabha in 2004 and 2009 and to the Assembly in 2006.        
	He thanked the Congress Big Two for making Tamil Nadu their first stop after passing the historic womens reservation bill in the Rajya Sabha.        
	In the context of Tamil Nadu having been in the forefront of womens empowerment, your presence today is all the more significant, Karunanidhi said. He recalled that the DMK had felicitated Indira after she had nationalised banks, and Pratibha Patil after she was nominated as the countrys first woman President.        
	To ensure his Delhi friends understood his prepared Tamil speech, Karunanidhi had thoughtfully given them English translations. Sonia and Singh were equally generous, saying the DMK had been an unwavering partner and a pillar of strength.        
	Whenever we have faced any problem, Mr Karunanidhiji has been the first person the Prime Minister would call for advice and guidance, Sonia said, bringing a smile to the veterans face. Though many experts worked on the Assembly complex, the spirit behind it was Karunanidhis creativity and commitment.        
	Some might have chosen to see an irony there: with the Assemblys main hall still incomplete, Karunanidhi had got film art director Thotta Tharani to build a makeshift dome for it for the inauguration.        
	Singh said his government had greatly benefited from the wisdom, knowledge, experience and leadership of Karunanidhiji. I have turned to him often for advice. He has been in our public life for over half a century. We are truly fortunate that we can draw on his experience and wisdom in managing the affairs of our nation.

	Islamabad, May 6: Pakistan has ruled out any legal assistance to Ajmal Kasab, saying it needed to draw a distinction on where to provide support as it called for bringing all the 26/11 plotters to justice.        
	It is incumbent upon the government of Pakistan to provide whatever assistance possible to its nationals abroad but we need to draw a distinction where legal assistance is required and where it is not, foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Basit said at a media briefing in Islamabad today.        
	Basit was responding to a query if Islamabad would provide any legal help to Kasab. Pakistan has strongly condemned the horrific Mumbai attack, Basit said. It is important that the culprits are brought to justice.        
	Pakistan has already indicted seven suspects accused by New Delhi of involvement in the Mumbai attacks. The suspects include Lashkar-e-Toiba leader Zaki-ur Rehman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind of the attacks, and four facilitators, Hammad Amin Sadiq, Mazhar Iqbal alias Abu Qama, Abdul Wajid alias Zarar Shah and Shahid Jamil.        
	The other two, Jamil Ahmad and Muhammad Younis Anjum, were arrested after a July 2009 meeting between Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Yousaf Raza Gilani at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh.        
	Basit did not think the death sentence would have a negative impact on the efforts to resume the stalled peace process between the neighbours. It is important to avoid such assertions as the two countries have agreed to resume dialogue and Pakistan is approaching the resumption process in that spirit, he said.        
	In Faridkot, Kasabs native village in Pakistans Punjab province, residents said the young man was being punished for being Pakistani. He is Pakistani, thats why he is going to be hanged, said Mohammad Ramazan, a retired schoolteacher. Its a conspiracy.        
	Another Faridkot resident, Mohammad Ramazan, said he didnt think Kasab was involved and it was a conspiracy against Pakistan. He said Faridkot had been portrayed as a village harbouring terrorists since the Mumbai attack. We are peace-loving people, we are not terrorists, he said.

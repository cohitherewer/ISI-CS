	Calcutta, Sept. 19: Hundreds of tourists from Bengal are feared stranded in Uttarakhand where heavy rain has triggered landslides and floods that have killed over 60 people in two days.        
	From ashrams to accommodation offered by complete strangers, the tourists have been forced to put up wherever they have found room.         
	SAIL official Santanu Banerjee has been living in the house of a trader at Maletha village near Badrinath with his wife Swati and son Shambo since Friday. We were to take a train home from Hardwar on Saturday, but couldnt make it, the Howrah resident said over the phone late tonight.        
	His hosts have been hospitable. We are surviving on khichdi cooked by Narinder Gusains family, he said.        
	Banerjee said landslides stopped them thrice on the way to Hardwar. Twice, we moved after the debris were cleared. Near Maletha, the landslide was very big.         
	The state government has sought the help of the army and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, PTI quoted a government spokesperson as saying. At least seven people are still trapped under the debris of flattened houses, he added.        
	The Ganga is flowing two metres above the danger mark in Hardwar and Har-Ki-Pauri is under water. The Met office has predicted more rain in the next 48 hours.        
	Police told us there are landslides every 3km. They said it would take four-five days to clear the roads, said Ramprasad Mondal, an Air India employee who is part of a group of 10 staying at the Bharat Sevashram Sangh Ashram in Badrinath. Two other families from Calcutta are also stuck here.        
	Monsoon is not the season to visit the region, but tour operators said many pilgrims have gone there this time. We apprehend at least 200 tourists from Bengal are stuck in Uttarakhand, said Anil Punjabi, the eastern India chairman of the Travel Agents Federation of India.

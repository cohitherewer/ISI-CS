          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Purulia, Aug. 29: A Purulia railway station was closed tonight for seven hours after Maoists warned the staff against working during a bandh called by the rebels tomorrow to protest Jnaneswari prime accused Umakanta Mahatos killing.        
	Sixteen trains, including the Tata-Amritsar Express, will be diverted, rescheduled or truncated so they do not pass the Urma station between 10pm (Sunday) to 5am (Monday), a top rail official said.        
	After security agencies assessed the threat this evening, it was decided to close the station tonight. No staff will report for duty during this period. The situation will be assessed again tomorrow. With Urma station being repeatedly threatened by Maoists, it is possible that we may decide to close it down temporarily, A.K. Garkare, the divisional manager of South Eastern Railways Adra section, said.        
	Over 30 armed rebels stormed the station, around 345km from Calcutta, around nine last night. Six to seven of them entered the station and, waving guns, herded the staff to a room. They told us not to run trains and stay away from duty on Monday, said assistant station manager Bimal Ghosh.        
	The rebels left after warning the staff that they would have to face the consequences if they did not heed the diktat, Ghosh said, adding the insurgents put up posters with the threat on the station building.        
	The RPF arrived this morning and took the posters away for examination. But another employee feared for his safety. If we attend work tomorrow, what is the guarantee of our safety? he asked.        
	Urma station has been a Maoist target a number of times over the past year. Attempts have been made to blow up the tracks twice. On August 6, the station manager and four others were detained for around 90 minutes at a nearby temple while the Maoists put up posters.         
	The station is close to the Ayodhya Hills, where the Maoists are known to have hideouts. The nearest RPF post is at Purulia station, 24km away. The closest police station is 8km away.

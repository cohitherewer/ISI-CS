   Elite centres to teach dance and music           CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Kapil Sibal                                        
	New Delhi, March 29: The human resource development ministry is starting two sets of elite residential schools that will for the first time in India teach students from Class IX onwards only the sciences and culture.         
	The Planning Commission has approved 10 science magnet schools, that will only teach science subjects to students and will offer students opportunities to interact with top scientists, government officials have told The Telegraph.         
	The HRD ministry is likely to take the proposal for setting up the science magnet schools to the cabinet soon.         
	These schools will be run by the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS), which today approved the plan at a meeting of its top executive body headed by HRD minister Kapil Sibal.         
	The NVS runs a chain of over 590 residential schools in all districts of India barring Tamil Nadu, which has stayed out of the Navodaya Vidyalaya movement started by Rajiv Gandhi 25 years back.         
	Sibal also proposed a set of cultural Navodayas that would offer specialised schooling  like the science magnet schools  in fields of the fine arts like dance, music or painting, sources said.         
	These are path-breaking schools that we hope will play a crucial role in making science and culture popular academic and career prospects once again, a senior government official said.         
	Navodaya Vidyalayas offer classes from VI-XII. They conduct a selection examination to pick students. The aim behind the schools is to provide top educational opportunities to meritorious children from poor backgrounds.         
	But unlike the mainstream Navodaya Vidyalayas, the science magnet schools and the cultural Navodayas will start only from Class IX.         
	In India, Class IX students study subjects across streams  sciences, social sciences and mathematics, apart from at least two languages.         
	But at the planned elite schools, students will receive specialised schooling  dependent on the mandate of the schools.         
	The science magnet schools will be set up specifically in the neighbourhood of the countrys top science hubs  such as near the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, the Indian Institute of Science and the IITs.         
	These apex science research institutions will hand hold the schools and will provide opportunities for the students to interact with their researchers and scientists, sources said.         
	We have spoken to these science hubs and they are very excited to be part of this initiative, a source said.         
	The government is hoping that the science magnet schools will help create a catchment of potential young scientists.         
	The NVS will also work on firming up a blueprint for Sibals proposal of cultural Navodayas and plans to roll these out soon, sources said.

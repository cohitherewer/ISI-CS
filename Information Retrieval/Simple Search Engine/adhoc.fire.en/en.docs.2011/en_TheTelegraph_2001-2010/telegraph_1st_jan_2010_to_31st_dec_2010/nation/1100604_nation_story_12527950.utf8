The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sex abuse charge against general
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sex abuse charge against general
          SUJAN DUTTA                          Lt. General AK Nanda. File picture                                  
	New Delhi, June 3: The army is investigating an allegation of sexual misconduct against a top general in its headquarters but is also suspecting that he is being victimised by jealous competitors within the force.        
	There are some allegations. There are a large number of loopholes in the account of the allegations against Lt. General A. K. Nanda, the engineer-in-chief, an army headquarters source said. We are investigating. There are interested parties. There is rumour mongering, he added.        
	So intense is competition at the top of the service that envy and avarice among peers can not only mar reputations built over decades but also threaten to destroy families.         
	This afternoon, a large section of the media was also unwittingly dragged into the petty rivalries in the top echelons of the force where too many generals are jostling for too few posts. By evening the channels were forced to temper their reports.        
	We are surprised at this sensational story when we have no information, a defence ministry official said. Both the ministry and the army have habitually suppressed and delayed information or have confirmed it only when it is carried as news, such as the Sukna land-transfer case shortly before General V.K. Singh took over as the chief in March.        
	The slur was hurled against the lieutenant general, one of the principal aides to the army chief, as a scoop leaked to a news agency this afternoon and was immediately picked up by TV news channels that flashed his pictures without verifying the information.        
	It was also put out that the lieutenant general, from the Bengal Sappers (engineers) regiment, had either resigned or had been asked to put in his papers by the army chief, General V.K. Singh.        
	Lieutenant General A.K. Nanda has neither resigned nor been asked to put up his resignation, the written statement from the army this evening said.        
	There is one instance of the army finding a general guilty of sexual misconduct that is officially acknowledged. In 2008, an army court martial found a major general, A.K. Lal, guilty of sexual misconduct with a junior officer, a captain, in Ladakh.         
	The major general was at that time commanding the Leh-headquartered 3 Infantry Division and was in a position of authority that he was charged with abusing.        
	The top general against whom the allegations were levelled last month heads the engineers branch of the army. The wife of a junior officer has alleged that he had misbehaved with her during a five-day official visit to Israel in the second week of May. But the generals wife said she was accompanying her husband and there was no such incident.        
	The lieutenant general who is 59 years old and due to retire in three months is forbidden under military law to speak out in public unless he is authorised.        
	The wife of the junior officer, a colonel who was the lieutenant generals technical adviser, complained to the Army Wives Welfare Association that is headed by the wife of the army chief.         
	The complaint was made after the colonel was posted out of Delhi to Bhopal. The lieutenant general has headed the Border Roads Organisation.

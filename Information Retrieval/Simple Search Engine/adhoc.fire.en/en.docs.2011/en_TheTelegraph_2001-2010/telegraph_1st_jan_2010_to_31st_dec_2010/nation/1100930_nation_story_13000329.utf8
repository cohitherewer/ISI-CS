	Srinagar, Sept. 29: The Jammu and Kashmir government today set up two committees to review areas declared disturbed under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act.        
	Two committees, comprising civil, army and police officers, one each for Jammu and Kashmir provinces, have been constituted to review areas declared disturbed under AFSPA. The committees will carry out a detailed review and submit their recommendations to the apex committee, B.R. Sharma, the principal secretary, home, said.        
	The apex panel, headed by chief minister Omar Abdullah, will have the final say on accepting the recommendations. Reviewing whether an area is disturbed or not is a pre-condition to lifting the act.        
	The decision to set up the committees follows a visit by an all-party team and the announcement of an eight-point plan to defuse the ongoing crisis. Sharma announced the decision after a Combined Unified Headquarters meeting chaired by Abdullah. It was also decided to immediately release stone throwers.

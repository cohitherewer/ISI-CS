	Gaya, April 27: About 12 students of Gaya Engineering College were injured in a clash with bandh supporters near Barki Payen village under the Buniadganj police station area this morning.        
	As the students insisted on going to the college defying the bandh, villagers attacked them with lathis and pelted stones at them, injuring some of them.        
	The three seriously injured students referred to the PMCH, Patna, have been identified as Suman Saurabh, Ashwini Kumar and Rohan Kumar, said engineering college officer-on-special duty Anil Kumar. Others  Ayush Mani, Md Firoz Alam, Gopal Prasad, Hari Om, Rakesh Kumar, Shailendra Kumar, Shubham Kumar Sinha, Rohan Kumar and Gautam Kumar  were admitted to the Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital here.        
	According to Anil Kumar, the attack on the students was pre-planned and it had little to do with the bandh. He added that it might have been fallout of a clash between some students and an autorickshaw driver last week.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      4-year jail for Aman seniors
          MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR                      One of the four medical students held guilty in the Aman Kachroo ragging   case outside the court 
  in Dharamshala 
  on Thursday. (PTI)                          
	Shimla, Nov. 11: Four students accused of ragging that resulted in the death of teenager Aman Kachroo at a government medical college in Himachal Pradesh were today convicted and sentenced to four years.        
	A Dharamshala fast-track court held the four  all final year MBBS students of Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College in Kangra guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and other sections of the IPC.        
	The judge rejected the prosecutions argument that they be convicted of murder under Section 302 of the IPC, for which the punishment is a life term.        
	Ajay Verma, Naveen Verma, Abhinav Verma and Mukul Sharma have also been fined Rs 10,000 each  the sum will be given to the victims family  and will have to serve another six months if they fail to pay.        
	The judgment came 20 months after the incident triggered an uproar and prompted the state government to pass a law making ragging a cognisable, non-bailable offence.        
	The maximum punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder is 10 years but the court awarded a four-year jail term after the defence argued for leniency saying the students had already spent time in jail.        
	Special public prosecutor Jiwan Lal Sharma, however, said the four should have been convicted for murder under Section 302 and hinted that the state government may move the high court against the fast-track courts decision.        
	The four students were present in the court when the sentence was read out.         
	Amans father Rajendra Kachroo suggested the punishment should have been harsher but still termed the judgement a victory. I see the judgement as a victory. It is a landmark judgement which will play a big role in curbing the menace.        
	The fast-track court had released all four accused on bail in July this year but Himachal Pradesh High Court, acting on its own by taking suo motu notice, cancelled it and asked the fast-track court to hear the case on a day-to-day basis. I would not have seen this verdict today, Kachroo said, referring to the high courts intervention.        
	Aman, 19, died on March 8, 2009, from injuries after being beaten by the four students, who were drunk at the time. The post-mortem report mentioned brain haemorrhage as the cause of the death.

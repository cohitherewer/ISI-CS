The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | January handover likely for Ulfa leader
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      January handover likely for Ulfa leader
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: Ulfa leader Anup Chetia may be handed over to India by Dhaka in January, while top Paresh Barua aide Antu Chowdang, arrested in Bangladesh, may be deported soon.        
	There have been two recent developments that could provide impetus to the peace talks process between the Centre and Ulfa.         
	One, Ulfa leaders led by Arabinda Rajkhowa have decided to hold a meeting of the top leaders after Chetia arrives and take positive decisions. Paresh Baruas name has not figured in their list of leaders.        
	Two, Baruas adamant attitude took a severe beating with the arrest of Chowdang on December 16 in Bangladesh. Chowdang was the vital right hand to Barua, and took care of his supplies of arms and ammunition and struck deals on his behalf.         
	Barua, sources said, is residing in a camp in the Sagaing region of northern Myanmar. Although he is under indirect protection of Naga rebel leader S.S. Khaplang, who controls the area, Barua still has the independence to shuttle between China and Myanmar.         
	The arrest of one of his aides has its advantages for India. For one, it exerts extra pressure on Barua, and for now, has hampered his gun-running business.         
	Barua, according to Indian intelligence agencies, is emerging as one of the top gun-runners in South and Southeast Asia.        
	Fortunately, New Delhi wields leverage that can be used at least against Baruas aides.         
	Chowdang has at least one case under Section 302 IPC (for homicide) and cases are pending under several sections of the Arms Act, a source said. According to procedure, the home ministry will send necessary papers to Dhaka for the early deportation of Chowdang to India.        
	Chetia is serving a sentence in a Dhaka jail. The proposal for his release was sent earlier this year and a reminder sent after interlocutor P.C. Haldar and Rajkhowa finalised the involvement of Chetia in the talks.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee                                  
	New Delhi, Nov 9: Mamata Banerjee tonight wooed top Bengal cadre bureaucrats with hilsa and chital, with an eye on the Assembly elections next year.        
	The Trinamul Congress boss hosted a dinner at the home of party MP and junior shipping minister Mukul Roy. The invitees were mostly state cadre officials based in Delhi or on deputation elsewhere.        
	She did not say anything political but amid all the personal attention she granted, she did not forget to underline that Bengals future lay with how the states bureaucrats performed, an invitee said.         
	Although unstated, Mamatas message was not lost on him or the other bureaucrats present.        
	She had given officials a similar treat last year, shortly after becoming the minister for railways. But with Assembly elections now only months away, the aspirant for chief minister is wooing bureaucrats with renewed urgency.         
	Tomorrow night, Mamata will host the capitals media at the residence of Trinamul MP and junior health minister Dinesh Trivedi.        
	On November 1, Mamata had hosted a dinner for industrialists in Calcutta.

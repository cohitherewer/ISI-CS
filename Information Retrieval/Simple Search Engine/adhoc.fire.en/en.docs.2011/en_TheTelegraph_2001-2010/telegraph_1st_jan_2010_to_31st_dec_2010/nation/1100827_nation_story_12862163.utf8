          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: Haripur, a probable site for a nuclear power plant, may have fallen off Russias radar because of protests against the project by farmers and fisher folk with Trinamul Congress support.        
	Our agreement with the Russians provided for two nuclear power plants being set up by them. While the site for one at Kudankulam (in Tamil Nadu) was fixed, the Russians have to indicate the other site, Union minister for science and technology Prithviraj Chavan said today.         
	The Centre, supposedly at the prodding of the Bengal government, had been trying to get the Russians into selecting Haripur as the second site for a 1,000MW plant.         
	But a Planning Commission source said the Russian firm Rosatom was not keen to set up the plant in Haripur, partly because of the agitation by fishermen and farmers against the proposed plant. The Russians will look at other coastal sites for the nuclear power plant, the source in the plan panel said.         
	In March this year, police in Bengal said arrested Maoist leader Telugu Deepak had confessed that his mission was to build a rebel base at Haripur in East Midnapore.         
	Sources in Delhi have hinted that the Russian firm could be more interested in a site in Bengals neighbour Orissa for the second nuclear plant.         
	Coastal Haripur was considered a suitable site because its population density is relatively low.         
	The government has selected two other coastal sites  Mithi Virdi in Gujarat and Kovvada in Andhra Pradesh  for nuclear plants to be set up by US-based companies. In Jaitapur, Maharashtra, a nuclear power plant will be set up by French firm Areva.        
	Atomstroyexport, Russias nuclear power equipment and service export company, has been building two reactors since 2002 on the basis of a 1999 agreement signed between India and Russia.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Policemen in Srinagar on Saturday. (Reuters)                                  
	Srinagar, Aug. 14: Hundreds of protesters today stormed the Hazratbal shrine and clashed with police when they tried to flush them out, leaving more than a dozen people injured.        
	Elsewhere, two youths died as the CRPF fired on protesters in south Kashmirs Anantnag and Srinagars Narbal this evening. Protesters also attacked army and police camps and clashed with the security forces in several parts of the state.        
	Hundreds of people, including women and children, defied curfew in Srinagar and forcibly entered the Hazratbal shrine, the states holiest Muslim place of worship, to pray.        
	They ignored appeals over loudspeakers by the policemen on guard. Reinforcements were rushed in and the security forces fired in the air. They also fired tear-gas shells on the shrine compound to flush out the protesters.         
	The police cane-charged the mob and many were injured. I saw blood oozing from an elderly womans head, said Shakeel, a protester.        
	A police officer said nobody had suffered bullet injuries. However, many protesters claimed the shrine was damaged in the police firing.         
	In 1993, the shrine became the scene of one of the worst militancy-related crises in the state when militants laid siege to it, setting up a month-long stand-off with the army. The militants later left following an amnesty offer.        
	Two years later, a group of militants took over a building adjoining the shrine before being killed in an encounter with the security forces. Security has been beefed up at the shrine since then.        
	Curfew was clamped in Srinagar and other major towns today following the death of four protesters in yesterdays police firing. However, protesters defied the curfew and clashed with the security forces. Irshad Ahmad Latoo was killed in CRPF firing in Anantnag. Three people received bullet injuries.         
	The protesters threw stones at CRPF personnel and vehicles when the forces were withdrawing in the evening. The forces tried their best to control the mob by using minimal force. However, we had to resort to mild firing in self-defence after the protesters refused to relent, a CRPF spokesperson said.        
	During a similar clash in Narbal on the outskirts of Srinagar, a youth identified as Omar Dar was killed in firing by the security forces.        
	A police spokesperson said: A mob threw stones at an army camp on the outskirts of Sopore town today. He said a CRPF head constable was hit by a stone in the face.        
	In north Kashmir, a five-year-old girl who was being taken to hospital was injured when a mob enforcing a shutdown threw stones at her car.        
	Chief minister Omar Abdullah today asked the Centre to initiate action to restore autonomy to the state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mr Pachauri, an observer, not a cop, for you
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mr Pachauri, an observer, not a cop, for you
										      Our special correspondent                              Pachauri (top); Ramesh				                           
	New Delhi, Feb. 4: India has offered to provide its own domestic assessments of climate change in the South Asian region as institutional inputs to the UN climate agency which had to recently retract an alarmist prediction about the Himalayas.         
	Environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh said today that India would provide the regional assessment by a network of Indian scientists to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as input for its fifth assessment report due in 2014.         
	More than 200 scientists from dozens of institutions across India are engaged in assessing climate change and its impacts on agriculture, water and health in different regions of the country.         
	Ramesh also announced that the Indian government would depute a senior scientist of its choice to accompany IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri as an observer to the panel meetings to contribute to the process of developing the content of IPCC reports.         
	The first scientist picked to accompany Pachauri is Subhodh Sharma, an advisor in the ministry who has spent more than two decades involved in climate science analysis.         
	Were not sending (Sharma) as a policeman  hell observe, network and contribute to the process, Ramesh said. The IPCC rules allow the chairperson to be accompanied by a scientist from his or her country, ministry officials said.         
	Ramesh also said the Indian government was backing Pachauri 100 per cent.         
	A senior ministry official said the Indian effort would fill in a gap in regional climate change science. Scientists had, for instance, pointed out last year that none of the models used by the IPCC could accurately predict rainfall over India.         
	The initiatives come after the IPCCs recent retraction of a prediction made in its fourth assessment report of 2007 that most of the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035. The IPCC admitted the error only after an alert by the Indian government.         
	Environment ministry sources also said there were other concerns about the contents of the IPCCs summary for policy makers.         
	A section of the summary dealing with what could be done to mitigate climate change was based largely on the peer-reviewed work of a single research group. There appeared to be a lack of diversity in the peer-review process, Ramesh said today.         
	The IPCC should be a climate science agency, not a climate evangelist, he said.         
	Weve been on the receiving end twice, he said. In the 1990s, Ramesh recalled, US scientists had suggested that Indias wet paddy fields spewed some 38 million tonnes of methane  a greenhouse gas  into the air each year. A team led by physicist A.P. Mitra launched its own research and established that the actual amount was much lower  less than six million tonnes per year.

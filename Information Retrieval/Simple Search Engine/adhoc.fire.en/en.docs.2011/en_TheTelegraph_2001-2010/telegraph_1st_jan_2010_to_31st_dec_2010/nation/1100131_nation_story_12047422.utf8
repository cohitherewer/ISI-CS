          FARHANA KALAM                              
	Gaya, Jan. 30: A youth died in police custody yesterday after allegedly being thrashed by the cops.         
	The victim, Aftab, 27, died on way to the court where he was to be produced.         
	He worked as a tailor in Mumbai and he was here to attend a religious ritual in his native village, Bhaon, under the Anti police station of the district.        
	Alma, the deceaseds mother-in-law told reporters at Gaya court that Aftab was picked up by the Anti police last night and he was mercilessly beaten by the cops.        
	Denying the allegation that Aftab was thrashed by the police leading to his death, superintendent of police Sushil Khopade said the man had trespassed into a villagers house around midnight and was subsequently caught by the villagers. The infuriated villagers thrashed the man before handing him over to the police.        
	Khopade said the Tekari deputy superintendent of police had been directed to conduct an inquiry and submit his report.         
	Hope for dwarfs        
	Dwarfs may get benefits available to physically challenged persons. During chief minister Nitish Kumars Bodh Gaya janata durbar on Friday, Onkar Dubey (22), measuring about 30 inches, approached him with a request to get some financial assistance as he had no source of income. Nitish directed the officials concerned to get the rules suitably amended to enable dwarfs to receive allowances payable to physically challenged persons.

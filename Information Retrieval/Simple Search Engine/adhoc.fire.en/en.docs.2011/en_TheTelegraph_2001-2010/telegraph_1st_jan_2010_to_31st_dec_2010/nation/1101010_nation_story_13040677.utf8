  - Gandhi scion buys ticket like other spectators amp; sits among them        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul Gandhi at the Commonwealth wrestling arena on Saturday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 9: VIPs, learn from Rahul the commoner.        
	For the second successive day, Rahul Gandhi sat in the spectators gallery to watch boxers and wrestlers fight it out at the Commonwealth Games, entering the stadium after buying tickets like any ordinary sports lover.        
	The young MP walked in accompanied by his SPG guards, sat among the spectators and even obliged kids who queued up for his autograph.         
	If the Congress general secretary was trying to shame the capitals VIP breed, known for their freeloading habits, it wasnt immediately clear if he had succeeded.        
	In Delhi, anybody who is somebody angles for passes for any important event. A pass is, after all, a status symbol.         
	But Rahul did send across a message  sometimes, they might as well condescend to buy tickets like a commoner and not hanker for a pass.        
	A Games source said there was a lesson in Rahuls conduct for Delhis so-called VIPs. It would help us to turn down their unreasonable demands in the future, he added.        
	Yesterday, Rahuls nephew and niece came to catch the action at the swimming stadium. The kids, children of his sister Priyanka, sat alongside other spectators.         
	Sources said the children refused to be shifted to the VIP enclosure. So unobtrusive was their behaviour that nobody in the crowd had an inkling they were sitting beside members of the Gandhi family, said a police official.        
	At the other end of the stadium, Khazan Singh Tokas, former swimming champion and venue manager, battled requests from numerous personal assistants of bureaucrats and politicians for free access for friends and relatives.        
	The kids father, Robert Vadra, was with Rahul at the neighbouring boxing stadium. Rahul, a boxing enthusiast, sat at the stadium for over two hours and watched Indias Vijender Singh win his bout.         
	Vijender later said he was honoured to have Rahul in the stands. There was added pressure because Rahul Gandhi was there, he said.        
	Rahul later hugged Vijender when the boxer went up to him to shake his hands.         
	Today again Rahul was back at the boxing stadium before he went over to the wrestling venue to catch the action.        
	Before Rahul, home minister P. Chidambaram had led by example when, on October 4, he visited the swimming stadium. Chidambaram sat in the VIP lounge but his daughter-in-law and granddaughter sat among the spectators in the general galley.         
	Chidambaram refused an offer by officials to accommodate them in the VIP lounge.

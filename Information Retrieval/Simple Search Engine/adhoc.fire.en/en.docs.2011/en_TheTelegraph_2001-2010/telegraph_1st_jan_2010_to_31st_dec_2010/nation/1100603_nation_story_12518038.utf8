	Cooch Behar, June 2: The Left Front has retained the Dinhata municipality despite the buzz that the Trinamul Congress would make inroads into the Forward Bloc bastion.        
	The Left won 13 of the 15 wards, while Trinamuls tally was unchanged from the 2005 polls at two. The Congress, which had two wards in the outgoing body, was wiped out.        
	Trinamul had cut its teeth in north Bengal by winning the Dinhata seat in the 2006 Assembly elections, sparking the buzz that it would fare better in the civic polls.        
	But the hopes seemed to have been belied. Only Ashok Mondol of Trinamul, who had defeated late Bloc stalwart Kamal Guhas son Udayan in the Assembly polls, won today. The second winner was Rabi Dey.         
	All the nine Bloc candidates romped home. The CPM, which had fielded five candidates and supported an Independent, won four wards.        
	Political observers said Udayan had concentrated after his 2006 defeat on strengthening the Blocs organisation, which had been riddled with factionalism, the divisions deepening after the demise of his father.        
	Another major factor was the close and co-ordinated strategies that he adopted with the CPM in the district, something that is rarely seen, an observer said.        
	The rapport marks a turnaround from the situation in the aftermath of February 5, 2008, when five Bloc supporters were killed in police firing outside the Dinhata subdivisional office, pitting the Left allies against each other. This had an effect in the May 2008 panchayat polls where Trinamul made inroads , the observer said.         
	However, all is not lost for Trinamul in the Cooch Behar district, which covers Dinhata. Overall, the partys tally up from six to 15 wards in the four municipalities of the district.        
	We are satisfied with the results and the people have voted in our favour, Guha said.        
	Trinamul district chief Rabindranath Ghosh said: We will have to analyse the results, that is all I can say at the moment.

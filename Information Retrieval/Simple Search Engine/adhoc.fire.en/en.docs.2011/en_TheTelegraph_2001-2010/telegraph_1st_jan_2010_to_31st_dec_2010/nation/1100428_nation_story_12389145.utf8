          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, April 27: Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren today supported the UPA government on the cut motions, stunning alliance partner BJP and setting the ball rolling for possible political realignments in Jharkhand.        
	It is a serious issue and will be discussed at our party forum, Jamshedpur MP and BJP leader Arjun Munda said.        
	The BJP leadership has summoned its ministers from the state to discuss the ramifications of Sorens tacit attempts at installing son Hemant as chief minister.        
	Soren, an MP from Dumka, must become an MLA within six months of being sworn in. That deadline ends on June 29, but he has so far been unable to find a safe seat, leading to speculation he was stalling to install son Hemant.        
	Sorens move has sparked fresh speculation in Ranchi that Guruji had opened up a channel of communication with the Congress. He has the option of exploring the possibility of joining hands with the Congress and Babulal Marandis JVM if the BJP refuses to make Hemant chief minister.

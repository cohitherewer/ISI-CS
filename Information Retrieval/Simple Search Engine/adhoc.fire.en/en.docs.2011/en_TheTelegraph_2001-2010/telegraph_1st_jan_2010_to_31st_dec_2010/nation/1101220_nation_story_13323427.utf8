The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wen skirts K-word in Pak
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Wen skirts K-word in Pak
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                              
	Islamabad, Dec. 19: Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao ended his Pakistan trip today without a word on Kashmir, the unexpected silence coming days after his then host India had snubbed Beijing by skirting the traditional One China refrain.        
	Indian officials said they did not want to read too much yet into the omission of the K-word from the joint statement by the inscrutable Chinese. They said Beijing was already doing enough to be provocative on Pakistan and Kashmir.        
	Still, in the past, all visiting Chinese leaders such as former Premier Li Peng had unequivocally backed Islamabads position on Kashmir, seeking a solution in keeping with the UN resolution and asking India to work for peace and security in the region.        
	Wen avoided mentioning Kashmir even in his speech today to a joint session of the Pakistani parliament, which he began with an As salam--alaikum (Peace be upon you).        
	Analysts here termed it a balancing act. For, the joint statement at the end of Wens India trip last week too was marked by twin omissions.        
	Beijing had kept mum on Pakistans export of terror while, for the first time in years, New Delhi had refused to commit itself on paper to the One China outlook that accepts Tibet as an integral part of the northern neighbour.        
	Pakistani officials said that during Wens visit, the two countries had signed business deals worth at least $35 billion, more than double the worth of deals signed in India last week.        
	Analysts say China is investing so hugely in Pakistan for two reasons: because it sees the country as a genuine friend, and because it irks India. Some said it carried a message for Washington too.        
	Chinas massive investment (in Pakistan) proves two things. One is that China is a genuine ally of Pakistan and second, it is a clear signal to the US that if the US supports India against China, China will support Pakistan, said independent analyst Hamayoun Khan.        
	They (China) do not want Pakistan to be entirely dependent on the US and the International Monetary Fund, and then get dictation from them.        
	The Chinese Premier almost seemed to be reminding the Pakistanis of their physical distance from America when he said: We in China say it is better to have a good neighbour than a relative who lives far away.        
	Wen lauded Pakistans efforts to battle al Qaida, just days after the US had said Islamabad could do more to crack down on militants, especially along the Afghan border.        
	He said terrorism must not be linked to any country or religion  there should be no dual standards in this regard  and called for efforts to address the real reasons behind the menace.        
	Wen, the first Chinese leader to address a joint sitting of Pakistans parliament, drew cheers when he said Pak-China dosti zindabad (long live Pakistan-China friendship), a phrase that carried an echo of the erstwhile Hindi-Chini Bhai Bhai slogan.        
	There was thumping of desks when he reaffirmed that Pakistan and China were all-weather strategic partners and share the sorrows and joys of each other as close brothers.        
	China is the main supplier of defence and military hardware to Pakistan and has helped Islamabad build its main nuclear power generation facility and is helping build another one.        
	Although no public announcement has been made about the future course of the civil nuclear cooperation, sources told The Telegraph that China had promised Pakistan behind the scenes to help meet its growing energy needs.        
	America, which has a civil nuclear deal with India, has refused to have a similar pact with Pakistan.        
	Strengthening and promoting strategic, brotherly relations is our joint strategic choice and they are in the interests of two countries and their people, Wen said, adding that his country was even ready to explore the possibility of a currency swap with the ally.

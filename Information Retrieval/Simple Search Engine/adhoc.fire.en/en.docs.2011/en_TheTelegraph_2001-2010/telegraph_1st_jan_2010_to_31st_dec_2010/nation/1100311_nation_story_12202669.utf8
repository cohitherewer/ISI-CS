The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Striking varsity staff punished
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Striking varsity staff punished
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, March 10: The Magadh University administration is acting tough against striking non-teaching employees, lodging FIRs against some of them and suspending 12 today.        
	The employees stopped work at the university headquarters on February 25, demanding pay parity with their counterparts at the secretariat.        
	Following failure of several rounds of talks between the striking employees and the university authorities, the varsitys officiating vice-chancellor, Bilat Paswan Shastri, put 12 employees, including office-bearers of the non-teaching employees union, under suspension.         
	The suspended union president, D.K. Dinkar, has gone into hiding with other leaders since afternoon.        
	Before issuing the suspension letter, university proctor N.K. Yadav lodged an FIR against the employees in the university police station under Sections 143, 147, 323, 353, 504 and 506 of the IPC.         
	According to Shastri, the strike had been declared illegal, as the mandatory notice had not been served by the union. Cautioning the employees against the consequences of the illegal strike, he urged the employees to resume duty, failing which strong action, including suspension and service termination, would be taken. Paswan made it clear that the government had refused similar pay scale of the employees and the secretariat employees.        
	He added that the employees had acted irresponsibly, as the strike has put into jeopardy the future of thousands of students at this crucial moment when the administration was making all efforts to maintain the examination schedule. Final-year examinations are slated to start early next month.        
	However, the unions general secretary, Amarnath Pathak, told The Telegraph from an undisclosed location that vindictiveness of the authorities will ultimately prove to be counter-productive as the employees were determined to get their demands fulfilled.         
	According to sources, HRD secretary K.K. Pathak asked Magadh division officials to ensure the arrest of the employees. The sources said eviction orders were also likely to be served to striking employees living in the quarters.

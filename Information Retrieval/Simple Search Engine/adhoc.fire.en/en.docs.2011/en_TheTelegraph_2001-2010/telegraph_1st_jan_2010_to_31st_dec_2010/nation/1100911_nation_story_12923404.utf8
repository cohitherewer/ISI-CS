	Washington, Sept. 10 (PTI): A 29-year-old Indian-origin truck driver was arrested by US authorities for allegedly trying to smuggle over 100kg of cocaine worth nearly $3.6 million in one of the largest drug bust cases in America.         
	Canada-based Ravinder Kumar Arora was arrested as he appeared extremely nervous during primary questioning when attempting to leave the US at the Lewiston-Queenston bridge on the US-Canadian border. As a result, he was targeted for an outbound enforcement examination, according to federal officials.         
	Authorities examining the empty commercial trailer, which was headed for Canada, found that the floorboards of the truck had been tampered with. Officers noticed that non-factory screws had replaced originals in the floorboard. When the board was removed, 97 vacuum-sealed bricks containing cocaine were found.

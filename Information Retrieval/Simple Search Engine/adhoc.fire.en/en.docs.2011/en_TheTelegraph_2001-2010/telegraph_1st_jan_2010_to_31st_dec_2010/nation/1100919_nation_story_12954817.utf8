          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 18: A speeding car tonight hit and injured an Anandabazar Patrika journalist and another reporter as they stood by Red Road talking to a police sergeant about a hit-and-run involving a horse.        
	All three, including sergeant T.K. Pal who suffered spine injuries, have been admitted to hospitals.        
	Parijat Banerjee of Anandabazar was given seven stitches on the forehead at a private hospital on the EM Bypass.         
	Sulaghna Sengupta of The Statesman has injured her right leg.        
	The scribes were speaking to sergeant Pal about the horse that was killed in a hit-and-run case near the Gandhi statue at Maidan when the car hit them.        
	The horse was killed in the accident around 7pm and Parijat and Sulaghna reached the spot around 7.30pm.        
	Recounting what had happened, Sulaghna said: We fell down after the speeding car hit us. Parijat was bleeding profusely. Some policemen came after some time and took Parijat to a private hospital and me and the sergeant to SSKM.         
	Pal has been released after treatment.        
	A traffic police officer said: It appears that the car grazed them. Had the vehicle hit them head-on, the accident could have been fatal.         
	The police are yet to trace the car.

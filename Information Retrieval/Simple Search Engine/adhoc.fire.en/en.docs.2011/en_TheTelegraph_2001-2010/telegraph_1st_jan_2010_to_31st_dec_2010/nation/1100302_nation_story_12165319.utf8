          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, March 1: The Supreme Court has clarified that land-losers can challenge the compensation awarded by a collector within six months of coming to know of it to avoid unreasonable discrimination.        
	Till now, an application for higher compensation had to be filed within six months of the collector announcing the award.        
	The ruling came on appeals filed by some Uttar Pradesh villagers against a high court judgment that rejected their plea for a review.        
	Permitting the villagers to make a fresh application, the top court ruled that though the Land Acquisition Act says a compensation can be challenged within six months of the collector making the announcement, it couldnt be literally interpreted.         
	If the words six months from the date of the collectors award should be literally interpreted as referring to the date of the award and not the date of knowledge of the award, it will lead to unjust and absurd results, the court said.        
	For example, the collector may choose to make an award but not to issue any notice under Section 12(2) of the act, either out of negligence, oversight or ulterior reasons. Or, the court said in its ruling last week, the collector might send a notice but not bother to ensure it had been served on the landowner as required under Section 45 of the act.         
	If the words date of the collectors award are literally interpreted, the effect would be that on the expiry of six months from the date of award, even though the claimant had no notice of the award, he would lose the right to seek a reference (for higher compensation).         
	That will lead to arbitrary and unreasonable discrimination between those who are notified of the award and those who are not notified of the award.         
	To avoid such a situation, the words date of the collectors award is required to be read as referring to the date of knowledge of the contents of the award, the court said.         
	The court also noted that during land acquisition, there was a tendency on the part of the collector to be conservative which results in less than the market value being offered.         
	The land-loser, the court added, is invariably required to make an application to get the market value.        
	In the case on which the ruling came, the collector of Banda district had on March 14, 2007, announced a compensation for land taken over to build a market.         
	The villagers were served a notice on October 25 by the office of the collector to appear and receive the compensation. They made enquiries and, on November 16, learnt that an award had been made on March 14.         
	The villagers immediately made an application for increasing the amount. On December 19, 2007, the collector rejected their application, saying it had been made more than six months after the award was announced, and refused to forward the plea to a civil court.         
	The appellants then filed a writ petition in the high court. On January 17, 2008, the high court dismissed the petition, saying the villagers ought to have sought a waiver of the delay along with the application for increasing the compensation.

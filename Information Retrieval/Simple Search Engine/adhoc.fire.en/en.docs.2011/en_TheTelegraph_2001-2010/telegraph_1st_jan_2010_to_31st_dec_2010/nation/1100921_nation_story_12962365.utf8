The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | To tweet or not to tweet, My Lord
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      To tweet or not to tweet, My Lord
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 20: Humble question, My Lord, does it behove you to tweet?        
	The law ministry has sought to know from the Supreme Court if judges can air their views through blogs or online interactive mediums such as Twitter and Facebook, or whether they should hold their silence and speak only through judgments.        
	The ministrys move comes at a time some judges have taken to voicing their opinion on such networking sites, creating a flutter in the conservative judicial circles.        
	Sources said a letter was sent recently to the Supreme Court secretary-general and registrars-general of 18 high courts asking them to collect and pass on to the ministry information about judges who have been blogging or tweeting their views.        
	The letter, according to the sources, was prompted by a parliamentary question on whether high court judges were airing their voice through blogs and Twitter.        
	The query also wanted to know if it was not against the code of conduct of the judges. And if so, what preventive measures were being taken to check the trend?        
	Although the law ministry says it needs to have its reply ready, the real reason could be that the department, which handles appointments and transfers of judges, wanted to be kept in the loop on whether blogging was endemic.        
	The first off the blogging blocks was Karnataka High Court judge D.V. Shylendra Kumar. The judge used his blog justdvskumar to criticise the Supreme Court collegium, headed by then Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, for proposing to elevate Justice P.D. Dinakaran to the apex court despite land-grab allegations against him.        
	He also spoke out against Balakrishnans opposition to declaration of assets by judges.         
	The top court ultimately bowed to public pressure and put judges assets in the public domain, but not before Kumar had posted details of assets owned by him and his wife Veena in defiance of the generally held judicial view against declaring assets.        
	Kumar also exhorted netizens and citizens to speak out against errant judges and the secretive collegium.         
	Lawyers said the maverick Kumar was an exception rather than the rule. They said he was at an age that made him ineligible to be considered for elevation to the Supreme Court and so doesnt care.        
	Sources in legal circles said there was no rule against judges using such interactive mediums, but they should avoid airing their views on such networking sites lest they land in unwanted controversies.         
	Judges should certainly avoid any interplay with the public on their views. This would seriously undermine their impartiality, constitutional expert Rajeev Dhavan said.         
	If Justice Kumar doesnt care, Justice K. Kannan, a much younger judge of Punjab and Haryana High Court, found out that he had bitten off a bit more than he could chew.         
	Justice Kannans blog mnkkannan.blogspot.com came with the rider not to seek legal advice and allegedly got a hit too many for his liking. Sources said he couldnt withstand the heat and stopped blogging altogether.        
	No other instance of a judge blogging or tweeting has come to light, but it has been enough to send the normally cloistered judicial establishment into a tizzy.         
	Under a self-framed stringent code of conduct, judges are expected to hold their silence and only speak through judgments. This is an extension of the theory that taking a public stand on any issue likely to come up before them may compromise their impartiality. This explains the question sent by the law ministry.        
	In his last blog on September 12 last year, Justice Kannan was almost prophetic. The question, he wrote, is whether to be or not to be  on the blog, that is.

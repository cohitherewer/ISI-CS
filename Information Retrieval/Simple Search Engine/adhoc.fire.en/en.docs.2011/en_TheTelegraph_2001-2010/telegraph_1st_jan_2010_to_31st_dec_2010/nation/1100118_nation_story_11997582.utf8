The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Behind calm face, Alimuddin cries 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Behind calm face, Alimuddin cries 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Brinda at the hospital. (Pabitra Das)                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 17: The CPM headquarters put on its most stoic face on Sunday, a red flag flying at half-mast and a garlanded Jyoti Basu portrait at the entrance the only visible signs of a party in mourning.        
	Why do you want to know whats going on inside? Marxists dont display their emotions to the public, veteran gatekeeper Pradip Bose retorted on being asked how 33 Alimuddin Street was coping with Basus loss.         
	Pradip may not have known that state party chief Biman Bose had shed more than a few tears in public hours earlier, but his words mirrored the mood at the party office that Basu would visit regularly till mid-2008.        
	Senior CPM leaders huddled inside said they did not have anything to say beyond the brief official statements made by Bose, Bhattacharjee and party general secretary Prakash Karat.         
	Politburo member Brinda Karat reluctantly agreed to talk, and opened up as she recalled her association with Basu. I was in London in 1967 when I came to know that people there knew the CPM as Jyoti Basus party. I even wrote about it in my diary, Brinda told The Telegraph.        
	When she returned, Basu asked her to work at the grassroots. He told me thats where my place was. Over the years, I realised nobody can do what Comrade Basu has done. Once I did something wrong and he summoned me to Banga Bhavan in Delhi and told me nobody was above the party  that you must always abide by the collective decision, she said.        
	Former MP Hannan Mollah, sporting a black badge on his shirt, said he would remember Basu for a personal reason. When the Opposition was falsely spreading the word that I had four wives, he came to my campaign and stood up for me. It made such a difference, Mollah recalled, standing outside the office room where a handful of party workers were browsing through emailed condolence messages.         
	The customary evening tea with chire bhaja was served as usual a little after 4pm. Mohammad Salim and Rabin Deb, assigned the task of receiving guests, were seen discussing the arrangements with minister Manab Mukherjee. A police team from Lalbazar arrived around 5pm to finalise plans for the last rites.        
	If you didnt know Jyotibabu was dead, you would think this was just another day in office for us. Businesslike is the way we have always worked, said a leader who did not wish to be named.        
	Basu, never the sort to let his face mirror his mind, would have approved.

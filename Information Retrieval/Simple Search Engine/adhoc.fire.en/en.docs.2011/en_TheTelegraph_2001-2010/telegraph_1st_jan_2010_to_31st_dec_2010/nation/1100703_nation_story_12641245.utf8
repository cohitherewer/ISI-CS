The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Path paved for Uma comeback
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Path paved for Uma comeback
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      Uma Bharti                          
	New Delhi, July 2: BJP president Nitin Gadkari has done the spade-work for Uma Bhartis return.         
	Her homecoming is expected to be announced with fanfare just before the Bihar elections.        
	Umas opponents in Madhya Pradesh and Delhi have been assured she will remain confined in Bihar until the October polls and later Uttar Pradesh which goes to the polls in 2012.         
	Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and the state BJP president, Prabhat Jha, have protested her re-induction. Their views have been factored in, said a source close to Gadkari.        
	Chauhan  serving his second tenure in office  is particularly worried that he might become vulnerable to inner-party machinations because Uma, herself a former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, might become the rallying point for his detractors. However, Gadkari has reportedly asked her to stay away from state politics and not create problems for the government.        
	Uma like Kalyan Singh, the former Uttar Pradesh heavyweight, has the ability to combine the Mandal and Hindutva strands in her persona and politics.         
	That she is from a backward caste and has fought for them does not need to be emphasised. She is a Lodh-Rajput, a caste that does not have a presence in Bihar. But thats not the point because her appeal goes beyond her caste. She attracts a following among the other OBCs. Her commitment to Hindutva appeals to our cadres, a Bihar MP said.        
	While Gadkari worked on the return of Jaswant Singh and Uma, a source close to him said he was not keen on taking back Sanjay Joshi, a former general secretary who had exited in disgrace in 2005 after a CD came up with incriminating revelations of his alleged relationship with a woman.         
	For Joshi, this was a sacrilege because a hard-core Sangh pracharak like him is sworn to celibacy.         
	Although the RSS was keen on his return, Gadkari was not.         
	Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi had also put his foot down on Joshi. Their political rivalry dates back to the time when Joshi was in charge of the state and had allegedly fomented dissidence against Modi.        
	With the Bihar elections and the importance of the OBC votes in mind, the BJP has decided that its support to caste enumeration for the 2011 census will continue despite the RSS rejecting it. It is for the RSS to explain its position but we are not veering away from ours, a source close to Gadkari said.        
	The Group of Ministers (GoM) looking into the question decided in a meeting yesterday that it will consult political parties before going any further. We will reiterate our support. If the government seeks clarifications on other aspects of the issue, we will give that too, said BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar.        
	With the Congress split on the matter  in yesterdays GoM meeting, A.K. Antony and Kapil Sibal spoke out against a caste census while Mukul Wasnik and Salman Khursheed argued in its favour  the BJP hopes to grandstand for its OBC constituency.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Final thrust   on nuke bill
          OUR BUREAU                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: The Congress-led UPA is considering a weeks extension for the monsoon session to get the nuclear liability bill passed, and even a joint session of Parliament if the BJP continues to play hardball.        
	The plans unfolded on a day a meeting of the Congress core group decided to back the governments renewed thrust on the bill.        
	While negotiations with all parties are on, a joint session of Parliament is being considered the last option if the BJP does not soften its opposition to the bill.         
	A joint session will give the government the advantage of numbers by helping it overcome any lack of support in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.        
	If such a session is eventually called, it would have a touch of irony for the BJP: the NDA government had called a joint session to pass the anti-terror law Pota as it did not have the numbers in the Rajya Sabha.        
	Efforts to build a consensus have not been abandoned, though. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today met the Left parties and was learnt to have accepted some of their key demands.        
	The communists  who have been demanding that the bill be scrapped  termed the meeting fruitful, saying the government was receptive to their suggestions. Another round of talks is likely on Monday.        
	The bill requires the operator of a nuclear plant to pay up to Rs 500 crore in case of an accident. A Left MP said the government had agreed to hike the amount but was not ready to raise it to Rs 10,000 crore as demanded by the Left.        
	The government is ready to increase the cap to Rs 1,000 crore-Rs 1,500 crore but not to Rs 10,000 crore. The government was ready to accept 60-70 per cent of our demands, said CPM leader Basudeb Acharya, who along with party colleague Sitaram Yechury was among the Left leaders at the meeting.        
	Acharya claimed the government was also not averse to the suggestion that all references to the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage be dropped from the bill. The Left parties feel that if India joins the convention, it would have to accept the principle that there would be no liability on foreign suppliers. The liability will be limited to operators.         
	Sources said the Centre was ready to make changes to address the Lefts concerns about the proposed bills Clause 17, which deals with defective or faulty design of equipment and materials procured from foreign suppliers.        
	Other than Mukherjee, the leader of the Lok Sabha, parliamentary affairs minister P.K. Bansal and minister of state for science and technology Prithviraj Chavan represented the government. D. Raja of the CPI, Barun Mukherjee of the Forward Bloc and Abani Roy of the RSP were among the Left leaders at the meeting.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: Vice-President M. Hamid Ansari today turned the focus on the poor quality of elementary education, the apparent criticism coming at an event where HRD minister Kapil Sibal was also on the dais.        
	We must remember that ensuring access to education without a commensurate focus on quality and outcomes will result in the right to education remaining merely a right to schooling, Ansari said. He was speaking at a programme organised by Sibals ministry to commemorate the birth anniversary of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the first education minister of India. Sibal has promised reforms in various areas of education.        
	Ansari cited findings of studies carried out by the Centre-run education body NCERT and Pratham, an NGO, to express concern over poor quality at the primary level, especially in rural areas.        
	According to Prathams Annual Status of Education Report for 2009, while 96 per cent of the children in the 6-14 age group in rural areas are enrolled in schools, average absenteeism is around 25 per cent. Over 30 per cent of those in Class I could not recognise alphabets or identify numbers from 1 to 9.         
	Also, the percentage of Class V children in government schools with actual learning abilities of Class II students hasnt gone up from 50 per cent for the past four years. In other words, half the children in government schools in rural areas are three grade levels behind in terms of outcome and achievement, he said.

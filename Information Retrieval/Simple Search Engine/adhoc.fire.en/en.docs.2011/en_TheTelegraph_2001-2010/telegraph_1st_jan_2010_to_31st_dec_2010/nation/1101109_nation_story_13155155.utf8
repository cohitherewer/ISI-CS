The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | We are not in business of stealing jobs, PM tells US
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      We are not in business of stealing jobs, PM tells US
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Barack Obama and Manmohan Singh during the joint news conference in Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: Barack Obama today sought to calm fears over outsourcing, saying he hadnt made a bogeyman out of the issue and promised to convince Americans against protectionist steps as India was creating jobs.        
	The statement was made at a joint news conference with Manmohan Singh, who tried to remove the perception among many in the US that outsourcing was causing employment among Americans.         
	The Prime Minister asserted that India is not in the business of stealing jobs from the US. The outsourcing industry, I believe, has helped to improve the productive capacity and productivity of American industries.        
	The US President pointed to the sensitiveness of the issue when he highlighted the fact that 20 deals worth $10 billion, and with a potential to generate 53,670 US jobs, were signed in Mumbai on the first day of his visit.        
	When I go back to the US, a part of the reason that I advertised these (more than) 50,000 jobs is that I want to be able to say to the American people when they ask me why are you spending time with India when they are taking our jobs. I want to be able to say they actually created 50,000 jobs and thats why we should not be resorting to protectionist measures. We should not be thinking that its just a one-way street. I want both the citizens of the US and India to understand the ties between the two countries, the President said.        
	The statement comes at a time Indias $50-billion IT and IT-enabled services industry  which derives 60 per cent of its export income from American companies  is smarting from protectionist measures, including an increase in visa fees for Indian professionals, and a ban on IT outsourcing by Ohio state entities.         
	Singh underlined the threat from US protectionism by saying it was detrimental to both nations. On whether Americas concerns on job losses from outsourcing to India were misplaced, Obama said: First of all, I dont think you heard me make outsourcing a bogeyman during the course of my address in Mumbai.         
	He added that he had cautioned at a meeting of business leaders in Mumbai that both countries are operating on stereotypes that have outlived their usefulness and that the two had enormous win-win potential.         
	The industry saw hope. While US has not made any promises to end the ban against outsourcing, Obamas statement would definitely add strength to the campaign against protectionism, said the chief of an infotech firm.        
	Singhs statement alongside Obama today appeared similar to the position taken by Infosys founder-chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy who has said in the past that India need not be apologetic about outsourcing as Indian IT companies add significant value to US corporations and have made them more efficient.

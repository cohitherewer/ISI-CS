	 New Delhi, Nov. 8: The Supreme Court today decided to examine files relating to the appointment of new central vigilance commissioner P.J. Thomas after a PIL questioned his credentials.           
	The government had appointed Thomas despite allegations that he was involved in covering up the 2G spectrum scam. The court gave the government two weeks to prove he was an outstanding civil servant, a key criterion for appointment as CVC.                  
	 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday issued show-cause notices to the chief secretaries of four states, including Bengal, asking them why measures the Centre had suggested four years ago to insulate police from political interference had not been implemented. The chief secretaries of Bengal, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh will have to be present in court on December 6 to explain the failure.                   
	 Purulia: A Class VIII student of Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission Vidyabhavan in Purulia was found hanging in his hostel dormitory on Sunday. Sagun Murmu, 10, an Adra resident, had returned after the Puja vacation with brother Rimil on Sunday morning.

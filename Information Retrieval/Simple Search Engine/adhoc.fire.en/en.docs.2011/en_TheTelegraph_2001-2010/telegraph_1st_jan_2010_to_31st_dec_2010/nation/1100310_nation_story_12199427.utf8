The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | One who said nay 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      One who said nay 
          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, March 9: When the tally at the end of todays voting flashed 1 Nay and many Ayes on the screen, the question on top of the minds of Rajya Sabha members was: Who had said no?        
	The only man, it became clear soon, to have voted against the womens bill was Sharad Anantrao Joshi.        
	The 74-year-old Maharashtra farmer leader is from the Swatantra Bharat Paksha  successor of C. Rajagopalacharis Swatantra Party  and owes his Rajya Sabha seat to support from the BJP and the Shiv Sena. He advocates laissez faire, opposes the licence-quota-permit regime that defined pre-reform India, and farm subsidies.        
	I object to the lottery-cum-rotation system, said Joshi, the founder of the Shetkari Mahila Aghadi, said to be the largest organisation working for rural women. He believes womens reservation in the proposed form is a disaster.        
	Joshi fears the selection of constituencies through lottery would prevent elected representatives from developing the areas as they wouldnt be sure of representing the seat again.

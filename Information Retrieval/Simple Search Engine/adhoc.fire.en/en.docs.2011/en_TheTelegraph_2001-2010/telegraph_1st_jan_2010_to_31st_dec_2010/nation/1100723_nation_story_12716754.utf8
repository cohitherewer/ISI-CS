The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | First minister summoned in Sohrab case 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      First minister summoned in Sohrab case 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Amit Shah                                  
	Ahmedabad, July 22: Gujarats junior home minister and Narendra Modi confidant Amit Shah today ignored a CBI summons for questioning in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case and virtually went into hiding.        
	The CBI has issued a fresh summons for tomorrow and if Shah again fails to appear, an arrest warrant could be issued in what would be a huge embarrassment for the state government. Sources said Shah was considering applying for anticipatory bail.        
	Shah is the first minister to be called for questioning over the murder of the alleged gangster in November 2005, for which three senior Gujarat policemen and a Rajasthan officer have been arrested.        
	The noose had begun tightening around Shah after the CBI arrested Ahmedabad deputy commissioner Abhay Chudasama on April 28.         
	For the past few days, the minister has not been seen in public. He has not been attending office, fuelling speculation he has handed over his resignation to Modi, though this has not been officially confirmed.        
	Modi, who holds the home portfolio, has apparently been distancing himself from Shah, ensuring that the two of them are not seen together at any public event.        
	The summons reached Shahs office around 11am today, asking the minister to appear before the CBI by 1pm. Confirming that a second summons has been sent, a CBI official said: He has to appear by 1pm tomorrow.        
	Agency sources said they had evidence that Shah was in constant touch with the accused policemen and may have hatched the conspiracy to kill Sohrabuddin.         
	They claimed that apart from the call details of Shah and the police officers, witness statements pointed to the ministers involvement.        
	Besides, they said, Chudasama had been caught on camera warning a witness, sent as a decoy by the CBI, against naming the minister before the agency.        
	Sohrabuddin, who the CBI says was a small-time extortionist and worked for Chudasama, and wife Kauser Bi were allegedly picked up from a bus and killed, along with a witness, Tulsi Prajapati.        
	CBI sources have suggested Sohrabuddin had helped Gujarat police prepare a fake sex CD against former BJP leader Sanjay Joshi, a known Modi opponent, and was killed to eliminate evidence.         
	The state police had claimed Sohrabuddin was a terrorist on a mission to assassinate Modi.        
	The CBI has to file a status report by July 31 to the Supreme Court, which had asked it to probe the case after the state CID failed to make much headway.        
	Sohrabuddins brother Rubabuddin, who was in Ahmedabad today, said the CBI investigation was moving in the right direction and that he expected to get justice.        
	His lawyer Mukul Sinha demanded that Shah be sacked from the ministry since his continuation could hobble the investigations.        
	State government spokesman and health minister Jaynarayan Vyas said: The CBI will get full cooperation; we have always co-operated with the law and will continue to do so.        
	The state BJP, however, accused the Congress-led central government of misusing the CBI.        
	Those arrested in the case include Gujarat officers Rajkumar Pandian and D.G. Vanzara, then chief of the state anti-terrorism squad, and Rajasthan officer Dinesh M.N. as well as 10 other policemen.

	Bhubaneswar, June 7: Industrialist Tara Ranjan Patnaik today threw his hat in the fray for the Rajya Sabha elections as an Independent candidate backed by Congress.        
	I am not a dummy Congress candidate. I have the backing of other Opposition and Indpendents, said Patnaik after filing his nomination paper on the last day today.        
	He claimed that he enjoyed the support of 40 MLAs. I have already talked to all MLAs cutting across party lines and all of them have promised to lend their support to my candidature, Patnaik said.        
	However, before he filed his nomination paper, high drama took place for 16 hours after the BJP announced it would abstain from voting last night. The media managers of Patnaik were busy in roping in the support of the party MLAs and everything was set right before 11am today.        
	When Patnaik was busy arranging supporters for his candidature, the BJP was caught in a deep crisis. All the seven MLAs had intimated their party high command that they should be allowed to participate in the voting, otherwise it would be a cakewalk for the BJD candidate for the third seat. When the BJP high command realised that if they didnt go by the wishes of party MLAs, there would be a split in the party, the high command succumbed to the pressure.        
	BJP vice-president Ashok Sahu said they were forced to reconsider their stand after realising that it would only help the BJD to win all the three seats. We are caught between the devil and deep sea. If we abstain from voting, BJD will have a cakewalk. BJD is our principal opponent in the state and we will not allow them to win the election, Sahu observed.        
	The party MLAs will vote for Patnaik, as the later has assured that he will not join Congress after winning the election.         
	Meanwhile, BJP central leader M. Venkaiah Naidu is coming here tomorrow or the day after to asses the ground realities, Sahu said.        
	With Patnaik filing his nomination paper, the race for the third Rajya Sabha candidate has just heated up.         
	Political pundits observe that any thing can happen at the last moment.        
	As the arithmetic stands, the BJD has a comfortable strength to win the first two seats.         
	However, the ruling party is short of eight seats to win the third seat on its own strength. It requires 111 single preference votes to win the three RS seats. However, it has 103 MLAs in the 147-member Assembly. It is hopeful of support of the Nationalist Congress Party, which has four members in the House and all six Independents.        
	On the other hand, Independent candidate Patnaik claims to have the backing of all 27 Congress MLAs, seven BJP legislators and at least three Indpendents.        
	Thirty-seven first preference votes are required to win a Rajya Sabha seat in Orissa.

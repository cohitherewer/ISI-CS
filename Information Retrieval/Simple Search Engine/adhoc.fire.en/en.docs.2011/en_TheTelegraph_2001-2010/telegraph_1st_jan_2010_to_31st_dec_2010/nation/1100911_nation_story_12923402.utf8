	Dhaka, Sept. 10: Coach to cricketer  why werent you watching the ball?        
	I was looking out for bookies, Sir.        
	If you think this is a joke doing the rounds, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is dead serious.        
	As the Pakistan spot-fixing scandal once again turned the spotlight on alleged links between players and bookmakers, the BCB has decided not to take any chances.        
	It will soon start training young cricketers on how to spot bookmakers.        
	Bookies, after all, can be more dangerous than googlies; they can ruin your career.        
	It is important that we initiate such an awareness programme as there are a lot of young Bangladeshi cricketers who can fall prey to bookies, BCB media and communications manager Rabeed Imam said.        
	What happens, he explained, is that players are approached by agents who bring them sponsors. These people approach the players directly. So the (young) players have to be trained to spot whether the people who are coming to them are genuine or not.        
	But how do you spot the ones not genuine?        
	One sure way to avoid falling into the trap, Imam said, is to be circumspect while interacting with strangers. And rock back in defence when someone comes up with flattering comments.        
	So the moment a relative stranger says something like I am a fan, can I take you out for dinner? or Can I pay for your holiday?, or asks seemingly innocuous questions like What is the mood like in the team? or Can you tell me the batting order?, the players should be immediately wary.        
	In other words, no better substitute than keeping bat and pad close together, especially in unfamiliar situations.         
	We plan to use pictures, videos and dialogues to show the cricketers the ways they can be trapped, the approach a bookie might take, aspects of the game they might talk about that can be fixed, and also how to avoid such people. Many young players get into a personal relationship with agents, only to realise later that they want them for fixing matches. So we decided to plan the awareness programme, Imam said.        
	The BCB will impose curbs on cricketers on all future tours. Players will be told to avoid strangers and report every phone call they receive from unknown people.        
	Imam also said that veterans who have been approached by bookies would be involved in the programme to relate their experiences and tell the younger players.        
	The boards intention seems clear  if any player is caught fixing matches, they cannot claim innocence after having gone through such an extensive programme.         
	In a statement recently, the BCB said several senior players had been approached by bookmakers ahead of a Test series with India earlier this year. Vice-captain Shakib Al Hasan and opening batsman Tamim Iqbal were approached ahead of the two-Test series in January, which the home side lost, an official said.

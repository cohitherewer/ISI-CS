                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      China ready for UN talks 
                            
	Beijing, Nov. 9 (PTI): China has said it is ready for consultations with India on UN Security Council reforms.        
	But the Chinese state media played down Barack Obamas endorsement of New Delhis quest for a permanent seat in the Security Council by saying that the US Presidents cheque could not be cashed easily.        
	China values Indias status in international affairs, understands Indias aspirations to play a greater role in the United Nations and is ready to keep contact and consultations with India and other member states on the issues of Security Council reform, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hong Lei said.        
	China supports reasonable and necessary reform of the UN Security Council and will maintain priority to giving more representation to developing countries at the UNSC so that they can play a bigger role in Security Council, Hong said.        
	He said China wanted democratic and patient consultations.         
	Pak calls US envoy        
	A shocked Pakistan foreign office has called in the US envoy to convey its concerns over Obamas statement. The Pakistan foreign ministry was shocked by the announcement, diplomatic sources said today.        
	Foreign secretary Salman Bashir conveyed Islamabads disappointment to American envoy Cameron Munter last night.

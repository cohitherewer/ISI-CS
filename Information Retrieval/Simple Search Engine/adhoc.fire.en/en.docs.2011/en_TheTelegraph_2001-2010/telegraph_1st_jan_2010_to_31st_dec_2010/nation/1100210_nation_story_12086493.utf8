	Patna, Feb. 9 (PTI): One person was killed and 10 others, including policemen, were injured when students went on the rampage, demanding action against some private coaching centres which they alleged had duped them.        
	The unidentified victim, who succumbed to his injuries at a hospital, was accidentally fired upon by a guard posted in front of an institute, police said.        
	Three policemen were injured during stone-pelting and lathicharge, they said, adding three students had been seriously injured.        
	Trouble erupted when a large number of students went on the rampage demanding action against the institutes.        
	Hundreds of agitated students blocked roads in Bazaar Samiti, Pathar Ki Masjid, Kankerbagh, Kadamkuan and Rajendra Nagar localities. They also pelted stones at the coaching institutes and vehicles, demanding shutting down of the centres.        
	Teargas shells were fired to disperse the agitators, who set police motorcycles on fire, after the men in khaki failed to control the situation.        
	Yesterday, the students had blocked Bazaar Samiti Road and demonstrated in front of coaching centres alleging that their owners had duped them under the pretext of conducting courses.        
	A CRPF constable, who had suffered head injuries during the protest at Rajendra Nagar locality last evening, died at the Patna Medical College Hospital today.        
	Senior superintendent of police Vinit Vinayak said the situation was now normal.        
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar said he had ordered an official probe into the incident.         
	The state human resource development department had been asked to formulate a policy for regulating the functioning of coaching institutes to ensure proper and quality teaching in Bihar, he said.        
	Opposition RJD chief Lalu Prasad alleged that the state government was responsible for the agitation and added that the police had lathicharged and opened fire to quell it.         
	Vinayak, however, denied that the police had fired to disperse the students.

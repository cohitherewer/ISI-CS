The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Omar fumes, limited-choice Delhi gropes
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Omar fumes, limited-choice Delhi gropes
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                              
	New Delhi, Sept 14: Another troubling dimension of the Kashmir tangle threatened to erupt today as the Centre continued to grope on ways of lifting the Valley out of the bloody mire.        
	Stung by the public disapproval of his governance record by the cabinet committee on security (CCS), chief minister Omar Abdullah nudged his flanks to launch precision attacks on the Congress for conspiring against him even as he continued to lobby support with sympathisers at the Centre.        
	Abdullah, who has come under renewed pressure to quit for failing to get a grip on the spread anarchy -- this time even from influential sections in the Congress -- also rallied support within in National Conference (NC) and responded bluntly to the quit demand.        
	I am not quitting. he asserted, even as protestors continued their defiance of government orders. I cannot do that in the middle of a crisis, leaving the state headless.         
	Omar, sources close to him said, remained extremely upset that the Centre has chosen to tick him off when he was expecting it to deliver a peace package, but father Farooq Abdullah is believed to have counselled patience. Union home minister P. Chidamabaram, a key supporter of the lift-AFSPA move, also spoke to Omar and persuaded him against any rash reactions before the conclusion of the all-party meeting called by the Prime Minister tomorrow.        
	Efforts were on late tonight to smoothen freshly erupted friction between the Congress and the NC, but it is clear that one section of the Congress, which enjoys the sympathies of former chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, is gunning for Omar.        
	It was probably to smoothen Omars ruffled feathers that sources in the home ministry clarified today that by governance deficit the CCS also meant the deficit on the Centres part. But that may be too fine a stitch to put on the fast-lacerating Congress-NC ties. It is well known that despite its backing to Omar, New Delhi has been disappointed with his handling of the crisis and is not averse to a change of guard.        
	It is unlikely that tomorrows discussions will throw up anything radical or magical to ease Omars increasingly untenable position. Apart from known dissenters within the Congress and the defence ministry, the BJP too has assumed a hard line on the issue.        
	To make matters worse for the chief minister, his chief political adversary, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, has decided to attend tomorrows meeting. The PDP had boycotted the last meeting called by the Prime Minister, but sources close to her confirmed she will travel to Delhi tomorrow  reportedly after Sonia Gandhi spoke to her. Regular air traffic to the Valley remains suspended but special arrangements are being made.        
	PDP sources told The Telegraph that the party isnt impressed with the notion of symbolic measures and wants the Centre to start a genuine and constructive process to address the grievances and aspirations of Kashmiris.        
	Asked whether the party would demand Omars removal, a PDP source said, Well, for anything constructive to happen here, that will have to be the very first step. Things can be retrieved but the current government will have to be out of be out of the way because has become the immediate focus of public anger.        
	Realistic --- and therefore pessimistic --- about arriving at firm conclusions tomorrow, the Centre might well decide to give itself --- and the Omar government --- another gasp by announcing that a delegation of senior parliamentarians will visit the Valley to assess the ground and mood before any steps can be contemplated.        
	At the moment, though, policy makers appear lost for clues on how to proceed. The Centres options are narrowing. A quick look at some of them:        
	Option 1: Revoke AFSPA, announce an economic package and give Omar something concrete to play with.        
	Upside: A symbolic gesture tough for the Kashmiri street to rebuff and it will save the Centre the immediate prospect of governmental instability in the state.        
	Downside: Tough to push through. Besides, it may prove too little too late for both the PDP and the separatists. The army will complain of being demoralised and there could be adverse security implications because the Kashmiri street will feel encouraged to mount greater protests.        
	Option 2: Engineer a change of guard. Replace Omar with Farooq Abdullah (or another senior NC leader, though thats unlikely to happen). Give an entirely fresh look to the police and civilian administration.        
	Upside: Omars removal will be a sop to the street. Farooq is more experienced and may be able to move levers in politics and administration that Omar is unable to.        
	Downside: Farooq in saddle may anger the separatists and the street even more as they will see his installation as a cosmetic, even farcical, change. Farooq will also attract the ire that the Abdullah clan does. Although more experienced than Omar, Farooqs record of governance is not much to go by.        
	Option 3: Dismiss the government, impose Presidents rule.        
	Upside: The stern signal may work to bring some order on the streets which will no longer have the Abdullahs to pin their ire on. Chain of security command will become much smoother and the administration can go about its job free of political/electoral concerns.        
	Downside: The Centre is averse to repeating what it calls the mistakes of the past by imposing a governor raj; it would much rather work through an elected government. Central rule has had a chequered history in Kashmir and brought the conflict straight to New Delhis doorsteps, removing the buffer of a locally elected government.

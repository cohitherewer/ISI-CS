The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naidu gets a fleet after bumpy rides 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Naidu gets a fleet after bumpy rides 
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Chandrababu Naidu                                  
	Hyderabad, June 13: The man was a hi-tech high-flyer but his mount coughed and sputtered.        
	For N. Chandrababu Naidu, once known as CEO of Andhra Pradesh and even now high on the Maoist hit list, his convoy of rickety old Ambassadors that break down every now and then has been as much an embarrassment as a security risk.        
	But the former chief minister just couldnt get his successor and nemesis Y.S. Rajashekhar Reddy to sanction him a new fleet despite over a dozen requests in five years.        
	Now, the Telugu Desam chief will get his wish. Current chief minister K. Rosaiah recently called up Naidu, the leader of the Opposition, to tell him the state government was ready to provide him with eight new Tata Safaris.        
	Naidu had always travelled in Ambassadors even during his days as chief minister. But by the time YSR drubbed him in the 2004 elections, the cars had become old and needed to be replaced.        
	One or the other car in his convoy broke down at least 31 times in the past six years on the way to the Assembly, officials said.         
	Naidus former driver Goverdhan Rao said: It was really painful. Once Naidus Ambassador broke down midway between Karimnagar and Hyderabad, and it could not be easily towed, either.        
	The bullet-proof Amby apparently weighed 2.2 tonnes.        
	But YSR wanted to pay Naidu back for rejecting his appeals to regularise his Banjara Hills plot four times when the Desam boss was chief minister, bureaucrats said.        
	So Naidu bought two bullet-proof Safaris on his own but the National Security Guard, which provides him Z-category security, refused to accept them. They said the two Safaris would stick out among the ramshackle Ambassadors in the convoy, one of Naidus security officers said.        
	Of the eight Safaris Naidu will get, two will be made bullet-proof at a cost of Rs 30 lakh each. One will have a jammer.        
	Theres more good news for the Desam chief: his party now plans to buy a helicopter for his visits anywhere in the state.        
	Naidu still manages the Desam more or less like a corporate body, with biometric entry cards for all leaders and workers, and his NTR Trust runs model schools, blood banks and even a software communications company.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | May 2 deadline to clear air on JEE
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      May 2 deadline to clear air on JEE
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Kapil Sibal                                  
	New Delhi, April 26: Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal today asked the IITs to declare by May 2 how they would compensate students for errors in this years joint entrance examination (JEE).        
	The minister is reportedly unhappy with the explanations given by the tech schools.         
	An upset Sibal quizzed the directors of IIT Madras, Delhi and Kanpur whom he had summoned to seek an explanation on how the errors had crept in. The IITs have admitted to the errors in an internal report.         
	An NGO has approached Delhi High Court seeking to stall the declaration of results.        
	Sibals plan to summon the directors and the admission of the errors by the IITs in their report to the minister were reported by The Telegraph on April 25.         
	Sources present at todays meeting said Sibal asked the IITs to ensure against the repetition of such errors.         
	The IIT directors reportedly told him that many students dont read the instructions and so would not have suffered because of the misleading instructions. Sibal, sources said, shot down the argument. I have also appeared for many examinations and always studied the instructions, the minister is understood to have told the IIT bosses.         
	The directors promised Sibal that they would place on the IIT-JEE website by May 2 the details of corrective measures they would take to see no students score is affected by the errors. But the trio also told him that the test could not be re-conducted as demanded by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.         
	IIT Madras organised the JEE this year on April 11.         
	The optical mark reader answer sheet wrongly instructed students to mark math answers where they needed to mark physics answers, and physics instead of math.         
	Hindi question papers allocated three marks each for a set of questions that were actually worth eight marks, misleading students who took the test in Hindi about the true value of these questions.         
	This error triggered concerns that given examination time constraints, students who took the test in Hindi might have chosen to spend less time on these questions thinking that they carried fewer marks. A handful of students who took the test in Hindi also had sections missing in the question paper.         
	The deadline set by Sibal and accepted by the IITs assumes significance because of the PIL filed by the NGO in Delhi High Court seeking a stay on the declaration of IIT-JEE results. The NGO has demanded a fresh test. It is likely to come up for hearing tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jamia dilemma for govt
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Jamia dilemma for govt
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                             Jamia Millia Islamia (top) and Mushirul Hasan                                 
	New Delhi, April 4: Jamia Millia Islamia vice-chancellor Najeeb Jung has sought a government probe into appointments made under his predecessor Mushirul Hasan, leaving the human resource development ministry in a quandary over fears of a witch-hunt.         
	Jung, in his verbal complaint, has alleged that Hasan bent and violated university rules to employ his loyalists, even creating new posts for some of them, government officials told The Telegraph.         
	The vice-chancellors demand has exposed afresh ruptures within the university which has frequently found itself in turmoil because of internal disputes that spill out into the public domain.         
	The demand has also triggered a debate within the ministry on how to approach the allegations on appointments made by Hassan.         
	The debate is centred around fears within the ministry that a probe could trigger a witch-hunt against Hasans loyalists that may further widen existing ruptures within the university.         
	One section of the ministry is arguing that the government should not dirty its hands by entering a probe that is likely to descend into controversy-riddled mudslinging.         
	This section contends that instead of itself launching a probe, the ministry propose that the university itself conduct an inquiry.         
	The statutes of the university allow its executive council to launch a probe into appointments, though the vice-chancellor may have asked the ministry to conduct an inquiry because a ministerial probe would carry greater legitimacy.         
	But another section of the government is worried that a university-level probe could result in a more vicious witch-hunt than if it is conducted by a panel appointed by the ministry.         
	As a central university, Jamia is an autonomous institution and the ministry cannot order it not to probe appointments made under Hasan, sources explained. No one in the government wants a witch-hunt but at the same time, no one wants to get their hands dirty. It is a tricky situation, a source said.         
	One reason behind the HRD ministrys discomfort in tackling Jungs demand is its own past relations with Hasan. The former vice-chancellor was known to be close to former HRD minister Arjun Singh who, on more than one occasion, publicly defended him on controversial decisions.         
	As the vice-chancellor in 2008, Hasan had announced that the university would provide legal assistance to students who were held as terror suspects after serial bomb blasts in the capital in September that year.         
	His announcement led to strong protests from the Opposition BJP but Arjun backed the decision. The ministry believed that Hasan represented their best bet at Jamia.         
	But any probe finding that Hasan violated university norms and rules could also cast a cloud on the ministrys failure to ensure that one of the countrys central universities followed the required procedure, sources said.

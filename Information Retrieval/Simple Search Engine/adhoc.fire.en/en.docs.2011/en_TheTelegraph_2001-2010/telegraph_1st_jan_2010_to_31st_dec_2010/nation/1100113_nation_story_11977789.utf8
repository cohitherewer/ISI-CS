	Mumbai, Jan. 12 (PTI): The US will launch an online visa application process from February 1 under which non-immigrant applications will have to be submitted using an electronic form.        
	The DS-160, the web-based non-immigrant application, incorporates all existing non-immigrant visa applications into one interactive, online form. Visa applicants completing their applications as of January 19 will need to use the new form.        
	The applicants can submit applications via Internet, eliminating the need for paper applications.         
	The applicant will have to fill up the visa papers electronically, answer a few questions online and approach the consulate with a printout of a one-page confirmation with barcode, Jim Herman, an official of the US embassy in Delhi, said here.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 7: External affairs minister S.M. Krishna today said he was shocked to discover Indian students were going to Australia for vocational courses that teach facial and hair styling.        
	He advised parents and students to be more discreet in selecting educational institutes in Australia. The minister did not elaborate but his advice came against the backdrop of attacks on Indians and a complaint by some Australians that foreigners were using the excuse of studies to migrate and work there.        
	Yesterday, Australian high commissioner Peter Verghese said his country was not in the numbers game and wished to provide quality education. Verghese met Krishna on the sidelines of an event in New Delhi today.        
	The two refused to divulge details of their private discussion. I can understand Indian students studying in Australian universities. But when I visited Australia, I was shocked to discover students immigrating to enrol in vocational courses that teach facial and hair styling, Krishna said after meeting Verghese.        
	Krishna said India had enough institutes, particularly in metros, which offered good vocational courses. I advise students and parents to be more discreet in choosing educational institutes (in Australia), he added.        
	New Delhi has demanded from Australia complete data on the number of Indians attacked there in recent months. The external affairs ministry has appealed to the Indian media to maintain calm and balance and allow Australia to take remedial measures.        
	 It is a matter of concern that in spite of serious and concerted efforts by the Australian government these attacks are continuing and have even resulted in fatalities, an Indian statement said.

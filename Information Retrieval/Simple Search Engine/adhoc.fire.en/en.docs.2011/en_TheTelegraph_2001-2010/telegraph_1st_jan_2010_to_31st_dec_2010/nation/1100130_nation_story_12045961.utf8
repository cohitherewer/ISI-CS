          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 29: The Centre has promised Rs 5,032 crore to repair Aila-damaged embankments and Rs 530 crore for flood control in East and West Midnapore, a team of Bengal MLAs said after meetings here today.        
	The delegation, which met Union water resources minister Pawan Kumar Bansal and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, had 20 members and was led by state irrigation minister Subhas Naskar. But the four Trinamul Congress MLAs boycotted the talks as they didnt want to be seen sharing a platform with members of the ruling Left.         
	The assistance on both counts will need the finance ministry and the Planning Commissions approvals.         
	Naskar lamented Trinamuls absence during the meetings. It would have been better if the Trinamul MLAs had also attended the meetings, he added.        
	The Congresss Manas Bhunia, though, sought to play down the absence. Not much should be read into Trinamul MLAs not accompanying us.

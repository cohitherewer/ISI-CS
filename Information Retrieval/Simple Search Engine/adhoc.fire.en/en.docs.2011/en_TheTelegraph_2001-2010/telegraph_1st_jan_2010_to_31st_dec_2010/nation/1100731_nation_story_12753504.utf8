The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rao set for Moscow
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rao set for Moscow
          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, July 30: Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao will be in Moscow on Sunday to canvass support from old ally Russia for a joint strategy on Afghanistan.        
	New Delhi and Moscow have similar concerns on the situation that will unfold in Afghanistan after the US-led international security forces withdraw from the region in 2014.        
	Their fear that the Pakistan Army would come to control Afghanistan has found resonance with Tehran as well. Sources said India and Russia have been trying to involve Iran in devising a joint strategy on Afghanistan.        
	Foreign secretary Rao and external affairs ministry officials will discuss Afghan strategy with Russian counterparts during the annual foreign office consultations in Moscow on August 2 and 3.        
	New Delhi wants to ensure the next Afghan government is not anti-India. Foreign minister S.M. Krishna has repeatedly said that the Afghan peace and reintegration process needs to be fully Afghan-led and Afghan-owned and (must) carry all sections of Afghanistans population together.        
	Both Moscow and Tehran are on the same page with New Delhis assessment that the Pakistan Army and the ISI will not restrict their role to being friends of Afghanistan but would want to be rulers in Kabul.        
	India and Russia, however, want to ensure that Afghanistan remains a neutral country. Moscow recognises that it has become a fringe player in the great game being played out in Afghanistan and has broached the issue of Afghan neutrality with the US.        
	With the US planning a quick exit, this appears a tall ask. The Afghan governments hold on the country is tenuous. Only nine of its 364 districts are firmly under government control, that too because of the presence of 100,000 US and 30,000 Nato troops.        
	New Delhi is also worried that Indians will come under attack from the Taliban and the Lashkar once the international forces leave the region.

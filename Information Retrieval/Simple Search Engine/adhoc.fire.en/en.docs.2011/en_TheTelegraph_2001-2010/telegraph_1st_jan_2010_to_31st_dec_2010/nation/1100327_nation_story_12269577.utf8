  - Big B not the superstar at home, its me, says wife          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jaya Bachchan at the news conference in New Delhi. Picture by Prem Singh                                        
	New Delhi, March 26: Political parties dont own the states they rule, Jaya Bachchan bristled today when asked if the Congress had over-reacted to her husband Amitabhs presence at a function attended by Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan.        
	When I hear things like this (controversy), I honestly feel as though India is badly divided and as though a party ruling a state owns that state, the Samajwadi Party MP said.        
	India belongs to all of us. In a democracy you should be free to stand with who you want to. Ideology should not come in the way.        
	Amitabhs presence at Wednesdays sea bridge inauguration in Mumbai has had the Congress squirming because of the Bachchans strained ties with the Nehru-Gandhis and because the actor is now brand ambassador for Narendra Modi-ruled Gujarat.        
	In contrast to Jayas swipe at those who think they own the state, Amitabh was conciliatory, describing the Congress on his blog as a large outfit that has governed this land for the largest tenure, a PTI report said.        
	The actor, who had been invited to Wednesdays programme by an NCP minister, wrote: The media attempts to insinuate that the Congress Party is responsible for this (row) and that it is a deliberate attempt to deface me is a lot of hogwash. The Congress has many important and more valuable issues to attend to than be interested in puny little me.        
	Yesterday, Amitabh had written the controversy was manufactured, a remark seen as a barb aimed at the Congress.        
	Jaya, during her interaction with journalists, was nettled when asked whether Amitabh should have courted controversy by associating with Modi.        
	I have not come here to answer for Amitabh. I am not standing in the dock, I am not a thief and you are not a cop. Amitabh was in Delhi until this afternoon and you could have asked him, she shot back.        
	But the former actress was relaxed answering questions about her family. Asked what it felt like being in a family of four superstars (herself, Amitabh, son Abhishek and his wife Aishwarya), she laughed and said: There are three stars and only one superstar. Thats me because I give them their daily bread.        
	She added that the last superstar she knew was not her husband but Dilip Kumar. I dont consider anyone a superstar after him.        
	On Shah Rukh Khan, with whom Amitabhs relations have been rather patchy, her take was: I love him. We are like ET, its a spiritual connection. I played mother to him (in K3G) and I took the role a little too seriously.        
	She said she was waiting for someone to surpass Amitabh on screen: Abhishek, Shah Rukh, anyone.        
	Jaya said she was dying to do a film with Aishwarya, with whom she shared a delightful relationship. I have a wonderful subject on the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship. If only someone would agree to make a film on it.        
	Meeting II buzz        
	Chavan and Amitabh have both been invited to the concluding ceremony of a literary conference in Pune on Sunday, and speculation swirled if the chief minister would attend it.        
	The Congress said it had not issued any directions to Chavan, PTI reported. Ask the chief minister whether he is going or not. The Congress has not issued any instructions. There is no question of curbing his freedom, the agency quoted party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi as saying.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sonia in front of the Rohtang Tunnel on Monday                                  
	New Delhi, June 28: Sonia Gandhi today laid the foundation stone for the strategic 8.8km-long Rohtang Tunnel, 27 years after the government led by her husband, the late Rajiv Gandhi, conceptualised it.        
	The Rohtang Tunnel is one of a series of projects, including building/re-building bridges and forward airfields, that India has taken up after it revised its policy on border-zone development two years ago in response to Chinas rapid road, rail and town building in Tibet.        
	Work on the project got an impetus immediately after the 1999 Kargil war when Pakistan-backed intruders threatened to cut off National Highway 1A, which carries a bulk of supplies and troops to Ladakh and the Siachen Glacier.        
	The horse-shoe shaped Rohtang Tunnel will in itself not make the alternative route to Ladakh from Himachal Pradesh all-weather. The Rohtang Tunnel project envisages an all-weather road across the snow-capped Rohtang Pass (3,978 metres) in the Pir Panjal Range. The tunnel will reduce the road distance by nearly 48km (four hours) and, after it is opened, is designed to give road access to the remote regions of the Lahaul-Spiti and Pangi Valleys.        
	The Rs 1,495-crore Rohtang Tunnel is expected to be completed by 2015.         
	It will have two-way traffic in a single tube. The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) also began drilling at the northern (exit) point for the tunnel on the Manali-Sarchu road over the Chandra river. The tunnel will have large fans that will circulate air across its length and have exhausts for vehicular emissions.        
	The tunnel is being built by the BRO in association with a joint venture between an Indian firm and an Austrian company.         
	There are two other snow-bound passes on the Manali-Keylong-Leh highway at Baralacha La and Thaglang La. The Rohtang project envisages the building of a 292-km all-weather road, Nimu-Padam-Darcha via Shinkunla Pass, through the remote Zanskar region at an additional estimated cost of Rs 286 crore.

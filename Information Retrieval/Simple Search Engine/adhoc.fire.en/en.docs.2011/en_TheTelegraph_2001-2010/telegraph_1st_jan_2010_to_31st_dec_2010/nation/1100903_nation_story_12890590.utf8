                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US bags million-dollar defence deals
          SUJAN DUTTA                          US Army soldiers demonstrate the Javelin anti-tank guided missile to the Indian Army at Yudh Abhyas in October 2009                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: The US is winning millions of dollars of orders from the Indian defence forces after demonstrating new weapons in joint exercises with the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force.        
	The Indian Army has now decided to make an outright purchase of several hundred Javelin anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) that were demonstrated for the first time in the largest war game that the two armies have held.        
	Executives of the company that makes the weapon, Raytheon Corporation, were present at Yudh Abhyas 09 in Babina, a range of the Indian Armys armoured corps in Madhya Pradesh. The US army demonstrated how the shoulder-fired weapon is used.        
	We have sent a Letter of Request to the US government. We want to procure the Javelin ATGMs with an agreement for transfer of technology, a defence ministry source said. The price of the missiles is still being negotiated.         
	But an armoured corps officer said it the Javelin was easily the most expensive anti-tank missile in the global market. The Indian Army has so far used the Milan anti-tank missiles that are made in India with French collaboration.        
	The Indian Air Force also decided to buy the C-130J Hercules and the C-17 Globemaster III aircraft after putting them through trials but after first witnessing their performance in joint drills and during visits of senior officials.         
	The Indian Navy bought the USS Trenton, now christened the INS Jalashva, after it was given a demonstration in the Mediterranean during the Israel-Hizbollah war of 2006.        
	Defence ministry sources have said the Indian government is buying the Javelin missiles through a mechanism of the Pentagon that bypasses the need for competition.        
	We have sent a Letter of Request to the US government. We want to procure the Javelin ATGMs along with an agreement for transfer of technology, a defence ministry source said.

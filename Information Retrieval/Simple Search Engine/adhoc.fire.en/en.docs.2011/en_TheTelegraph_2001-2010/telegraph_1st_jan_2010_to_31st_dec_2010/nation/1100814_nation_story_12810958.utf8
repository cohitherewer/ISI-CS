	Kochi, Aug. 13: Kerala High Court today dismissed a review petition filed by the state government against its order banning public meetings on roads and roadsides.        
	The right to hold a meeting is nothing superior to the freedom of movement, the court said. The CPM criticised the verdict as utopian and the Congress said it was not practical.

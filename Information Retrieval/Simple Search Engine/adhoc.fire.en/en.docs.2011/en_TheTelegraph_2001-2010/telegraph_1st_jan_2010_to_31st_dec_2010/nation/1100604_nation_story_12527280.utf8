          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, June 3: Security forces today foiled a Maoist conspiracy to sabotage Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumars meeting at a Munger village on Saturday by storming a rebel camp at Baghail forests under Bhim Bandh sanctuary.        
	Two Maoist guerrillas were killed in the encounter that lasted for seven hours. A few other rebels are believed to have sustained injuries.         
	However, the Maoists succeeded in escaping with the bodies and their injured comrades in the deep forests, the police said.         
	Two rifles and 50 cartridges were found at the spot, about 200km from here.        
	Sources said the security personnel launched the combing operation at Baghail forests on the basis of a tip-off that over 50 armed rebel guerrillas were camping there with a plan to sabotage Nitish Kumars meeting at Kaira village in Munger.         
	As the forces approached the camp, the rebels started firing. Our men also fought back, said director general of police (DGP), Bihar, Neelmani.        
	Two Maoists were killed. They were in their olive green uniform and one of them sported tattoos on his hands. Several were injured too. But we could not lay our hands on the bodies as the Maoists took them away, he added.        
	Senior police officers are camping at the site while combing operations are on at Bhim Bandh forests ahead of Nitishs visit. At present, the chief minister is on his vikas yatra in the states hinterlands.        
	Munger, Nawada and Jamui districts, which border Jharkhand, have been the nerve centres of Naxalite activities for decades with the terrain dotted with hills and forests.         
	Besides, Munger has become infamous for the mushrooming growth of illegal arms factories. According to intelligence sources, Maoists and even militants from north eastern states have access to many of these illegal factories in Munger.        
	In fact, police had unearthed an illegal arms factory, catering exclusively to Maoists active in Jharkhand, Bihar and Chhattisgarh, in the Ganga Diara area of Munger April this year.

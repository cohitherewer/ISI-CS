  - Proposal for council on kids literature amp; management studies        BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                           better studies: Children at a book fair in Calcutta. File picture                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 31: A task force set up by the human resource ministry has drafted what is possibly Indias first book-promotion policy.        
	Among the suggestions put forward are a book regulatory body, an autonomous council for childrens literature and an institute for publishing management and technology.        
	The draft  officially called the National Book Promotion Policy  was discussed among HRD minister Kapil Sibal, the task forces members and experts recently. Dinesh Mishra, president of the Indian Society of Authors, heads the committee.        
	The proposed regulatory body will set codes and ethics for publishers and adjudicate disputes on copyrights.         
	At present, there is no law to regulate book publishers, leading to denial of and delays in royalty payments to writers, besides copyright rows and piracy. The proposed body, to be set up on the lines of consumer commissions, will also regulate the book publishing standards and practices and contain fraud.        
	The National Council of Childrens Literature should be independent, the task force has suggested, pointing out that since childrens books shape a societys future, the body should be autonomous and entrusted with the task of publishing such literature. At present, the National Book Trust has a wing for such books.        
	The draft policy also touches on the growing number of book fairs and exhibitions  a theme that will resonate especially in Calcutta where the annual book fair is one of the most important events on the citys social calendar.        
	The panel has suggested book publishing and promotions hubs in cities and villages. The centres, with bookshops, facilities for exhibitions and fairs and training centres for publishing, will also bring out regional-language books.        
	Another key suggestion is to set up an Indian Institute of Publishing Management and Technology, which will offer diploma and certificate courses and MBA in publishing sciences, editorial studies, book designing and e-publishing.        
	At present, there is no government institute dedicated to book publishing and marketing. The proposed institute will conduct researches and surveys to understand publishing trends and reading habits.        
	For persons with disability, cells may be created in educational institutions to cater to their book needs, the task force said, adding there should be special facilities to produce books for the visually challenged.        
	To encourage reading, the draft says the library movement should be spread and a central scheme started to finance at least four to five rural libraries, to be set up by states, in each district during the 12th Plan (2012-2017).        
	At least 70 per cent of the grants given by the Centre and state governments to the libraries should be spent on purchase of books by Indian authors. Around 25 per cent of the sum should be spent on childrens literature.        
	The task force said publishers needed to come to terms with the challenges of new technology in the form of e-books and digital libraries given that e-books are going to have a sizeable market share in the future.        
	The draft policy is now being given final shape. We are holding further consultations with experts to make it comprehensive. By November-end, we will submit the final draft policy to the government, Mishra said.

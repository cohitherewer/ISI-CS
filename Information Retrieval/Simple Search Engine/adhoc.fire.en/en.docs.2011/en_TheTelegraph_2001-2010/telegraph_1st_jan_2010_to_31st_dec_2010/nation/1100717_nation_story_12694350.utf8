The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata mum, party smells bosss maturity 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mamata mum, party smells bosss maturity 
          J.P. YADAV                      Mamata Banerjee                          
	 New Delhi, July 16: The airwaves buzz with one oblique statement after another from the CPMs central and Bengal camps. Minister Asok Bhattacharya thumbs his nose at the vaunted winds of change.        
	And all that oozes out of Mamata Banerjee is silence.        
	Or maturity, as her party sources would like to believe.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief, who arrived in Delhi on Monday after nearly two weeks, has apparently been operating quietly in the power corridors. Sources close to her claimed she had made good use of her time to improve ties with ally Congress and push her agenda for early polls in Bengal.        
	But she has studiously avoided the media, aware of her penchant for creating controversy almost every time she hands out a sound bite.        
	Mamata doesnt want to say anything that could endanger the alliance with the Congress, party sources said. Besides, she wants to project herself as mature enough for the Bengal chief ministers chair, which she now believes is within her grasp.        
	So, each time reporters approach her, she rushes away saying: I am very busy. I will talk to you later.        
	Mamata did not react even when Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee skipped the meeting of chief ministers of the Maoist-affected states, called by the Prime Minister. When a reporter sought her reaction, Mamata simply turned her face way.        
	Trinamul sources claim that one reason Mamata can afford not to attack the CPM immediately is the intensifying battle between the partys central and Bengal leaders. They are fighting among themselves, so its unnecessary for Mamata to attack them now, a Trinamul MP said.                  Brinda Karat      
	Instead, Mamata, who is expected to leave for Calcutta tomorrow, has used her time fruitfully meeting President Pratibha Patil and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, sources claimed. She apparently told them that illegal arms were being stockpiled in Bengal ahead of the Assembly polls, and so early elections were a must.        
	Trinamul sources claimed Bengal governor M.K. Narayanan had already taken up the matter seriously and asked the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and the state government to look into it. Mamata raised the subject of illegal arms at yesterdays cabinet meeting too.        
	She is also working on strengthening ties with the Congress. Mamata has invited Congress leaders to share the dais with her at the July 21 martyrs day rally in Calcutta. Trinamul sources said law minister Veerappa Moily had confirmed participation.        
	Mamata is keen to have Pranab at the rally. July 21 being a weekday, Pranabda is expected to be very busy. He, however, has promised to try his best to come, a Trinamul leader said.        
	It remains to be seen how long Mamata can maintain her silence, with the CPM renewing its attack on her alleged Maoist links. Politburo member Brinda Karat today wrote to the Prime Minister demanding action against Trinamul members on the issue.

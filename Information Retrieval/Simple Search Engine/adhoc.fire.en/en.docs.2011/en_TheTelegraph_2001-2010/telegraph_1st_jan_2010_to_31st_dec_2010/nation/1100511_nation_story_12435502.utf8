The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cloud of delay on   hill political talks

          OUR BUREAU                                    
	May 10: The return of disquiet to Darjeeling has cast a cloud over the next round of political talks scheduled for later this month, Union home ministry officials indicated on a day most government offices shut down in the hills.        
	The indefinite shutdown, the prelude to a weekend two-day strike to put pressure on the Centre and the state, also covers the toy train.        
	The concern over the fate of the political talks came on the eve of official-level discussions in New Delhi on Tuesday.        
	The home ministry officials suggested that the next round of political talks could be delayed if the situation remained volatile in the hills. The officials were worried by reports of clashes between the cadres of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) and the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) on Saturday.        
	The political talks are tentatively scheduled for May 24, possibly in Darjeeling. Sources in Delhi blamed the confusion over the dates on the infighting among various Gorkha groups.         
	The first round of political-level talks had taken place in New Delhi on March 18, capping five rounds of official-level tripartite talks among the Morcha, the Bengal government and the Centre.         
	The Morcha has been demanding that the entire Darjeeling hills, along with the Nepali-dominated areas of the Dooars and the Terai be included in an interim set-up to administer the hills.         
	The Centre and the state, however, want its reach to be limited to the three hill subdivisions of Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong.         
	The sources in Delhi said they were unhappy with the obstinate attitude of the Morcha leadership on territory.         
	Negotiations mean give and take. They (the Morcha) need to understand that this will be a slow process and we have our own compulsions, an official said.        
	Central and state government offices in the Darjeeling hills, except exempted ones, shut down today following an announcement by the Morcha on Saturday.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Governor talks, Cong walks out
  - Opposition protests against speech highlighting false achievements by Naveen government        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, March 8: The pre-budget session of the Assembly began today on a stormy note with the Congress staging a walkout while the governor delivered his customary opening address to the House.        
	As Governor M.C. Bhandare entered the House and started reading out his speech in English, Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh rose and made a parallel speech.        
	Expressing his displeasure, Bhandare said: I am paying homage to former members of the House. Please observe some discipline.        
	Dubbing the Naveen Patnaik government as a killer of democracy, Singh alleged that the government had abruptly adjourned the last winter session. It escaped from the House as the Opposition was pressing for a CBI probe into the multi-crore mining scam. This time, the government has not convened a full-fledged budget session, as it was scared to face the Opposition attack on the mining scam, he said.        
	Alleging that the government had failed on all fronts, he said it had failed to utilise the funds allocated in the current years budget. The governor had also expressed his displeasure of low spending. Farmers were committing suicide because eof debt burden and crop failure as the government had failed to come to their rescue. People were also dying due to chronic hunger, he added.        
	We are not interested to listen to your speech prepared by the government highlighting false achievements and concealing all the misdeeds, said Singh before staging a walkout as a mark of protest. Members of the Congress followed him one after another. Even an angry Congress member S.S. Saluja tore away a copy of the governors speech booklet and threw away into air before walking out of the House.        
	Unfazed, the governor went on reading out his 48-page speech for 94 minutes.        
	Later, the House witnessed noisy scenes when government chief whip R.N. Pani moved a thanksgiving motion for the governors address and condemned the Congress members for staging walkout during the governors speech.        
	The Congress, which has ruled Orissa for more than 40 years, is responsible for the sorry state of affairs. Now they (Congress MLAs) have turned the Assembly into a theatre hall, Pani said. He was also jeered by the Opposition while highlighting the achievements of the government.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Double trouble for Aligarh university
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Double trouble for Aligarh university
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, March 17: An inquiry into corruption allegations against the Aligarh Muslim University vice-chancellor and an embarrassing tussle over its top ceremonial post are pushing the varsity to the brink of paralysis.        
	Human resources development minister Kapil Sibal has advised the university against holding meetings of its highest appointing authority  the AMU Court  till the inquiry is complete.         
	But the university administration is hamstrung because it needs the Court to amend the structure of its two biggest academic and executive bodies where vice-chancellor P.K. Abdul Azis faces a revolt, government and varsity sources told The Telegraph. Earlier this month, Sibal advised Azis to postpone, for a second time, a meeting of the Court, scheduled for March 28. An earlier January 31 meeting was also postponed under Sibals advice.         
	Azis, sources said, was keen to call a meeting of the Court where a majority of members support him  to amend the rules governing the AMU executive and academic councils.         
	His supporters on the executive and academic councils at present do not make up the quorum required for meetings of these bodies to be held.         
	His opponents on these bodies have been boycotting meetings of the councils, ensuring that no major administrative decision is taken.         
	We are feeling completely paralysed. The university will suffer, a senior varsity official said.         
	A government source argued that this inability to take decisions may push Azis into taking decisions on his own  precipitating sentiments against him further.         
	But sources close to Sibal argued that the minister had no choice but to defer AMU Court meetings.         
	One reason behind Sibals move is a tussle over the post of the chancellor between rival groups lobbying for Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad and retired Supreme Court judge A.M. Ahmadi.         
	The AMU teachers union has endorsed Azad for the post while the university administration is keen that Ahmadi, the current chancellor, be given another term.         
	The Court  where the vice-chancellor enjoys a majority  elects the chancellor, and a defeat for Azad could prove embarrassing for the Centre. The HRD ministry isnt keen on Azad winning either, since such a scenario could create a parallel power centre at the varsity. The ministry is waiting for Azad to back out of the race.         
	Critics of Azis, both within the AMU and outside, too have petitioned Sibal alleging he wants to use the Court to curb the powers of the executive and academic councils.

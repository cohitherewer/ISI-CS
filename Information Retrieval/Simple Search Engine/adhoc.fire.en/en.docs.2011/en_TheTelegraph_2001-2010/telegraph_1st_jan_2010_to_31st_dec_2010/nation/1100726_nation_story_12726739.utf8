The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong feels President pressure 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong feels President pressure 
  - Patil pushes for brothers   selection in organisation        SANJAY K JHA                           Pratibha Patil                                              
	New Delhi, July 25: President Pratibha Patils name has been dragged into the ongoing Congress organisational polls, with party leaders alleging Rashtrapati Bhavans active involvement in some parts of Maharashtra.        
	The President had created controversy last year by pressuring the Congress leadership into nominating her son Rajendra Shekhawat for the Maharashtra Assembly polls.        
	Sources said the Presidents family wanted the party to heed its advice on the organisational elections, at least in two districts of Maharashtra: Amravati and Jalgaon. These districts are considered Patils areas of influence, but local Congress leaders have been resisting the wishes of the Presidents family.        
	The sources said Pradesh returning officer Gulcharan Charak had been summoned to Rashtrapati Bhavan on July 20 and given instructions on how to go about the elections in these two districts.        
	Maharashtra leaders allege the President not only wants her brother G.N. Patil to be made Jalgaon district Congress president, she has also asked Charak to accommodate certain people in the Pradesh Congress Committee and the All India Congress Committee.         
	Charak is said to have told the President there was strong opposition within the party to her brother. Patil then allegedly suggested the name of her son Uday as a compromise candidate.        
	The incumbent Jalgaon district president, Parultai Patil, has already lodged a protest and even written to the partys chief election officer, Oscar Fernandes. But a source said a message had already gone out from Rashtrapati Bhavan to Maharashtra Congress chief Manikrao Thakre, and that he had promised to accommodate the people suggested by the President.        
	Since organisational elections are not actually taking place in most parts of the country, and office-bearers are being chosen through consensus or a compromise between competing groups, influential leaders have succeeded in pushing their candidates everywhere.        
	Although Rahul Gandhi has succeeded in democratising the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India by successfully holding fair elections in many states, the parent body has resorted to the usual nomination route despite promising elections.        
	Even the efforts to eliminate fake members by making photographs mandatory have come a cropper. Sources said party workers had been fraudulently using the photographs of outsiders in many states.        
	Even forming booth committees, each of which has to have 15 members, is proving difficult.

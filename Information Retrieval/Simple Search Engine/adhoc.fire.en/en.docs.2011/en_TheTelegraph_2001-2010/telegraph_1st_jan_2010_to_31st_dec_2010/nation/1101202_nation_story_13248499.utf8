          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: The CBSE has asked Chandigarhs Sacred Heart Convent School to take disciplinary action against its principal for expelling Ruchika Girhotra for non-payment of dues without informing her parents.        
	The 1991 expulsion came a few months after Ruchika, then a Class X student, was molested by former Haryana director-general of police, S.P.S. Rathore. She later committed suicide.        
	In a letter to the school yesterday, the CBSE said principal Sister Sebastina and other staff members had taken the expulsion decision without following due procedure. Action will be taken against all those involved.        
	The school management has been asked by CBSE to take disciplinary action against the principal and other staff involved. The decision taken by the school is a violation of procedure and norms, a source said.        
	The school is supposed to inform the parents of a child about the non-payment of fees. But in this case the school expelled the girl without bothering to inform the parents about non-payment of dues.        
	After the DGP was given 18 months in jail in the molestation case earlier this year, questions had arisen about Ruchikas expulsion. The CBSE had then set up a committee, which found the principals decision not as per procedure.        
	Asked if the expulsion had any link to the molestation, the source said: The CBSE has mandate to look at any omission or commission by the school. It has no mandate to decide if Rathore had any role.        
	The principal will be given a chance to reply to the CBSE letter. Based on that, the school will decide the action to be taken. She could even be terminated from service, the source said.

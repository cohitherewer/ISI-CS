          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Feb. 15: The Goenka family has accused the authorities in Pune of giving them a harrowing time by forcing them to go around in circles to identify the body of Shilpa, who died in the German Bakery blast.        
	Close relatives of Shilpa  who had joined Japanese finance major Nomura in Mumbai after completing her engineering in computer science from BIT Mesra, near Ranchi  at their Lake Town home today narrated their plight from the time they learnt about the tragedy.        
	According to the family, Shilpas uncle in Mumbai, Gopal Goenka, received a call from some of her colleagues, who informed him about the tragedy around five hours after the blast. Shilpa, along with her school friend Ankik and his sister Anindyee Dhar, was in the caf when the improvised explosive device went off.        
	Gopal left Mumbai along with three others and reached the Pune blast site, from where they were asked to go to Sassoon Hospital. We reached Sassoon Hospital around 3am on Sunday morning and it took us over two hours to trace Shilpas body inside the hospital. At the gate, police constables pleaded ignorance and we couldnt find any one from the hospital to tell us where the body was, recalled one of Shilpas relatives.        
	Around 5.15am, Gopal managed to identify Shilpa  lying cold in death. And then, the test of nerves began.         
	From 5.15am to 11am, we just kept going round the hospital to get the post-mortem done. There was no one to guide us. And after we had found some police officials and the hospital staff, we were told to get papers, recalled a family member, adding that Gopal and the others faced strange procedural constraints.         
	According to the family, Pune police wanted papers from the Bengal cops and several other documents before the body could be sent for post-mortem.        
	Today, the relative wondered why things were so difficult. Was it our fault that our daughter died? At least there could have been be a single window from where you could get all information and directions, said the relative.

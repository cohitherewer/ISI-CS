The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In Padma pond, Chatwal suspense
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      In Padma pond, Chatwal suspense
          ARCHIS MOHAN                                          Sant Singh Chatwal        
	New Delhi, April 5: Uncertainty reigns over whether controversial US-based hotelier Sant Singh Chatwal will arrive in New Delhi on Wednesday to receive his Padma Bhushan from President Pratibha Patil.        
	A lobby within the government has advised against handing Chatwal, charge-sheeted and acquitted in CBI cases, the award in India.        
	The alternative plan is to organise a quiet ceremony at the Indian embassy in Washington where ambassador Meera Shankar would confer the honour on the hotelier.        
	The idea is to keep Chatwal away from the media glare since the Centre has earned much bad press for its decision to confer the countrys third-highest civilian award on Chatwal.        
	Officials at the ministries of home and external affairs were tight-lipped about whether Chatwal would at all be present at Wednesdays event at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.        
	The first round of the Padma ceremony was held on March 31, when the President handed awards to Nobel winner Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, cricketer Virender Sehwag, composer A.R. Rahman and badminton player Saina Nehwal, among others. The second and final round is scheduled for April 7.        
	Chatwals nomination for the award was questioned by the BJP and some other political parties because of the past CBI cases of financial irregularities against him.        
	There was some good news for the Centre today from Delhi High Court, which dismissed a petition challenging the governments decision to award the hotelier.        
	A bench headed by Justice Madan B. Lokur, the acting chief justice, went through original documents submitted by the Centre and found no substance in the allegation by petitioner S.K. Shah that proper procedure was not followed in awarding Chatwal.        
	Union ministers Praful Patel and Vayalar Ravi had recommended Chatwals name to the Padma awards committee, headed by the cabinet secretary.        
	The principal secretary to the Prime Minister and the home secretary are official members of the panel. This year, the non-official members were former Confederation of Indian Industry chief Tarun Das, Planning Commission member Syeda Hameed, playwright Girish Karnad and Rajya Sabha MP Kapila Vatsyayan.

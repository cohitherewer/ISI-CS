The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt-Maoist skirmish: fax versus phone 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Govt-Maoist skirmish: fax versus phone 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chidambaram                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: The Maoist offer of conditional ceasefire is turning out to be a phone-and-fax war of nerves after home minister P. Chidambaram today made it clear the rebels would have to abjure violence first.        
	I would like a short, simple statement from the CPI (Maoist) saying We will abjure violence and we are prepared for talks, Chidambaram said.        
	I would like no ifs, no buts and no conditions. I would like the statement to be faxed to 011-23093155. Once I receive the statement, I shall consult the Prime Minister and other colleagues and respond promptly.        
	The fax machine which has this number lies in North Blocks room No. 125-A, the office of additional secretary (Naxalite management) D.R.S. Chaudhary. But unlike the home ministrys 24X7 control room, the additional secretarys room is not manned round the clock.        
	Chidambarams virtual rebuff came a day after Maoist guerrilla wing chief Kishen had offered a 72-day ceasefire if the Centre called off an offensive against the rebels. The Maoist leader made the offer through a statement to TV and newspaper offices late on Monday, saying the ceasefire could hold from February 25 to May 7.        
	Kishen today told the media the home ministrys designated representative could call the Maoists on the mobile number 9734695789 after 5pm on Thursday, February 25, if the government wanted to talk.        
	He also clarified that the Maoists would not fax any message and described Chidambarams response as childish.        
	Government sources said the Maoist offer betrayed the desperation of the insurgents in the face of the co-ordinated offensive, though some felt it could be a ruse to regroup.        
	A home ministry statement said: (The) Government has seen many versions of a statement reportedly made by the leaders of the CPI (Maoist). In the absence of an authentic statement, (the) government is unable to respond to these versions.        
	Officials, uncertain about the reasons behind the offer, said it was not worth considering. Our reading is that they are not under pressure (from central and state forces). This offer may be to create confusion or buy time to regroup, said an official.        
	The ministry has been working on a two-to-three year plan against the rebels. We are in it for a long haul. Security forces need to dominate the areas that Maoists have under control. For this we need to deploy men. It will take two to three years to turn the tide against the Maoists, a source said.        
	Plans suggest one lakh trained security personnel could be deployed in Maoist-affected areas by the end of this year and another 1.5 lakh by June 2011.        
	The Maharashtra government has adopted a similar strategy in insurgency-hit Gadhchiroli district. It has deployed 4,000 police personnel and will soon send another 2,000 men.         
	It is only area domination that will help. Unlike in the past, when we would enter an area, carry out an offensive and leave, now our companies occupy and squat in Maoist areas, an official said.        
	Sources said the next step would be to set up a police station, mobile medical vans and flood the area with free rations to send the message that the Indian state was the good guy.        
	It is the fight for grassroots support. By carrying out development work, we intend to weaken their (Maoists) support base, said an official.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 30: At least four persons were injured in a clash between villagers and police at the controversial Kalinga Nagar Industrial Complex in Jajpur district today over the construction of a common corridor.        
	The situation is tense, but under control, Jajpur superintendent of police D.S. Kutte said.        
	The construction of the common corridor to connect the industrial complex was stalled on January 16 following protests and resumed yesterday amid heavy security.         
	Activists of the Visthapan Virodhi Jana Mancha, who have been opposing the project, first picked up arguments with the police early this morning.         
	They were soon joined by supporting tribals. As the situation deteriorated, the police resorted to firing rubber bullets and bursting teargas shells.

          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Oct. 6: A British auction house today sold for 769,250 a series of 24 rare paintings commemorating almost the worst defeat suffered by the British in India.        
	 The sale price was very near the top estimate for the lot  650,000-850,000  that had been predicted by Sothebys in London.        
	 In the Battle of Pollilur, which took place on September 10, 1780, Tipu Sultan and his father, Haydar Ali, of the kingdom of Mysore, inflicted a heavy defeat with many casualties on the forces of the East India Company commanded by Colonel William Baille.        
	Pollilur is near the city of Kanchipuram in present-day Tamil Nadu.        
	 The 24 preparatory paintings, which were done on rice paper shortly after the battle  the colours are so vivid they emanate the noise and fury of battle were originally part of two long scrolls, each 7ft by 30ft.        
	 They were included among 400 lots that went under the hammer at Sothebys biannual Arts of the Islamic World sale, with the auction house expecting to realise more than Pound10 million.        
	 Following the Battle of Pollilur, Tipu commissioned a mural which was duly installed in the Daria Daulat Palace, Seringapatam in1784. The preparatory paintings, almost certainly the work of an Indian artist  or possibly a master working with his pupils  were used to draw the mural.        
	 While the British lost this particular battle, Sothebys points out, they went on to defeat Tipu Sultan at the Battle of Seringapatam on May 4, 1799  the final confrontation of the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War between the British East India Company and the Kingdom of Mysore.        
	 In 1791, the mural had been painted over following the Treaty of Mysore, when Tipu was forced to surrender his two sons as hostages. It says much for the British that the mural was subsequently restored, even though it featured a British defeat. The restoration was done using the preparatory paintings for referencing.        
	 The British love of Indian art got the better of them, according to experts at Sothebys.        
	 The restoration is attributed to one of the commanding officers who attended the siege in 1799, Colonel Arthur Wellesley, later 1st Duke of Wellington, one of the most celebrated and renowned figures in British military history.        
	 The scrolls with the preparatory paintings were chopped up into 24 paintings which have survived in remarkably good condition.         
	 The paintings were acquired by Captain John William Freese in approximately 1802. Freese was a member of the Madras Artillery and played an important role in the siege of Seringapatam in 1799; in 1802 he was appointed Commissary of Stores at Seringapatam.

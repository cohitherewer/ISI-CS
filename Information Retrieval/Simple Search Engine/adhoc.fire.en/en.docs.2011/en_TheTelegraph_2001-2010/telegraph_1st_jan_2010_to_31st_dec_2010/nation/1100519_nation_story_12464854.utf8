          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 18: Health organisations have charged the health ministry with buckling under pressure from the tobacco industry and deferring a set of new pictorial warnings on packets of tobacco products by six months to December 2010.         
	A government notification issued in March had set June 1 as the date when manufacturers would have to show a picture of lips devoured by oral cancer instead of images of human lungs or a scorpion.         
	But health ministry officials have indicated that the new warnings will be mandatory only from December, prompting activists to warn that the delay would only compound the harm.         
	While the tobacco industry is inflicting severe harm on Indian people, the government should not be complicit through ineffective delayed action, said Srinath Reddy, the president of the Public Health Foundation of India.         
	Sections of the tobacco industry claimed that they need time to prepare the new pictures. This is no excuse, said a spokesperson for the Voluntary Health Association of India, a nationwide network of health organisations.

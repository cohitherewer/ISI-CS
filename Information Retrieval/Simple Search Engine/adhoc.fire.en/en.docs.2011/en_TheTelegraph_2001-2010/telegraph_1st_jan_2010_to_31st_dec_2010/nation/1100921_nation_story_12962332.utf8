          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Sept. 20: The defiance in Bibi Jan was unmistakable: age, distance or the separatists would not deter her from trying to secure freedom for her grandson, Sameer.        
	The 70-year-old today trudged over 50km from Baramullas Sopore to the Sher-e-Kashmir International Convention Complex in Srinagar to tell the all-party delegation from Delhi that Sameer had been arrested on trumped-up charges.        
	My only bread-earner has been arrested and booked under the Public Safety Act. But he was never a stone-thrower, Bibi Jan said.        
	The grandmother has been surviving on alms since 22-year-old Sameer, a construction labourer, was arrested three months ago for allegedly joining the azaadi protests in the Valley. She claimed she had tried all options  even bribing officials Rs 20,000  but to no avail. I have sold my two kanals (one-eighth of an acre) of land to pay the bribe. The state government had invited common people to meet the team headed by home minister P. Chidambaram. But most had shied away after the separatists decided to boycott the meeting.        
	Bibi Jan, however, chose to take a risk and go anyway. She was one of a three-member team, headed by Langate MLA Sheikh Rasheed, who showed up in Srinagar.        
	Bibi Jan moved from Langate in Kupwara to Sopore, about 40km away, 20 years ago after her son and Sameers father, Wali Mohammad Mir, left for arms training in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

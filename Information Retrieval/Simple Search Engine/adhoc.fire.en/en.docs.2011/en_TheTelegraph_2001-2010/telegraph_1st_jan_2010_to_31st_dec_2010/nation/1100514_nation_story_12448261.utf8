The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu weathervane as wind blows for Nitish 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lalu weathervane as wind blows for Nitish 
										      SANKARSHAN THAKUR IN PATNA       BIHAR -THE GAMECHANGE                        Lalu Prasad				                                 
	In a strange, rather piquant sort of way, Lalu Prasad has become the best weathervane of the turned wind in Bihar, flapping helplessly about in a current that no longer runs to his command.         
	So much of his political treatise has come to revolve around Nitish Kumar  rubbishing his governance claims, carping about his micro-engineering with backward castes, mocking his commitment to minorities  that it is in itself an admission of his loss of centrality.         
	Bihar used to be about Lalu Prasad, for or against. In five years of power, Nitish has made it about himself, for or against. Unwittingly, even Lalu Prasad attests that.         
	Sample this:               
	Q: Laluji, you have lost two successive elections, whats there to give you hope now?        
	There is hope and great hope, Nitish Kumar has lied to Bihar and the country for five years, we have to expose him. We will do that.               
	Q: He claims, though, that Bihar has progressed in unprecedented ways under him.         
	What development? All lies, jhooth bolta hai sab (he lies all the time). People are suffering under Nitish Kumar and his fraud with numbers and statistics. We have to expose that.               
	Q: But Bihar has seen positive changes under Nitish.         
	What change? All lies, I cannot see anything. Only Nitish and the media can see it. Where is the change? People are suffering, I tell you, they are suffering badly.               
	Q Specifically, what is your charge against him?         
	Bahut hai, ginaven kya? (there are lots of them, should I begin to count them?) Nitish raj is fraud raj, I only have to communicate this message to the people and you will see the results.               
	Q: But he does not have a constituency of his own?        
	What constituency? Sab hamra khod-khod ke chura liya hai aur bolta hai apna (All of it stolen bit by bit from me, and he calls it his own now). People are not with Nitish. He sits in the BJPs lap and he thinks Muslims are with him.               
	Q: But sections of Muslims did vote for him.         
	They will realise their mistake, Nitish has conned everybody.        
	Q: But they are with you even less, as the election results show.         
	People were taken in by Nitishs fraud, tamasha. Now they know the truth. His own loyalists are breaking away, ask them why? He has divided the backwards also, we have to unite them, divisive politics is not good, Nitish is a divisive man.         
	Q: Do you have a strategy?         
	Remove Nitish, end the fraud in Bihar. Dekhiyega, kona kona se Nitish-hatao ka awaj uthega. (Watch, the remove-Nitish cry will rise from all corners of Bihar).                
	Q: But on what basis?         
	Politics mein basis hota hai? (Is that required in politics?) Janta jaagruk hai (people are alert), they will remove him. Nitish hatao!               
	If theres an echo to that cry, it probably comes off that spittoon of his. The jury is yet be out on whether Nitish is riding an incumbency wave in Bihar, but any yearning for a return to the Lalu Prasad era is palpably absent in the state.        
	There was a time Lalu Prasad was able to assert his political longevity with some wit and a lot of credibility: Jab tak rahega samosa mein aaloo, tab tak rahega Bihar mein Lalu. Hed convince few with that today, even though his Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) remains the chief Opposition in the state, and Lalu Prasad himself a leader who only the brave or the foolhardy will dare write off.         
	But it is bad enough for a man who rode the scene several cuts above anybodys reach through the better part of a decade and a half to be merely relevant, to be salient no more.         
	It is bad enough for him not to have a full court gathered around him as he expounds on the ills of his successor regime between vigorous oral expulsions into the spittoon. It is bad enough for that bereft court to be located in precincts not rightfully his; the bungalow belongs to the leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly and wife Rabri Devi.         
	Samosas still come delectably stuffed with aaloo in Bihar, but Lalu Prasad has shrunk in the states scheme; once-protg, now-rival Nitish has filled it out. The irony is, he has done so with much the same stuffing that once kept Lalu Prasad cosy in his power-nest.         
	For Nitish, make no mistake, is essentially Lalu Prasads ideological descendant, a dyed-in-the-wool socialist who chipped the Mandal masonry, nibbled at bits of the minority vote and squared it with the BJPs upper caste/urban bases to make adroit political algebra.         
	Part of the difficulty of Lalu Prasads battle with Nitish is down to just that  it is a battle with his own. The clever hiving of the extremely backwards from the backwards, the Mahadalits from the Dalits and the Pasmanda Muslims from the Muslims is all at the cost of what used to make up Lalu Prasads once-invincible social coalition.         
	As one RJD MLA told us, sotto voce, as soon as Lalu Prasad was out of earshot: For Lalu to now complain about the concessions being given to these new social formulations by Nitish means throwing them even more firmly into Nitishs lap. Chalak hai Nitish, meri billi mujhi se miaao. (Nitish is very cunning, he is beating us at our own game.)         
	Where does he look to make up the purely arithmetical losses? Lalu Prasads gaze couldnt be offering much.         
	The alliance with the Congress lies abrogated and overwritten by Rahul Gandhis future heartland manifesto. Not that it offered much in the first place  the Congress in Bihar remains a daily squabble whose only absorbing aspect is that it is over the partys collective bankruptcy.         
	Ram Vilas Paswan is a diminished ally in addition to being fickle. He awaits his prospects in the Rajya Sabha  elections for vacancies from Bihar are due next month  and if Lalu Prasad isnt of help, Paswan could shift his light weight. The Congress? Nitish? Or even the NDA? Who knows?         
	And should he stay, will that be enough? Arre hum akele hi bhari padenge, Lalu Prasad asserts, Nitish kahan se aaya? Koi poochhta thha usko itna saal? (I will weigh heavy enough on my own, where did Nitish come from, was anyone bothered about him for years?)         
	Its a start from scratch. He knows. (Concluded)

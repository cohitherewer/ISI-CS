          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, June 20: A youth was killed in Srinagar today when security forces fired at a group of mourners who had gathered in front of a hospital where a young man died after being beaten up by the CRPF last week.        
	Srinagar was rocked by protests after the CRPF firing in which six people were also injured. Also today, Pakistani troops violated a ceasefire and fired at Indian posts in Kupwaras Machil sector, killing two porters and injuring two army jawans.        
	Hundreds of people had gathered in front of the SK Institute of Medical Sciences at Noor Bagh to attend the funeral of Rafiq Ahmed, 26, who died after fighting for his life for a week. Ahmed had suffered a head injury after being beaten up by the CRPF during a protest last week. A mourner said Rafiq had been beaten up with rifle butts and bamboo sticks while protesting the killing of a youth by the CRPF.         
	The CRPF today said it fired in self-defence after some of the mourners started raising anti-India slogans and tried to set ablaze a bullet-proof mobile bunker.         
	However, several residents of Noor Bagh claimed that the security forces fired without provocation.         
	No warning shots were fired. They straightaway started firing above the waist, a mourner said.         
	Javed Ahmad Malla received a bullet in his throat and died on the spot. The CRPF has allegedly killed three youths in Srinagar in the past nine days.        
	CRPF spokesperson Prabhakar Tripathi said the force today fired in self-defence. Maximum restraint was observed but the mob tried to set ablaze our bunker after which our men fired in self-defence, he said.         
	The police today declared a curfew in the old city after hundreds of people hit the streets, protesting the killing of Malla. The separatists have called a Kashmir bandh tomorrow.         
	After todays incident, Riyaz Bedar, the senior superintendent of police (Srinagar), was summarily removed. The move came after a high-level meeting chaired by chief minister Omar Abdullah. Bedar has been replaced by Syed Ashiq Bukhari.

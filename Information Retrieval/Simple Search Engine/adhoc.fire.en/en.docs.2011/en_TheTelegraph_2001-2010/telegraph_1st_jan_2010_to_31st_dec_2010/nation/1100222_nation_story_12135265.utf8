          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Irrawaddy dolphin                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 21: The population of Irrawaddy dolphins in Chilika lake has increased by 9 per cent, according to the latest census.        
	The numbers have gone up to 158  9 per cent more than last years population, said Chilika Development Authority (CDA) chief Ajit Pattnaik.        
	Every year in February, the CDA carries out an annual population estimation of Irrawaddy dolphins in the lake. The survey is done in collaboration with state wildlife wing, volunteers and experts from various institutions. The survey began in 2003 with the aim of monitoring the status and population dynamics of the Irrawaddy dolphins, said Pattnaik        
	The survey by 20 teams was carried out using boats with at least 82 surveyors participating in it.        
	This time, for precision, the track routes were predetermined through computer programming and the track points were preloaded in hand-held GPS sets. Each survey team was provided with a preloaded GPS set to track the survey route. In addition, the teams were provided with range finders to determine the exact distance.         
	There are 12 more dolphins this year, said Pattnaik. Dolphins being at the top of the food chain is a good indicator of the health of the lakes ecosystem. The rise in the population of Irrawaddy dolphins in Chilika is thus a healthy sign, he added.

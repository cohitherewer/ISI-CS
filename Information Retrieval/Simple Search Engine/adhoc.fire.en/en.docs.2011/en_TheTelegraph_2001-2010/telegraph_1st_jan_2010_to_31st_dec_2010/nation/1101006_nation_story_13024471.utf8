          GAJINDER SINGH                      Amarinder Singh                          
	Chandigarh, Oct. 5: Maybe the martini did it. Or the maharajah connection.        
	Prince Charles and his wife Camilla are believed to have so enjoyed family friend Amarinder Singhs party last night that they stayed really late despite being early sleepers, a source said.        
	The party, a hush-hush affair to which only a handful of close friends were invited, was held at the former Punjab chief ministers sprawling New Motibagh palace. Security was so tight that guests had to empty pockets and deposit mobiles at the gate before entering the 22-acre grounds.        
	Even details of the menu were kept under wraps, though it is believed cooks from Lahore and Mumbai were flown in for the party. The only cocktail that was definitely served was martini, a source said.        
	It was a private party thrown by Amarinder and his wife Preneet to honour a personal friend of the family. Neither cameras nor mobile phones were allowed inside on the orders of the family, a police officer at the main gate said.        
	Both Charles and Camilla, despite being early sleepers, seemed to have enjoyed the party that went on till late in the night. The guests left after midnight.        
	Relations between the Patiala and British royal families go back decades. Not only was Amarinders grandfather, Maharajah Bhupindar Singh, given the title favoured son of the British Empire, Patiala was also known as the cradle of the Imperial Service troops. Besides, the kingdom did not join India immediately after Independence.        
	According to a guest, Camilla looked pleasing in an ice-blue silk dress with lace and a stunning diamond necklace. Charles wore a suit.        
	The royal couple met everyone and remembered some who had met them earlier. The food was excellent, better than the 2006 party when Amarinder was chief minister and could not personally supervise arrangements, the guest said.        
	Others observed that though Amarinder and Charles have been friends for years, the former chief minister was seen ensuring that his son, Raninder, stuck close to the prince right through the evening.        
	The meal was sumptuous, an Amarinder aide said. Nothing was pre-planned for them. They were provided whatever they wanted to eat.        
	The palace was given a fresh coat of paint and truckloads of flowers were used to decorate the lawns.

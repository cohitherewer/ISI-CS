          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 15: Deccan Chargers, owned by media group Deccan Chronicle Holdings Ltd, today declared its ownership structure amid charges being traded between Shashi Tharoor and Lalit Modi over the Kochi IPL team.        
	However, the other teams were still reluctant to go public with the details of their shareholding structures, preferring to wait till a fiat is issued by the IPL governing council.        
	Deccan Chronicle Holdings told stock exchanges that Deccan Chargers is owned by its 100 per cent subsidiary, Deccan Chargers Sporting Ventures Ltd.         
	Also put out were details of the Deccan Chargers Sporting Ventures Ltd board: V Shanker is the chairman and the other board members include T. Venkattaram Reddy, P.K. Iyer, N. Krishnan, M. Sukumar Reddy and G. Kumar.        
	While Venkattaram Reddy is the chairman of Deccan Chronicle Holdings, the information filed with stock exchanges shows Iyer, Kumar and Krishnan are also board members. V. Shankar is the company secretary.        
	In the light of various media reports and speculation regarding the shareholding pattern of Indian Premier League franchisees, we would like to place on record(that) the Hyderabad IPL franchisee Deccan Chargers is owned by Deccan Chargers Sporting Ventures Ltd, the communication to exchanges said.        
	After the spat with Tharoor started this week, IPL chairman Modi had announced that the shareholding details of all the teams would be made public after the current tournament is over.        
	Information on some teams is trickling in. GMR Holdings, for instance, owns the entire equity in Delhi Daredevils, sources said. However, some of the leading franchises said they had no immediate plans to reveal their ownership structure. But they had no objection if the IPL decided to disclose it.        
	Reliance Industries, UB Group, GMR Holdings and India Cements are some of the leading industrial houses that own various teams.               
	Preity Zinta, Ness Wadia of the Bombay Dyeing group, accompanied by Karan Paul and Mohit Burman, own Kings XI Punjab. Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, Juhi Chawla and her husband Jay Mehta own Kolkata Knight Riders. Mumbai Indians is owned by Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) through subsidiary IndiaWin Sports.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PC Maoist strategy draws flak 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      PC Maoist strategy draws flak 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 23: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today faced opposition from an MP of his own party during a discussion on counter-Naxalite strategies.        
	 Left-wing extremism was the only subject that was dealt with at the consultative meeting on home affairs that MPs from both Houses attended.         
	Sources said the most vocal among Chidambarams critics was K. Keshava Rao, the Congress MP from Andhra Pradesh who has consistently opposed police action in Maoist-dominated areas.         
	He was not agreeable on the home ministers policy of police action, said a source.         
	The debate on what should take place first  development or police action  is misplaced, Chidambaram is believed to have said at the meeting. The decision will vary from situation to situation and from state to state. No fixed prescription is possible.         
	Rao and some other MPs, however, stressed on issues like lack of development, discrimination and landlessness among the tribals as the larger issues. Law and order is different, the larger issue is different, a Congress leader reportedly said at the meeting.         
	The home minister said the government would continue to follow its two-pronged approach of development and calibrated police action to deal with the Naxalite problem.        
	Chidambaram drew the MPs attention to the anti-development activities of the Moaists in the worst-affected districts. They have been destroying schools, roads and telephone towers, Chidambaram pointed out. He said in 2009 alone, the rebels had destroyed 71 schools, the re-building of which may take years, depriving tribal children of education.         
	Chidambaram argued that huge allocation was provided to states for development projects in the worst-affected districts but utilisation of the money was not always satisfactory.         
	A couple of MPs suggested that an all-party MPs delegation visit some of the Naxalite-affected areas to win the trust and goodwill of the tribal people. Members also pointed out the need for good co-ordination between local police and central paramilitary forces and availability of actionable intelligence at the ground level.         
	Chidambarams deputies Mullappally Ramachandran and Ajay Maken attended the meeting so did several MPs across party lines.

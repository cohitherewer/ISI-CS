	New Delhi, Aug. 26: A draft bill on 14 innovation universities has a provision to appoint professors of international repute on invitation, a pioneering step aimed at attracting the best teachers to India.         
	So far, no university in the country, which is faced with a faculty shortage, has done this.        
	Under the draft Universities for Innovation Bill, 2010, these institutions can appoint any person of high academic distinction and professional attainment as professor or assistant professor by invitation. They can also appoint by invitation any graduate with high academic distinction, and who has shown exceptional talent for research, as assistant professor.         
	According to government reports, about 30 to 40 per cent faculty seats are vacant in the central universities, Indian Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Management. A high-level panel, headed by IIT Kanpur director S.G. Dhande, recently suggested that faculty be attracted from foreign countries by organising overseas fairs.         
	The 14 innovation universities will specialise in research. Each of them will establish a council that will act as a link with research-funding organisations, the industry and civil society.        
	The research councils will provide resources and assistance for projects undertaken by the teachers. It will also arrange for dissemination of knowledge created by research programmes at the universities.         
	Some of these universities will be set up in collaboration with promoters but the surplus money generated will not be distributed among the promoters. It will be spent on the universitys development.         
	The school of studies under each university will specify the study programmes and decide the admission norms. The universities will also establish a faculty of knowledge manpower assessment to study and assess the emerging fields of knowledge. These wings will recommend revision of curricula and syllabuses.         
	The draft bill is under consultation, after which it will go to the cabinet for approval.        
	AIIMS seat hike        
	The All India Institute of Medical Sciences will add 182 seats following the implementation of 27 per cent reservation for the Other Backward Classes (OBC), a PTI report said.        
	A meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister, today approved the seat hike as recommended by the oversight committee supervising the quota implementation.        
	After implementation of reservation for OBCs in the institute, the annual intake in various undergraduate, postgraduate and paramedical courses will increase by 182, an official statement said.        
	Implementation of OBC reservation will not only increase seats at AIIMS but also facilitate better healthcare delivery, the statement said. It added that the total number of seats would increase without altering the existing number of unreserved seats.

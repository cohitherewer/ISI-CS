The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karats historic correction
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Karats historic correction
          OUR BUREAU                          Prakash Karat                                  
	Calcutta, March 3: Under pressure from the Bengal CPM to explain his remarks to British Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, general secretary Prakash Karat has dissociated himself from having made any pessimistic prophecies and placed the burden of analysis entirely on the latter.        
	In a contradiction-ridden rejoinder Karat said: Some reports in the media have claimed that I have given a grim forecast for the Party in the next assembly elections in West Bengal and that the Party expects to do very badly in the election. These assertions have been made on the basis of some remarks in an interview given to the New Left Review in London by the eminent Marxist historian, Eric Hobsbawm. Such assertions are mere claims without any foundations.        
	Later in the same statement, Karat held that the only omission he found in Hobsbawms account of their conversation was that he did not convey the CPM chiefs understanding of how the Trinamul Congress was collaborating with Maoists to target the Left Front government.        
	Significantly, Karats statement was sneaked exclusively to the Bengal partys mouthpiece Ganashakti yesterday and was more in the nature of a clarification to the local unit rather than a public denial of the content of his conversation with Hobsbawm. The publication of Karats view of the situation in Bengal, especially through such a credible voice as Hobsbawm, could not have pleased his Bengal comrades, already haunted by the spectre of electoral defeat.         
	Karats clarification makes it sound as if media reports had interpreted Hobsbawms interview to conclude that the CPM was going to do badly. The New Left Review interview makes it plain the conclusion was reached by Hobsbawm himself based on his conversation with Karat.        
	Karat confirmed that he had spoken  over the telephone  to Hobsbawm some months ago about the state of the CPM in Bengal, but seemed to quarrel with the conclusions the eminent historian had reached on the basis of their exchange.        
	Karat said: The comments made by Hobsbawm are his own views. He has cited me to underline the fact that the CPI(M) is under serious attack in West Bengal. The only omission I find, is that he has not referred to the role of the Maoists in the violence against the CPI(M) about which I had spoken to him.         
	Relevant sections of Hobsbawms interview to the New Left Review were first reproduced in The Telegraph.         
	Asked about recent developments that surprised him, Hobsbawm counted the collapse of the CPI(M) in West Bengal among them, adding, Prakash Karat, the CPI(M) general secretary recently told me that in West Bengal, they felt themselves beleaguered and besieged. They look forward to doing very badly against this new Congress in the local elections. This after governing as a national party, as it were, for thirty years. Hobsbawm went on to cite the Left Front governments industrialisation policy as clearly a big mistake.         
	Karats remarks to Hobsbawm have upset a large section of the Bengal unit which believes that the central leadership should avoid making defeatist noises at a time when the party is not merely demoralised by successive defeats but also under siege by an aggressive Trinamul.        
	In this context, the central plea of Karats clarification to Ganashakti is significant, as it is clearly aimed at allaying the impression that the party general secretary was insensitive to the difficulties being faced.         
	I had told him about the situation in West Bengal where the CPI(M) was under attack after the Lok Sabha elections. I had explained to him how the Maoists were targeting the CPI(M) and killing its cadres and how they were acting in collusion with the Trinamul Congress. I had also told him how the Party was gearing up to meet the difficult situation and was resisting the attacks by actively mobilising the people, Karat said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Class of Oxford beckons Singh the teacher
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Class of Oxford beckons Singh the teacher
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Sept. 20: Oxford University is setting up a new faculty to train world leaders, with Manmohan Singh invited to drop in and teach the students any time he feels like it.        
	The Indian Prime Minister was among eminent folk who sent good luck messages as the Blavatnik School of Government was launched in Oxford today. It is being funded by an incredibly generous donation of 75m from Leonard Blavatnik, a Russian-born US philanthropist who has no connection with the university but thought Oxford was the right place to set up such a school.        
	The school will start in 2012 and eventually take a total of 120 students who will spend a year being tutored in governance before earning a degree in Master of Studies.        
	More important, they will have access to a network of influential international figures  people like Manmohan Singh, who did his PhD from Nuffield College, Oxford, after studying economics at Cambridge as an undergraduate at St Johns College.        
	Oxford said the school aims to develop tomorrows leaders, in both the private and public sectors, through an original multi-disciplinary curriculum. It will address complex global problems in new and practical ways, drawing on the talents of top teachers and researchers from across the world.        
	Singh would be the first to admit he is not the best speaker in the world. In intimate tutorials with a small group of students, however, he could provide valuable insights into how to run a coalition government, formulate socially inclusive policies and keep maverick politicians from derailing fragile partnerships of unlikely parties.        
	In his message of support to the school, he said: I commend Oxford University for taking the initiative to establish this school and convey my best wishes for its success. I am sure that it will attain renown as one of the premier centres of study in the field of governance.        
	Asked whether he could be considered for a part-time teaching post, Oxfords spokesperson told The Telegraph: We would be delighted.        
	Blavatnik is an industrialist who has supported many other educational institutions.         
	If ambitious Indian students wish to apply, they ought to be aware that the school is to be anchored across humanities; medical sciences; social sciences; and mathematical, physical and life sciences. Students will be trained to offer a practically informed and critical perspective on a wide range of issues, spanning democracy, law and security, economic governance, science and the environment, demographics, public health and social policy.        
	Mamata Banerjee, who has not yet taken up an invitation to address a roundtable at Cambridge, could conceivably get a call from the Blavatnik School one day, especially if she were to become Bengal chief minister. Her unorthodox views on why it is important to hold up progress in the name of progress would no doubt enrich the schools programme.        
	So who are the other Indians who might be invited? Mayavati and Jayalalithaa are expected to be, as are former president Abdul Kalam and Mukesh Ambani. Narendra Modi would be a prize draw.        
	Former US President Bill Clinton, who came to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar more than 40 years ago, sent a video message: I am confident that... Blavatnik School will bring ground-breaking research closer to the heart of public policy.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: The Supreme Court will next hear on October 4 the Orissa governments petition against the in-principle clearance given by the environment ministry to the Polavaram project in Andhra Pradesh.        
	The Orissa government had moved the apex court on September 4 seeking an urgent stay on the clearance. The state fears the dam would submerge tribal villages in Malkangiri district and displace hundreds of people.        
	 The court, however, wondered why the Union government had not informed it of the in-principle clearance to the project at the last hearing of the original petition on August 2.         
	The Union government is yet to present its stand on the case to the court. The court today also directed that the Centre be informed of the states new application.

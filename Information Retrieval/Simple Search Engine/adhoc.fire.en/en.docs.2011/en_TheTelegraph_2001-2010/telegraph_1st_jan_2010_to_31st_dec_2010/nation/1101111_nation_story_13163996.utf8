	New Delhi, Nov. 10: The Centre has agreed to release funds to help states implement the revised pay package for university and college teachers and not to insist that they raise the retirement age of faculty to 65 years.         
	The Sixth Pay Revision for university and college teachers, announced by the HRD ministry on December 31, 2008, had said the retirement age of teachers should be raised from 60 to 65. It had announced that it would assist in implementing the package in state government institutions from January 2006 to March 2010.         
	The ministry said it would bear 80 per cent of the additional cost of implementing the revised pay package for nearly five lakh teachers in about 250 universities and 20,000 colleges under state governments.         
	But the condition that the retirement age be raised to 65 years ran into stiff opposition from the state governments. The retirement age varies  while it is 58 in most states, it is 55 in Kerala. The states argued that raising the retirement age to 65 would require huge spending.         
	Another condition was that the states would have to spend from their own funds and then get reimbursed by the Centre. At a meeting in June this year, state education ministers opposed this clause, too, citing a funds crunch.

	Sea waves crash into an embankment in rain-lashed Mumbai on Wednesday, the Gateway of India barely visible through a curtain of spray and haze.        
	Forty-six people, including nine in Mumbai and Thane, were killed in heavy rain since Tuesday evening in Maharashtra. Road, air and rail traffic were affected.         
	A boundary wall erected by a construction company caved in on a cluster of huts at Dnyaneshwar Nagar in Thane, trapping over a dozen people. Nine people were killed and four were injured.        
	The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation issued a high-tide alert for Wednesday and deployed lifeguards and firemen at the beaches.         
	The state government has announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh for each of the families of the dead, Rs 50,000 for each of the seriously injured and Rs 25,000 for each of those who sustained minor injuries.

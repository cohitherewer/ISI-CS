          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 16: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar today said action would be initiated against bureaucrats alleged to have played a role in the Adarsh Housing Society scam.        
	The NCP leaders statement came a day after the CBI, Mumbai, launched a preliminary probe into the scandal.        
	Pawar appeared unequivocal about action against both serving and retired bureaucrats alleged to have manipulated documents and cleared files related to the 31-storey building that was originally meant to be a six-storey structure for Kargil war widows.        
	The CBI has begun a serious investigation into the matter, and the probe will reveal the roles played by the officials. The Centre should take action against central officials, and we will take action against state officials, Pawar said.        
	Chief secretary J.P. Dange said: We will provide the necessary documents to the CBI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shashi hits out over insult
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shashi hits out over insult
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 16: If anyone expected Shashi Tharoor to go on the defensive in his Lok Sabha statement on the Kochi IPL controversy today, they quickly stood corrected.        
	The junior foreign minister oozed a sense of pride as he defended his efforts to help a consortiums bid for the Kochi team, even berating MPs for insulting him and his friend Sunanda Pushkar.        
	He declared himself innocent and delivered a sermon on the need to free cricket from the clutches of a coterie of vested interests.        
	With an Opposition uproar preventing him from making his statement, which was tabled on the instructions of Speaker Meira Kumar, Tharoor came out of the House and told the media he would only read out his statement and would take no questions.        
	The allegations against me which have been seized upon by honourable members of the Opposition are baseless, ill-founded and ill-motivated. I trust that I have clarified my position to the satisfaction of this august House, the junior foreign minister said.        
	The notion that somebody is some sort of proxy for me is frankly insulting to me and to the professionalism and business ethics of the investors and their associates. I have not benefited, and do not intend to benefit, in any way financial from my association with the team now or at a later stage, his statement said.        
	Tharoor went beyond self-defence. He said: It is unworthy of any member of this august House to imply that a reputed business professional and entrepreneur with a long track record of business can, because of her gender, only be seen as a front for someone else.        
	Tharoor also made a call for cleansing the management of cricket in India. It is essential in our democracy that institutions of interest to the general public are run openly, rather than restricting their opportunities to a favoured few, he said.        
	For India to change and prosper, it must be an India for all Indians, not one where a few rich and powerful individuals can dominate all activities of interest to them. The game and the benefits accruing from it should not be retained only by an influential coterie with interests in a few privileged centres.        
	The confident show, however, did not reflect the true picture of the turmoil Tharoor is passing through. Minutes after making this statement, his voice choked as he spoke to a group of Kerala journalists, complaining that people didnt understand what he was doing. He was very angry and almost in tears, a source in his office said.        
	Tharoor entered the Lok Sabha wearing a cheerful expression. He greeted MPs who came to shake hands with him with a smile and laughed loudly when a few of them cracked jokes. In a show of solidarity, many Congress members  from the veteran Girija Vyas to cricketer Mohammad Azharuddin  walked up to him and offered moral support.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Orissa to beef up coastline security
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 25: The Orissa government will step up security along its coastline and set up 13 marine police stations to prevent a repeat of the 26/11 terrorist attack on Mumbai using a sea route.        
	The decision was taken at a high-level meeting, chaired by state home secretary A.P. Padhi and attended by senior officials of Indian Navy and Coast Guard here today.        
	The meeting assumes significance as Orissa has a 480-km unguarded coastline that is extremely vulnerable to terrorist attacks.        
	The Indian Navy had conducted a mock drill, Operation Rakshak, along the coastline on February 3-4. We have learnt a lot from the mock drill, the home secretary told reporters here after the meeting today.        
	During the mock drill, a fake terrorist sneaked into Sri Jagannath temple in Puri despite the deployment of security personnel at the entry points, official sources said.         
	The state will train its police personnel guarding the coast. It has already submitted a proposal to the Centre to sanction 13 more marine police stations, said Padhi.        
	Five marine police stations have been set up at Arjipalli in Ganjam district, Paradip in Jagastsighpur district, Balramgadi in Balasore district, Jambu in Kendrapara district and Dhamra in Bhadrak district.        
	The Indian Navy and Coast Guard will train additional policemen. Sixty-one state policemen have already been trained in coastal security and another batch of 45 personnel will undergo training soon, official sources said.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Order too late to save professor
  - Glare on Aligarh university after death of teacher suspended over gay charge        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          R Srinivas Siras                                        
	Lucknow, April 8: The order reached Aligarh Muslim University today, six days after the suspended elderly professor had won a reprieve from the high court. It was too late.        
	His former colleagues were already preparing to hold a condolence meeting.        
	Had the order staying his suspension reached even a day earlier, R. Srinivas Siras might have been alive.        
	Police yesterday found him lying dead on a sofa of his rented home, where the 64-year-old, hounded out of the university for being gay, had been staying after being told to leave his campus residence.        
	The day before, April 6, his beloved university had told him it wouldnt take him back as the copy of the court order had not arrived yet.        
	Police sources said Siras appeared to have vomited and there were bloodstains on his shirt. The way his body was found points to a case of suicide. The reason of death could be depression, said city superintendent of police, Aligarh, Mahendra Singh Chauhan.        
	But we have not found any suicide note, a police official said.        
	An autopsy this afternoon said Sirass death was unnatural.        
	All we can say is that death was not caused by natural reasons, said Dr S.K. Varshney, who headed a panel of three doctors who conducted the post-mortem.         
	The doctors wouldnt say if it was a case of suicide. We cannot state this for certain. It is for the police to say, Varshney said, adding that they had preserved the viscera for further examination.        
	Siras, who headed the department of modern Indian languages, had been suspended by AMU for alleged homosexual acts in his campus home on the basis of a sting operation in which he was purportedly shown hugging a young man in his room.        
	The suspension order came on February 10, seven months after Delhi High Court had ruled that adult consensual gay sex was no longer a crime.        
	The professor, who was from Maharashtra, had gone back to hometown Nagpur after the university suspended him. On April 2, Allahabad High Court stayed the suspension.        
	Siras then returned to Aligarh on April 5, three days after the court reprieve. But AMU refused to lift the suspension as a copy of the order hadnt reached yet.        
	When the professor, who had taught at AMU for over 20 years, was told about this, he went into depression. I thought I would rejoin my beloved university, he had told some reporters in Aligarh.        
	The copy of the high court order reached AMU today, an hour before Sirass department was to hold a condolence meeting.        
	What is the use of this now? said a junior lecturer of the department. He is no more. This university is in a mess.        
	University insiders said they suspected some senior members had held back the copy of the court order. We will see why the court order reached so late, vice-chancellor Abdul Aziz said.        
	A probe by the Association for Advocacy and Legal Inquiry (AALI), a human rights group in Lucknow, claims that a university electrical engineer was asked to remove the power meter and fans from the professors campus home to make it impossible for him to stay on.        
	Police sources said they would probe AMUs charges against Siras and the professors allegations against the university to find out if any external factors were responsible for his death.        
	But the cops, too, appear to have been unhelpful when Siras had approached them after the sting operation.        
	On March 3, Aligarh police had sent back Sirass FIR against the sting operation because it was in English. The police said they registered FIRs only if they were in Hindi.        
	The next day when Siras went back with a Hindi translation of the FIR, he was told to give it personally to Vijay Prakash, the senior superintendent of police, Aligarh, in the evening, the probe report by the rights group AALI said.        
	He was being hounded by his colleagues, the moral police and a section of professors in AMU. The police did not help him when he was alive. They are now doing a post-mortem on him literally and figuratively, said Rashid Ismail, a student of the department Siras headed.         
	Its a shame the university would take long to recover from.

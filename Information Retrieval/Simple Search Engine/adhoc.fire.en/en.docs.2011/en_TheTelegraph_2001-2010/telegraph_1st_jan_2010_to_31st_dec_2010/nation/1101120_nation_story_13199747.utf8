The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal contests Swamy on procedure
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sibal contests Swamy on procedure
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: The Centre today said law and procedure did not allow the Prime Minister to sanction prosecution against any minister or official without a probe.         
	Kapil Sibal, who was given charge of telecom after A. Rajas exit, told reporters: Subramanian Swamy knew that law requires that he file a complaint of wrongdoing before a magistrate or before the police and that a probe by either substantiates his complaint before any prosecution could be ordered... he never did this.         
	What Swamy did instead was to write to the Prime Minister, making charges and appending newspaper articles but no substantive evidence, Sibal said.         
	The minister, who is also a lawyer, refused to say if this was the line the government would take in court.         
	Everybody must understand that the Prime Minister cannot sanction prosecution till an investigation into the matter is complete the CBI was probing the issue, he said. Sanction is a legal term and its purpose is for prosecution and not investigation... till CBI report is complete, there cannot be sanction for prosecution.         
	Opposition MP Swamy had written several times to Manmohan Singh since 2008 calling for investigation and prosecution of Raja, who was then the telecom minister. Swamy has since claimed that he received ackowledgements every time he wrote a letter, but a reply only after 16 months in March this year.         
	The Supreme Court on Tuesday made observations on the Prime Minister for his alleged inaction in response to Swamys requests and then said an affidavit should be filed on his behalf by Saturday.         
	Congress circles appeared unhappy with the legal officers and the government for not pointing out this simple fact to the court and allowing what they describe as misrepresentation by an Opposition politician who simply wants to muddy waters.         
	Signs are that at the next hearing, it will also be stressed that the Prime Minster has long been calling for transparency in spectrum allocation.         
	However, the government could not stop Raja from going ahead with the sale of 2G spectrum at prices that were discovered in 2001. The Comptroller and Auditor Generals report has said Rajas decision-making cost the exchequer thousands of crores.         
	Raja has been arguing that he followed rules set during the NDA regime and kept the entry fee low in order to keep the cost of telecom services low. But he has been accused of making sudden changes in the timeline that allegedly helped some players and kept others out.         
	Legal experts said that change in the timeline could attract a civil case, where corporate groups could claim they had been hurt by a policy decision which made the playing field uneven, but it did not make for a criminal case that Swamy has been pushing for.         
	At a different forum, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said that when he fixed Rs 35,000 crore as possible receipts from the auction of 3G spectrum, he had no idea the actual amount would be nearly double. So nobody could have forecast how much could be realised from 2G (if it had been auctioned), the minister said.         
	This was a clear sign the government would not simply throw Raja to the wolves and say he had lost money meant for the national exchequer, but would let the investigation continue, sources said.

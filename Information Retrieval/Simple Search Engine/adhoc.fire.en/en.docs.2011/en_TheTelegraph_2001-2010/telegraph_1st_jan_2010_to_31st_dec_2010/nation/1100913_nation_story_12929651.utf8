          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 12: Mamata Banerjee today told Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee over the phone that she wanted the amended land acquisition act to be sent to a standing committee, a move that will effectively delay its tabling till the Bengal elections are over next year.        
	The Congress wants to table the bill in the winter session.        
	Given the sensitivity attached to land acquisition in Bengal, we dont want to take any risk during the Assembly polls. So it is better if the bill is sent to a standing committee. By the time the committee gives its opinion on the bill, our Assembly polls will be over, a Trinamul junior minister said.         
	A party source said that Mamata conveyed everything concerning the land bill to Mukherjee who was in Calcutta till this morning.         
	Sudip Bandopadhyay, the Trinamul chief whip in the Lok Sabha, however, added a twist to the matter by saying that Mamata had conveyed to UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi that a new land law should be put in place of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894.        
	The 1894 Land Acquisition Act is a British law. We want a thoroughly changed new land law in place of this old act, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Speech therapy: charm rivals, gag party Pranab woos, at lunch and tea 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Speech therapy: charm rivals, gag party 
Pranab woos, at lunch and tea          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Pranab Mukherjee (centre) with state finance ministers at a meeting in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 21: Pranab Mukherjee has unleashed a charm offensive on the Opposition ahead of Parliaments monsoon session, starting Monday.        
	Not only is Mukherjee the leader of the Lok Sabha, he is also the UPAs principal trouble-shooter. Observers believe he has an unenviable task in a House in which the Congress might be more happily placed than it was in 2004 but not comfortable enough to thumb its nose at the Opposition.        
	The governments somewhat on-the-edge plight was reinforced in the budget session when Mukherjee pulled all stops to shore up the UPAs numbers after the BJP and the Left brought cut motions against petro price rise. From winning over the Yadavs and Mayavati to wooing Independent MPs, Mukherjees labours paid off when the UPA trumped the Opposition.        
	In the two-month interregnum between the budget and monsoon sessions, the Opposition re-grouped itself when it called a national strike to protest another spike in petro price. That show threatened to upset the UPAs applecart. Which is why Mukherjees political reflexes swung into action.        
	In the forthcoming session, the government has important business on its agenda: it wants to introduce the womens bill in the Lok Sabha and roll out the goods and services tax (GST) regime. It cannot push these through without having the Opposition on board.        
	Through the week, Mukherjee had Opposition leaders over to his North Block office for lunch or tea.        
	First on the guest list were L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley of the BJP. The RSS had hoped Advani would fade away from political consciousness as a parliamentarian emeritus when he was kicked up as BJP parliamentary party chairman. To the contrary, the veteran bounced back to show he would not take honourary titles but was here to stay as a pro-active leader. The partys as well as the NDAs warm-up strategy meets ahead of Parliament will take place at Advanis house early next week.        
	Mukherjee read the tea leaves accurately. Over a normal vegetarian meal, he sounded out Advani, Sushma and Jaitley on the GST. Although the BJP was tempted to use it as a Centre versus states issue, it was ultimately agreed that the matter was not political. The leaders asked Mukherjee to evolve a consensus because GST was perceived as discriminatory.        
	Business wisdom has it that affluent, high-consuming states would benefit by collecting taxes in proportion to their spending wealth while poorer states, despite being rich in resources, would trail because of lower incomes and lower end-point consumption.        
	The leaders used the opportunity to urge the finance minister not to end the tax holiday given to Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, both ruled by the BJP.        
	On Monday evening, Mukherjee invited Sharad Yadav, the Janata Dal (United) leader, for tea that included soup, vegetable cutlets and gulab jamun. The interaction was helpful because at least it showed that Pranab babu wanted to end the communication gap with us, Yadav told The Telegraph.        
	Although GST was the major conversation topic, Mukherjee told Yadav he would need the Oppositions support in dealing with Nepal and Kashmir. His verdict? We need consensus on foreign policy, interactions like these on economic policy.        
	Today, it was Lalu Prasads turn to lunch with him over rice, yellow dal, shukto and vegetable koftas. No fish or mutton, because the RJD chief turned vegetarian a few years ago.        
	So, do the courtesies extended by Mukherjee stand out as extraordinary in contemporary Indian politics?        
	Senior columnist Inder Malhotra, who has covered major political events from Jawaharlal Nehrus era, said: Mukherjee is placed in a unique situation where he is the governments prime trouble-shooter in the Lok Sabha because the Prime Minister is not a member of this House. Normally, the Prime Minister deals directly with the Opposition. Panditji (Nehru) would ask (Lal Bahadur) Shastri to handle the troublespots, whether it was Kashmir or Kerala. But he reached out to the Opposition himself.

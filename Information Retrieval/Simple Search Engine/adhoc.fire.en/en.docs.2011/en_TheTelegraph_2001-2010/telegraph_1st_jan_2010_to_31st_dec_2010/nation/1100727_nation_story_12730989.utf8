	An interceptor struck down a target 15km above the Bay of Bengal in a missile defence test  the fourth in the series  by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).        
	The test of the endo-atmospheric (within the atmosphere that is up to 30km altitude) interceptor missile is one of a series in which the DRDO is also developing an exo-atmospheric interceptor. DRDO sources say they are trying to develop both types to be able to strike down an enemy missile at different trajectories.        
	The single-stage interceptor missile fitted with a directional warhead neutralised the target, a Prithvi missile, the sources said.        
	The target Prithvi ballistic missile was fired from Launch Complex III of the Interim Test Range at Chandipur on the Orissa coast. The interceptor was launched seconds later from Wheeler Island, off the coast, and destroyed the Target Missile breaking it into fragments, the sources said.        
	The interceptor was tracked by various radars and sensors. All weapon system elements including Command and Control, Communication and Radar performed satisfactorily, the DRDO claimed.         
	Among those who were overseeing the test were V.K. Saraswat, secretary (defence research and development); Avinash Chandar, director, Advanced Systems Laboratory, Hyderabad; K. Shekhar, chief controller, DRDO; V.L.N. Rao, programme director; S.K. Ray, director, Research Centre Imarat, Hyderabad; P. Venugopalan, director, Defence Research amp; Development Laboratory, Hyderabad; S.P. Dash, director, ITR; the Vice-Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal P.K. Barbora and the additional director general, Army Air Defence, Maj. Gen. V.K. Saxena.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 21: A Delhi court today rejected alleged spy Madhuri Guptas bail plea saying the charges against her were too grave to allow any relief.        
	Gupta, a middle-level Indian diplomat posted in the Islamabad mission, has been in judicial custody since she was arrested a month ago on the charge of passing on information to Pakistani intelligence.        
	Her lawyer Joginder Dahiya had filed the bail application after junior foreign minister Preneet Kaur told Parliament on April 29 that Gupta didnt have access to classified documents.        
	Additional public prosecutor Rita Sharma told the court that many of the emails accessed from Guptas laptop were yet to be probed and that bail for her would hamper investigations. She said computers seized from Gupta had been sent for forensic examination and reports were still awaited.        
	Gupta, booked under the Official Secrets Act, had claimed that her interrogation was complete and there was no need for her to be kept in jail. The 53-year-old had added that she had high blood pressure and high sugar levels and should be allowed to get out for better treatment.        
	She had said there was no likelihood of her becoming a fugitive since she was a permanent resident of Delhi. The court had earlier extended her remand till May 29.

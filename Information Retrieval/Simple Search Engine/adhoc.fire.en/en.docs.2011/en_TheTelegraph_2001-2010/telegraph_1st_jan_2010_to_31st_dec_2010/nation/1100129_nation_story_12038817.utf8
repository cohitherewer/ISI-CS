	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 28: Maoist-backed Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangha leader Gananath Patra (70) was arrested from here at 8.30pm yesterday.        
	Patra has been charged of leading the land grabbing movement and inciting violence at Narayanpatna in Koraput district. His arrest comes close on the heels of arrest of Subhashree Panda, the wife of Maoist leader Sabyasachi.        
	Patra was denied bail by the court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate here as there was a murder charge against him in a case. The court allowed transit remand of Patra to be taken to Koraput. A CPI(ML) Liberation member, Patra has led many peoples movements. We were monitoring his movements, inspector-general of police (operations) Sanjeeb Marik said.

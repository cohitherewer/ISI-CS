                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shah flies   to Mumbai
                          Amit Shah                          
	Mumbai, Oct. 31 (PTI): Former Gujarat minister Amit Shah landed in Mumbai today, a day after he was ordered by the Supreme Court to stay away from his home state till November 15 when it hears the CBIs plea for cancellation of his bail.        
	Sources close to Shah said he flew to Mumbai from Ahmedabad today, complying with the directive of the apex court to leave the city by Sunday morning. It is not known where Shah, a close aide of chief minister Narendra Modi, is putting up in Mumbai where he has several relatives.        
	The former minister of state for home, an accused in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, was granted bail by Gujarat High Court on Friday.        
	The CBI had yesterday appealed in the apex court seeking cancellation of the bail, but the bench refused to reverse the high court order.        
	The CBI argued that Shah could tamper with evidence. By observing this condition (to leave Gujarat) set by the SC, Shah will be immune from the allegation of tampering with evidence, Shahs counsel Nirupam Nanavati had said.        
	Shah, who has been described by the CBI as the kingpin of the fake encounter conspiracy, quit his post in July after being slapped with charges of kidnapping and murder of alleged gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kausar Bi in 2005.

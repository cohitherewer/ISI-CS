          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Madhuri Gupta outside a New Delhi court on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 15: The foreign ministry is yet to send the mandatory sanction for the prosecution of spy Madhuri Gupta three weeks after her arrest, Delhi police today told a magistrate.        
	Following this, the court extended Guptas judicial remand for another 14 days.        
	Gupta, 53, a middle-level diplomat posted at Indias Islamabad mission, has been in Tihar jail since her arrest in the last week of April for allegedly passing on information to Pakistani intelligence.        
	Under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code, public servants accused of committing an offence in the discharge of their official duties cannot be prosecuted except with the sanction of competent authorities. Without a sanction, no chargesheet can be filed and no court can take cognisance of such offence.        
	The competent authority in Guptas case is the secretary, ministry of external affairs.        
	Its not clear whether the foreign ministry or the police are to blame for the delay. Police sources claimed that the forces special cell had sent an application to the ministry but did not say when.        
	If the police cannot file a chargesheet within 90 days of her arrest, the court is likely to grant bail.        
	The sanction rule is meant to protect judges, magistrates and public servants from frivolous prosecution, or to avoid prosecution if that is deemed not to be in the public interest  as may well happen in the case of an alleged mole.        
	In case the foreign ministry decides it is too risky to prosecute Gupta, whose remand hearings are being held behind closed doors, it has to let her off with, perhaps, a punishment posting following a departmental inquiry. So far, the ministry has not suspended her or taken any other action.        
	Last year, then Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan had said the system of sanctions had obstructed the course of justice in some cases and given public servants a sense of impunity.        
	The legislative intent behind the requirement for such a prior sanction was to discourage frivolous complaints and vexatious litigation against public servants. However, it is perceived in many quarters that these provisions contribute to a climate of impunity where the requisite sanction is either delayed or denied by higher executive authorities, Justice Balakrishnan had told a seminar on the fight against corruption.        
	Guptas lawyer Joginder Dahiya said: Delhi police today informed the court they had filed an application under Section 197 of the CrPC seeking sanction for the prosecution of the woman officer.        
	He added that Gupta, booked under the Official Secrets Act, had sought a copy of the first information report registered against her.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Governor vs mine brothers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                                                 HR Bharadwaj      
	New Delhi, July 13: Karnataka governor H.R. Bharadwaj today said he had asked chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa to take action against two of his ministers, the Reddy brothers, over their alleged illegal mining in Bellary.        
	Bharadwaj did not name the controversial brothers tourism minister G. Janardhana Reddy and revenue minister G. Karunakara Reddy  but questioned their continuance in the BJP cabinet.        
	He (the chief minister) is a person who realises the problem. I told him you have appointed them as ministers. Take action against them. He says I need time. He doesnt say it (the action) is not happening, the governor told reporters after meeting President Pratibha Patil.        
	Bharadwaj  a Congress leader who was law minister in the previous UPA government  did not specifically say the tainted ministers should be sacked. But he left little doubt that was what he meant when he said he had informed the chief minister and the central government of his concern and whether they can continue as ministers.        
	Late tonight, Karunakara Reddy, the revenue minister, threatened legal action against the governor. If, indeed, the governor has publicly made such a statement, we will initiate legal action, he said.        
	The BJP dubbed the governor a Congress agent working to dislodge the Yeddyurappa government. It even raked up Bharadwajs alleged role in the Ottavio Quattrocchi case. His record as a law minister was under a cloud. Im saying this with full responsibility, he did everything to save Quattrocchi (in the Bofors kickback case), BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said.        
	The Congress and Dal (Secular) MLAs have held up the Karnataka Assembly proceedings in recent weeks demanding a probe into the Reddys mining business.         
	Bharadwaj argued that one of the major problems was conflict of interest as the corruption allegations involved ministers making a profit, and said he had sought the Election Commissions views. The allusion was to a Congress MLAs disqualification petition against the Reddy brothers that Bharadwaj has referred to the poll panel.        
	The governor parried a question whether he would recommend imposition of Presidents rule. But he seemed to suggest the move was not necessary by saying there was no law and order problem.

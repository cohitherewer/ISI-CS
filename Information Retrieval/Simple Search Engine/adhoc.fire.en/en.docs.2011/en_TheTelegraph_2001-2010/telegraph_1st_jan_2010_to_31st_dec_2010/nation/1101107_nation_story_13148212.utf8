	New Delhi, Nov. 6: Left partner Forward Blocs decision to stay away from Parliament when Barack Obama addresses the House on Monday seems to have inspired MPs of some other parties too.        
	Trinamul Congress MP Kabir Suman, who has fallen foul of party boss Mamata Banerjee, today said he was least interested in listening to the US President speak, while Independent MP Tarun Mandal, who supports Trinamul, declared he would boycott the speech.        
	Suman said: I have serious business at home. Crisis at home is more important than listening to Obama.         
	Speaker effort        
	Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar has taken personal interest to make Barack Obamas visit to Parliament a memorable one.         
	Sources said that apart from personally selecting flower pots to be lined on the way Obama will take, Kumar for the first time will introduce a golden book for visitors. The book, bound in khadi silk, will be embossed in gold and the first signatory will be Obama.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Oct. 27: Defence minister A.K. Antony has asked the army and the navy to examine allegations that a new highrise in Mumbais Colaba in which top defence officers and bureaucrats own flats has been built on navy land.        
	The fact-finding move came even as the owners association of the 31-storey Adarsh Co-operative Housing Society denied the charges and claimed that the land was allotted by the Maharashtra government in 2004  during the ruling Congress-NCP coalitions first term.         
	The society blamed the controversy on aspirants who couldnt get an apartment. Two former army chiefs  N.C. Vij and Deepak Kapoor  have a flat each in the building.        
	What has stoked the row is that Adarsh lies in one of the costliest real-estate zones in the country, with each of the 103 flats estimated to have cost Rs 26 crore or more. Its proximity to a naval facility is the second point of contention.        
	The third dispute is whether coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) regulations  which forbid construction close to the coast, such as the Colaba area  were bent by state government officials.        
	Activists in Mumbai have alleged that the officers who tweaked the system to help the builder flout the CRZ rules, environmental laws and security considerations were granted flats in return for such favours.        
	The navys Western Command chief, Vice Admiral Sanjiv Bhasin, complained last week that the building was given clearances despite the hazard it posed to a nearby naval air station.         
	Bhasins misgivings assume significance against the backdrop of the high priority accorded to coastal security after 26/11.         
	But there are several political heavyweights  of both the ruling Congress and the Opposition Shiv Sena in Maharashtra  involved and the defence ministry is measuring its steps.         
	Those pointing a finger at the complex claim that initial clearance was for a six-storey building to house war widows and war veterans. Also, despite the CRZ norms limiting construction to 30 metres, the highrise rose to over 100 metres, the critics have said.        
	The owners association denied the allegations, saying not an inch of defence land has been grabbed. Some aspirants have been denied membership due to non-availability (of flats) and that is the origin of the problem, Brigadier (Retd) M.M. Wanchu, president of the housing society, said in Mumbai today.        
	He said the land was allotted by the state government in July 2004 at rates applicable to housing societies. The building plan was approved in stages as per rules. The CRZ clearance was obtained from the (Union) ministry of environment and forests on March 11, 2003, Wanchu said, denying the building violated CRZ norms.        
	Naval establishments are not close to the society as alleged, he asserted, and pointed out that there were several sensitive buildings in the vicinity, such as the Taj Mahal Hotel, the RBI headquarters and at least two other highrises. Neither (the) navy nor any other authorities have ever raised any security concerns over Adarsh in the past.        
	Wanchu also defended the allotment of flats to the former army chiefs. Gen. Vij was allotted a flat in 2009, nearly five years after retirement. Gen. Kapoor was with the Northern Command and had no role in formation of the society or allotment of land.

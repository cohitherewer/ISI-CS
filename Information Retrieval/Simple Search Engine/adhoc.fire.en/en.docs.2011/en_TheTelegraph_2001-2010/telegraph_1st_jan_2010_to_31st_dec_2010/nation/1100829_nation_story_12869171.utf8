  - Suggestion to use cold-water cannons in Kashmir        NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          A boy at a protest in Srinagar on Saturday. (Reuters)                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: Soak them, if you cant sock them.        
	The home ministry is thinking of using cold-water cannons to tame mobs in Kashmir, where unrelenting street violence has since June left over 60 people dead in firing by security forces, many of them children and teenagers.        
	As winter approaches, cold water will be effective. Moreover, there wont be any casualties, said a ministry source. They would rather get busy mopping floors.        
	Sources said jets of cold water should prove effective during winter when temperatures in Kashmir dip below zero.        
	The advice has come in the wake of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs directive on Thursday to form a task force that could suggest non-lethal ways to maintain public order.         
	We need to revisit standard operating procedures and crowd-control measures to deal with public agitations with non-lethal, yet effective and focused, measures, Singh told a conference of directors-general of police.        
	However, water cannons have also been known to cause internal injuries.        
	Sources in the Union home ministry said officials were already planning the composition of the task force that Singh had requested home minister P. Chidambaram to establish.        
	By Tuesday, Chidambaram is expected to finalise the names on the panel that will look at new ways of fighting street protests, particularly in Kashmir.         
	Sources said the police chiefs of Kashmir and some other states and the directors-general of central paramilitary forces would be part of the task force besides home ministry officials.        
	Home ministry officials said equipment would be bought to build up a non-lethal arsenal as conventional devices like tear-gas shells have made little impact on violent mobs.        
	We (need to) have a whole pile of equipment that would help change from a counter-insurgency grid to handling street protests, and it has to be done imaginatively, said an official.        
	Police forces across the world use water cannons. The police in Indonesia and the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland have even used pink and purple dyes that leave a mark on rioters.        
	Although institutes like the Defence Research and Development Organisation have devised novel weapons of crowd-control  such as the chilli bomb made out of the northeastern bhoot jolokia  the police forces still use rubber bullets and tear-gas shells.        
	This is despite crores of rupees that have been allotted for police modernisation. As for Kashmir, the Centre has since 2004 pumped in more than Rs 60,000 crore by way of plan or non-plan funds.

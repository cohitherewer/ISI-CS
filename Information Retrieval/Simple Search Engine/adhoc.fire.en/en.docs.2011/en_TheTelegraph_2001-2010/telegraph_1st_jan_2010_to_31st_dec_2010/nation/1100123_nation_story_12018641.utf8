The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cold wave freezes Rahul schedule
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cold wave freezes Rahul schedule
          NALIN VERMA                           BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha distributes blankets in Patna on Thursday                                  
	Patna, Jan. 22: In Bihar, politics is said to be the primary feed and fodder. But the crippling cold wave sweeping across the Indo-Gangetic belt for over a month now has cast a shadow on all political activity in the state just as it has on day-to-day living.        
	The prevailing cold wave was said to be one of the prime reasons  besides infighting  for the Congress leaderships inability to finalise a date for Rahul Gandhis scheduled visit here this month.         
	Who will come out to listen to him under such condictions? The party is waiting for some relief in the weather conditions to finalise his programme, said senior AICC delegate Umakant Singh, adding: Most of the party workers are staying indoors.        
	Schools, which were closed since December 21-22 for winter vacations, have not opened till date. The administration has extended vacations for the fifth time, declaring that schools would now open only on January 25 if the weather condition improved.        
	Room-heaters, geysers and woollens have vanished from the market after doing record business this season. Sources in leading companies revealed that that they had registered a growth of 40 per cent in sale.        
	There is no heater in stock for we have sold whatever we had in the state, the area manager of a leading company, Neeraj Kumar, said. Similarly, another companys area manager, Rezi DCosta, said: We have sold room-heaters worth Rs 45 lakh against our target of Rs 30 lakh. There are no room-heaters left in the store now.        
	Three days ago, the Lhasa market organised primarily by the Tibetans for selling woollen garments and jackets near the Patna junction railway station, wound up suddenly after the shop-keepers had nothing more to sell.        
	According to sources in the railways and civil aviation, at least 97 long-distance trains passing through Bihar and 29 Patna-bound flights have been cancelled between December 20 and January 21.        
	People here havent seen a sunrise since December 22. And the state hasnt experienced a bright and sunny day in the past 20 days.         
	The weather office recorded 4.3 degrees Celsius as the lowest temperature and 10.2 as the highest here yesterday.         
	The westerly wind rebounding to the northern planes after hitting the Himalayas has been causing icy waves in the region, said a meteorological official here, adding: The condition is likely to continue for a few more days.        
	The lack of sunshine has affected the rabi crops adversely with wheat and barley plants turning yellow.

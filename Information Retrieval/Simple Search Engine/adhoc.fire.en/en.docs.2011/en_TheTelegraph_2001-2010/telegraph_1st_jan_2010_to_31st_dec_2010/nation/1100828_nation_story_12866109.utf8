The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Temple tempo before verdict 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Temple tempo before verdict 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: The RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) have ramped up pressure on the Centre to think of building a bhavya (grand) Ram temple weeks before Allahabad High Court is expected to pronounce its verdict in the 60-year-old original title suit of the Babri Masjid/Ram Janmabhoomi case.        
	The VHP kicked off a Hanuman Shakti Jagran Abhiyan (campaign to display Hanumans power) in Nagpur to make a case for the temple.         
	Launching the programme, RSS chief Mohanrao Bhagwat said: We are trying to have a magnificent temple built with consensus. But if required, we are ready to embark on another struggle. Because in a country that upholds Satyamev Jayate, it is ironical we have to fight and struggle to establish the truth.        
	VHP veteran Ashok Singhal, addressing the media, said irrespective of the court verdict, the only realistic solution to the dispute was handing over the land to Hindus through a law that Parliament should pass.        
	 This is the final solution because the judgment will certainly not please both the sides, he said.        
	Singhal made it clear that no replica of the16th century Babri mosque could be built within the Shastriya seema of Ayodhya as defined in the Ramcharitrmanas, which means it can come up only outside the town limit.         
	He said the VHP and the Hindu clergy would not forfeit their claims to Varanasis Gyan Vapi and Mathuras Shahi Idgah mosques that allegedly came up on the debris of temples.        
	The VHP wrote to all MPs exhorting them to rise above political considerations and pledge their support to a law that will facilitate the temples construction.        
	However, Singhal warned the BJP not to take advantage of the RSS-VHP campaign. The Ram temple is not an electoral matter, its a national issue. The BJP should atone for politicising it. But for Narasimha Rao and Kalyan Singh, that structure would have stayed intact in Ayodhya, he said.        
	BJP sources said they had reasons to believe that the temple card had outlived its utility for the party. They referred to the back-to-back defeats in Assembly and Lok Sabha polls in Uttar Pradesh.        
	On July 27, the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court reserved its judgement. Indications are the verdict will come in the third or fourth week of September.        
	The Uttar Pradesh government has taken pre-emptive measures to tackle a communal or political fallout by posting 168 companies of the Provincial Armed Constabulary throughout the state and ordered the police force not to go on leave. It has sought additional forces from the Centre.

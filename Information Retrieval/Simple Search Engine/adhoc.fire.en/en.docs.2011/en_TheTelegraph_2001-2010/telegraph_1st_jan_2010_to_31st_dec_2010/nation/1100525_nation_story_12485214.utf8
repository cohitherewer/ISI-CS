The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Runway to get longer

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 24: Mangalores tabletop runway is likely to get longer by 1,000ft, the added part built on pillars rising from the valley below.        
	The hanging runway idea, part of the original plan but shelved for six years, has been revived after a Boeing 737-800 overshot the plateau-top runway on Saturday, killing 158 people.        
	Since theres no room on the plateau to build the extra length of runway, it will be perched on a network of pillars embedded in the earth below the cliff, Airports Authority of India (AAI) sources said.        
	The sources added that apart from the extra 1,000ft, which will take its length to 9,300ft, the runway would get a longer buffer zone of soft earth and sand pits to halt any overshooting plane. Aviation experts recommend a buffer area of 1,000ft but Mangalores is 300ft.        
	If the plan is approved, the bidding process will take at least six months. The extension will take at least three years to complete, considering the engineering challenges of building the huge pillars to support the massive concrete structure (runway) which, in turn, would have to bear the load of large aircraft, an AAI engineer said.        
	Runways are often built on pillars in the West, especially when they have to stretch over highways with heavy traffic. But it could not be confirmed if a tabletop runway had ever been built on pillars.        
	An AAI official said this extra length was part of the plan when the runway was being built between 2004 and 2006. But two factors led to it being scrapped  the high costs and lack of urgency for that additional length.        
	Since the (existing length) was more than sufficient for even an Airbus A320 to land comfortably, the extra 1,000 feet was not felt to be an urgent necessity then, he said. At least two Airbus flights now operate out of the runway.        
	Besides, building the extended runway-on-pillars would have raised the cost of construction by Rs 40 crore.        
	Since the runway in its present form was estimated to cost Rs 70 crore in view of the technical challenges involved in building such a large concrete structure atop a plateau, it was decided not to proceed with the 1,000ft extension, another AAI source said.        
	The cost will now be much higher compared with what was projected originally. But commercially, extending the runway makes sense.        
	Gulf-based international carriers now want to operate out of Mangalore, having watched the increased air traffic and the huge success of Air India Express.

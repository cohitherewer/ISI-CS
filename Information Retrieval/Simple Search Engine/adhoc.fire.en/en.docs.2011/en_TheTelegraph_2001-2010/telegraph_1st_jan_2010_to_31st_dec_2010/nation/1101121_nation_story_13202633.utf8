          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Manmohan Singh with his former media advisor Sanjay Baru in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 20: The Prime Minister went by law ministry advice to wait for the CBIs findings on the 2G spectrum controversy before deciding whether to sanction then telecom minister A. Rajas prosecution, a government affidavit told the Supreme Court today.        
	According to the advice received from the department of legal affairs, the decision of granting sanction for prosecution may be determined only after perusal of evidence (oral or documentary) collected by the investigation agency i.e. CBI and other materials to be provided to the competent authority, the document said, quoting a note from the legal affairs department.        
	This view was later endorsed by the law ministry, said the affidavit, filed on behalf of a director in the Prime Ministers Office (PMO), V. Vidyavati. The department of personnel and training conveyed this to Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy, it added.        
	Swamy had earlier sent a complaint to the Prime Minister and demanded sanction for the prosecution of Raja, who recently had to resign over the spectrum scandal.        
	At its last hearing of Swamys petition seeking sanction for Rajas prosecution, the top court had directed that an affidavit be filed on the PMs behalf stating the facts so that nothing was held back from the bench.        
	Todays affidavit, filed instead on behalf of a director in the PMO, restricted itself to the facts of the case, presumably leaving the legal issues to be handled by the law officers during court arguments.        
	The affidavit made it clear it was addressing the courts specific query about the delay and inaction in dealing with Swamys complaints.        
	Swamy has cited a 1997 judgment to argue the Prime Minister should have taken an unambiguous stand on the grant of sanction to prosecute Raja within a maximum period of four months. But, Swamy claims, the Prime Minister only replied to him in March this year  15 months later.        
	The affidavits version:        
	The Prime Minister went through Swamys first letter, written on December 1, 2008, and sought to know the facts of the case. A letter was sent to the telecom department asking for a factual report. Two more letters were received later that year from CPI MPs Gurudas Dasgupta and Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy.        
	On March 24, 2009, a director in the PMO prepared a note and sent it to the telecom department, asking it to reply to Swamy.        
	The President then received a complaint from Anil Gopal Variath, advocate and founder of the organisation Law Focus, seeking prosecution of Raja. This was forwarded to the PMO on April 4, 2009.        
	On May 20, 2009, a secretary in the PMO prepared a note seeking the law ministrys opinion whether there was any ground to consider such a request. The matter was referred to the legal affairs department on May 29, 2009.        
	Swamy wrote two more letters to the PMO, on October 23, 2009, and October 31, 2009. The second letter said it was not necessary to carry out any detailed enquiry on whether these allegations are true and false.        
	The letter complained that the statements by the Prime Minister and the finance minister were non sequitur (did not follow logically from what had gone before). Swamy wrote that if sanction were not granted by November 15, 2009, he would move court.        
	Both letters were forwarded to the law ministry for examination and advice on November 18, 2009.

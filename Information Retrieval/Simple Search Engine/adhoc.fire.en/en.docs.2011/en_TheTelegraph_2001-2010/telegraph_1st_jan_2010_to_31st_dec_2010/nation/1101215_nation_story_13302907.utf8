	New Delhi, Dec. 14: Carry red chilli spray to feel safe in Delhi, a doctor and her 28 friends are telling women.         
	Through camps in colleges and neighbourhoods, the group has over the past fortnight been spreading awareness about the use of chilli powder as a weapon of self-defence.         
	Carry a pack of red chillies in the bag and blind an assailant, said Seema Malik, a doctor who has launched the Mirchi Jhonk campaign, possibly inspired by the Smita Patil film Mirch Masala.         
	The group has also advised women to always walk on pavements facing the traffic, not in the same direction, and to keep all important phone numbers, including that of police, on fast dial.         
	Delhi has become completely unsafe for women. Every day, each one of us faces molestation in one form or the other and most such incidents are never reported. The rising number of crimes against women, including rape and molestation, prompted us to launch the campaign. We felt strongly about making the city a safer place for women, Malik, who runs a skin and cosmetic surgery clinic, said.         
	It is a campaign by the women for the women. People can volunteer for self-defence training.         
	The group, which includes doctors, retired police officers, models and teachers, officially launched the campaign in September but it could not take off then because of the Commonwealth Games. But after the gangrape of a woman from Mizoram, Mirchi Jhonk started in earnest.         
	The group has been distributing leaflets and putting up posters across the city to help women in distress. They have a dedicated team of self-defence trainers and counsellors and run a 24-hour helpline (60606161). Any woman in trouble can call the number and group members immediately get in touch with police.         
	We have already received 163 cases, ranging from eve-teasing, stalking and molestation to domestic violence, and have taken up the matter with the cops, Malik said.         
	Acting on a complaint about the absence of street lights on a particular road, the group also contacted the corporation to put up lights on deserted streets. After the lights, things have improved a lot, another member of the group said.         
	Rajan Bhagat, the spokesperson for Delhi police, said: We need this kind of initiative to help police catch the culprits and crack down on such crimes.         
	Malik said the group was planning to conduct training camps in schools and colleges after taking permission from the respective institutions.        
	A cab service for women, with women drivers, is also on the cards.

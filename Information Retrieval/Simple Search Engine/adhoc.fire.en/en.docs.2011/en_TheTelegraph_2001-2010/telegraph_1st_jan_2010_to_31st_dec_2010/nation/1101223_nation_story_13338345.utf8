	New Delhi, Dec. 22: Left leaders today sought to distance themselves from the BJPs frontal attack on the Prime Minister over the spectrum and other corruption cases as they called on Manmohan Singh to discuss the plight of farmers in Congress-ruled Andhra Pradesh.         
	CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan and CPM politburo member Brinda Karat led a delegation of seven parties, including Chandrababu Naidus Telugu Desam, to demand adequate compensation for the states farmers who have been buffeted by repeated natural calamities.        
	We told the Prime Minister to act fast and avoid Andhra Pradesh turning into another Vidarbha. So far, 37 farmers have committed suicide, Brinda said.         
	The meeting with the Prime Minister came a day after the general secretaries of both the CPM and the CPI wrote to him demanding that the Andhra situation be declared a natural calamity.         
	Left leaders said their emphasis on the plight of Andhra farmers was an attempt to pre-empt allegations of co-ordinating with the BJP over the demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe into the telecom scam and also to keep its secular front partner, the Desam, happy.        
	The BJP is desperately trying to expand the NDA by roping in parties like the BJD, the Desam and others who have joined hands with the Left. Farmer distress is a big issue for the Desam and we need to be with them, a CPM leader said.        
	So even as the BJP is raising the pitch for a JPC probe and aiming directly at the Prime Minister, the Left parties appear to be softening their stand on the issue. CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta has already said his party will not pursue the demand and disrupt Parliament during the budget session.         
	For the record, however, CPM leaders continued to demand a JPC probe. Brinda said a JPC should be set up to look into whatever happened during the Congress regime and that of the BJP-led NDA that preceded it.        
	She also accused the Prime Minister of remaining silent for two years over the alleged corruption in allocation of 2G spectrum by former telecom minister A. Raja.

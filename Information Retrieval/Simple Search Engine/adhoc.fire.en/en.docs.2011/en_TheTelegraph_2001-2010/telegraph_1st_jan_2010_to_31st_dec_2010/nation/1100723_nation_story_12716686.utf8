          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, July 22: Autonomy was back on the lips of National Conference leaders today as they met to discuss how to check the slide of the party, which swept Srinagar in the 2008 elections but is now looking powerless in the face of uninterrupted street protests.         
	The partys working committee, meeting for the first time since the present unrest began on June 11, sought restoration of autonomy in its pristine form or that which existed before 1953 when Kashmir had its own Prime Minister and Sadar-e-Riyasat (President).         
	The only way to bring peace and normality to the state and the subcontinent is to restore autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir in its pristine form, party president Farooq Abdullah said.         
	Chaired by Abdullah, the meeting also pushed for the release of all the political detainees in the state, which could include hardliners such as Syed Ali Shah Geelani, the septuagenarian leader seen as the face of the present troubles.

   Cong sticks to nominations to apex body           SANJAY K JHA                           Sonia Gandhi takes a sip at the AICC meeting in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                         
	New Delhi, Nov 2: The irony was difficult to miss: the All India Congress Committee that hailed Rahul Gandhi for bringing internal democracy in the frontal organisations today screamed its heart out to block elections in the parent organisation.         
	Sonia Gandhi, who too showered praise on her son for democratising the Youth Congress, readily accepted the nomination proposal for the Congress Working Committee.         
	The purpose of calling the AICC meeting after three years  the party constitution says the AICC should meet at least twice a year  was defeated at the outset when general secretary Janaradan Dwivedi threw the hint that the high command was not in favour of elections.         
	Though the election schedule has been announced, many states have passed resolutions authorising Sonia Gandhi to constitute the Congress Working Committee and the Central Election Committee, he said.         
	So when the partys election authority chief, Oscar Fernandes, rose to talk about the planned polls, he was roared down by some AICC members who had taken the hint dropped from the dais.         
	True to the script, Oscar announced: There will be no election, we leave it to Sonia Gandhi.         
	The Congress president responded: It is a great responsibility and the task is not as easy as it appears. Many people complain after being left out. But if you have reposed trust in me, be prepared to suffer some losses too.         
	By way of explanation for not holding elections, Dwivedi said: Organisation is run by co-operation, not competition.         
	At the same time, the party extolled Rahul for holding elections in the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India, of which he is in charge as general secretary.         
	Sonia mentioned it in her speech, the formal statement adopted by the AICC appreciated Rahuls initiative and almost all the individual speakers hailed the electoral process introduced by him.         
	With polls to the working committee and the election committee ruled out, the meeting was reduced to a self-congratulatory exercise with some speakers hailing the Congress and others the Nehru-Gandhi family. Although some issues like Jammu and Kashmir, terrorism and the Naxalite trouble were mentioned both in the formal statement and Sonias speech, the four-hour exercise was largely limited to propaganda about government initiatives and the glorious past of the Congress.         
	No mention was made of the Commonwealth Games corruption charges or the Adarsh housing society scam that has shaken the partys government in Maharashtra. Suresh Kalmadi, who greeted senior leaders with the broadest smile, and the glum Ashok Chavan, who was among the first persons to sit on the dais, attracted maximum attention from the audience. Whispers and jokes about the two kept Congress delegates engaged and happy.         
	At such gatherings, Sonia usually exhorts Congress members to rise above selfish interests, greed and corruption, but this time she only asked them not to forget the basic values on which the party was raised. She talked about simplicity and commitment but avoided even a subtle message on corruption, surprising delegates.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, whose personal integrity repeatedly came in for special mention, also chose to skip the issue of corruption.

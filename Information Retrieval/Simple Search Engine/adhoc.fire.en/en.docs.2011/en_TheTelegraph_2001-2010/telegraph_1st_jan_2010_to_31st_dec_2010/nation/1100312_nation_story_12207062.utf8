          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Nitish Kumar in Patna on Thursday. (Deepak Kumar)                                  
	Patna, March 11: Nitish Kumar today warned Union home minister P. Chidambaram against speaking to states on extremism through the media.        
	He (Chidambaram) should desist from speaking to states on the extremely sensitive issue through the media. He should check the Union home secretary, too, from conducting dialogues through the media, the Bihar chief minister said, indicating he would perhaps not meet Chidambaram to discuss the Maoist issue.         
	Chidambaram recently wrote a letter to Nitish Kumar and other chief ministers of Maoist-hit states to meet him to give their opinion on the proposed Operation Greenhunt and other action directed at rebels.        
	Addressing a meeting of party executives, Nitish said: The most effective solution to extremism is to take the light of development to the grassroots and end corruption in the administrative structure supposed to deliver goods to poor people.        
	It is not that the police should stop work. Lawful action must be taken against the offences. But the actual solution lies in strengthening democratic institutions and winning the heart of people.        
	He said Bihar used to witness carnage at regular intervals prior to the JD(U)-led government here. But now violence on a big scale has become a thing of the past and there is harmony.

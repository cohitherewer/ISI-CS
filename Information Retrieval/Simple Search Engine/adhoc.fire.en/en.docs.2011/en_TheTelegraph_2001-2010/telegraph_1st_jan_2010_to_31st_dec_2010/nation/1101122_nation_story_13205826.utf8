	New Delhi, Nov. 21 (PTI): The CBI today arrested M. Jayachandran, the sacked treasurer of Commonwealth Games organising committee, in connection with the alleged funds irregularities in the organisation of the Queens baton relay in London last year.        
	Jayachandran was arrested after several rounds of questioning, CBI spokesperson R.K. Gaur said tonight.        
	He said the Games official was arrested in connection with the ongoing investigation in two cases registered by the CBI earlier this week. The spokesperson added that Jayachandrans residence was being searched.        
	The CBI action comes within days of the arrest of two other sacked Games officials  T.S. Darbari, the sacked joint director-general of the committee, and Sanjay Mohindroo, the deputy director-general.        
	Jayachandran, who was expelled from the committee on charges of alleged irregularities in the relay, was also quizzed over certain contracts awarded for the Games.        
	 Jayachandran has also been questioned by enforcement directorate (ED) officials for over six hours. The ED had summoned him under the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act.        
	The ED has also interrogated Games committee director-general V.K. Verma several times, on one occasion for 10 hours at a stretch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Realign whiff in Jaya muscle flex

          G.C. SHEKHAR                           Jayalalithaa                                  
	Chennai, July 13: Coimbatore witnessed a massive rally today by Jayalalithaa in a quick show of strength to boost her stronghold barely a fortnight after chief minister M. Karunanidhi held a Tamil cultural conference in the same city.         
	Coimbatore is in western Tamil Nadu, where Karunanidhis DMK could not win a single seat in the last Lok Sabha elections. By holding a rally that gathered a crowd of around 2 lakh, Jayalalithaa today tried to blunt any support that the ruling party could have shored up.         
	The DMK had hoped that the success of the World Classical Tamil Conference, combined with recent desertions by former ministers of the ADMK from the western districts, would boost its chances in next years Assembly elections.         
	But the turnout at Jayalalithaas rally has proved that the ADMKs hold on the western belt remained unshaken. Most of the cadres who came today from the neighbouring districts travelled on their own. They were not ferried by party organisers, as had happened during the Tamil meet. Todays crowd has proved that the party and the public are fully behind Amma, ADMK MLA Pollachi V. Jayaraman, one of the organisers, said.         
	For Jayalalithaa, such a show of strength had become unavoidable as she had been accused of being indifferent to the challenges thrown at the ADMK by the ruling combine.         
	She told her foot soldiers to be prepared for elections, which could happen anytime. You do not worry about the alliance. I will take care of it. You will get the alliance that you wish, she said, but did not give away more.         
	Most of the cadres sniffed in the statement a hint of an ADMK alliance with actor Vijayakanths DMDK, but a few functionaries interpreted it as a possibility of realignment with the Congress.         
	We cannot rule out such a possibility. That is why out of the 46 slogans raised by our leader only one directly attacked the Centre, said an ADMK office bearer.         
	Although the Centre was targeted in passing for freeing petrol prices from government control, the DMK was singled out for being a willing collaborator.

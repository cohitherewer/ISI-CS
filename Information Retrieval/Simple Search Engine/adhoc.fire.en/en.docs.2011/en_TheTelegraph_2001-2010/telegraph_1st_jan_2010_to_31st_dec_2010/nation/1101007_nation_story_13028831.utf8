          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 6: Six Mumbai college students accused of raping a US national studying at Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) last April were acquitted today, with the court saying the victims evidence does not inspire confidence.        
	The court gave the six  students of various city colleges  the benefit of doubt, saying the medical reports on the 24-year-old woman were negative and she could not substantiate her allegations of gangrape.        
	The victims evidence does not inspire confidence. She was not a wholly reliable witness, said S.D. Jagmalani, the additional sessions judge of the Sewri fast-track court, adding the prosecution had failed to provide corroborative evidence against the accused.         
	A lawyer for one of the youths pointed out that the call and message records of the woman immediately after the alleged incident showed no mention of rape. She had claimed she had called friends for help but the police could not produce any evidence to corroborate the claim, the lawyer, Rohini Salian, told The Telegraph.        
	Vinamra Soni, 23, Harshavardhan Yadav, 22, Jaskaran Singh Bhullar, 21, Dev Colabawala, 21, Anish Borkatki, 21, and Kundanraj Borgohain, 22, were charged under the stringent Section 376 (g) of the IPC. This is a special provision with enhanced punishment in cases where more than one person is found involved in the rape.        
	Salian said the testimony of a member of the Andheri housing society where the incident was alleged to have taken place in Borgohains flat also went against the girls claims.         
	The witness told the court that she spotted the girl chatting and roaming around with some boys on the society premises on April 12 last year (the night after the alleged rape). There was little to suggest that the demeanour of the girl was one of a rape victim.        
	Even the allegation that the youths had spiked her drinks could not be proved in lab tests, Salian said.        
	The prosecution had argued that the American, who was 23 at the time, had been raped by the six students at the flat in Andheri, several kilometres away from her TISS campus, after being given spiked drinks.         
	According to the prosecution, the girl had gone to a cafe at Deonar, near TISS, with a hostel mate, Annie Brown, on the night of April 11, and was introduced to the youths. The six were Annies friends.        
	The victim claimed that she had gone with the youths to Borgohains apartment in Andheri where the group spent the night. On the morning of April 12, she found herself lying naked in the room with the six men sleeping around her, the prosecution had said.        
	But lawyer Salian picked several holes in the case and in the turn of events that the prosecution claimed had occurred.        
	The girls first information report was lodged two days after the alleged incident. In the FIR, she says that after waking up, she felt that she might have been raped. However, all medical reports, including the DNA tests, were negative. When she was medically examined, there was no evidence to suggest gang rape.        
	Another factor was the lack of evidence in the victims telephone records. The examination of her telephone records showed that she had made and received several calls at 5am (on April 12), Salian said, adding the court had found it surprising that alleged sexual assault did not figure in the communication at all.        
	The charges were framed against the accused in January this year. In February, the girl, who had gone back to the US after the alleged incident, returned to Mumbai during the trial for cross-examination.         
	Barring Borgohain who got bail, the other five youths are lodged at the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai. They will now be released as a result of the courts orders, said Pervez Memon, the defence lawyer for another accused.

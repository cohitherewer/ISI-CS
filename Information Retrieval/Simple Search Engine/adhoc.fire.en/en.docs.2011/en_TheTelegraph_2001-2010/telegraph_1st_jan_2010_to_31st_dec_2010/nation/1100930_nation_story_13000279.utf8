The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bill to blunt outsourcing blocked
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bill to blunt outsourcing blocked
                                      Barack Obama      
	Washington, Sept. 29 (PTI): The Republicans have blocked in the Senate an anti-outsourcing bill that denies tax breaks to US companies which move jobs overseas, an outcome that has cheered Indian firms but dealt a blow to Barack Obama.        
	The legislation, Creating American Jobs and End Offshoring Act, was stalled in a 53-45 vote, seven short of the at least 60 needed to overcome the Oppositions obstruction.        
	President Obama has thrown his weight behind the bill as part of his efforts to end the tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. He has said the sops should go to firms which create employment in America.        
	India Inc, which holds an estimated 50 per cent of the global outsourcing market and had lobbied against the bill, toasted the result of the vote.         
	Indian IT bosses had earlier maintained that the bill would not affect their firms much while at the same time warning that US companies operating in other countries could be beaten by the same stick.        
	We welcome the move. The anti-offshoring bill was more of an electoral rhetoric. We had met Congressmen, government officials and American industry representatives last week and expressed our concern against the protectionist measure, Nasscom vice-president Ameet Nivsarkar said today. The Nasscom delegation included representatives of top IT firms such as Infosys, Wipro and TCS.        
	Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra said the majority in the Senate has kept in mind the larger interest of the US economy, its corporations and the global economy.         
	Assocham president Swati Piramal said the anti-outsourcing bill was against free trade and a non-tariff barrier.         
	Ganesh Natarajan, the CEO of Zensar Technologies and chairman of the CIIs national committee on IT, accepted that unemployment was a concern in the US but insisted that discouraging outsourcing was not the cure. These kind of measures will not help create jobs in the US.        
	The bill envisaged a ban on government contractors from using American taxpayers money to move jobs offshore.        
	Democratic backers, who have vowed to make the vote defeat a campaign issue in the November 2 Congressional election, claimed that Republicans had undermined their efforts to create jobs.         
	Several business groups in the US, such as the National Association of Manufacturers, were strongly opposed to the legislation and had written to senators arguing the measure would make companies less competitive and hurt job creation.        
	Republican senator Orrin Hatch slammed the Democrats for their height of irresponsibility that would put the US economy at greater risk.

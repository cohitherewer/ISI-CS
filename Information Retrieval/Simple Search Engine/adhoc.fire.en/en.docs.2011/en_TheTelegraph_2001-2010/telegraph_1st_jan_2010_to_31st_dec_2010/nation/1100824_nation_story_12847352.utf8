	Mumbai, Aug. 23: Diamonds worth Rs 6.6 crore were allegedly stolen from a stall at an international jewellery expo at the NSE grounds in Mumbais Goregaon late this evening, police said, reports our special correspondent.        
	The stall owner has claimed that the diamonds, which had been kept in a box, could not be found after a group of foreigners visited the stall. We are investigating the claim before lodging a formal complaint, additional commissioner Ramrao Pawar said.        
	The annual jewellery expo, which is being organised at a much larger scale this year, had three layers of security, including provisions for electronic surveillance.

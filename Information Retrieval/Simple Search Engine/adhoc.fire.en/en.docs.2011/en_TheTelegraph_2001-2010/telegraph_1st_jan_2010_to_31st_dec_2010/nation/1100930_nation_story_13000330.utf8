          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: Vice-chancellors of 40 central universities today agreed in principle to put in place a system to admit undergraduate students through a common aptitude test with due weightage to Class XII marks.         
	The aptitude test will assess the overall personality of the students. A decision was taken in principle that the central universities will give admission on the basis of the performance of the student in the aptitude test and the Class XII exam, HRD minister Kapil Sibal said after a conference of vice-chancellors.         
	This would make admissions smooth and more convenient for both institutes and students who now have to appear for multiple entrance tests. A committee of vice-chancellors will speak to faculty members and finalise a report in two months. It will decide what weightage should be given to the Class XII marks and the aptitude test.         
	Sibal said there would be no compulsion on any university to follow the new system.

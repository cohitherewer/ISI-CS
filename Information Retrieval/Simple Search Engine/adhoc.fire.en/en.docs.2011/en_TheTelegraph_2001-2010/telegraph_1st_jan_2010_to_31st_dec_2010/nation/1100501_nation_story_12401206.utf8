The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Meet on rebels inconclusive
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Meet on rebels inconclusive
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 30: The meeting was dubbed an ice-breaker, but at the end of the day the talks remained inconclusive.        
	MPs from Maoist-affected districts held discussions with home minister P. Chidambaram today for the first of a series of planned meetings, but of the 34 invited, only about 20 turned up.        
	One claimed he had got the invite too late.        
	Among those who were invited  apart from the ones from the 34 districts labelled worst affected  was Prabodh Panda, MP from West Midnapore.        
	The Bengal district is not on the Centres official list of Maoist-affected districts, though it has a substantial rebel presence.        
	What the Centre could have done instead is invite Pandas fellow West Midnapore MP Pulin Bihari Baske from rebel-infested Jhargram.        
	Baliram Kashyap, MP from Bastar, one of the worst hit districts in Chhattisgarh, did not attend. I was informed only at 2pm, he said. How could I go?        
	Among the affected districts, 11 are in Jharkhand, seven are in Chhattisgarh, six in Bihar, five in Orissa, two in Maharashtra, and one each in Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.         
	According to a report by the Institute of Conflict Management, provided recently to a standing committee on home affairs, 165 districts in 14 states are Maoist-affected.        
	The home ministry has told the same committee that 76 districts are affected.        
	Sources said one of the suggestions the ministry got at the meeting  held in the backdrop of the April 6 Dantewada ambush that killed 75 CRPF jawans  was that police personnel deployed in Maoist areas be taught the local dialect.        
	At least one MP said knowledge of local dialects should be imparted to security force personnel working in areas affected by Left-wing extremism, said a source.        
	When it comes to language, the Maoists have an advantage over security forces as their written and oral communication is in local dialects. The problem for security forces, sources pointed out, is they have no time to learn the local language as they keep getting shifted to other theatres.         
	Some of the MPs wanted involvement of local tribals in development schemes and suggested they be recruited in security forces.        
	The MPs spoke about their perspective on the issue and what role they could play in ensuring better monitoring of various programmes, home secretary G.K. Pillai said after the meeting.        
	Chidambaram said a plan would be worked out based on concrete suggestions from the MPs and then be presented to chief ministers of the affected states.         
	The discussions remained inconclusive and another meeting would be held in the second half of May so that more MPs can take part, a home ministry release said.

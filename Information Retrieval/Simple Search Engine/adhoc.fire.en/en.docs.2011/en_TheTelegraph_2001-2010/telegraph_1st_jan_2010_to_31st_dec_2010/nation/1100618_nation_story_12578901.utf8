	Jaipur, June 17: Ram Jethmalani was today elected to the Rajya Sabha as a BJP candidate from Rajasthan, belying fears he wouldnt be able to sail through as he was an outsider handpicked by Narendra Modi.          Union commerce minister, the Congresss Anand Sharma, also got elected to the upper House from the desert state. The BJP had herded all its MLAs into a resort near Jaipur and kept them there over the past few days over fears of cross-voting that could harm Jethmalani. Leaders elected from other states included Union minister Oscar Fernandes, Ram Vilas Paswan, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Vijay Mallya and Venkaiah Naidu.

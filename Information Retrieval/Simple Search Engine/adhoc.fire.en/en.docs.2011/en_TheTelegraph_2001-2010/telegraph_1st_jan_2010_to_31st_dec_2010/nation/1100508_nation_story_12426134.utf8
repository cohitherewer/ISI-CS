The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | School fund U-turn for PM pledge
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      School fund U-turn for PM pledge
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, May 7: The human resource development ministry has accepted a controversial Planning Commission financial model it had earlier opposed for the Centres largest-ever public-private partnership exercise in setting up schools, the turnaround fuelled by a rush to implement the project.        
	The ministry plans to seek a whopping Rs 87,000 crore from the finance ministry over the next decade to implement the Prime Ministers promise of 2500 public-private partnership (PPP) model schools, top government officials told The Telegraph.         
	The proposed funding is over 40 times larger than this years budgetary allocation for the government-run Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan and may spark concerns, especially from those critical of the project.         
	The ministry plans to outline its blueprint for the schools in a note to the expenditure finance committee (EFC), which must accept the proposal before it can be taken to the cabinet. The ministry finalised its blueprint after over two years of intense and often heated debate with the Planning Commission over how the government and the private partner should share investment costs and responsibilities.        
	Planning Commission adviser Gajendra Haldea had proposed that the private partner finance the capital expenditure (such as construction costs), while the government would fund the projects operational expenses. But the ministry argued that this financial model would prove too costly for the exchequer.        
	In its proposal to counter the Planning Commission suggestions, the ministry argued that the Centre should invest in the initial capital expenditure  such as building the infrastructure. Private partners and state governments could share the burden of operational expenditure, the ministry had said in its proposal.         
	But in its draft note to the EFC, the ministry has accepted the model proposed by the commission earlier. The private partner will make the capital investment and run the school, with the government compensating it for tutoring 1,000 economically weak students per school. The private partner can admit at least another 1,000 students who can be charged fees.         
	However, the note has introduced some changes to the Planning Commission proposal and the ministry is unlikely to formally concede that it has broadly accepted the commissions financial model.         
	The Planning Commission, for instance, wanted the project to include PPP model schools in urban slum areas, but the ministry has decided that the schools must be exclusively for rural areas.         
	But the decision to accept the commissions proposal that the government invest in the recurring expenditure on the students as opposed to capital costs represents a sharp turnaround. It is learnt that a key reason for the change of stand is the governments desperation to kick off a project first announced by the Prime Minister from the ramparts of the Red Fort during his Independence Day speech in 2007.        
	The project is a part of the current Eleventh Five Year Plan, which ends in 2012. Failure to implement the project would prove embarrassing for the government, especially as it was promised by the Prime Minister.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav today skipped the meeting Speaker Meira Kumar had called to discuss legislators unruly behaviour in Parliament, robbing it of much of its sting.        
	Leaders across the political spectrum, including Sonia Gandhi, L.K. Advani, the CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, voiced concern at the routine disruptions and agreed that maintaining parliamentary decorum was a collective responsibility.        
	But the absence of the Yadav duo, behind most of the sound and fury in the monsoon session, diluted the point of the meeting. Lalu Prasad was away from Delhi and none from his RJD showed up. Mulayam did not attend but Shailendra Kumar from his Samajwadi Party was present.        
	Leaders from various parties, including the BJPs Sushma Swaraj, expressed regret that a mock House session had been held in the Lok Sabha last Friday. JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav agreed that disruptions were posing a threat to Parliaments functioning. Others present included the CPMs Basudeb Acharya, Trinamuls Sudip Bandopadhyay, the Telugu Desams Nageshwar Rao and parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal.        
	Sources said Speaker Kumar had come prepared with a statement that said: The trend of disrupting the proceedings instead of debating issues is fraught with the danger of rendering Parliament irrelevant. She said those who frequently disrupted the House constituted only 4 per cent of the total strength of the Lok Sabha.        
	The Speaker, encouraged by the response of those who attended, is planning a bigger meeting after the session ends.

	New Delhi, Feb. 26: When finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said toy balloons were a source of joy to millions of children and exempted them from excise duty, he may not have anticipated that seasoned politicians in the Opposition ranks would be the first beneficiary of his benevolence.         
	Wasting little time, they ran out of the Lok Sabha to float a toy balloon of unity against the petrol price increase, in what was probably the first time the Opposition had walked out of a budget presentation.        
	Price rise is a sensitive issue that cuts across barriers. However, the Congress is hoping that it will be able to embarrass the Opposition during election campaigns by making use of the rare photograph of Sushma Swaraj, Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Sharad Yadav, Basudeb Acharya and Gurudas Dasgupta joining hands in solidarity against the budget.        
	The Congress feels the Opposition balloon needs no exertion to deflate: both the Left and the RJD would hate to be seen in the BJPs company at a time Bengal and Bihar are heading towards polls. A dip in the minority vote is bound to sink both.        
	Congress leaders, aware of the intractable contradictions among these parties, said they had the numbers to sail through any immediate crisis in the Lok Sabha  like cut motions on budgetary proposals being planned by these parties  and the long-term political fallout of this contrived unity was not a worry at all.        
	We hope they stay this way  hand in hand  for much longer, Congress spokesperson Shakil Ahmed said, asked about the Left-RJD-BJP trinity.         
	These people have paid a heavy price for joining hands with the BJP in the past. They are on the verge of repeating the same blunder. If the CPM, RJD and the Samajwadi Party plan to give strength to communal forces once again, we congratulate them, Ahmed told The Telegraph.        
	 The Opposition parties believe that any hike in prices of petroleum products will be unequivocally rejected by the people. Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj said increase in the prices of petrol and diesel would have a cascading effect and hit the common man hard.        
	BJP leader and former finance minister Yashwant Sinha later said his party would definitely bring a cut motion to censure the government on its anti-people policies.        
	Addressing an impromptu news conference along with other Opposition veterans, Samajwadi leader Mulayam appealed to people to support them as they had done during the Emergency.        
	CPM leader Basudeb Acharya described the walkout as unprecedented. We cannot be a mute spectator. We will continue the agitation until the government withdraws the proposal, he said.         
	RJD boss Lalu Prasad said the joint struggle would continue. The entire Opposition is together, Lalu Prasad thundered, as the BJPs Sushma and Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav smiled sheepishly.         
	A government which cannot check price is incompetent and an incompetent government has to be changed, Lalu Prasad added.        
	Observers said it would be interesting to see Lalu Prasad and Bihars Dal (U) chief minister Nitish Kumar fighting together for the same cause against the Congress, which is dying to occupy the space of the main Opposition in the state.        
	Mamata Banerjee, too, would be chuckling to herself to find the CPM nestled in the BJPs lap.         
	The BJP, in a statement later, said the finance minister, instead of concentrating on priority areas like agriculture, rural development, health and education, had spread his resources too thinly over a large number of sectors.        
	The Congress hailed the budget, with the Prime Minister patting Mukherjee for a job well done.

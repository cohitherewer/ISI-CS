          SANJAY MANDAL                                            
	Rajabandh (West Midnapore), May 29: Heaps of bodies tumbled out today when rescuers managed to cut open coach S6 and hoist up S5, some crushed inside the coaches and some flattened and buried five feet into the ground under the wheels of the goods trains engine.        
	At the end of the day, after the rescuers had completed one of the toughest missions of their careers, the toll stood at 145 dead and 250 injured. But railway and rescue officials said the toll could rise even further.        
	More bodies may be embedded in the ground. Some have got flattened under the weight of the coaches and the engines, said Sukhdev Raj, commandant of the second battalion of the BSFs National Disaster Resistance Force.        
	Since four in the morning yesterday, the rescue team had been toiling to bring survivors and bodies out, mainly from the S3, S4, S5 and S6 coaches of the Jnaneswari Express that had been hit by the twin engines of the goods train.        
	While the rescuers succeeded in clearing S3 and S4 yesterday, the other two coaches threw up a bigger challenge. The goods trains engines had telescoped into S5 and S6, making the job of separating locomotive from coach a difficult one.        
	With anxious relatives of the dead and the missing gathering at the site, the rescuers task became that much more difficult.        
	Initially, the rescue team used gas cutters to try and slice through the coaches but gave it up at night, their efforts having produced hardly any impact on the twisted mountain of steel.        
	This morning, two powerful cranes, capable of lifting 140 tonnes, were deployed to lift the coaches. At first, that too proved difficult. For, while the coaches weighed 40 tonnes each, the engines with which they had got entangled weighed another 120 tonnes, taking the total weight of the mangled mass to 160 tonnes, 20 tonnes above the cranes capacity.        
	Eventually, hydraulic cutters were used to cut open S6 and retrieve some bodies, which had started rotting in the heat.         
	Late this evening, the remaining half of the coach was also cleared.        
	Earlier, as the rescuers, using their two cranes, wrenched S5 apart from the first engine of the goods train and lifted it to the side of the tracks, anxious relatives rushed to the spot to try and identify the dead.        
	They found 20 bodies buried in the ground, crushed under the engine.        
	Govind Agarwal, a trader from Calcutta, burst into tears on seeing the lifeless body of his college-going son Himangshu.        
	But my wife Arati is still missing, Agarwal sobbed. Arati and Himangshu were going to Bilaspur to attend a relatives wedding.        
	The bodies were all taken to Midnapore where they will be handed over to the families after post-mortem and identification.        
	By tonight, all the coaches and engines had been cleared from the tracks. The goods trains second engine, which had rammed into S6, was lifted and removed around 6.40pm.        
	The next step will be to fix the overheard wires and restore the 300m stretch of damaged tracks, which the officials expect will be done by tomorrow.

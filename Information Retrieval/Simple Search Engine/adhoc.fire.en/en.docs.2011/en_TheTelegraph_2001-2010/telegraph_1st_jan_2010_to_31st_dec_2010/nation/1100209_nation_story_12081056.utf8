          NALIN VERMA                          Ram Vilas Paswan in Patna on Monday. (Deepak Kumar)                                  
	Patna, Feb. 8: Lok Janshakti Party president Ram Vilas Paswan today said there would be no compromise with the Congress at the cost of the RJD-LJP alliance, which was set to contest the Assembly elections in complete partnership.        
	Scotching speculations that the states tallest Dalit leader might respond to the resurgent Congresss search for a mass stalwart in the absence of popular faces in its state unit, Paswan ruled out the possibility of entering into any deal, which did not involve the RJD.        
	Unlike Lalu Prasad, who has turned acerbic on the Nehru-Gandhi family, Paswan, however, said: We have nothing against Sonia Gandhi and her party. I tried my best to include the Congress in the alliance with the LJP and RJD.        
	About the RJD bosss recent outburst against Rahul Gandhi, he said: Lalu was well within his rights to speak on the Congress in such a manner for he had all along supported Sonia. He can speak if he feels hurt.        
	On the wish of a section of the Congress that he should merge his LJP with the Congress and become the main torchbearer of the party in Bihar, Paswan said: The LJP is my vision with which lakhs of Dalits across the country identify themselves. I can never merge the LJP with any outfit for my personal gains.        
	The LJP chief was confident that the RLD-LJP combination would dislodge the Nitish Kumar dispensation in the polls. You have seen the results of the September by-election on 18 seats spread across the north and south of the Ganga. We won nine of the 18 seats and Nitishs JD(U) was reduced to four.        
	Explaining the reason for the resurgence of the RJD-LJP, Paswan clarified: Nitishs NDA won all the by-elections from 2005 till September 2009 because LJP and RJD fought separately. The division of votes gave victory to the NDA.        
	With the RJD and LJP deciding to contest together, the writing was quite clear on the wall. It will be hard for the NDA to win more than 50 seats, he predicted.        
	He reiterated that the RJD and LJP were primarily embattled in the war for dislodging the NDA from power. The Congress is not our main rival, he stressed.               
	The fight between the RJD-LJP and the Congress is only for seats we have to share among ourselves. The Congress-LJP and RJD alliance broke only on the issue of sharing seats. There is no ideological difference among us.        
	Paswan accused that Nitish Kumar has divided the Bihars society. For instance he has divided the dalits coining an illegal word of Mahadalit in which he has incorporated all the dalits except the Paswans. You can imagine the hurt feeling of the equally poor section which is not the beneficiary of his schemes. Moreover, he has hardly done anything good for the sections whom he has dubbed as Mahadalits, he remarked.        
	The LJP chief also said that Nitish Kumar has also humiliated the upper castes by sidelining their leaders like Prabhunath Singh, Digvijay Singh and Lallan Singh etc. He has hardly been left with the base votes of any caste group.

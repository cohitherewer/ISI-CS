The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hint of more mining vetoes 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hint of more mining vetoes 
          JAYANTA BASU                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 1: The veto on Vedantas bauxite-mining project in Orissa is not a one-off thing and industries violating environmental norms might face similar action soon, Jairam Ramesh has said.        
	In an interview with The Telegraph, the forest and environment minister denied any political pressure behind his decision last week, although his plan of action seems in line with the Congresss latest tribal policy.        
	The Congress has decided to stand up for the cause of tribals and win them over politically, and use the same strategy to develop a disconnect between them and the Maoists. By extension, this would neutralise the Maoists claim that tribals were being exploited and their land forcibly taken over.        
	There is no political or other pressure on the Vedanta issue. We have rejected the bauxite-mining clearances in the Niyamgiri hills because they violated stipulated norms, Ramesh said.        
	It (denial of permission to Vedanta) is not a one-off thing. You will find that many industries not conforming to environmental and forest norms will soon face similar strictures.        
	The minister said so far strong action had seldom been taken against non-conforming industries. Previously, the department used to clear almost all projects received by it and it almost acted like a courier. Now we are extremely stringent with the application of laws before giving clearances.        
	Sources said despite Ramesh claiming otherwise, the political ploy in his contemplating action against other non-conforming projects in tribal-dominated areas could not be ignored. Some of these are already under the Supreme Court scanner.        
	This also falls in line with Rahul Gandhi calling himself a sipahi (soldier) of the tribals at a rally in Orissas Kalahandi barely 48 hours after the veto on Vedanta.        
	Youve been fighting for your rights peacefully. Your voice has reached New Delhi. Youve saved your land, mountain and religion (tribal groups revere their forest and hill as deities). I extended help in whichever way I could as your sipahi in Delhi, he said.        
	Sources said the Congresss tribal policy was clearly evident in Rahuls words. If his reference to fighting for rights peacefully pointed to the success of non-violent hence non-Maoist means of protest, the use of sipahi was aimed at winning over the tribals politically. And Ramesh, known to be close to the Gandhi clan, did not seem averse to the strategy, the sources added.        
	Environment activists have appreciated the move to revoke clearance to Vedanta. We support the environment ministrys directive on Vedanta as it was clearly violating the tribal and forest right acts, said Sunita Narain of the Centre for Science and Environment.        
	Another tribal activist added: I dont mind if there is a political angle to the denial of environmental permission to Vedanta. The bottomline is, perhaps for the first time, the government has accepted tribal peoples right on the land where they live.        
	Ramesh is reported to have withdrawn Vedantas clearance on the basis of the recommendations of a committee headed by National Advisory Council member N.C. Saxena and a forest advisory committee. Both had concluded that Vedanta violated three central laws: the Forest Rights Act, the Forest Conservation Act and the Environment Protection Act.

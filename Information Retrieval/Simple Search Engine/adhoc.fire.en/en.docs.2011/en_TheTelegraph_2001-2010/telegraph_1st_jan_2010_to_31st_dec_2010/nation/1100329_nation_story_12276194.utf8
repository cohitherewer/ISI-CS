                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Doc fined Rs 2 lakh for vision loss
                            
	New Delhi, March 28 (PTI): The National Consumer Commission has told an eye surgeon to pay Rs 2 lakh to the family of a patient who lost his vision after an alleged botched laser therapy, upholding a state forums order.        
	Dr Niraj Awasthi, who had appealed against the order, has been asked to cough up another Rs 10,000 for not exercising reasonable care during treatment. The claimant had lost vision for the wrong or negligence committed by the treating doctor and now he is no more, leaving his legal heirs to mourn his death, the commission said.        
	It rejected the doctors plea that the compensation claim was not justified as the patient, Jagdish Bharati, had died later while the case was on.         
	The commission said the patient had approached the doctor not with high expectations but simply for improvement in his vision, and clarified the instances in which the doctors were held liable for negligence.        
	A doctor may be held liable for negligence on one of two findings that either he/she was not possessed of requisite skill which he professed to have possessed or one did not exercise with reasonable competence in a given case.        
	The doctor conducted laser therapy on both eyes of the patient following which he gradually began losing vision.

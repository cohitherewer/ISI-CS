          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 30: The 2011 census will get off the ground on Thursday from Bengal and some other states, the count billed the largest such attempt in the history of mankind.        
	The census will not enumerate castes other than Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, the government announced today, confirming a report in The Telegraph on March 5.        
	The census will start from Bengal, Assam, Goa, Meghalaya, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and parts of Delhi. It is the largest census attempted in the history of humankind. It will cover 1.2 billion residents living in all 28 states and seven Union territories. A total of 25 lakh enumerators will collect data in two phases, home secretary G.K. Pillai said.        
	China has more people than India. But by terming the Indian exercise the largest ever, Pillai probably meant the comprehensive and detailed nature of the census.        
	The census will cover every usual resident of India and not just citizens of India. The government has defined a usual resident as an individual who has stayed at a place for at least six months.        
	For the first time, the count will also compile a national population register with data on each resident.         
	Pillai cited practical problems behind not including OBCs. There will be no proof of a persons claim of belonging to a particular caste. We may get a very distorted version. We want to establish a casteless society, he said.        
	Sources said the real reason behind governments refusal to collect caste data was the fear that it would open a Pandoras box. The Centre had said Bengal was the only state to have demanded a caste-based census.

  - Congress believes YSR son has other plans and time to persuade him is over        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Kiran Reddy after meeting home minister   P Chidambaram in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)                                
	New Delhi, Nov. 27: The Congress high command has made up its mind to take action against Jaganmohan Reddy for his relentless defiance and sources said a showcause notice against the Andhra Pradesh MP could soon be on its way.        
	Top party leaders believe Jagan, too, has decided to quit the Congress, which was evident from his television channels tirade against both Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.         
	Asked if the party would try to persuade Jagan to give up his rebellion, a senior leader said that phase appears to be over.        
	Jagan has stretched his defiance too far and now he is challenging the high command to throw him out. His actions show he has alternative plans. Now the party has to analyse the damage he is causing and act before it is too late, the leader added.         
	Party insiders said the AICC disciplinary action committee had studied Jagans activities over the past few months and was mulling punitive action.        
	An indication of what the high command was thinking came from Union minister S. Jaipal Reddy, a conservative politician who had all these months avoided making any comments either on the Telangana controversy or Jagans defiance.

	Jaipal said Jagan was violating party discipline and his channel Sakshi, which telecast programmes attacking Sonia, Manmohan Singh and Rahul, was being misused to weaken the party.        
	Everybody knows that the channel is owned by him and the channel is run for his own politics apparently. The channel is being misused to weaken the party. It is very undesirable, he said.         
	Sources said Jaipals decision to speak up was an indication that Jagans time was up.        
	Jaipal, who too is from Andhra, said that while Jagans father, the late Y.S.R. Reddy, was a tremendously loyal Congressman, his son, otherwise dynamic, seems to be confused.        
	Responding to queries about the possibility of disciplinary action against the young MP, Jaipal said: Naturally, the decision has to be taken at the national level of the party.        
	The comments came on a day the new Andhra Pradesh chief minister, Kiran Reddy, was in the capital, meeting Manmohan Singh, Sonia and other senior party leaders.        
	Although they were courtesy calls, sources said Jagan figured prominently in the discussions Reddy had with his party bosses.         
	The sources said the timing of the change of guard in the state was linked to Jagans activities as the high command wanted to assess the situation before deciding to punish the rebel.         
	Although the appointment of a Reddy helped the Congress lure away most of Jagans sympathisers, there are still a good few MLAs loyal to him. But the partys assessment is that the government would survive even if Jagan tries to split the party.        
	Jagans uncle Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy today said his nephew would meet Sonia and express regret over the controversial programmes on his channel.        
	Vivekananda Reddy said every Congress worker had been hurt by the programmes but sought to suggest that Jagan may not have been aware of the contents of the shows before they went on air. He also said the editors of the channel should be advised against such telecasts.

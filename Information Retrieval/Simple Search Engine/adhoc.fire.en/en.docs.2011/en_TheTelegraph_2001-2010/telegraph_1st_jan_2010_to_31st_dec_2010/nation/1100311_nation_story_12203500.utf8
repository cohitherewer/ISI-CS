The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | For Brinda, time to take a hard look at party
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      For Brinda, time to take a hard look at party
          BARUN GHOSH                                            
	Calcutta, March 10: After the euphoria over the womens bill, it may be time for Brinda Karat to ensure that charity begins at home. Woefully under-represented in their own party committees, the CPMs women leaders now want a larger share of the partys plum posts.         
	Its good that the womens reservation bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha. Now there will be 33 per cent reservation for women in the Lok Sabha and later in state Assemblies, provided the bill is passed in the lower House. But in different strata of our own organisation, representation of women is not quite up to the mark. There should be a larger participation of our women members in the higher strata of the organisation, said Shymali Gupta.        
	Gupta, who was inducted into the Bengal CPM secretariat, the highest decision-making body at the state level, only in January this year, today recounted how Brinda had kicked off a storm in the organisation during the party congress in 1998 in Calcutta by voicing her protest against the low representation of women members in the central committee.         
	I still remember how Brinda had vented her ire in the 1998 party congress, demanding a larger representation of women members in the central committee, Gupta said, adding that she was the first woman to become a member in the key decision-making body at the state level.         
	I cannot remember any other woman rising to become a member of the state secretariat, she said. Gupta was inducted as a party member in 1962 but was elevated to be a state committee member only in 1985. Going by the CPMs organisational set-up, representation of women members is low. Starting with the CPMs central committee, the highest decision-making body, to its 19 district committees across Bengal, the participation of women is almost negligible.         
	In the 85-member central committee, only 13 are women, of which two are from Bengal. Other than Gupta, Banani Biswas is the member in the central committee.        
	In the 16-member politburo, Brinda, wife of CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, happens to be the lone member and that, too, for the first time. Contacted, Brinda refused to comment. Sudha Sundaram, central committee member and the president of the All India Democratic Womens Association, said: We do believe the leadership will rise to the occasion after the entry of women into the corridors of power.        
	In the 84-member Bengal state committee of the CPM, only eight are women. In the 18-member state secretariat, Gupta is the lone woman representative.        
	There is no denying that representation of women members in our different strata of the organisation is abysmally low. We have been seeking more women members since they are as organisationally active as men, said Biswas.        
	CPM politburo member and Tripura chief minister Manik Sarkar admitted that there was low representation of women in the organisation. But we cannot induct members into the organisation according to our will. One has to go through a process before becoming a member, he added.         
	CPM central committee member and Citu all-India vice-president Basudeb Acharya, however, felt that more women members should be accommodated in the organisation.        
	Three things organisational capability, ideological stand and political maturity  are considered before inducting somebody into key posts. Women are more and more fulfilling the requirements these days and that is why we need to be liberal in inducting them, he said.        
	Citu, he said, has decided to bring in 25 per cent women delegates for its upcoming all-India conference in Chandigarh.

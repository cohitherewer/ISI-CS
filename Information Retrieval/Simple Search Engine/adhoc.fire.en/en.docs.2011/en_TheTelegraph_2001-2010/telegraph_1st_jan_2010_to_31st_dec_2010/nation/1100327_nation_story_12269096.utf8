                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Census peep from laptop to latrine
          ARCHIS MOHAN                               
	New Delhi, March 26: Starting April 1, a census enumerator will be at your doorstep to ask 49 questions as part of Census 2011.        
	The queries will range from your name and the kind of roof you have over your head to whether you use banking services.        
	The home ministry says the list of questions will be much more sensitive and in tune with the 21st century than the one used for the previous census in 2001.        
	For the first time, census officials will carry two questionnaires. The first will relate to the usual house-listing and housing census and consist of 35 questions; and the second, new questionnaire will have 14 questions relating to basic personal details such as name and sex. The second questionnaire will be used also to launch a National Population Register, a comprehensive identity database.        
	The first phase of the census exercise, with these two questionnaires, starts on April 1 in Bengal, Assam and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The second phase, with a third questionnaire, on population enumeration, will be carried out in February 2011. This will take down more detailed personal data such as religion and language.        
	The house-listing questionnaire has been amended, said minister of state for home Ajay Maken.        
	So, for the first time, households will be asked whether they own a computer or a laptop and if they are Internet-enabled. A question to find telephone density has been amended to include ownership of mobile phones too.        
	The questionnaire will also be more sensitive. A question asked during Census 2001, on the number of married couples having independent room to sleep, has been dropped after feedback from enumerators that many respondents felt offended and took the question as an invasion of their privacy.        
	This time, questions 17 and 18 will aim to find out  separately  the number of dwelling rooms exclusively in possession of this household and the number of married couple(s) living in this household.        
	There will also be a more detailed question on whether the houses latrine is within the premises and, if not, whether the family uses a public latrine or defaecates in the open.        
	The other questions include ones relating to the main source of water and lighting for the household; whether the family owns a TV, radio, bicycle, two-wheeler or four-wheeler; ownership status of the house, availability of kitchen and the fuel used for cooking.        
	The National Population Register will also have bio-metric identification data including facial characteristics, fingerprints and probably pictures of the iris of each Indian.

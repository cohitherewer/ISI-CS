The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Snip for being late to school
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Snip for being late to school
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, June 15: A case has been registered against the principal of a Srinagar school for punishing students by cutting their hair.         
	Police said a case has been filed against the management of the missionary school after some students lodged a complaint against Burn Halls principal, Jey Kumar.         
	The students said about 50 boys had been subjected to the punishment.         
	We are investigating the case. Five students approached us with a complaint that their hair was chopped. We will take action against the school only after the investigations are complete and their allegations are found true, Aadil Rashid, station house officer of the area police station, said. Kumar has not been arrested.        
	The officer said the police would question the school management and the students.         
	The incident comes in the middle of an uproar surrounding the La Martiniere for Boys, Calcutta, over the suicide of a boy who was caned in school.        
	One of the Srinagar school officials said the teachers got the hair of some of their students cut, a few days back, as they were late for assembly. The official, however, mentioned that the boys who had long hair were given a hair cut.        
	It appears morning assembly is not important for them (students) and we wanted to enforce discipline. They were kept out of school for some time and later we gave a cut to boys who had long hair, an official said.         
	One of the students, who had complained to the police, said: Some of us mustered the courage and approached the police but now the school management is intimidating us. We also boycotted the classes for some days.         
	He said one of the boys was injured after he resisted. Some of us were beaten by the school management for resisting, a student said.         
	We will not compromise on discipline and we want to convey to the students that they have to take their education seriously, a school official said.        
	We are approaching the civil society to help us in this endeavour. They (the students) have set a wrong precedent and we fear more students will resort to such actions, one of the officials said.

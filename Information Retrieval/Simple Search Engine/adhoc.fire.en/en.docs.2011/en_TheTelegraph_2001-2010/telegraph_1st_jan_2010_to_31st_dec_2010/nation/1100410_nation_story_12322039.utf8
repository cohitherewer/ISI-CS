The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bomb panic in Vadodara
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bomb panic in Vadodara
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ahmedabad, April 9: Three crude bombs went off in an under-construction building in Vadodara today, the pre-dawn scare unfolding in a predominantly middle-class Hindu locality that has never seen communal trouble.        
	There were no casualties in the 3.30am blasts, which occurred in the citys Manjalpur area, in an under-construction building whose owner is a stenographer of a judge in Anand, among the Gujarat towns worst hit during the 2002 riots.        
	The bomb scare is being viewed seriously also because Gujarat has been rocked by serial blasts before, such as the Ahmedabad explosions of July 26, 2008, in which more than 40 people died.        
	Jitendra Limbachiya, the buildings owner who was sleeping on the ground floor that was ready, was quizzed, but no clues emerged. We have no idea, no clue so far, so we cannot say anything, said Vadodara joint police commissioner G.S. Malik.        
	 What has puzzled the police is that there were three blasts but the intention of the blasts did not seem to be to kill people. We are still not clear about the motive, Malik added.        
	The blasts jolted the residents out of sleep, with many rushing to the building that was later sealed by the police, the fire brigade and experts from the local Forensic Science Laboratory for investigations.        
	Investigating officer Ram Gadhia said two crude bombs went off on the first floor and the third one exploded on the second floor within a span of 10 minutes.         
	Another crude bomb found at the site was taken out and defused.        
	Police sources said gunpowder was used in the pipe bombs, which had been attached to a timer device. There was no major damage  other than minor cracks in the walls and floors  to the building, Samurdhi Tenement.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rahul takes train to drive home message 
  - Gandhi scion gives chopper ride a miss           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               Rahul Gandhi at Ghatkopar station in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)      
	Mumbai, Feb. 5: Rahul Gandhi today stole the thunder from the Thackerays on their home turf, making a symbolic journey on a local train to send a message that he was willing to challenge the politics of identity.        
	Rahuls visit came 48 hours after Uddhav Thackeray had warned him not to mess with the Shiv Senas power in Mumbai. Uddhav had reminded the young Gandhi how the aggressive protests by the Sainiks had forced his grandfather, former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, to travel in a closed car in Mumbai at the peak of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement in the Sixties.        
	As if to prove a point, Rahul kept the helicopter that brought him to Mumbai waiting and boarded a second-class compartment of a local train to reach Ghatkopar, the venue of his second meeting during his three-and-a-half-hour stop in Mumbai.         
	Rahul drove to Andheri station from Vile Parle, stopped at a Bank of India ATM to withdraw cash, purchased train tickets for his entire entourage with that money and changed two trains to reach Ghatkopar, throwing the large security apparatus including the SPG, the Mumbai police and the Government Railway Police, into a tizzy.        
	According to his original itinerary, the 38-year-old Nehru-Gandhi scion was set to travel to Bhaidas Hall in Vile Parle to meet college students. He was then expected to travel by helicopter to Vikroli, a five-minute drive from Ghatkopar where he had his second engagement with slum youths in a Dalit pocket.        
	Rahul reached Mumbai at 11.15am and spent about 50 minutes with college students, then he drove to Andheri station instead of the Juhu helipad. Apart from a few uniformed SPG guards, Mumbai police commissioner D. Sivanandhan, joint commissioner Rakesh Maria and newly appointed Youth Congress president Rajeev Satav accompanied him on the train.        
	Like ordinary commuters, Rahul waited on platform number five at Andheri and boarded a crowded second-class compartment of the 1.03pm Churchgate fast train to Dadar, one of the most crowded stations in Mumbai.         
	At Dadar, he took a footbridge to cross over from Western Railway to Central Railway, and travelled in a first-class compartment to Ghatkopar, which would have cost Rs 52 per ticket. He mingled with pleasantly surprised commuters.         
	Ashok D, 62, seated next to Rahul, said: I couldnt believe my eyes that Rahulji was travelling in a train. I told him that we in Mumbai are well aware about Shiv Senas political stunts. He took my visiting card and promised to stay in touch on email.         
	Rahul did not forget to deliver the key message of his visit and snub the politics of the Sena and the MNS.         
	If you want to make a change, join politics and the Congress party. Some people are trying to divert your attention from real issues, but you have to stay focused, he told college students at Bhaidas Hall.         
	The Sena refused to accept it had lost the face-off with Rahul. Our protest was a success, Uddhav said at a news conference after Rahul had left for Pondicherry.         
	Referring to his stop at an ATM, he said: Mumbai has been treated like an ATM by Delhi. One can take away Mumbais money anytime to Delhi. This is the mentality we are opposing.         
	Uddhav ridiculed the unprecedented security offered to Rahul and also took potshots at chief minister Ashok Chavan.         
	The chief minister was reduced to playing a policeman for two hours and the mini-ster of state for home was looking after Rahuls shoes, he said.         
	Chavan was kept waiting at Ghatkopar while Rahul travelled by train and junior home minister Ramesh Bagwe was photographed while picking up Rahuls shoes.

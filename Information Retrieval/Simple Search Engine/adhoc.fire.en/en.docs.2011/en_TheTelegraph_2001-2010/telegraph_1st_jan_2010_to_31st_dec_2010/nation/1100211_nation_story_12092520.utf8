The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Feel more welcome with chip in passport
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Feel more welcome with chip in passport
          K.P. NAYAR                          An Indian passport                                  
	Washington, Feb. 7: Indians arriving at airports around the world may find themselves a little more welcome when high-tech passports are issued to them as part of reforms initiated by external affairs minister S.M. Krishna.        
	The high-tech passports, with an electronic chip inlaid on their front cover, are expected to be issued to the public in about 18 months. They will drastically alter the way information about Indian passport-holders is stored and disseminated for travel purposes.        
	The chip at the bottom of the front cover can be felt as an embossment and will contain personal particulars of the holder. When the cover is swiped at immigration counters at leading airports in the world, particulars of the traveller will light up on the computer screens of officers processing the arrival or departure of passengers.        
	At many airports around the world, immigration officers now suppress a groan at the sight of Indian passports. Officers have to manually enter details of Indians before they can be allowed into countries they are visiting.        
	After the September 11 terrorist attacks on the US, the particulars required to be entered into immigration systems have grown progressively bigger and vary from country to country. Entering details from Indian passports can, therefore, be cumbersome and time-consuming for officers handling passengers at busy, high-volume airports.        
	Some countries like the US have overcome this problem of dealing with arriving Indians by having machine-readable visas. As a result, an Indian passport-holder arriving in, say, New York or Chicago can be cleared quickly by swiping the US visa, which has all the required information about the visitor.        
	But an arriving Indian in Moscow, Jakarta, Manila or many other cities will have to be manually processed, often irritating the passport-holder, the immigration officer and other passengers waiting in a queue to be let in after often long trans-continental flights.        
	Similarly, passport details of arriving Indians are now manually entered at Delhi, Mumbai or Chennai, for instance, by immigration officers, who often can only type on their keyboards with one finger of each hand. Missing one or two letters in a full name can lead to delays such as finding the wrongly input name on an Indian government blacklist, which is growing with each terrorist threat.        
	The chip on the new passports will eliminate such problems and clear Indian passengers more quickly at airports in their home cities.        
	The high-tech passports will also eliminate a chronic problem with Indian passports which often leads to ill-treatment of Indians travelling to Gulf airports like Dubai or Jeddah: a high incidence of fake or tampered travel documents, which prompt immigration officers there to look at every Indian passport with suspicion.        
	The chip in the passports to be issued under the reforms are tamper-proof, according to officials in the ministry of external affairs (MEA), who have gone to great lengths with software experts to test the reliability of the proposed system.         
	They said the moment the chip was exposed or came into contact with air, all the data in it would disappear and no new data could be entered.        
	The first of the chip-laden passports that went through rigorous tests was recently issued to Krishna. Since then, several Union ministers and a host of MPs have also been given the new passports. However, until the new system is entirely in place and on stream at passport offices across India, they cannot use the chip and can only carry the new passports as ornaments and a sign of better things to come.        
	Officials said they were allowing for 18 months for the new system to go on stream to ensure that there were no glitches, which could cause huge inconvenience to Indian travellers when they were abroad.        
	The new system will meet the specifications set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which has incrementally called for bio-metric passports to be issued by all countries following the September 11, 2001 attacks.        
	A recent ICAO conference set a deadline of April 2010, after which those with hand-written passports cannot travel at all, but it is expected that an extension will be given in this deadline since many countries are not yet ready to issue high-tech passports.        
	In Indias case, 37 passport offices and 22 Indian diplomatic missions and posts abroad already issue machine-readable passports, but Krishna is cracking the whip on speeding up the change to make it universal in the MEAs system.        
	After a report found grave shortcomings in the passport system, Krishna has ordered the setting up of a centralised decision support network in the MEA to evaluate the performance of individual passport offices in the country.        
	As part of making the passport process more transparent, he has also ordered the setting up of a national call centre for the public to make enquiries about the status of their applications. The call centres will handle enquiries in 18 languages, MEA officials said.

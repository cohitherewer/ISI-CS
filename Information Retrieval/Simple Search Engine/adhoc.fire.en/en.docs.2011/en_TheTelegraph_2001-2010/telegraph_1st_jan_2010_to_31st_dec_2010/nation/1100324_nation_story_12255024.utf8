The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Suitor takes Net revenge 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Suitor takes Net revenge 
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, March 23: A techie with a US multinational allegedly morphed a girls photo and put her details on porn sites after being spurned as a suitor, prompting a police advisory against putting such information on social networking sites.        
	The arrest of software engineer Shivshankar Madishetty, 29, on Friday from a flat in Hyderabads upscale Banjara Hills is being seen by the police as one of the growing cases of abuse of technology by spurned grooms, many working for high-paying IT firms.        
	What prompted the advisory was the revelation that Madishetty  he created a bogus profile but gave her fathers genuine mobile numbers  had gathered detailed information on the girl from Facebook and Orkut.        
	Point of caution: Avoid creating profiles with identities i.e., complete names, mobile numbers, photographs on social networking websites like www.orkut.com , www.facebook.com as there are chances such information will be misused, said an advisory from the cyber police cell of Hyderabad police, which arrested Madishetty. The warning is meant for all youngsters, particularly girls whose profiles are more at risk of being misused.        
	P. Sumathi, superintendent of police in the cyber crimes wing, says there has been a spurt in the cases of abuse of technology for personal vendetta, a large number of them by spurned techie grooms in the south.        
	I only wanted to use technology to influence her family. But they were stubborn and insulted me, which led me to act with vengeance, an officer quoted Madishetty as telling the cops. He has been booked for sexual harassment and outraging the modesty of a woman under the IPC and remanded in judicial custody.        
	Madishetty, who works in the MNCs Bangalore office now after stints in the US, initially sent the girl emails through proxy Internet protocol (IP) addresses  which shows where a content on the Web has been created  that revealed US origins. He began smothering her with hate mail after her family turned him down.        
	To avenge his hurt pride, the techie morphed her (the girls) photo and other details on a porn site. He also put an advertisement on social networking sites such as Facebook and Orkut saying the woman specialised in body massages and gave her fathers mobile number for contact, said another police officer.        
	The family had filed a police complaint seeking removal of the objectionable ads and content on social networking sites. But the probe made little headway as the IP servers traced it to the US. Checks at Boston and Cleveland, where the investigators initially thought Madishetty was sending the mails from, also drew a blank.        
	Ironically, it was the advice of a techie that gave Madishettys game away. On the advice of a techie, we asked the girl to send a sweet mail to him to smoke him out. She did and the police found that the mail had emanated from Hyderabad and zeroed on him last Friday at an apartment in Banjara Hills, the officer said.        
	It also emerged that Madishetty had papers showing his address in Ramanthpur, though he lived in Banjara Hills.

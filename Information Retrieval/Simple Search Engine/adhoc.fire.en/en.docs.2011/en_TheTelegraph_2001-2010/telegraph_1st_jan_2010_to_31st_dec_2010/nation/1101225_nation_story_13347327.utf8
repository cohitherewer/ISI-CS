          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Dec. 24: The Mayavati government today started fresh investigations into the murders of four senior doctors of the medical health and family welfare department on orders from Allahabad High Court.        
	A bench of Justices Rajiv Sharma and Ved Pal yesterday asked the government why so many murders had taken place in the department since 2000 and asked it to submit a report within two weeks.        
	The order was issued after jailed gangster Abhay Singh, who faces over 12 cases of murder and is known to be close to politicians, filed a petition saying he had no hand in the October 2010 murder of Vinod Arya as investigations had claimed.        
	An advocate told the court three chief medical officers and one director-general of health had been killed in the past decade and that Arya, the latest victim, was gunned down on October 27 at Gomtinagar in Lucknow.        
	The special task force that probed the murder said in a report submitted early this month that Arya had fallen to the bullets of contract killers Vijay Dubey and Ajay Misra.        
	According to additional DGP Brij Lal, Dubey, a resident of Lucknows Vikas Nagar, and Misra, who lived in Aliganj, had told police during questioning that they worked as assassins at the behest of Abhay Singh. Lal, however, could not explain why the murders had been commissioned.        
	Police sources said Aryas murder may have been the fallout of rivalry between contractors who supplied medicines to the health department. The mafia often got involved in disputes over tenders, they said, and bumped off doctors if the contractor they backed lost the bid.        
	Arya was head of a cell that invited tenders and decided on the suppliers. A quarrel with contractors over procurement of tenders cannot be ruled out and is a strong angle, a police officer said.        
	Of the remaining three murders, one took place in 2008 and two in 2000.        
	In August 2008, Om Prakash Chimpa, who was posted as chief medical officer in Etawah, was murdered. Two health department staffers had been detained in this connection but the murder remains unsolved.        
	In December 2000, another chief medical officer Radhey Shyam Sharma, 62, was shot dead in front of his chamber in Lucknows Mahanagar, an hour after he was informally told by department bosses that he had been given an extension.        
	A director-general of health, H.C. Vaish, was arrested later on complaints from Sharmas wife Rita but the police failed to prove charges against him.        
	Earlier the same year, Bachi Lal Rawat, director-general (medical and health), was murdered. The 55-year-old officer was on his way home when he was shot from close range at Gokhale Marg in the heart of Lucknow.        
	The name of an MP from eastern Uttar Pradesh and a don from Jaunpur had come up in connection with Rawats murder but the probe did not make much headway.

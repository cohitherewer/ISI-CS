The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Verdict not the end: Govt 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Verdict not the end: Govt 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 16: The Centre today said the Ayodhya title suit verdict due on September 24 was, at this stage, one step in the judicial process and either side could resort to legal remedies if they found it unacceptable.        
	In a resolution aimed at dousing the anxiety building up, the Union cabinet said the judgment, expected to be pronounced by a three-judge Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court, should be treated with utmost respect, but made it clear that it was not the end of the road.        
	The determination of the issues need not necessarily end with this judgment unless it is accepted by all parties. In case any of the parties feels that further judicial consideration is required, there are legal remedies available which could be resorted to, it said.        
	The cabinet appealed to the people to maintain equanimity and tranquillity after the judgment and said nobody should provoke any community or express emotions that could hurt sentiments.        
	It is important for all to ensure that the highest traditions of Indian culture and respect for all religions are fully maintained, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni said, reading out the statement.        
	Indias firm and resolute place on the path of inclusive growth is recognised the world over, the statement said, adding: Nothing must be said or done and nothing must happen that may cause us to deviate from our goals and our objectives.        
	The Centre is worried about the impact of the Ayodhya verdict on a slew of international events in the next two months. The Commonwealth Games start on October 3. A month later, in early November, US President Barack Obama is due to arrive in Delhi.        
	His visit will be followed by that of the Russian and French Presidents, Dmitry Medvedev and Nicholas Sarkozy. In between, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will travel to Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam for a week from October 24 to 30.        
	So far, the principal non-state actors  the Vishwa Hindu Parishad-Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas and the Babri Masjid Action Committee  have maintained that they will honour the court ruling and not hit the streets. I welcome the Centres statement, Babri committee convener Zafaryab Jilani said.        
	Even the BJP, which is searching hard for a plank with political and emotive possibilities, has decided to lie low principally because its Bihar ally, the Janata Dal (United), has made it clear divisive issues should not be touched before the Assembly elections.        
	Besides, the BJP is trying to rework its image as a responsible and moderate entity.        
	The RSS had convened a two-day meeting of Sangh parivar affiliates, including the BJP, on Wednesday and Thursday to assess the possible fallout of the verdict.         
	There was agreement that nothing should be done outside the legal and constitutional framework. There should be no violence, BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi told The Telegraph. Joshi, Nitin Gadkari, Rajnath Singh and organising secretary Ramlal represented the BJP at the meeting.        
	RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav said: The ideal solution lies either in negotiations or a law in Parliament. The judicial verdict will be limited to a small piece of land. But to build a grand Ram temple, a lot of adjoining land will be required either through legal means or talks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Life gets easier
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Life gets easier
          HOW MUCH HAVE THE 2000S CHANGED OUR LIVES? JUST THINK BACK TO 1999. FOR MOST OF US THEN, THERE WAS NO MOBILE, INTERNET, IPOD... AND FEW METAL DETECTORS                                            
	EVENINGS OUT        
	Then: You went to New Market for a spot of shopping and maybe watched a film at New Empire before dining at a Park Street restaurant. Sometimes you chatted with friends at your favourite tea stall        
	Now: You go to a mall, shop or window-shop, watch a movie at a multiplex and grab a bite at a restaurant  all at the same place. A little heavier on the pocket but you save a lot in travelling time. Tea stalls are out, cafes are in              
	STAYING IN TOUCH        
	Then: Your friend had just gone out when you called over the landline. Often, your girlfriends father took your call. The line stayed dead a lot of the time, and heaven help you if you expected Calcutta Telephones to do something about it        
	Now: Call anyone anytime on the mobile, from anywhere, especially with STDs so cheap. Ask for help from a stuck lift, call your driver to find out where the cars parked, find out if the maids coming, talk to your boyfriend from the privacy of your bedroom. No need to remember numbers. And guess what, even Calcutta Telephones staff have become prompt and polite  if you have a landline as well.        
	Your mobile can download music and videoclips, take pictures, make payments, access the Internet. The iPhone even looks sexy                      
	CHIT-CHAT        
	Then: You invited friends home and sat down for an adda. You talked about the school/college friends who had moved to another city or country. You toyed with the idea of writing them a letter  or actually wrote one  if you knew the address        
	Now: Life is a continuous connection with everyone you want to stay in touch with through social networking sites like Facebook, Orkut or Twitter, with you in your office (or bathroom) and maybe your friends in theirs.        
	The Twitter helped organise Iranian election protests in 2009. Facebook says its clocking 200 billion page views a month from its 350 million users, who send 1.6 billion messages every day (nearly 20,000 a second) and upload 2.5 billion photos a month. A teenaged burglar was arrested in the US after he stopped to check his account on the victims computer but forgot to log out               
	HAVE YOUR SAY        
	Then: If you had an opinion about something, you wrote an article in your college magazine. Or a letter to a newspaper editor, hoping it would be published        
	Now: The world is your oyster. You start your own blog and maybe get thousands of readers, or start tweeting to a host of followers and associates              
	LOOK IT UP        
	Then: You went to the college library, searched for the right book, then the right pages, and took notes        
	Now: Just Google (which has turned verb from noun in record speed). Wikipedia and other Net sites offer you whatever you want, and theres enough scope for cross-checking too. Wiki, launched in 2001, boasts more than 14 million articles in 271 languages and is used over 300 million times a month by everyone from schoolchildren to speechwriters              
	READY MONEY        
	Then: If a loved one had to be hospitalised, you often had to wait for the bank to open first. And there always lurked the potential embarrassment of being caught short of cash while paying the restaurant bill or buying expensive medicine        
	Now: The ATM card and credit card have taken care of all that. On the flipside, if your colleagues insist on a treat the day of your promotion, you no longer have the excuse that its the end of the month and you have no cash              
	MEMORY LOSS        
	Then: Remembered phone numbers, birthdays, meetings, appointments, mail addresses, pin codes. Swotted for exams  especially the essay-type questions         
	Now: Age of amnesia. Your mobile remembers everything, and has put the digital personal organiser, which no self-respecting CEO would be seen without in 1999, out of business. Forgotten street directions? Call your spouse or friend from your cellphone  if you dont have GPS in your car. And who needs to remember spellings in the era of SMS?        
	Actors in a New York theatre are using ear-pieces  they just cant remember their lines any more              
	DETECTORS AND I-CARD        
	Then: Metro had no metal detectors, you didnt get detained unnecessarily in US airports, and airline passengers didnt send text messages about suspicious co-travellers. I-cards were a politically incorrect infringement on self-respect; checks and frisking an intrusion on privacy and dignity        
	Now: Then 9/11 and 26/11 happened. Detectors and I-cards at offices. You are asked to reach the airport two hours in advance for a domestic flight, you cant carry liquids into planes. Parents require ID proof to enter their childrens schools and perhaps need to inform the school authorities in advance. The kids have their own I-cards              
	QUEUES amp; TOKENS        
	Then:You queued everywhere  at the cinema and railway ticket counter (despite computerisation). You clutched your token and waited at airline booking offices and banks        
	Now: You buy railway, airline and movie tickets online (multiplexes have put paid to long queues anyway). And if you are carrying only hand baggage, check yourself in at a self-help kiosk at the airport. Banks? When was the last time you went to one? Now you have ATMs even in villages. And, of course, credit cards                      
	TRAVEL        
	Then: Middle-class Bengalis travelled to Darjeeling and Digha  at best to Rajasthan, the Himalayas or the South (Kashmir was a no-no)        
	Now: They travel to Bangkok, Phuket, Kuala Lumpur and even Singapore, thanks to lowering of airfares  first by competition among a host of new players and then by the entry of low-cost airlines. With hotels too lowering rates and tour operators offering tempting packages, it can sometimes be cheaper travelling to Southeast Asia than to an Indian tourist hotspot.        
	The rich then had the Palace on Wheels, now they have the palace on wings: the Airbus A380, with luxury suits and double beds. The super-rich can travel to space                      
	MUSIC        
	Then: You listened to audio cassettes, CDs or Walkman        
	Now: Download whatever you like on iPod or your mobile anytime and listen to it. Figuratively heavier on your pocket than Walkman, but literally much lighter and easier to fit              
	REALITY DOSE        
	Then: Television meant soap operas and sport  an escape from reality        
	Now: No escape. If you arent watching a reality show, you must be glued to the breaking news on one of the hundreds of news channels that have sprung up in India              
	HOME ENTERTAINMENT        
	Then: Pestered cable operator for your favourite film with uncertain chances of success (if it was an offbeat or quality film that few subscribers would want to watch). If lucky, you got to see it on a grainy channel No. 78        
	Now: Have DTH, order on showcase              
	INVESTORS ALL        
	Then: Limited options like fixed deposits, LIC policies or PPF. Among the middle classes, only a few brave-hearts would dabble in the stock market, especially after the heartbreak following the 1992 stocks scandal        
	Now: Explosion of options. The stock market has drawn even homemakers, and theres an entire gamut of mutual funds to choose from. Not to forget the commodities market and new-age derivatives              
	FRIENDLY TAILOR        
	Then: The neighbourhood tailor would sniff if you wanted an old pair of jeans repaired, or a new readymade shirt altered for a better fit. He had time only for new orders        
	Now: Hit hard by the boom in the branded apparel market, the local tailor is glad to oblige              
	CRICKET        
	Then: Cheered for your country in Tests and ODIs        
	Now: You still cheer  along with scantily clad cheerleaders  for your city team in T20, and barrack some of your national stars who are in the opposition. Dilscoop, carrom ball, switch hit  wouldnt they have given you a heart attack in the stone-age 90s?              
	RULERS        
	Then: A chief minister who spoke in monosyllables and made you think the Left Front would rule Bengal over your entire lifetime. Prime Ministers, if less taciturn, were hard-bitten politicos        
	Now: A chief minister who breaks out into poetry and gaffes, and the Left seems on the way out. And we have an apolitical Prime Minister              
	SUPERPOWER        
	Then: A for America, B for nobody        
	Now: China, Russia are posing a challenge, and India is being spoken of as an emerging superpower  
	Digital deluge  
	At the end of the Decade of Download, the physical album probably faces a bleak future, even in the CD format. Overnight superstars are made online: the Arctic Monkeys, a band based in a suburb of Sheffield, UK, released its debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That rsquo;s What I rsquo;m Not, in January 2006 wholly online. The record became the UK rsquo;s fastest-selling debut album, shifting over 360,000 copies in its first week. By March, the Sheffield boys were ready to tour the world.
    
	The flipside? Not too many artistes are paying much attention to album art and even established artistes are being dropped by their labels since record sales are at an  all-time low.
    
	For all that, the decade witnessed a rising affection for analogue gear, especially for artistes who took a serious look back at their past oeuvre and/or looked forward to creating sounds that weren rsquo;t run-of-the-mill. This decade saw both the rise and fall of the note-perfect ProTools to correct/replace human error. Bands like The White Stripes,   
	The Jets and Kings of Leon have often proudly proclaimed recording whole albums without ldquo;a single computer rdquo;. As for the sounds, with records like In Rainbows by Radiohead out in the world at large, you can only look at a new genre called ldquo;collapse of genre boundaries rdquo;

	Crisis and Chindia  
	Recession: The decade rsquo;s last years witnessed a global financial crisis described as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Blamed on excessive faith in the free market, it caused investment banking giants such as Lehman Brothers to close, heavily slashed consumer wealth and led to a fall in economic activity. Governments were forced to offer huge bailout packages to key companies, and Keynesian economics and pro-regulation policies became fashionable again.
    
	India unbound: The continuing liberalisation of the economy raised the middle classes rsquo; wealth. India became an IT giant, with cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune becoming global software hubs. The economy grew by over 9 per cent for two years running, with the average growth rate for the decade being more than 7 per cent. But poverty, malnutrition and child mortality continued while no great strides were made in healthcare or literacy.
    
	New powers: Fast-growing economies catapulted China to superpower status and India to that of an emerging superpower. China is seen as stronger in manufacturing and infrastructure and India in services and information technology; China the leader in hardware and India in software.              
	Luxury lightning  
	Easing of trade restrictions exposed Indians to international brands, raising demand for these sky-priced luxury items, but the honeymoon ended quickly with many leading boutiques shutting or contemplating doing so.
    
	The metrosexual man was born. The woman became very conscious of what she was wearing, embracing skinny, low-waist jeans, tunics, empire-line tops, trapeze tops, high platform heels and much more. Spikes for him and ironed hair for her. The Louis Vuitton Bag became the symbol of the decade for her.
    
	Filmdom was no longer pink and frilly: the 2000s saw the rise of style in Bollywood. From Kaho Naa Pyar Hai (2000) to Bunty Aur Babli (2005) to Kambakkht Ishq, the likes of Manish Malhotra and Aki Narula set the trends from screen to street.
  Beauty salons mushroomed. The birth of fashion weeks in India made designers such as Manish Arora and Sabyasachi Mukherjee household names.
    
	Shradha Agarwal

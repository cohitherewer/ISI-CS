          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 7: Under pressure from Christian groups and the government, Indias apex minority education watchdog has backtracked on a controversial decision it took in March that threatened to strip several top educational institutions of their minority status.         
	The National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions today declared that it would reconsider a move to deny institutions with less than 30 per cent students from a particular minority community the tag of a minority institution.         
	But while backtracking on its 30 per cent demand, the minority panel today laid down fresh potentially controversial conditions that could require schools to conduct a religion-based headcount of students.         
	Panel chairman M.S.A Siddiqui had demanded a minimum percentage of minority community students from institutions seeking the minority tag in a slew of cases in early March.         
	But that move triggered a wave of protest from the Christian community which petitioned the Prime Minister, the human resource development minister and even the Vatican expressed concerns.         
	The Christian groups, including the Catholic Bishops Conference of India  the highest decision making body of Catholics in the country  also demanded that the HRD ministry appoint a Christian member on the commission.         
	The HRD ministry has now appointed a Christian and a Sikh member to the commission in addition to Siddiqui. The posts of Christian and Sikh members were lying vacant since December.         
	Today, Siddiqui declared that the full commission would decide whether to impose a minimum percentage of minority students for institutions seeking the minority tag, and what it should be.         
	Let the full commission debate and decide how to determine what constitutes a substantial population as required by the Supreme Court in its order, Siddiqui said, in a hearing today.         
	In its 2005 landmark P.A. Inamdar judgment, the apex court had stated that minority educational institutions must substantially cater to students from such communities.         
	But the judgment did not define substantial and did not lay down any minimum percentage of students from such communities that institutions need to claim for the status.         
	Siddiquis demands for a minimum percentage had triggered fears among several top Christian educational institutions that they may lose their minority status. Most of these institutions have fewer than 30 per cent Christian students.         
	The minority panel has, however, introduced fresh application conditions that will require institutions seeking minority status to conduct a religion-based count of students.         
	Under the new application procedure, institutions have to submit an affidavit showing the community-wise break-up of student population admitted in the institution.

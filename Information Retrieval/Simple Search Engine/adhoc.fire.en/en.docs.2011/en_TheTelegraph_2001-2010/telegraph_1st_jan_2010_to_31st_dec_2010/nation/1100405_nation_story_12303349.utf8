                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Trinamul expels Suman election aide
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mamata Banerjee (top), Kabir Suman (bottom)                                
	Calcutta, April 4: The Trinamul Congress today expelled Mufazzal Hossain, MP Kabir Sumans election agent, for anti-party activities.         
	The move is being seen in party circles as an attempt to signal the Jadavpur MP to quit the party and the Lok Sabha seat. Suman had earlier said he would quit Trinamul but was held back by author Mahasweta Devi to the dismay of Trinamul leaders who want the singer to go.        
	The party is miffed with Sumans contrary stands on several issues and frequent criticism of its leaders in public.        
	The Trinamul leadership wants Suman to quit Parliament and the party on his own and at the earliest. So, it is targeting those close to him to send a signal to the rebel MP that the sooner he resigns, the better for Trinamul, a party leader close to Suman said tonight.         
	The Trinamul leadership has already written to Speaker Meira Kumar requesting her to treat Sumans text message as his resignation from the House. In a one-line text message sent to Mamata Banerjee and party chief whip Sudip Bandopadhyay early last week, Suman said he would quit his seat in the House and the party.         
	Our disciplinary committee has expelled Mufazzal Hossain for being involved in anti-party activities, Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said tonight. He, however, did not say what these anti-party activities were.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata had given her nod to the expulsion before she left for Delhi this afternoon.         
	Hossain said the party had unilaterally expelled him. I was not given a showcause notice before my suspension. This is an injustice to a devoted party worker, he said, adding that he was associated with the Trinamul Congress since its inception in 1998.         
	He said Trinamul minister and general secretary Mukul Roy had telephoned him this afternoon to inform him about his expulsion. Asked if he had told Suman, he said no. However, dada (Suman) came to know about it from news channels. He is very upset.         
	Suman was not available for comment.

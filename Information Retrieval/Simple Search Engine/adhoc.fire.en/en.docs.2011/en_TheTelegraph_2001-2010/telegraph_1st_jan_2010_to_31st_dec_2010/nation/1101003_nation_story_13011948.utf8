          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 2: CIA chief Leon Panetta is in India ahead of US President Barack Obamas visit and has met Union home minister P. Chidambaram.        
	The discussions on Friday evening revolved around security issues related to the Afghanistan-Pakistan (Af-Pak) region where attacks on US-led Nato forces this week have heightened concerns about the US Presidents security when he visits India in November.        
	K.C. Verma, the chief of Indias external intelligence agency RAW, was also present when Panetta met the Union home minister.        
	Sources said the discussions also included the US agencys warning that the Commonwealth Games could be an appealing target for the Lashkar-e-Toiba.        
	Officials were tight-lipped on how exactly the Lashkar threat had figured in the talks but the matter assumed significance as the meeting happened two days before the Games opening ceremony, which is tomorrow.        
	On September 22, Michael Leiter, the director of the National Counter-terrorism Center (NCTC), had highlighted the Lashkar threat in a briefing to the Senates homeland security and governmental affairs committee.        
	We are concerned that next months Commonwealth Games in New Delhi will be an appealing target for LT (Lashkar) due to their political and economic significance for India, as well as the heightened media exposure that will accompany the event, Leiter had said. New Delhi has been receiving inputs from Washington on the issue.        
	Another immediate concern was Obamas visit. The CIA is worried about the possible fallout from civilian deaths in Nato air strikes in Pakistan and attacks on Nato oil tankers convoys in Afghanistan this week.         
	Added to that is the apprehension that Pakistans ISI could foment trouble in Kashmir ahead of Obamas visit.        
	Panetta is also understood to have discussed with Chidambaram recent intelligence inputs suggesting 26/11-like style terror attacks in European cities, including London.         
	The NCTC is said to have recently carried out a table-top exercise in which experts simulated a Mumbai-style strike on Chicago.        
	The Mumbai attack also figured in Leiters assessment to the Senate committee. The groups attack two years ago in Mumbai resulted in US and Western casualties, and the group continues to plan attacks in India that could harm US citizens and damage US interests.

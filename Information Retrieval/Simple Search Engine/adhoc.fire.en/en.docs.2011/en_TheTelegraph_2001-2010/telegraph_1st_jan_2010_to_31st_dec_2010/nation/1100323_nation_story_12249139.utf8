	Bhubaneswar, March 22: Jindal Steel and Power Limited is going to set up a coal-to-liquid plant in Orissa with an investment of $10 billion.        
	The proposed project was discussed at a meeting between chief minister Naveen Patnaik and JSPL vice-chairman and managing director Naveen Jindal at the secretariat here this evening.        
	Later, Jindal said the MoU for the project would be signed within a few months. About the location of the project, he said: We are discussing various options. We will take a decision within a few months.        
	Stating that the coal-to-liquid project is of national importance and will ensure energy security, Jindal said the project would be immensely beneficial for Orissa, which has 33 per cent coal reserve of the country. The project is expected to be commissioned within eight years.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 11: The Supreme Court today asked the Kerala government to explain a 2008 order providing education quotas in state-run institutions to the economically backward among forward castes.        
	A bench headed by outgoing Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan issued notices to the Left government on the order of September 4, 2008, which had set aside 10 per cent seats in undergraduate and post-graduate courses. The beneficiaries were to be identified from BPL cards issued by the local authorities.        
	The notices came on a petition by Kerala Muslim Jamath Council, which argued that any such quota on the ground of economic backwardness violated the right to equality.         
	Kerala High Court had dismissed the councils plea in January.         
	The council, which claims to espouse the cause of the states socially and educationally backward Muslims, said the move discriminated against backward classes. The GO (government order) was issued for political ends. The remedy should have been financial assistance to the economically backward students of all communities, the council said in its appeal.

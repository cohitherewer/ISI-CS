          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 1: The Supreme Court today rejected former Goa tourism minister Francisco Xavier Pachecos anticipatory bail plea over his girlfriends mysterious death, saying the influential politician could tamper with the evidence.        
	Nadia Francisco Torrado, 28, died in May this year following complications arising out of poisoning  a combination of sleeping pills and rat poison.         
	Women activists in the state have, however, alleged that Torrado was carrying Pachecos child and could have been murdered.        
	Goa police had initially registered a case of attempted suicide but later brought charges of destruction of evidence, abetment to suicide and culpable homicide not amounting to murder against the minister, who faces several other cases.        
	The 46-year-old Pacheco, who had been on the run since being summoned by the police, will have to surrender now. He had stepped down as minister after the womans death.        
	The top court has stayed his arrest for two weeks, until the prosecution files a reply on the bail plea, but the tainted politician has been asked to appear before police and co-operate with the investigations.        
	A vacation bench of Justices R.M. Lodha and A.K. Patnaik said the minister had already tampered with the evidence, pointing to the fact that Torrados cellphone, laptop and other key items were missing.         
	The custodial interrogation of the ex-minister is essential to find the missing links in the probe, the judges said. There are several things that make us wary, the bench said.         
	The judges noted that there were 13 contusions on Torrados body, according to the post-mortem report.         
	Pachecos lawyer Uday Lalit tried to explain it away saying that those could be a sign of the attempts made by the doctors to revive her after her heart failed.         
	At this, the judges asked: What about those on her arms and legs? The post-mortem report said these contusions could be the result of blows by a blunt object such as a log or a rod. The injuries pre-date her hospitalisation following poisoning. Pachecos lawyer, however, admitted that his client had a relationship with her.        
	Lalit argued that there was no needle of suspicion pointing at his client.         
	Torrados mother has not said anything about the politicians involvement, he said. Ever in her dying declaration, Torrado has admitted that she consumed poison, he argued. But the apex court judges shrugged off the arguments.         
	I was the one throughout with her till her death. That is now being held against me, the lawyer said, reading from Pachecos submission. He also claimed that he had spent Rs 40 lakh on treatment to try and save the lady.        
	Torrado was first admitted to a Goa hospital but later flown to a Mumbai healthcare hospital where she slipped into coma following liver failure. An attempt was made to save her with a liver transplant in a Chennai hospital but she died following complications.        
	Earlier, Pacheco had approached the sessions judge in Margao for anticipatory bail. That petition was turned down.         
	Then he moved Bombay High Court, which also rejected his plea.         
	Pacheco has at least nine criminal cases pending against him, including one filed by his first wife that he used to beat her. Another case relates to the alleged rape of a minor.

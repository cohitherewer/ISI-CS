	Hyderabad, Jan. 10 (PTI): Andhra Pradesh High Court has told news channels not to telecast sensational programmes that may create panic in peoples minds.        
	Referring to the coverage of the Telangana protests, Justice T. Gopala Krishna said the news channels had not only been practising sensationalism to improve ratings but were promoting enmity among different groups of people.        
	Advocate V.V.S.S. Kameswara Rao had filed a petition yesterday against 13 Telugu news channels for broadcasting stories about conspiracies behind the death of then chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy in a helicopter crash last year.        
	Earlier, the petitioner had challenged the repeated telecast of provocative speeches and scenes of violence by some Telugu news channels.        
	The TV channels (are) exceeding their limitations only for the purpose of creating sensation and this court cannot be a silent spectator, the judge said.

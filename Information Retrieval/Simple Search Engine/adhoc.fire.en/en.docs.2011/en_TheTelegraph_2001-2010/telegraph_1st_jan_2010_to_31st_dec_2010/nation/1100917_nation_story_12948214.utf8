          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 16: The government today hiked the central dearness allowance by 10 percentage points to 45 per cent of basic pay, a double festival gift after yesterdays move to raise provident fund savings rates.        
	Todays increase, cleared by the Union cabinet and taking retrospective effect from July this year, brings employees within sniffing distance of a larger bonanza.         
	When the DA rate crosses 50 per cent, as expected next year, all allowances will go up 25 per cent, according to the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations.        
	Last March, the employees had got an 8 per cent DA hike, effective from January, though inflation was around 10 per cent in the preceding few months.         
	Around 50 lakh central employees and 38 lakh pensioners will benefit from todays decision. The government said the hike was meant to compensate for the rising cost of living.         
	Overall inflation stood at 8.5 per cent in August, while food inflation is around 15 per cent, according to a new set of price indices that kicked in this week.        
	However, the 15 per cent food inflation, computed for the week ended September 4, is not exactly comparable to the previous weeks 11.47 per cent because it has been calculated using a different reference point.        
	The DA hike will cost the Centre an estimated Rs 6,202 crore in the nine months of the current financial year (July 2010 to March 2011), and Rs 9,303 crore every year, an official spokesperson said after the cabinet meeting.        
	The hike came on a day the Reserve Bank of India signalled a rise in interest rates by nudging up two benchmark rates to fight rising prices. DA revisions take effect two times a year, from January 1 and July 1.         
	The increase in DA is in accordance with the formula based on the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission, the spokesperson said.         
	The increase comes ahead of the Dussehra and Diwali festivals over the next two months.

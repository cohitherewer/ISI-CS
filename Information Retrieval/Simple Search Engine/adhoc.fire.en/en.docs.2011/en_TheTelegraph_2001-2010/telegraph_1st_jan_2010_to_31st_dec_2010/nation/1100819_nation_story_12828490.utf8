          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: A BJP initiative to reach out to Muslims in Kashmir faltered after a Valley student delegation objected to Pandits being invited to the interactive session organised by the party today.        
	The session, hosted by leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj, turned into a duel with the Pandits angrily rebutting the students argument that Independence was the only solution to Kashmirs problems.        
	We have come here to express the aspirations and the frustration of the youths of the Valley and also try to find ways to restore peace.         
	But the party (the BJP) seems more interested in digressing from the real issues by inviting Kashmiri Pandits, said Kashmir Universitys Aasma Rashid.         
	The BJP has traditionally espoused the cause of the Pandits, many of whom had to flee the Valley after militancy began in the early 1990s.         
	Members of the 55-member student delegation  from Kashmir University, the Islamic University for Science and Technology and other colleges  were of the view that India had long represented fear and an independent Kashmir was the only solution.         
	But a war of words ensued when some Pandits retorted that the demand for independence was uncalled for. Kashmir is an integral part of India and it should be like that. Our families were forced to leave the Valley and have been living in exile in their own country, said Radhika Kaul, who stays in Delhi with her parents.         
	The students objected. Nobody has been forced to leave Kashmir. We want everybody to live in peace, one of them screamed, trying to be heard over the din.         
	A visibly upset Sushma asked the delegation to be patient and put forward their views one by one.         
	The students, wearing black armbands to protest recent civilian killings allegedly by security forces, criticised what they described as the silence of mainstream parties, including the BJP, on the deaths.         
	Dont you think the BJP and the Congress are hand in glove when it comes to the Kashmir problem while being diametrically opposite on other issues? Syed Sarmad of the Islamic University for Science and Technology asked.         
	Sushma insisted that dialogue was the way ahead. Why do you want Kashmir to be independent? she asked. She iterated the BJPs stance that it does not agree with the special status granted to Kashmir.         
	The session was organised by the Shyama Prasad Mookerji Foundation.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, May 19: The Centre has rejected a proposal by the Rajasthan Royals owner to induct as an investor the Mauritius-based firm through which Lalit Modis brother-in-law and Shilpa Shettys in-laws hold stakes in the IPL team.        
	The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), a body under the finance ministry, rejected team owner Jaipur IPLs plan at its meeting on May 7 to include Emerging Media (EM) Sports Holdings as an investor.        
	The reason was technical: Emerging Media had paid cricket board BCCI on Jaipur IPLs behalf. For the team owner to issue shares in lieu of a payment, the money should come to it directly, not go to a third party.        
	This is the second time Jaipur IPLs application has been turned down. It was first rejected in October 2009 for lack of information on the sources of funding.        
	EM Sports Holding is a venture between the Manoj Badale-promoted Emerging Media IPL and other investors. These include Modis brother-in-law Suresh Chellaram, Shiplas in-laws Bal Kishan and Usha Rani Kundra, and Rupert Murdochs son Lachlan.        
	In June 2008  the year the IPL started  Badales firm had forked out over $5 million in earnest money and other fees on Jaipur IPLs behalf to the cricket board.         
	The payments to the cricket board were made from Badales personal account and through his firm, apparently to save time that would have been spent in routing the money first to Jaipur IPL and then to the BCCI, the owners have claimed. The proposal to the FIPB was to issue shares in return for these payments.        
	The income-tax department is already scanning the teams funding since it has come through multiple entities registered in tax havens like Mauritius. Jaipur IPL is also under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate (ED), part of the finance ministry, for alleged violations of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema).        
	Jaipur IPL, an EM Sports Holding subsidiary, was incorporated in March 2008 to manage and operate the Rajasthan Royals.

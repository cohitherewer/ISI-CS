          SANJAY K. JHA                                                  
	New Delhi, May 11: When Manmohan Singh presents his Report to the People in a fortnight from now, it will be as a troubled Prime Minister.        
	Indiscreet ministers, stubborn prices and cock-a-snook Maoists have combined with a host of other issues to deepen the worry lines on his forehead.        
	The focus has shifted since he assumed office for the second time in May 2009 when Singh had made it clear that his top priorities would be improving the delivery mechanism and enforcing greater accountability.        
	A year later, as he prepares for his presentation to the nation on May 24, the lens is on the web of controversies his government is caught in.         
	So concerned is the Congress and the government after the latest episode of indiscretion by environment minister Jairam Ramesh that party media cell chief Janardan Dwivedi today issued a fresh warning to trouble-makers. No minister, he said, is expected to publicly speak on policies of other ministries and issues that involves relations with other countries.         
	The allusion was to Jairams China comment, which is being viewed seriously despite the ministers written clarification to the Prime Minister and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.        
	Jairam had said the home ministrys attitude towards the Chinese was alarmist and paranoid, leaving P. Chidambarams department seething.        
	Although the Congresss official communication channels claimed the chapter was closed, many party leaders admitted the comments could have a wider ramification as China was a sensitive subject. These leaders said they feared the Prime Minister might end up firefighting at his first formal media conference of UPA-II.         
	Many leaders said they understood the indignation in the home ministry and Chidambarams angry letter to the Prime Minister and wondered how an intelligent person like Jairam could talk of Indias hostile attitude towards China, a comment that could cause the government global embarrassment.        
	But Jairam has survived in the past despite greater political transgressions like commenting on Sonias mental faculties and comparing her with former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi.        
	The Prime Minister moved fast to nip the China controversy in the bud but he hasnt been able to act decisively on other matters like corruption allegations against communications minister A. Raja and the accusation that a corporate lobbyist was influencing ministry-making.        
	Conflicting views on Maoists within the Congress is another problem the Prime Minister has to address. The cabinet also has to find a way out of the differences over including caste in the ongoing census.        
	Last month, the IPL row had scalped a minister, Shashi Tharoor. Prices, too, are refusing to come down. As if these were not enough, four ministers are ending their Rajya Sabha terms. Earlier, the Telangana tangle had taken up a lot of time.        
	All these issues are set to dominate Singhs media conference, which will be followed by a dinner Sonia will host for UPA partners the same night.                        Manmohan Singh      
	The media conference, at Vigyan Bhavan, will be connected live with six metropolises through videoconferencing so that Singh can take questions from journalists in Mumbai, Chennai, Calcutta, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Lucknow.         
	The Press Information Bureau and the ministry of external affairs are also arranging video facilities to enable journalists to ask questions from foreign capitals and other metros.         
	Senior cabinet ministers will also be present at the media event. A drill is on in the Prime Ministers Office for about a month now to collect details of success stories of ministries for making them part of the presentation.        
	The AICC has sent out a circular to presidents of state units to organise events highlighting the achievements of the UPA during its six years in office.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: The human resource development ministry is likely to refer to the CBI the case of a fake institute running on the IIT Kharagpur campus with the alleged connivance of the tech school faculty and other officials.        
	The ministry had earlier decided to set up a two-member committee comprising IIT Indore director Pradeep Mathur and IIT Gandhinagar director Sudhir Jain to probe the matter.         
	But the decision drew flak from certain sections that felt such a committee would not be able to do a fair job as the scam allegedly involved former directors and senior officials of IIT Kharagpur.        
	The ministry is now likely to refer the matter to the CBI for a proper investigation, a top source said.        
	Allegations have been filed before the Central Vigilance Commission that a fake institute, Institution of Electrical Engineering (IEE), was allegedly running on the IIT Kharagpur campus with the connivance of the tech school administration.        
	IEE students have alleged that A.K. Ghosh, a senior faculty member and former chief vigilance officer of the institute, was the president of the institute that is not recognised by the All India Council of Technical Education.        
	The fake institute was offering diploma courses in electrical engineering and was managed by J.K. Tiwary, who allegedly lured students into taking admission by claiming it was a branch of IIT Kharagpur. Another senior faculty member, J.C. Biswas, was the IEE vice-president.        
	IEE students have also alleged that former IIT Kharagpur directors K.L. Chopra and S.K. Dube were supporting the institute, but the claim has been denied.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sen defence bares CPM quandary

          J.P. YADAV                           A protest in Delhi against the judgment. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: The CPM has now joined the chorus in support of Binayak Sen, a rights activist convicted for Maoist links.         
	A bad judgment. Misuse of sedition charge, party general secretary Prakash Karat said in a text reply to The Telegraph. Karat was, however, silent when asked if the politburo would issue a statement on the life sentence handed to Sen by a Chhattisgarh court.        
	The CPM had till recently attacked Left-leaning academics and rights groups who the party felt were speaking for the Maoists. Top party leaders often questioned the silence of such groups on the killings of CPM cadres by the rebels.        
	This stance had led the party to be identified with the tyrannical state. Bengals Left Front government was on the same page with home minister P. Chidambaram in advocating a no tolerance attitude towards Maoists and the party too backed it.        
	The condemnation of the judgment on Sen is being viewed as an attempt by the party to check its isolation from Left-backed academics and rights groups.        
	However, unlike the central leadership, the Bengal CPM has so far not reacted to the verdict.         
	The first step to back Sen was taken by the likes of Prabhat Patnaik, Amiya Kumar Bagchi, Ashok Mitra and Jayati Ghosh, academics identified with the CPM, who signed a statement condemning the judgment.        
	Dr Binayak Sen never resorted to violence against any other person, never incited anyone else to resort to violence, never entered into any conspiracy against the Constitutional order of the country, and never entered into regular service of any organisation that was involved in any such conspiracy, for furthering its cause, the statement says.        
	It has made a section of the CPM uncomfortable, who feel it absolves Sen of any links with Maoists. It is common knowledge that Binayak Sen is a Maoist sympathiser. We should limit ourselves to criticising the judgment and not giving him a clean chit, said a senior CPM leader.

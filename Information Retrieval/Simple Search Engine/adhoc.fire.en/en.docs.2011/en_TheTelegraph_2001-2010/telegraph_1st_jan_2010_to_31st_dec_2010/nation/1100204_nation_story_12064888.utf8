The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP tiptoes on Shah Rukh
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP tiptoes on Shah Rukh
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: The BJP today sought to walk the tightrope on the Shiv Sena furore surrounding Shah Rukh Khan, its cautious response standing out against the backdrop of the outright condemnation of the attacks on north Indians.        
	Referring to the Senas outburst against the actor for expressing unhappiness at the absence of Pakistani players in IPL teams, BJP spokesperson Prakash Javdekar said: The BJP does not accept politics in games. Games should be games.        
	But he wondered what stopped Shah Rukh from bidding for a Pakistani player as he co-owned the Kolkata Knight Riders and why the actor got sanctimonious a week after the episode was over. Nobody can object to what he said. But why didnt he bring a player from Pakistan? asked Javdekar.        
	But he refused to comment on the Senas clamour for a ban on My Name is Khan.         
	In Mumbai, the BJPs leader in the Assembly, Eknath Khadse, was a bit more vocal and said the demand was not proper.         
	The BJPs differences with the Sena on north Indians arose because of the Bihar elections this year and the damage it could bring upon itself, if it remained silent.        
	The party reckoned that the call to ban the movie, on the other hand, would not resonate politically beyond the chat shows on TV.

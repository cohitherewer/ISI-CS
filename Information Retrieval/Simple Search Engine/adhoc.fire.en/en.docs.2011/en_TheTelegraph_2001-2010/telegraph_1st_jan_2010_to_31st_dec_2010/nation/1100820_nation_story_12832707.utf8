The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Enclave talks with Bangla
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Enclave talks with Bangla

	New Delhi, Aug. 19: The government today decided to go ahead with border talks with Bangladesh that could see the two sides swapping enclaves, in a confidence-building step that could give the neighbour more territory than what India gains.        
	India is also likely to include another 45 to 50 items to the list of duty-free imports from its neighbour.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who recently visited Dhaka, held an inter-ministerial meeting to review progress on Bangladeshs demand for concessions on trade, border and sharing of river waters.        
	A meeting of the joint boundary commission is expected next month to decide on swapping the enclaves, a deal long in the pipeline.        
	India has 92 Bangladeshi enclaves, most of them in Cooch Behar, and Bangladesh has 106 Indian enclaves.         
	Delhi and Dhaka had in 1974 agreed to exchange the enclaves or at least provide easy access to them, but little has moved since.        
	India is also likely to waive import duties on another 45 to 50 items from Bangladesh, in a move aimed at improving bilateral trade. Bangladesh had asked for 61 items to be added to the duty-free list of over 4,000 categories of products.        
	India sells $3.37-billion worth of goods annually to Bangladesh and imports items worth $358 million.        
	During Mukherjees recent trip to Dhaka, India signed a $1-billion loan agreement.         
	Under the deal, India will lend the amount, the biggest it has offered to any foreign country, at a 1.75 per cent rate of interest with a repayment period of 20 years, including a grace period of five years.

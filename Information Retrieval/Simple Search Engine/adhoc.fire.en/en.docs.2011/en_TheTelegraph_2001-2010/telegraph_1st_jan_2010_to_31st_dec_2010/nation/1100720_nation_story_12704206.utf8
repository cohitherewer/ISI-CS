The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong murmurs against minister
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong murmurs against minister
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, July 19: The Congress leadership views the regular rail accidents with a deep sense of disquiet and murmurs have started in the party about the need to rid the railway ministry of an absentee minister.         
	The party has so far avoided giving vent to its frustration in public but many leaders feel it is high time Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke to Mamata Banerjee and persuade her to allow someone with undivided attention to look after the biggest ministry.        
	Congress leaders admit the minister cannot be held personally guilty but argue that the regularity of accidents has created an alarming situation.        
	A senior minister said the problem is not the causes of the accidents but the perception that the minister is preoccupied with Bengal politics and not fully committed to her job.         
	The problem cannot be addressed till the (Bengal) Assembly elections (next summer). Hence, Mamata should herself depute someone for the job. We dont want her to go out as a failed minister but she can, at a later date, choose to opt out citing the elections.         
	Most Congress leaders share the concern and say something needs to be done to address the negative public perception.         
	The partys official response, though, was very cautious. The government should take every step to ensure that such accidents do not occur in the future, spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed told a news conference. He refused to accept, despite being asked several times, that the railway minister was at fault.        
	But Ahmed had to face a barrage of questions on Mamatas performance. Asked if 15 accidents in over 14 months were not enough to shake the government and whether the railway minister was doing full justice to her job, he said: It is a cause for concern that so many accidents have taken place. Those responsible should make extra efforts to improve the situation.         
	On whether Mamata could be sacked, he shifted the onus to Singh. It is the Prime Ministers prerogative to decide who should be in the cabinet.         
	The spokesperson dismissed suggestions that the accidents were the outcome of Mamatas obsession with Bengal politics and that her ministerial work was secondary. Accidents can happen anytime. Nobody should make light of the tragedy by viewing this through the prism of partisan politics. Nobody should try to take political mileage. We are sure even the minister is extremely concerned about the situation.         
	The Congress has so far treated Mamata with extra caution and adopted different yardsticks for its coalition partners. Congress leaders never defended Sharad Pawar, the agriculture minister who heads ally NCP, on food price rise, or the DMKs A. Raja against corruption charges as communications minister. By contrast, few Congress leaders have spoken against Mamata despite her image as an absentee minister.         
	But todays accident in Bengal appears to have altered the situation, though some Congress leaders gave credence to Mamatas doubts that todays crash could have been caused by suspected sabotage.         
	Another section of Congress leaders feels the Prime Minister should take some symbolic steps to convince people there is nothing amiss with the railways. Parliaments monsoon session is barely a week away and nothing dramatic can be expected at this stage. But the chapter on Mamata will be reopened whenever the next cabinet reshuffle takes place.

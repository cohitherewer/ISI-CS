The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP seeks probe but unsure of Pawar
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP seeks probe but unsure of Pawar
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley                                  
	New Delhi, April 23: The BJP has demanded that a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe the truthfulness of the IPL revelations after a nod from Arun Jaitley, the Opposition leader in the Rajya Sabha.        
	But the party is ambivalent on seeking the resignations of NCP ministers Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel, whose close relatives, according to reports, are alleged beneficiaries of the cricket league.        
	While former minister Yashwant Sinha insisted that they should go, S.S. Ahluwalia, the deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha, said there was no clinching proof to demand their removal.         
	The stand is in contrast to the campaign the BJP had mounted against ousted junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoor, based on evidence of his alleged role in the Kochi IPL franchise.        
	The BJP wants to keep its options open with the NCP in case there is a political churning in Maharashtra, where Pawar has a coalition government with the Congress. If the alliance snaps, the BJP hopes to fill in the numbers the NCP will require in the legislature with the Shiv Sena.        
	This morning, party leaders Sushma Swaraj and L.K. Advani, at a meeting to firm up a strategy for Parliament, agreed it was time the BJP sought a JPC probe  something other Opposition parties have been asking for.         
	Sushma was, however, clear that the demand would not be raised without Jaitleys go-ahead. Jaitley is a member of the IPL governing council and a vice-president of the BCCI.        
	He endorsed the plan when Sushma spoke to him over the phone. However, Sushma requested Jaitley to attend the meeting so that the issue could be discussed threadbare. The BJP decided to go ahead with the proposal after Jaitley joined the meeting.        
	Asked how the JPC could function objectively given the cross-party interests in the IPL, a BJP leader said: It does not impact our party. Our leaders who are part of cricket panels and associations (Himachal MP Anurag Thakur and Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, apart from Jaitley) are above board. Nobody can question their integrity. So let a JPC get to the bottom of the sordid goings-on, the money trail, bribes, match-fixing, etc.        
	Asked about Lalit Modis association with former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, the source said: Yes, they are close. But the allegations raised so far against Vasundhara relate to land deals and the take-over of heritage properties (in Rajasthan). The state government has said it will investigate these, so let it do so. Then the law can take its course. But there is no evidence of Vasundharas cricket links because of the Modi association.        
	The BJPs reading is that the Congress was not one on the JPC demand. While one section wanted a committee, those Congress leaders who have overt or covert cricketing interests did not, claimed a party source.         
	Its a calibrated vendetta drive against Pawar and Patel. The Congress wants to frighten them like it had intimidated Lalu Prasad, Mayawati, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Jayalalithaa. The idea is to paint the NCP into a corner so that it loses its clout vis-a-vis the Congress. The Congress can then use the party in whatever way it likes, the source claimed.

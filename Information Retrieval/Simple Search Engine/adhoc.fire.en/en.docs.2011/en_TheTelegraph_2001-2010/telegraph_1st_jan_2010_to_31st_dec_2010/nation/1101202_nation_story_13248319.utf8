	New Delhi, Dec. 1: The government has said it will hand over a set of the Niira Radia tapes to the Supreme Court for safekeeping to dispel fears they might go missing like the Adarsh society papers.         
	Solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium said the government had no objection to making available a complete set of the tapes for the court to preserve.         
	Now with the income-tax department, the tapes feature conversations between Radia, a corporate lobbyist, and members of Parliament, bureaucrats and journalists.

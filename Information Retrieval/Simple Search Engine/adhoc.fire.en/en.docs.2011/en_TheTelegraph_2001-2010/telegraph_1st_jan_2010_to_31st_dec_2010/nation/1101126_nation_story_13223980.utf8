The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Red jolt to power drive
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Red jolt to power drive
          RAMASHANKAR                               
	Patna, Nov. 25: Swept back to power on a landslide, Nitish Kumar got a grim reminder of the road ahead hours later.        
	Maoists struck at the heart of the chief ministers ambitious plans for Bihar, raiding a site of a 3,020MW power project last night and setting fire to machines before warning the handful of workers present to leave or face the consequences.        
	A security guard said at least 100 rebels swooped down on the under-construction Nabinagar plant, one of the four big power projects coming up in the electricity-starved state.        
	For Nitish, the plant in the heart of Maoist-dominated Aurangabad district, 180km from Patna, holds the key to his plans of turning Bihar into a power-surplus state by 2015.        
	Investors, too, said they saw in Bihar a great potential in setting up power projects, but the chief minister would first need to assure them the state was safe for doing business amid suggestions that his government was soft while handling situations involving rebels.        
	Police said the Maoists raided the office of the construction company around 11.30pm and assaulted some workers and security guards before setting fire to four dumpers, three cranes, concrete mixing machines and a generator set.         
	The rebels also left pamphlets threatening employees of the construction firm with dire consequences if they continued with their work on the project, a joint venture between the National Thermal Power Corporation and Indian Railways.        
	Surendra Kumar, a security guard, told the police the Maoists descended on the plant around midnight while he and the others slept in the makeshift office. The rebels, he said, first asked for the contractor and the accounts clerk. When we said neither was present, they assaulted us with iron rods and told us to leave the job. They then set fire to the office and the equipment.        
	Aurangabad police chief Vivek Raj Singh said the area had been cordoned off. A search is on to arrest the Maoists involved in the incident, he told The Telegraph.        
	Singh said the police hadnt received any complaint from the company about Maoist demands for levy.        
	For Nitish, the attack on the plant, which he believes would generate employment and spur development in the Maoist-dominated district, was a grim reminder of the challenges ahead.        
	For all his thrust on development, the Maoists could derail his drive by keeping investors out.        
	Yesterday, as the results poured in, many investors were keeping a close watch. If Nitishji is able to fix the law-and-order and power situation, industry would be only too happy to come to Bihar, said two-wheeler baron Rahul Bajaj.        
	H.M. Bangur, managing director of Shree Cements, was more effusive, saying Bihar was the countrys next growth story.        
	We see a great potential in setting up power projects in the state.... We want to meet the chief minister and explore opportunities there.        
	Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of RPG Enterprises, said Nitish had instilled confidence among investors. CESC has emerged as the highest bidder for a distribution licence in Patna and Muzaffarpur and we are awaiting the final decision. Should we get the licence, we will move ahead with a 2,000MW power project.        
	Over the past two years, the state investment promotion board has approved over 20 high-value projects with a collective investment of Rs 1.6 lakh crore.        
	Amit Mitra, secretary-general of commerce chamber Ficci, said the private sector would be willing to join hands with the state government in the next stage of development as Kumar had addressed the basic issues of law and order, primary education and rural roads.

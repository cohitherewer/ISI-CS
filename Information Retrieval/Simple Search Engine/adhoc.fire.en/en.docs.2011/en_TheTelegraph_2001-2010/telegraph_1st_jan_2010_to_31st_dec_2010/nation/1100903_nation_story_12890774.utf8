          A STAFF REPORTER                                              Mahasweta Devi,   Swami Agnivesh       
	Calcutta, Sept. 2: The Maoists claim of having killed Abhay Yadav, one of the policemen they had abducted in Bihar, has stunned even those who have always been sympathetic to their cause.        
	Writer Mahasweta Devi, rights activist Sujato Bhadra and social activist Swami Agnivesh have condemned the killing of a hostage.        
	Yadav was killed this afternoon after the Bihar government failed to meet the deadline for the release of jailed Maoists, the rebels said.        
	I am opposed to the killing of hostages. I strongly condemn the killing, Mahasweta said. She also criticised the killing of policemen in Jungle Mahal, West Midnapore. I dont understand why policemen are being targeted. Policemen are human beings like us and are working under a government to feed their families, she said.        
	Bhadra said that killing a hostage amounted to gross abuse of human rights.        
	Agnivesh said: Although I hold the Bihar government responsible for not meeting the deadline... I wont support the manner in which they (the Maoists) have killed a policeman who was taken hostage. The hostage should have been released.

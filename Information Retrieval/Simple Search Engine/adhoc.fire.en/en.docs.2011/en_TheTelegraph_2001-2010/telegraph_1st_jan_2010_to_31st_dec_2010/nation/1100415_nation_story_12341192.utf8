          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 14: The schism in the top Congress leadership on the anti-Maoist strategy has come to the fore with Digvijay Singh, one of the most powerful general secretaries of the party, publicly criticising home minister P. Chidambaram for treating the Naxalite threat as a purely law and order problem.         
	Digvijay had met Chidambaram several times in recent months calling for a holistic approach to the problem, but his decision to go public with his criticism  through a newspaper article  exposed the futility of the earlier exercise.        
	Digvijay has spoken of Chidambarams rigidity and intellectual arrogance, indicating that changing the ministers mindset through persuasion was difficult and the better way to mount pressure on him was by bringing the debate into the public domain.        
	The Congress promptly snubbed Digvijay for choosing such an exceptional method of berating a senior cabinet minister. The partys chief spokesperson Janardan Dwivedi said everybody was free to raise an issue within the party, but not through the media.         
	But the ritualistic admonition has exposed the partys hypocrisy: Digvijay had chosen the same route  an article in the same paper  to criticise Chidambaram a few months ago.        
	While senior leaders such as Ajit Jogi and Mani Shankar Aiyar had given similar statements in the media earlier, others had been more discreet, choosing to express their grievances in off-the-record conversations.        
	Chidambarams revelation that he had offered to resign after taking responsibility for last weeks Dantewada tragedy had angered the majority of Congress leaders who felt the ministers indiscretion helped the BJP politically.         
	Digvijay appeared to echo the sentiment in his article. As far as law and order is concerned, the buck stops with the chief minister. In this incident, where was the state (the BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh) police? Why is the home minister taking the flak when it is the chief minister who should be answering the questions?         
	Digvijay argued that the Naxalite problem could not be solved without winning over tribals and said this could be done by implementing welfare schemes and changing forest and mining policies. What has happened to the historic, revolutionary pro-tribal legislation of Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (Pesa)? Would any state government gather the courage to empower the tribals through enforcing Pesa?, he asked. He pointed out that Chidambaram is a member of the Congress core committee, which can influence policies.        
	Digvijay has criticised the home minister on operational details, too, describing the failure to notice the movement of 1,000 Maoists in the Dantewada area before the attack on CRPF jawans as utter intelligence failure.        
	I havent understood why we are not trying to learn from the Andhra Pradesh experience of adopting pro-poor policies and closely targeting the Maoists leadership. In spite of the fact that Maoists central committee mostly consists of leaders from AP, particularly the districts of Khammam and Warangal, the state has been able to control the growth of Maoists in AP, Digvijay has written in the article.              
	He differed with colleague Aiyar  who felt corporate houses were exploiting the tribals and forest resources and, in turn, strengthening the sense of alienation  by pointing out that Maoists were protecting companies, contractors, miners and traders after taking money. Digvijay questioned the rebels political commitment, saying the BJP had been winning in Naxalite-hit areas by striking financial deals with the guerrillas.         
	The views are bound to trigger a wider debate within the Congress and it would be difficult for the government to push Chidambarams line, described by Aiyar as a one-eyed policy. It is ironical that the party has not debated the Naxalite problem at its highest forums, such as the Congress Working Committee, even once despite the confusion and dilemmas in dealing with the problem over the past few months.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Max Planck to launch unit in IIT
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Max Planck to launch unit in IIT

	New Delhi, Feb. 1: Germanys Max Planck Society, one of Europes most prominent basic research agencies, is launching its first centre in India to support a network of academic groups in cutting-edge research in computer science.         
	The Indo-Max Planck Centre for Computer Science (Impecs) will be launched this week at the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, with the participation of research groups at three other IITs and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai.         
	Impecs is expected to receive 4 million euros over the next five years, half of it from Indias department of science and technology and the other half from Germanys ministry of education and research and the Max Planck Society.         
	Were hoping to build a bridge for research and exchange of ideas between computer science communities in India and Germany, said Naveen Garg, a professor of computer science at IIT Delhi.         
	Garg will head the Impecs initiative together with computer scientist Kurt Mehlhorn, director of the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Germany.         
	The research groups supported by Impecs are already involved in diverse activities  from the search for giant prime numbers to new techniques to create more efficient electronic circuits for computers.         
	Were looking for algorithms (sets of instructions) that can quickly and reliably identify large prime numbers, said Manindra Agrawal, a professor of computer science at IIT Kanpur and an Impecs principal investigator. The search for large prime numbers is important for cryptography, a science that makes possible, among other things, safe online credit card transactions.         
	The Impecs initiative will support exchange of faculty and students at all levels  masters students, doctorate scholars and post-doctoral researchers  according to officials associated with the project.         
	The Max Planck Society is already supporting 14 partner groups  collaborative networks between individual Indian and German scientists  in India, but Impecs would be its first centre for collaborative research in the country.         
	The number of Indian research groups participating in Impecs will be increased over time from the current 6 to 10, said Garg.         
	The goal is to create a centre of excellence that not only engages in top-level research but opens up career opportunities for young scientists in India, said Peter Gruss, the president of Max Planck Society.         
	A project document for Impecs suggests that one of its objectives would be to expose Indian students to research in Germany and encourage them to pursue post-doctoral studies there.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Prince Mukarram Jah (in red fez). Picture by Vijayalakshmi                                  
	Hyderabad, March 18: Once he had 18 palaces but now fully owns just one. But the Nizam of Hyderabad has put even that mansion up for sale to try and clear his $10-million debts in Australia and Britain.        
	Prince Mukarram Jah is talking to three prospective buyers for the 101-year-old Nazri Bagh Palace in Hyderabad, where the eighth Nizam partially owns four other palaces too, one of his lawyers said.        
	The run-down heritage building once housed the durbar of the seventh Nizam, Osman Ali Pasha, and later became home to all his illegitimate children, the khanezad, according to lore.        
	Built by Osman in 1909 inside the King Kothi Palace complex where he lived, it lacks the architectural beauty of some of the others among the Nizams palaces but is known for its purdah gate  a huge curtain hung from an arch.        
	One of Jahs lawyers said the Nizam, who lives in London and Australia, was here last week to talk to three potential buyers: Rr Masala, MBS Jewellers and a Mumbai-based construction firm.        
	The offers are good but the market is low because of the Telangana agitation, he said. Industry observers said the palace, spread over five acres, ought to be worth at least Rs 350 crore, but might not fetch much more than Rs 150 crore in the current political situation.        
	Another problem is the buildings heritage status. Jah is yet to get the state tourism departments approval to sell the palace and, sources said, that may be holding the potential buyers back from finalising a deal.        
	Several city Congress MLAs and a state minister close to Jah are, however, said to have promised to help him sell not only the Nazri Bagh Palace but also several other properties.        
	City historian Narendra Luther said that given the poor condition of the palace, selling it off might just ensure restoration of the heritage building. The buyers apparently want to turn it into a heritage hotel.        
	The Nizam had himself acquired government permission to carry out repairs to the palace but had backed off after the builders said it would cost Rs 12 crore.        
	However, sources said the would-be buyers were pressing Jah to use his good offices with the state government to get the building struck off the heritage list. They fear that if the heritage tag stays, they will not be allowed to demolish and rebuild any portion of the building.        
	The last palace that the debt-ridden Jah had sold off was the Falaknuma  to the Taj Group of Hotels two years ago.        
	He has signed away portions of the Kilwat Palace, Purana Haveli and the Chiron Palace to former wives and descendants to settle alimony and property claims. He also partly owns the Chow Mohalla Palace, which is now a cultural centre that hosts exhibitions of Nizam-period costumes, furniture and antiques.        
	Bella Vista at Nampally houses the Dr Sarojini Naidu College of Fine Arts. Hill Fort Palace and Mahbob Mansion have been taken over by the government.         
	In 2002, the Hyderabad chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach), an NGO, had asked the government to ban the sale of any of the Nizams palaces.              
	That hasnt happened but the state government has authorised its tourism department to hang the heritage label on all buildings in Hyderabad that are over 100 years old.

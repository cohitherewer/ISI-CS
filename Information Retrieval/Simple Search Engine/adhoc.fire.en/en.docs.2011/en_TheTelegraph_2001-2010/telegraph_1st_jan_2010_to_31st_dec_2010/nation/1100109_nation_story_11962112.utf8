The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bangla Ulfa on officer lips
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bangla Ulfa on officer lips
          SUJAN DUTTA                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: Ulfa, which founded itself on the slogan Assam for the Assamese, now has a cadre that is largely Bangladeshi, according to the head of the largest counter-insurgency force in the Northeast.         
	More than 50 per cent of the lower cadre of Ulfa is from across the border, said Lt Gen. Karan Singh Yadav, director-general of Assam Rifles.         
	Bangladesh recently handed over Ulfa chairperson Arabindra Rajkhowa in a move that made the Indian security establishment happy. When Rajkhowa was taken to an Assam court, hundreds of people assembled on the premises in a demonstration of empathy.         
	But the observation that Ulfa is now recruiting Bangladeshis into its ranks threatens to ignite a tinder box.         
	First, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is due to visit India from January 10 and the Indian government is lining up thanksgiving gifts.         
	Second, the opinion of such a high-ranking officer who is clued into all the conflicts in the Northeast reflects just one of the inputs that goes into central policy-making on the region. So far, there has only been evidence of Ulfa leaders taking refuge in Bangladesh.         
	I can say, and this is my personal opinion, that Ulfa has degenerated into an extortionist organisation. It is unable to recruit cadre. I estimate that the hardcore element of Ulfa is about 200 (activists). But more than 50 per cent of the lower cadre is from across the border, the general said.         
	It is a great thing to happen  the handing over of Rajkhowa  but (Ulfa chief) Paresh Barua is still somewhere and we are looking for him, he said.         
	The generals statements drew sharp reactions. Hiranya Saikia, a member of the Ulfa-constituted Peoples Consultative Group, which had held a couple of rounds of talks with the Centre, said: It is a blatant lie. It is simply rubbish. People in responsible positions should think twice before speaking their minds on such sensitive issues.        
	Saikia said that in the 20 years of counter-insurgency operations in Assam, several thousand Ulfa militants had been killed and several thousand had surrendered. How many of them are Bangladeshis? he asked.        
	All Assam Students Union (AASU) adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya declined comment, saying that we would comment only after going through the statement. AASU had led the six-year-long movement to cleanse Assam of Bangladeshis between 1979 and 1985, when the Assam Accord was signed.         
	The influential students union even had run-ins with Ulfa over the Bangladeshi issue.

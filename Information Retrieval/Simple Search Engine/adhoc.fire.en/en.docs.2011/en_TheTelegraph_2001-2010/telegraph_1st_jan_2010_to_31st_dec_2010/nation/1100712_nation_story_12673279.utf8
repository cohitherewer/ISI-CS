                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CM gets Cong support to the hilt
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, July 11: The Congress has directed its Jammu and Kashmir ministers and MLAs to back chief minister Omar Abdullah to the hilt and thwart any attempt by the Peoples Democratic Party to destabilise the coalition government, official sources said.        
	Abdullah has the full support of the Congress, iterated a Congress cabinet minister, adding: It looks like the PDPs game is to paint him into a corner so that he resigns in a huff. Thats the last thing we want in such a crisis.        
	The mood in Delhi was that while Omar was a sitting duck in troubled times and easy to blame, the incidents took a predictable turn whenever the Amarnath pilgrimage was under way. Those who foment trouble know the troops concentrate fully on the yatra. So they strike.        
	The Congress hoped that the PDP would be isolated in its seeming attempt to make use of the volatile situation in Kashmir.         
	CPM MLA from Kulgam, Mohammed Yusuf Tarigami, and Independent MLA of Langate, Sheikh Abdul Rashid, welcomed the Prime Ministers call to the PDP leader on Saturday.        
	They hoped the PDP would put forth its suggestions in the Monday meeting. The BJP MLAs have also decided to participate in the talks. If the PDP boycotted it would give an impression that it had nothing positive to contribute, Langate was quoted as saying.        
	The Congress would persist in its attempts to tell Omar that notwithstanding the PDPs obduracy, he should have an open mind and continue to reach out to all, the sources said.        
	The Prime Minister is expected to keep an open house for all Jammu and Kashmir political representatives.        
	A government source added: There is no question of overt intervention by the Centre. We are monitoring the situation closely.         
	The Congresss Rajya Sabha MP from Jammu and Kashmir, Saifuddin Soz, will attend the meeting.        
	Asked how the government expected things to pan out after the meeting, the source said: We dont expect meaningful counter-suggestions to emerge. We will have to wait and watch and perhaps see this cat-and-mouse game playing out for a while.        
	The decision for Singhs appeal to Mehbooba was taken at a meeting of the Congresss core group on Friday.         
	The political options to deal with the situation in Kashmir dominated the agenda at the Congresss meeting that was attended by Singh, party president Sonia Gandhi, her political secretary Ahmed Patel and Union ministers Pranab Mukherjee, P. Chidambaram and A.K. Antony.        
	The Congress leadership wanted all mainstream political parties in the Valley, including the PDP, to help in the task of alienating the separatists and restoring normalcy.         
	On Saturday, Farooq Abdullah, Union minister and Omars father, called on Singh and the home minister separately and pleaded with them to help the chief minister to get things back on track. Singh also met Kashmir governor N.N. Vohra on Saturday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | N-deal hurdle down, ball in Delhi court
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      N-deal hurdle down, ball in Delhi court
          K.P. NAYAR                          Barack Obama                                  
	Washington, March 29: Indo-US relations, which have come under a cloud with crossed wires on access to terrorist enabler David Headley and Washingtons mollycoddling of Islamabad, today received a sudden shot in the arm when one of the last remaining hurdles in operationalising the nuclear deal was successfully crossed.        
	The US state department announced this morning that India and the US have taken an important step towards implementing their nuclear deal following the finalisation of arrangements and procedures for reprocessing US-origin spent fuel from nuclear plants in India.        
	The procedures fall far short of Indias similar arrangements with France and Russia, which have imposed no restrictions on transfer of enrichment and reprocessing technology in their nuclear deals with New Delhi.        
	The US will not provide any technology for reprocessing, but will allow India to use its own technology to do reprocessing of US spent fuel from plants to be set by American companies in India.        
	The reprocessing will have to be done under safeguards from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in dedicated facilities to be set up for this purpose.         
	There will be more than one such facility. That was one of the last sticking points in the protracted negotiations which began between the two sides after then foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon wrote to the Americans in February last year seeking talks on reprocessing under the terms of the nuclear deal.        
	The successful conclusion of the reprocessing talks increases pressure on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to push through in Parliament a controversial bill on civil nuclear liabilities in case of accidents at atomic power plants.        
	American companies will not sell nuclear power plants to India unless this bill limiting the liabilities of US companies becomes law.         
	The legislation was to have been introduced in Parliament last fortnight, but it was put off on account of all-round opposition to a provision capping the liability of these companies at a mere $450 million in cases of accidents.         
	There was also opposition to a provision that would make the operator of the plant and not the supplier liable for damages.        
	Singh wanted to show the Americans that there has been progress on the legislation by the time he arrives here on April 12, but that now seems unlikely even as US President Barack Obama will claim that the ball for the operationalisation of the nuclear deal is in Indias court.        
	The Americans have similar reprocessing arrangements only with Euratom, the European Unions atomic energy community, and Japan. India fought hard for reprocessing rights during the three-year negotiations with the Bush administration.        
	The Obama administration has been less enthusiastic than its predecessor in giving India reprocessing rights: it was expected that they would hold on to these rights until August, the deadline for completing the arrangements announced today.        
	But the disenchantment in Delhi over the Headleys plea bargain in a Chicago court, an agreement by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin this month to build 16 nuclear power plants in India and resentment in the political class in Delhi over US-Pakistan relations appear to have persuaded the White House that something major needed to be done to placate India before Singhs trip here.

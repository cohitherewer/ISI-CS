          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 24: An Indian who had gone to the US to lecture on Islam at a Hindu Mahasabha conference has been detained in Houston for possessing jihadi literature.        
	Malad resident Vijay Kumar was apparently sweating and fidgeting in queue at the Bush Intercontinental Airport on Friday so authorities thought he needed a second look. He raised the suspicion of behaviour detection officers. Thats what we have come to know from our FBI contacts, said a Mumbai police officer, who has worked with the FBI for the 26/11 investigation.        
	Anti-terror squad chief Rakesh Maria denied official intimation about Kumars arrest. I am categorically stating that we have not been officially intimated about his arrest, he said.        
	Today, a Mumbai anti-terrorist squad team visited Kumars Malad residence. For one, we now know that he was not attending any Islamic conference as stated in the complaint filed by US airport officials. He was in Houston to attend a conference of the Hindu Mahasabha where he had planned to speak on Islam and jihad. The Hindu Mahasabha has confirmed this to us, said a Mumbai police source.        
	At the Houston airport, when the security found what they said was tonnes of jihadi literature on Kumar, along with a pair of brass knuckles and literature on US military, his luggage was tested for presence of explosives. The first test came positive, but a second and third read negative, said the Mumbai police source. By then, Kumar was in detention on suspicion of being a terror suspect.         
	Airport security checked if he figured in the watch list for terrorists. He did not. They then booked him for carrying a lot of undeclared cash  in this case $8000, around Rs 3.7 lakh. But a Houston court dismissed the charge yesterday.         
	Kumar is still in a jail for carrying a prohibited weapon  the brass knuckles.

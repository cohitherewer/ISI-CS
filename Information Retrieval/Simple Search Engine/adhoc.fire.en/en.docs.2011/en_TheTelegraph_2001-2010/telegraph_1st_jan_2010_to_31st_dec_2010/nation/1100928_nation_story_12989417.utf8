The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre finds starting point in Valley
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Centre finds starting point in Valley
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 27: The Centre seems to have found the elusive starting point for engagement in Kashmir, sending students back to school despite a separatist leaders appeal to parents to keep children home.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram said parents had disregarded separatist hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelanis call, though he didnt name the Hurriyat hawk.        
	There was a call by one of the Hurriyat leaders to parents asking them not to send their children to school/college. Happily, parents have disregarded that call and sent their children to schools/colleges, Chidambaram said as he reached out to all sections of people, especially parents, to co-operate with the state government.        
	In a release, the minister said the government was happy to learn that most schools and colleges had reopened in Kashmir and voiced hope that those that remained closed, presumably out of caution, would open tomorrow.        
	Educational institutions, shut since June as unrelenting street protests claimed over 100 lives in the Valley, reopened this morning, two days after the Centre announced an eight-point initiative, including smooth functioning of schools and colleges, to bring peace to the Valley.        
	Attendance, however, was low as fear of militant attacks made many parents keep their wards home. But for the Centre, struggling to find an elusive starting point for a peace drive, the reopening of educational institutions was the toehold it was hoping for.        
	The starting point has taken more than a month to come, not the next few days as Chidambaram had told state police chiefs last month.        
	It is my hope that, in the next few days, we would be able to find that elusive starting point from where we could reach out to the protesters... and restart the process of dialogue that will lead to a solution, Chidambaram had said at that August 25 meeting.         
	Today, he focused solely on education, though he conceded there were incidents of stone-throwing at school buses. How can any right-thinking person pelt stones on school buses? he said, and hoped that such mischief would stop immediately.         
	Anyone who has the interest of the children at heart cannot indulge in stone-pelting; nor should anyone support such mischievous attempts to interfere with the functioning of schools and colleges, the minister said.        
	Sources said the government was tomorrow likely to announce Rs 100 crore as central assistance for educational institutions.        
	On its part, the Omar Abdullah government told the Centre efforts were on to ensure that all schools and colleges reopened and functioned normally. Chidambaram said Omar had assured the Centre that security would be provided to enable students to attend classes.        
	Sources in Delhi said by Thursday, the government was likely to announce the names of interlocutors for mediating with various groups in Kashmir as part of the eight-point initiative. There could be three or four interlocutors led by an eminent person, the sources added.        
	The sources said a decision had been taken on the release of political prisoners. They said 67 of the 80-odd prisoners might be released soon.

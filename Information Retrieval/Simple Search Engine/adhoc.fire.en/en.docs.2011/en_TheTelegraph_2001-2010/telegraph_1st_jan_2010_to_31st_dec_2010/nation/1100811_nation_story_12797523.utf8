          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: The US is watching Pakistans use of its military hardware supplies and is mindful of Indias concerns, a senior US defence official told Indian leaders during meetings here.        
	The US undersecretary for defence, Michele Flournoy, said here today that during her meetings with Indian government leaders in Delhi this week, the subject of pending defence co-operation agreements had also figured.        
	The undersecretary was in Pakistan before her visit here. Islamabad has requested the US recently for pilotless aircraft (the Scan Eagle and the Shadow) with the supplies for war against terrorists.        
	But New Delhi suspects that Pakistan is using US hardware to shore up its conventional military capabilities and for use in the event of hostilities with India.        
	The concerns were voiced by defence minister A.K. Antony during the visits of the chairperson of the US joint chiefs of staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, and earlier during the visits of the US national security adviser Gen. James Jones and defence secretary Robert Gates.        
	Antony is slated to visit the US next month.

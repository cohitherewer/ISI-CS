          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh before their talks at Hyderabad House in New Delhi on Tuesday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: More Russian arsenal, including jointly developed fifth-generation fighter aircraft (FGFA) and a nuclear submarine, are headed Indias way in addition to Units 3 and 4 of the Koodankulam N-power plant in Tamil Nadu but Moscows concerns over the Nuclear Liability Bill remain to be addressed.        
	Summing up the years last and probably shortest P-5 visit to India, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev paid high tributes to the time-tested ties between the two countries and committed themselves afresh to deepening the strategic relationship which is now a decade old.         
	This is a relationship we deeply value and one which will develop independent of our ties with other nations, Prime Minister Singh said, after a long mornings delegation level and one-to-one talks. Medvedev responded with a reiteration of Russias backing for Indias case at the UNSC when the decision to expand it is taken.         
	In this context, while India and Russia recognised Irans right to develop a nuclear programme for peaceful purposes, both nations called upon Iran to comply with the UN and the IAEA, the atomic watchdog, on its nuclear programme just as they called upon the leading nations to address the Iranian nuclear issue through dialogue.         
	The two sides said they were committed to build an international order that is inclusive and democratic, based on the supremacy of international law, and adhering to the goals and principles enshrined in the UN charter.        
	Before the two leaders spoke under an elaborate marquee on the lawns of Hyderabad House, India and Russia initialled a hefty catalogue of pacts  30 in all  on a wide range of issues from defence co-operation to trade to civil nuclear co-operation, information technology and space research.         
	Although no formal agreements were signed on specific nuclear projects, the Russians remain keen on the Haripur plant in South 24-Parganas, should local and political objections be overcome. Responding to opposition from locals and the Trinamul Congress, the government has been considering re-locating the facility to a site in Orissa. But sources said no final decision had yet been reached on this.         
	Sources on both sides sounded optimistic that concerns on the implications of the Nuclear Liability Bill will be sorted out and co-operation between the two will proceed unhindered.         
	We are already part of Indias civil nuclear programme on the technical side and we are positive our co-operation will expand in the time to come, a Russian official said.         
	Singh and Medvedev also exchanged notes on terrorism and regional issues, especially in the context of Afghanistan, which impacts both India and Russia. The summit-end joint statement not merely ticked off Pakistan for offering safe havens for terrorists responsible for Afghanistans instability but also endorsed Indias grouse with Islamabad, particularly post 26/11.         
	The two sides agreed that all terrorist networks must be defeated. They called upon Pakistan to expeditiously bring all the perpetrators, authors and accomplices of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks to justice, the statement said.         
	Asked at the joint press conference that followed the signing ceremony, Medvedev said, Terrorists are criminals and they should be treated as such. We are both victims of terror and we both feel that modern civilised nations cannot become havens for terrorists. Those who hide terrorists conceal criminals.         
	On the defence front, HAL and the Sukhoi Design Bureau have agreed to jointly develop FGFA; India is also seeking to enhance its Sukhoi and MiG 29 K (naval aircraft) fleets, agreements for which are in the pipeline. There has been some annoyance on the Indian side over repeated delays in the supply of a nuclear submarine, but New Delhi has been assured it will arrive by March 2011.         
	But the Russians clearly were looking at another aspect of bilateral ties that has long lagged behind: trade. Moscow is particularly disappointed that despite their long and friendly history, and despite the potential, trade turnover remains at $10 billion. Medvedev made a sharp point of it at the news conference saying he hoped to double that over the next five years.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: The Supreme Court today directed the Centre not to withdraw for now the deemed university status granted to 44 institutions, which together have nearly two lakh students, over alleged poor standards.        
	We shall not pass any ex parte (one-sided) orders, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Dalveer Bhandari said. They (the institutions) will be heard. No student or institutions interests will be affected, it added, issuing notices to the institutions to present their case and fixing the next hearing for March 8.        
	The institutions  16 of which are in Tamil Nadu  face de-recognition after a review committee report slammed them for poor performance and bad management. The panel said they were being run as family fiefs rather than on academic considerations.        
	Acting on the recommendations, the government had said on January 18 that it was planning to withdraw the deemed status to the institutions  which were among the 126 that had been granted such a tag amid much fanfare by former HRD minister Arjun Singh.        
	In todays hearing, several institutions objected to the manner in which the status, conferred on the recommendations of the University Grants Commission (UGC), was sought to be withdrawn on the basis of the report of the P.D. Tandon committee which, they argued, was a non-statutory body.        
	It is the UGC, a statutory body, which recommends whether such status is granted or taken away, said senior lawyer Rajeev Dhavan. It cannot be taken away on the recommendation of a non-statutory body, he said, speaking on behalf of one of the institutions.         
	Others pointed out that the 44 set to lose their status had received glowing encomiums from the UGC. The court then directed the government to produce the reports of the UGC, the Tandon panel and the task force set up to implement the Tandon committees proposals.        
	The hearing was marked by angry exchanges between attorney general G.E. Vahanvati, representing the government, and the lawyers of the deemed varsities. Vahanvati dubbed the clamour by the lawyers as cacophony, prompting senior lawyer Dushayant Dhave, representing another institution, to retort that it was not cacophony but anguished citizens grievance.         
	The din prompted the judges to step in saying: You are all senior counsel, please behave yourself. There has to be a limit. Dont test our patience.        
	According to the affidavit the government filed before the court, only 38 of the 126 institutions justify their continuation as deemed varsities. Another 44 found wanting in several areas would be given three years to make up their deficiencies or lose their status, it said. Institutions which stand to lose the status would be allowed to turn affiliates of local universities, the government said.        
	 Several institutions had violated guidelines prescribing excellence in teaching and research and were engaged in thoughtless introduction of unrelated programmes and proliferation of degrees beyond the original mandate, the government told the court in its affidavit.        
	The Tandon panel had found several aberrations in the functioning of the deemed universities. In some cases, families rather than experts controlled the institutions, it said.         
	Others charged excessive fees and took in more students than their infrastructure would allow, it said. There was also little evidence of any effort on the part of some of the institutions to focus on emerging areas of knowledge, part of the conditions.

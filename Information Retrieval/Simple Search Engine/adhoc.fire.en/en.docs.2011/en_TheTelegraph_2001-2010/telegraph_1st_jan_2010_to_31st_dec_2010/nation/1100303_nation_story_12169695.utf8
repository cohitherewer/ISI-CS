  - Utter helplessness of kids depicted on canvass          PRIYA ABRAHAM                                          Some of Jains paintings on display				                                       
	Bhubaneswar, March 2: Little faces, parched hands, and broken and bent bodies.        
	In Dont Scratch My Face, C.D. Jains solo show at Rashtriya Lalit Kala Kendra here, the 48-year-old artist takes viewers through a journey of joy, innocence, pain and abuse in a childs world.         
	Jain is probably the only Indian artist who has devoted his entire life to conjuring these images of childhood.         
	His works depict with great insight the utter helplessness of a child condemned to hard work and sexual abuse against the backdrop of those in power.        
	The exhibition of his paintings, which opened on February 24, bears testimony to the artists imagination of childhood  its joys and melancholy, its myriad hues and darkness, its hopes and despair  in canvasses that challenge the viewers get a heart for life and living.        
	His works with charcoal and mixed media build up the agony and anguish of children with an astounding intensity of emotion. As a person, I believe in the infinite possibilities of art to transform society. My rapport with children gives my work depth, which I have always dreamed of, says Jain.        
	The exhibition includes a series, Reminiscence of childhood sketches on my grandfathers canvas, which leaves an unforgettable imprint on the viewers mind.        
	Jain likes to introduce himself as a provoked artist and a child and explains that the exhibition is so named because of his rather wandering personality and his bumping into children with their faces scratched with stories of misery, hands depicting tales of hardship and bodies expressing neglect.

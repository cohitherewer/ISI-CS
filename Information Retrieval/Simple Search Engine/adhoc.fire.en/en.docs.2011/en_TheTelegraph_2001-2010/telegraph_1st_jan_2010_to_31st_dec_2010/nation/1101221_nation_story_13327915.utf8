The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Grassroots tip for Singh: stop aid to states
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Grassroots tip for Singh: stop aid to states
          SANJAY K. JHA                                          Delegates listen to Manmohan Singh rsquo;s speech on Monday at the plenary. (AFP)		    
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: The ordinary Congress worker has been hailed at the plenary. Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have saluted the foot soldiers, acknowledging their contributions to the partys success.        
	So it was time for the grassroots men and women to give the leaders the benefit of their earthy wisdom.        
	Sushila Tiria from Orissa had one advice for the Prime Minister: stop central aid towards welfare schemes to states that are taking all the credit.        
	Only for a few months please, she pleaded, so that the state governments lies were nailed.        
	Several other Congress workers from the states too got their chance to speak at the partys highest platform over the past two days. What was on their mind? Politics, politics and just politics. Their speeches on the economic resolution showed this most clearly.        
	While Madhusudan Mistri from Gujarat chose to rip into Narendra Modi for allegedly rigging the panchayat polls, Manjunath Bhandari from Karnataka asked why the Centre could not do something to check corruption in his state.        
	The workers, who bring in the votes, probably feel that the likes of Pranab Mukherjee can take care of arcane matters like the GDP and deficits while they themselves take the bull by the horns.        
	Common sense        
	P. Chidambaram revealed to the plenary that if you closed your eyes during Rahuls speech, you could hear echoes of Rajiv Gandhis voice. Not everyone was convinced, however, though the theory offers party leaders the perfect excuse to steal forty winks during Rahuls speeches.        
	On the Congresss centenary, Rajiv had made his famous Mumbai speech against power brokers. Rahul, during the 125-year celebrations, has puzzled many by saying: A common man is he who is not connected to the system.        
	Even some senior leaders were left tut-tutting about a definition that bundles technocrats, businessmen, day labourers and farmers together as the aam aadmi.        
	Samajh nahi aaya, the poor India-rich India analogy was better, a young Delhi leader was heard saying.        
	Some others, though, felt Rahul was maturing. There was a chorus of calls for his elevation, anyway.        
	With one exception. Manmohan Singh, who in many past speeches had hailed Rahuls leadership and invited him to join his government, remained silent on the subject. He, however, praised Sonias humility, commitment and clean image, repaying her for the compliments she has showered on him at the plenary.        
	Gastric goof        
	As the two-day plenary ended today, the managers emerged the villains of the piece. The sound system kept giving trouble throughout yesterday, and a food crisis kept many top leaders awake almost the whole of last night.        
	Having had almost nothing to eat through the day, a large number of party workers deserted the tents last evening and made it to the city for a proper dinner.        
	Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel took Delhi Congress chief J.P. Agarwal to task in the evening and asked chief minister Sheila Dikshit to take charge. The turf war continued till late night when Dikshit eventually took over the charge of food arrangements from one of her ministers.        
	Dikshit asked one of her loyalists at 3am to get a new contractor and deliver good food. The result: good arrangements, better food and brilliant service today.

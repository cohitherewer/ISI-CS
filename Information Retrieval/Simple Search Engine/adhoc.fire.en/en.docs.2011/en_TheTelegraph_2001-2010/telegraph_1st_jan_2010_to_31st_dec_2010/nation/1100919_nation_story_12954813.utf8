          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 18: Select government-run district hospitals may be expanded into medical colleges under a proposal by the countrys apex medical education regulator to rekindle the governments role in the training of doctors.         
	The Medical Council of India (MCI) board has said the government may set up new medical colleges within five kilometres of district hospitals and relaxed conditions for land requirements for such hospitals from 20 acres to 10 acres, a board member said.         
	The goal is to bring back government prominence in medical education. The growth in private medical education hasnt really been successful, the member said.        
	 Government hospitals are still seen as the best training grounds for medical education. Were hoping the new proposal leads to more government colleges.         
	The MCI board has also proposed that the age of retirement for faculty in medical colleges be raised from 65 years to 70 years.         
	India has a little more than 300 medical colleges that produce about 32,000 medical graduates each year. But board members believe India needs to significantly expand this number.         
	The number of seats in medical colleges would be determined by the size of the district hospitals. The larger the number of beds in the hospital, the greater may be the intake of students.         
	The MCI proposal also allows a binary campus  in which the hospital is located a distance within five kilometres from its associated teaching college.         
	The existing rules require a unitary campus containing both the hospital as well as the academic block and a land requirement of 20 acres.

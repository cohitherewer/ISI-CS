          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: Scientists in the UK have extracted a set of chemicals with antibiotic properties from the brains of cockroaches and locusts that can kill some of the most feared drug-resistant bacteria.         
	Preliminary studies indicate that the molecules found in the brains and the central nervous system of cockroaches and locusts are peptides that display anti-bacterial activity, said a researcher involved in the studies.         
	Researchers say they are not surprised by the discovery. Insects often survive in conditions where they are exposed to enormous loads of bacteria. Cockroaches, for instance, thrive along kitchen drains. The peptides with antibiotic properties may have emerged as part of insect machinery to protect themselves from bacteria.         
	It is essential for the survival of the insect that its central nervous system doesnt get damaged by bacteria, Simon Lee, a researcher at the University of Nottingham who is studying the peptides told The Telegraph.         
	In laboratory experiments, tiny bits of tissues of brains of these insects were able to kill 90 per cent of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, a type of drug-resistant bacteria that is very difficult to treat.         
	Lee presented the research findings at a meeting of the Society for General Microbiology in Nottingham on Tuesday.         
	Lees work extends research by his supervisor Naveed Ahmed Khan and his colleagues at the University of London who had shown two years ago that extracts from locust brains show powerful bactericidal effects against at least three species of bacteria.         
	But Lee cautioned that it could take years before such candidate molecules move  if proven to be safe  into the armoury of antibiotics. We have no information about the mode of action yet, Lee said.         
	Scientists will have to isolate the peptides, study them and demonstrate their safety as well as efficacy of their anti-bacterial properties in animals before any human trials can be considered.

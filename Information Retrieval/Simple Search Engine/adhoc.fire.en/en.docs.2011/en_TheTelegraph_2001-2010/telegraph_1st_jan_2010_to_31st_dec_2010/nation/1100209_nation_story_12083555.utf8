The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Applause and gimmick tag 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Applause and gimmick tag 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 8: The minority community today reacted to the 10 per cent quota in Bengal with statements ranging from encouraging to election gimmick to too little too late.        
	 The 10 per cent reservation is not adequate, considering the huge Muslim population in the state. It is just a drop in the ocean, said Abul Khair Mohammed Wadudur Rahman, a businessman in central Calcutta. Bengal has 2.02 crore Muslims, of which around 27 lakh are expected to benefit once three more communities are added to the list of 12 backward groups in the state.        
	Its too little and too late. The government should have done this a long time ago. What was it doing for the last 30 years when the community was suffering and being neglected? he asked.        
	It is just a gimmick before the civic and Assembly elections. The condition of Muslims is appalling in the state and the Sachar report has already proved it, said an official of the state minority department.         
	He said that the government had been in power over the past 33 years but did little for the community. This is their ploy which will fail miserably, he added.        
	But S.S.Z Adnan, the chairman of the West Bengal Minorities Commission, welcomed the governments decision. Reservation was the only way out to solve the problems in the community. This is a step in the right direction, he said.         
	He referred to the recent recruitment drive by Calcutta police in which only 11 Muslim candidates were selected out of 550.         
	We got several reports of discrimination in the past. Now I think a large section of people will benefit from the reservation. We were also in favour of it, the chairman added.        
	Tanweer Alam Mazhari, who teaches English literature at Ramkrishna Vidya Mandir at Belur Math, termed the reservation unconstitutional.         
	The Indian Constitution does not allow reservation on religious lines. This will create unnecessary tension between Muslims and other communities and will have its effect on social harmony.         
	 The government should not have acted like this. The move will result in backlash from other communities, he added.        
	But an IPS officer termed it a positive step, saying the government should try to implement it as fast as possible.        
	Giving reservation is not enough but what is important is how the government implements it. It should not remain only on paper as an election gimmick, he said.

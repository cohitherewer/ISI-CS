                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Prayer on lips, chaos at Kurla station
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 28: Chaos reigned at the Kurla railway terminus today as people with prayers on their lips scoured for information on relatives.        
	Young Sourav Datta was blurting out a mobile phone number before television cameras with a plea for information on his father. Saiful Gazi was hopping from one counter to another for a clue about his brother and nephews. Jaikumar Gupta was worried mad about his sisters in-laws.        
	Souravs father Kalyan Dutta was not reachable over the phone. And he was not on the first two lists of the injured that arrived here.        
	Gupta had been at the station since 8am, but he did not know till evening what had happened to his sisters mother-in-law Prerna Gupta and brother-in-law Harish. When The Telegraph spoke to him around 7pm, Prerna and Harish were no more.         
	I am at the airport, trying to reach Calcutta but there are no tickets. Private airlines are charging Rs 22,000 for a ticket to Calcutta. How can I afford that? The government should at least arrange for our travel, an angry Gupta said.         
	Saiful Gazi traced his brother Waheed to a hospital near Midnapore town. But Waheed did not know where his children  Rakhib-ul Gazi, 8, and Meena Khatoon, 10  were. Central Railway gave free passes to Gazi for the Shalimar Express that left Kurla around 9.30 tonight.         
	Maoists kill 3        
	Suspected Maoists shot dead three persons, one of them a woman, and left their bodies on a road about 8km from Jhargram today. Villagers identified the men as Haren Mahato, 45, and Rohit Mahato, 42, but could not recognise the woman. The CPM said the two were its supporters.

	New Delhi, Jan. 28: The human resource development ministry is mulling a proposal to extend up to Class XII a policy of grading Central Board of Secondary Education students instead of awarding marks, HRD minister Kapil Sibal said today.         
	We are examining the proposal. A committee has been set up to evaluate how realistic the proposal is and how it can be implemented, Sibal said.        
	The proposal is not new and Indias education policy for over two decades has focussed on shifting from marks to grades. But Sibals keenness to initiate reforms and the formation of a panel to examine the proposal could provide fresh impetus to the idea. The CBSE has already introduced grading till Class X. Students are graded on a nine-point scale.

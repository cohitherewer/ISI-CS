          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 3: India today said it was building an anti-satellite system to nullify and destroy spying enemy satellites, taking its competition with China to new heights.        
	India is putting together building blocks of technology that could be used to neutralise enemy satellites operating in low-earth orbits, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) director-general V.K. Saraswat told reporters at the Indian Science Congress here.        
	China had demonstrated its anti-satellite technology three years ago by using a ground-based missile to destroy one of its ageing weather satellites. The move attracted international criticism since it revived memories of the star war between the US and the erstwhile Soviet Union.        
	Probably we will never use or test the system, Saraswat said. But he added that its development could act as a deterrent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US does Headley homework for trip
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US does Headley homework for trip
  - Obama tells intelligence boss to review all information gathered on 26/11 suspect        K.P. NAYAR                          Manmohan Singh with Hillary Clinton at an Asean summit meeting in Vietnam on Saturday. (PTI)                                         
	New Delhi, Oct. 30: US President Barack Obama has asked his intelligence czar, the director of national intelligence, to conduct a comprehensive review of everything the American intelligence community knew about the activities of terrorist enabler David Coleman-Headley from start to finish in order to salvage Washingtons counter-terrorism co-operation with New Delhi.        
	Such co-operation has been strained ahead of Obamas visit to India by Union home secretary G.K. Pillais charge two days ago that the government was disappointed that information about Headley was not provided by the US before the November 2008 terrorist strike in Mumbai and that we could have nabbed him here in March 2009 if Washington had shared all it knew about the US citizen now in jail in Chicago.        
	Our director of national intelligence has ordered a review, a full review of everything that we knew related to the Headley case, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told Indian correspondents in Washington today.        
	Rhodes excused the lapse on the grounds that there is a vast amount of information within the US intelligence system. And the nature of the kind of information that we received in this instance from Headleys ex-wives, again, was of a more general nature and would be in that category of, again, many pieces of intelligence that are collected.        
	It would appear from the argument by Rhodes that the intelligence failure in the US in this case was similar to the intelligence failures in the American administration which failed to pinpoint the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington although there were many straws in the wind about al Qaidas planning.        
	The post of director of national intelligence was created by the George W. Bush administration precisely to break the firewalls that existed among multiple American spy agencies and pool all available information within the intelligence community in cases such as the one involving Headley.        
	We want to find exactly  given the importance of this case  let us get all of the facts completely together as best as we can. And when we have that information, when that review is completed, it is certainly something that we will share with the Indians, as well, in the spirit of the co-operation and partnership that we have, Rhodes assured Indian correspondents.        
	Although he said the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, who has been on the job only since August, ordered the review, other sources in Washington said it was Obama who directed Clapper to do so because of White House concerns that a slanging match between Pillai and the US ambassador to India Timothy Roemer over Headley was vitiating the atmosphere in the run-up to the US presidential visit to Mumbai where Obama will participate in several events in memory of the victims of the November 2008 attack.        
	Rhodes insisted that if we had had information that could have helped to prevent the attacks or pinpoint specific aspects of the attacks (of November 2008), we certainly would have shared that, too. The fact of the matter is that the information that we had before 26/11 was not of that nature. It was more just  far more general and far less specific.        
	It is an indication of how seriously the White House is taking Indian suspicions about the US in the Headley case that the deputy national security adviser went to great lengths to rationalise Washingtons actions in the handling of this case.        
	However, after we picked up Headley, we did learn a lot about 26/11. Not only did we share that information, but I think it is a signal of the strength of our counter-terrorism cooperation that we actually provided access to Headley for the Indian security services so they were able to ask him questions directly, which continue to flesh out the understanding of what took place on 26/11, he added.        
	Anish Goel, senior director for South Asia in Obamas National Security Council put a positive spin at the briefing that this case sort of highlights how far our counter-terrorism co-operation has come in the past couple of years, and the fact that we have more initiatives going with them (Indians) than we ever have before.        
	And that we gave access to Headley I think sort of demonstrates how we kind of view this issue basically in the same perspective as the Indian government.        
	Geoffrey Pyatt, deputy assistant secretary of state for South Asia in the state department, an old India hand, complained at the briefing about skewed media coverage in India about Obamas visit.        
	There have been many, many gallons of ink spilled writing about this visit in India, but the thing I havent seen enough attention to is about this visit in the wider Asian context. It is not a coincidence that this visit to India comes at the front end of a very important swing through Asia.        
	He emphasised that the US has a powerful interest in Indias rise as a more consequential player in the international system. It (is) in the US interest for India to be emerging as a true global power.        
	As if to pre-empt a media frenzy over Kashmir during Obamas visit, Rhodes said this India-Pakistan dispute left over from Partition is certainly not in the first tier of issues that we are addressing during the presidential stay in New Delhi. I dont want to elevate the issue because it is not.        
	Rhodes said the Obama administrations position on Kashmir is that it is an issue to be settled bilaterally between India and Pakistan.         
	There has been some dialogue between India and Pakistan in recent years. That is a dialogue that we are supportive of. But it is very much our position that the US cannot impose that dialogue on the two countries. It is not our position to say we are going to determine an outcome to this issue (or that) we are going to oversee some trilateral dialogue, for instance. But instead, what we are going to do is say that we welcome and support efforts by the Indians, Pakistanis to talk to one another.

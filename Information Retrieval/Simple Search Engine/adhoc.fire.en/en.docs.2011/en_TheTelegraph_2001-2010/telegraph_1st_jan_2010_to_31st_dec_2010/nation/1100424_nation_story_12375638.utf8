          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, April 23: The woman IPS officer who was L.K. Advanis security escort on Babri demolition day repeated before a Rae Bareli court today that the district administration had intelligence that kar sevaks might try to pull the mosque down.        
	The defence today began its cross-examination of Anju Gupta, whose March 26 testimony has raised the possibility that conspiracy charges may be revived against Advani over the December 6, 1992, demolition.        
	Gupta said the then zonal inspector-general of police, A.K. Saran, had met senior Faizabad district officials on December 5, 1992, and quoted central intelligence agencies to say the kar sevaks might demolish the mosque.         
	She had said this in her earlier testimony too.        
	Gupta, 45, now with external intelligence agency RAW, denied defence lawyers claim that she and her husband, fellow IPS officer Safi Ahsan Rizvi, had been given plum postings in the Union home ministry because she had agreed to testify against Advani.        
	The defence asked her whether there was intelligence that operatives of Pakistani spy agency ISI had reached Ayodhya to damage the disputed structure with explosives or by any other method.         
	She said Saran had mentioned an ISI threat but this was in the context of what the kar sevaks might do and how the ISI might take advantage of it.        
	(The) threat from Pakistans ISI was mentioned by the IG, but he said there was a serious threat (at the) local level and there was a strong possibility that they (the kar sevaks) may attack and demolish the structure, she said.        
	Gupta was cross-examined for over three hours, after which the court fixed the next hearing for April 29.

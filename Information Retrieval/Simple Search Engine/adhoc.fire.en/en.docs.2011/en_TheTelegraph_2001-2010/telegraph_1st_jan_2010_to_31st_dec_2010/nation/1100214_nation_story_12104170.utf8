          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                          Gauri Khan with her daughter outside a Mumbai multiplex where   My Name is Khan was screened on Saturday. (PTI)      
	Mumbai, Feb. 13: The dust settling over My Name is Khan, Gauri Khan finally caught a show of her husbands film, 10-year-old daughter Suhaana in tow.        
	The film released yesterday after days of uncertainty with Mumbaikars defying the Shiv Senas threats and making a spontaneous beeline for the theatres. Gauri had spent much of yesterday meeting and thanking Shah Rukh Khan fans at a Mumbai multiplex.        
	Today, she and a bunch of gal pals, including daughter Suhaana, stepped into the INOX multiplex at Nariman Point for the 2.50pm show.        
	An INOX source said: They picked up popcorn and Sprite from the food counters before stepping into the theatre. We were not selling any food or beverages yesterday because of security reasons, but today we decided to run everything as normal.        
	Gauri Khan insisted on Sprite when the group picked up their food and beverages  her friends kept teasing her saying IPL was far off.        
	Sprite is currently the drink the Khans pick up in public because of Kolkata Knight Riders association with the brand. Shah Rukh is a co-owner of the cricket team.        
	After watching the screen saga of Rizwan Khan and Mandira, Gauri, who is also the co-producer of the film along with Karan Johars mother Hiroo, went and visited Shah Rukh fans watching MNIK at the Metro Big Cinema close by.        
	What is a better way (to celebrate) than saying Jai Maharashtra. We love Mumbai and Shah Rukh is really excited and will be coming to the cinemas tomorrow to meet his fans, she told reporters.        
	Jai Maharashtra is a popular slogan with political parties of all hues in the state.        
	Shah Rukh, currently in Berlin, is expected back in Mumbai tonight.        
	The tamasha over the films release seemed to have petered out in the state with all theatres in Maharashtra screening it today.        
	The collections, though, have been less than expected for a Shah Rukh-starrer on the first day  whether in the crucial Mumbai circle or across the country.        
	Though distributors Fox STAR is yet to release the official figures, trade experts agreed that the films total domestic collections were lower than Aamir Khans blockbuster 3 Idiots.        
	The Day One collections for 3 Idiots in the domestic circle was Rs 14 crore.        
	My Name is Khan is estimated to have grossed around Rs 8 crore from across India on Friday. Of this, Bengal accounted for Rs 75 lakh.         
	The northern circle comprising Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab grossed the highest with Rs 3 crore.        
	The crucial Mumbai circle, expected to yield 35 to 45 per cent of a big flicks revenue, coughed up just Rs 1.5 crore, primarily because the film didnt have a full release yesterday.        
	Today, tickets were being sold on the black market at a 15 per cent premium. Over 300 prints have been released in Maharashtra, of which Mumbai alone has 65.        
	The collections are expected to go up as the cloud of Shiv Senas threat on the film seems to have moved, said Dilip Dhanwani, a Mumbai distributor.        
	The film also released today in Nashik, Pune, Aurangabad, Jalgaon and other parts of Maharashtra where it had not been screened yesterday.        
	Eternity Mall in Thane, the place where the Shiv Sena agitation had begun, too screened the film today after yesterdays no-show.        
	Sources said chief minister Ashok Chavan was mulling a felicitation for Shah Rukh.        
	Sena chief Bal Thackeray again ridiculed Chavan over the unprecedented state security provided for the film.        
	If he (Chavan) is a bodyguard, then he should don a security personnels uniform and stand outside Khans Mannat bungalow and salute passersby, he said.        
	Sena leader Sanjay Raut said his partys agitation was still not over.        
	Nearly 3,000 of our cadres are in police lockup. We are waiting for them to rejoin us. Wait and watch what happens after that, he said.

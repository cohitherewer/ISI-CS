          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A burnt motorcycle in Balitutha village after the clash on Saturday                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 17: The situation in the proposed Posco project area in Jagatsinghpur district remained tense today as anti-plant protestors dug up all roads leading to the area, preventing police entry.        
	We fear that the police will enter Dhinkia and unleash a reign of terror to forcibly evict the villagers, said Prasant Paikray, an activist of the Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti.        
	The police have sealed the roads and are frisking all vehicles entering the area, said Jagatsinghpur superintendent of police S. Devdutt Singh. Around 25 platoons of armed police had been deployed in the area to prevent untoward incident, he added.        
	Meanwhile, a BJP parliamentary team, led by Rajya Sabha member from Orissa, Balbir Punj visited Balitutha, site of Saturdays clash between police and anti-Posco protesters, today.         
	We talked to the people and felt that there were police atrocity and human rights violations, said Punj, adding that they would draw attention of the National Human Rights Commission.        
	The state Congress, too, has constituted a fact-finding team headed by its president K.P. Singhdeo.

          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: The Centre is preparing a dossier on developments in telecom during the NDA regime to counter the BJPs propaganda on corruption in the allocation of 2G spectrum.        
	Congress sources said the new telecom minister, Kapil Sibal, might come out with full facts one of these days, explaining how the policies and decisions of the BJP-led NDA government prepared the ground for irregularities in the telecom sector.        
	This is part of the Congress leaderships action plan to retrieve the ground lost in the battle of perceptions in the wake of scandals related to the Commonwealth Games, Adarsh Housing Society and the 2G allocation.         
	The party is rattled as a whole session of Parliament has been wasted for the first time and an impression was created that the government was wallowing in the mire of corruption.         
	Having taken the first step of handing over the sensitive telecom portfolio to Sibal, the Prime Minister has apparently decided that the portfolio will not be given to the DMK again.        
	Sources said the CBI raids on former minister A. Rajas house and those of his aides were part of the damage-control exercise. DMK chief M. Karunanidhi had already been taken into confidence to avert any immediate political fallout, the sources added.        
	The Congress has already launched an offensive on the NDA, pointing out that the loss to the national exchequer owing to suspect policy decisions taken earlier, too, was worth thousands of crores.        
	Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari released some documents dating back to the NDA period to buttress the contention that contractual obligations were violated repeatedly by NDA ministers to allocate extra spectrum and reduce licence fees.        
	These are not notional losses like in the 2G spectrum but governments own estimates, Tiwari said, asserting that the BJP did not want a debate in Parliament only to escape this disclosure.        
	The Congress spokesperson said the party had compiled enough evidence to expose the BJP but it was waiting for a debate to take place in Parliament. Now that there is no chance of a debate, we will release these before the nation, he said.        
	The documents released by Tewari had purported signatures of former telecom ministers Pramod Mahajan and Arun Shourie, in addition to notings by senior officers, suggesting that the source of the papers was the government.

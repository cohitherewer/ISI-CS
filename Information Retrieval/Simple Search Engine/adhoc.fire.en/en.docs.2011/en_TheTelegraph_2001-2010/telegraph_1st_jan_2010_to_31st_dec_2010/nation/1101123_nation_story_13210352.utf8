                          Mamata lights the inaugural lamp at the film festival as Yash Chopra and Ajay Devgn look on in Panaji on Monday. (PTI)                    
	Panaji, Nov. 22: Mamata Banerjee got mistaken for Ambika Soni but thoroughly enjoyed her brush with the glamour field as she inaugurated the International Film Festival of India here today.        
	Mamata confessed her English wasnt very good but didnt allow that to cramp her style, and let the glitterati around her make all the goof-ups.        
	This is a real occasion for me. This festival has a beautiful blend of all the cinema, from Bollywood to Tollywood, from regional, national and international there is a beautiful blend, she said, speaking extempore.        
	She admitted: I dont know the good English. I can speak whatever I feel.        
	The railway minister wondered about the actresses size-zero figures: Sometimes I feel, how they look so nice but how they maintain is no joke.        
	She was unfazed after guest of honour Ajay Devgn addressed her as minister for information and broadcasting, the portfolio held by the ailing Soni whom Mamata had replaced as chief guest. The Trinamul Congress chief thanked Soni for giving her the chance.        
	When Ambikaji told me, I thought, My goodness, I cannot do this  because I thought I wont be able to match them as my field is different. I started from grassroots and now I am in the glamour field. I dont know whether I will manage to do it or not but I said, Okay, let me attend this, she said, drawing giggles.        
	Mamata marvelled at everything about the movie world. I really love the film industry. It is very difficult. It is not a matter of joke. The actors and actresses really do a tough job. They cannot even take their food as they are always dieting, dieting, dieting.        
	When veteran filmmaker Yash Chopra complained about the taxes, she promised to take it up with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Yash Chopraji is right. There is too much taxation. I must pursue the matter with Pranabda because the matter is related to the finance ministry. I will certainly talk to Pranabda. I will mention all the details.        
	Actor Devgn took the dais briefly and read out from a note  which was perhaps why he made the mistake, for Soni is a regular at the festival and usually inaugurates it. Apparently unaware of his howler, he hurried back to his seat.        
	Actress Gracy Singh, who was anchoring the event, made serial bloopers and often forgot her words, much to the crowds enjoyment. Co-host Aftab Sivdasani tried to help her but Gracy continued to mix up names and tried to cover up her mistakes with giggles and smiles.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Blast costs bakery casual charm
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                      The bakery after the blast                          
	Pune, Feb. 18: German Bakery will open its doors very soon, its menu and ambience unchanged. But no longer will it be a casual place, the blast has ensured that.         
	Security will be much tighter, we have learnt our lesson. It will no longer be as casual as it used to be, said Smita Kharose, 39, the current owner of the legendary caf started by a German, Indophile Klaus Woody Gutzeit, in 1987.        
	Klaus is in the Himalayas now. He left in 1995 as he could not stand the increasing levels of pollution in Pune. He spent some time launching another similar bakery in Goas Anjuna beach. Then he sold it off and went off to the Himalayas  he keeps travelling in the hills and wants to spend the rest of his life in peace. But he was very concerned after learning about Saturdays blast and called to find out how we were, said Smita.        
	Smita married Nanu Kharose in 1989 and moved to Pune. Nanu ran the caf with Klaus and the couple took it over after the German got bored of Pune and left.        
	When Nanu died of a heart attack a decade later, Smita was left holding three kids and the bakery.        
	Along with her partner Gokul Kharki, 50, she turned the caf into the gastronomic destination it was till Saturday.        
	Gokul, who is originally from Payuntar in Kathmandu, has been staying in India for the last two decades. He runs a handicraft business in Goa besides the Pune eatery.        
	Since Saturday I have desperately tried to reach our (Nepal) embassy officials in Delhi between attending to my injured staff members in various hospitals. All except four lying in Sassoon Hospital with serious injuries have been discharged, he said.        
	Gokul said he even called the Calcutta consulate, but got no response.        
	Gokul, who lived in the same building which housed the bakery, had gone to the local market at the time of the incident and rushed back around 7pm after hearing the explosion.        
	Gokul had gone to the market and I was out with my daughters as it was a Saturday. I got a call from him about 7.30pm about the blast. When I rushed back, the bakery was gone. There were police barricades and flesh and blood splattered all around. The police did not let me go in. I was so worried for my waiters who were injured. I kept crying remembering our waiter Gokul Nepali who died. The boys are like my children, said Smita.        
	All the 15 waiters at German Bakery hailed from Nepal. The four injured Nepalese waiters recuperating at Sassoon Hospital have been identified as Manish Shrestha and Pravin Panta from Nuwakot, Ganga Magar from Bara district and Paras Rimal, whose address is deliberately unlisted for security reasons.         
	All of them have been admitted with second and third degree burns.        
	We saw the whole place burn down, our patrons burnt alive, our staffers killed and injured. What harm have we done to anyone that they targeted this peaceful place? But we will raise it again, promised Gokul.

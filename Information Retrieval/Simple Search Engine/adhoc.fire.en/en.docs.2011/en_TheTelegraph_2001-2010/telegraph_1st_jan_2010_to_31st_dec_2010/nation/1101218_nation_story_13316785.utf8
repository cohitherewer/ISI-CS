The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress to seal lips on coalition 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Congress to seal lips on coalition 
  - Bihar debacle and Parliament deadlock dull go-alone sentiment before plenary          SANJAY K. JHA                                                   
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: The Bihar debacle and the hostile political climate might force the Congress to take a middle path on the coalition issue and give Rahul Gandhis ekla chalo line the miss in the plenary beginning here tomorrow.         
	The anti-coalition sentiment perceptible in the one-day AICC meeting last month has almost been buried now, sources said.         
	Although Sonia Gandhi and Rahul will both exhort party workers to strengthen the Congress across the country, they are likely to avoid advocating the go-alone line. The political resolution, too, is expected to avoid the issue.         
	Sources said there was a possibility that the Congress president would indirectly refer to the need for a coalition by saying the party should take steps to strengthen secular forces in the country to fight communalism.         
	At the AICC meeting last month, Rahul had said: I have travelled in this country for the past five-six years and understood two things: one, only the energy of the poor can build this country, and two, only the Congress can govern this country.         
	Without commenting on other parties or allies, the general secretary continued: Only the Congress is a pan-India party. All other parties are based on caste, religion, state or region. People told me the Congress is dead in Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu. This party can be awakened very easily. Go, reach out to the poor and work for them, the Congress will be alive.         
	Sonia had said then: We should try to rejuvenate our party with a renewed vigour. We have alliances in the states and at Centre with a few parties and we respect them. But that does not mean we will abandon our own political space for them or stop strengthening our party there.        
	 This was seen as a subtle message against coalition politics and senior leaders said it was clear that the Congress would now on work towards establishing its own rule.         
	Since then, however, the corruption charges over the Commonwealth Games and spectrum allocation and the unprecedented paralysis of Parliament by the Opposition have affected the mood in the party, forcing a go-slow.         
	A Congress leader said: Positions taken by the party will be more or less the same as the stated policies and expecting any substantial diversion would be unreasonable. No new direction is going to be there and the party will traverse the old route only.         
	At the AICC meeting, Sonia had left out the corruption issue  an omission that is not likely to be repeated.         
	Sonias speech will take a strong stand against corruption, sources said. The Congress president will stress the urgent need to purge the system and also try to expose the duplicity of other parties on corruption.        
	Both her speech and the political resolution will make a forceful mention of communalism, reminding the nation that the threat had not receded only because the BJP had been thrown out of power.         
	The plenary will also highlight the welfare schemes and legislation introduced by the Congress-led alliance since its first term in 2004, including the employment guarantee scheme and right to information and education laws.         
	The party will claim that its schemes have changed Indias face and helped the government fight poverty, inequality and corruption. Sonia will lay emphasis on the inability of the party organisation to exploit the government initiatives to gain political advantage and win elections.         
	Sonia is unlikely to set such lofty goals as Mission 2012 for reclaiming Uttar Pradesh but she will highlight the need for hard work in the election-bound states. She will stress on unity and discipline in the party and the need for keeping organisational interests above personal interests.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will in his speech concentrate on the governments performance and achievements.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee will speak on economic resolution and Rahul will be the main speaker on the political resolution.

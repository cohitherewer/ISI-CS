                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mumbai imposes tax on IPL, one-dayers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 20: Indian cricket boss Sharad Pawars home state today imposed a 25 per cent entertainment tax on all Indian Premier League matches played within the Greater Mumbai region.        
	The levy, which also applies to ODIs, comes as part of measures taken by Maharashtras Congress-Nationalist Congress Party government to increase revenues from entertainment tax.        
	The government has not charged any tax on cricket matches so far and, therefore, we have taken this decision, chief minister Ashok Chavan said.        
	A government spokesperson added: International Test matches would be excluded from the levy. For One-Day Internationals and IPL 20-20 matches played in the jurisdictions of municipal corporations other than Mumbai, a levy of 20 per cent would be imposed.        
	In Bengal, the entertainment tax kicks in only if the revenues reach a certain amount, which no IPL match in Calcutta has attained.        
	The Maharashtra BJP tried to claim credit for the state governments decision.        
	We have been demanding this since IPL Season One in 2008 after the government lost crores in revenues because of the tax exemption granted to the tournament. Todays decision is a victory for us, BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said.        
	The cabinet also cleared entertainment tax of Rs 50,000 per month on permit rooms (bars) with live orchestra in the Greater Mumbai region. The tax will be Rs 25,000 per month in other municipal corporations areas, and Rs 15,000 per month elsewhere in the state.

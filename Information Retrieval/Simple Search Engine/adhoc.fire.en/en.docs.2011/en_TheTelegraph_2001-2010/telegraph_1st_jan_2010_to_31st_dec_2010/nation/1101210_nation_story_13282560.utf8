The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Probe blow to Prasar chief 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Probe blow to Prasar chief 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           B.S. Lali                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: President Pratibha Patil today gave her assent to a Supreme Court inquiry into charges of financial mismanagement against Prasar Bharati CEO Baljit Singh Lalli, setting the stage for his removal.         
	The Central Vigilance Commission had in a report indicted Lalli of financial mismanagement, breach of parliamentary privilege and giving undue favours to private broadcasters.         
	He has also come under a cloud for Doordarshan granting a UK-based firm the contract to cover the Commonwealth Games. Recently, Prasar Bharati employees had struck work protesting Lallis alleged autocratic ways.         
	Members of all political parties, including the Trinamul Congress, welcomed the Presidents assent. Lalli, 63, has been Prasar Bharati CEO since December 2006 despite bitter disagreements with its board, now headed by journalist Mrinal Pande.         
	In its report dated July 16, 2010, the vigilance commission had established five out of seven allegations on which inquiry was conducted, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha last month.         
	The allegations were related to management of advertisement revenue earned from the telecast of cricket matches on Doordarshan in 2007, Doordarshans non-telecast of the T20 World Cup held in South Africa in September 2007, hiring expensive lawyers to represent Prasar Bharati, purchase of radio broadcasting rights by AIR for 13 cricket series in 2007-09 at higher rates, and hiring transport and accommodation for the Commonwealth Youth Games at Pune in 2008.         
	The CVC has held CEO Prasar Bharati to be responsible in respect of four of these allegations, Soni told the Lok Sabha.         
	On receipt of the vigilance commission report, the ministry had asked Lalli for his reply in accordance with the Prasar Bharati Act. The law says the chairman or a board member can only be removed by an order of the President on the ground of misbehaviour after the Supreme Court holds an inquiry. The member (executive) is the chief executive. Pending an inquiry, the CEO can be placed under suspension.         
	This is the first time a CEO of Prasar Bharati is being sought to be removed under the law that came into force two decades ago.         
	Lalli, however, remained unfazed and said the Supreme Court inquiry would bring the true picture to the fore.         
	At long last, due focus would be given to facts rather than conjectures, half-truths and plain lies, he said in a signed statement citing his nearly 40 years of unblemished service in the IAS. The 1971 batch officer said he derived comfort from the fact that he would finally be heard.         
	Lalli said he did not want to reply to every charge. Available record clearly and unequivocally sheds light on the transparency, good faith and sound commercial judgement in respect of all these matters. Judicial scrutiny, I am sure, will also show that fallacious interpretation of relevant provisions of law and rules was made to arrive at certain conclusions and that presumptions and prejudice held the field while the facts on record were not even acknowledged, he said.         
	The Shunglu Committee is looking into allegations relating to the CWG coverage and Lallis role in the grant of contracts to Britains SIS Network allegedly without following the due process.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cambridge course for khaki
          AMIT ROY                                        
	London, March 13: Giving a suspect a good thrashing to extract a confession is out; encounters when prisoners are shot in the back while escaping is out; and trampling over forensic evidence at the scene of a crime is also out.        
	These are some of the basic principles of good policing that will be imparted to 420 Indian police officers by Cambridge under a 2.4-million programme signed in Hyderabad between the universitys Institute of Criminology and the National Police Academy of India.        
	Working in groups of 140, the police officers  mid-career staffers but considered leadership material  will receive training and lectures in India from the programmes co-directors, Lawrence Sherman, the universitys Wolfson Professor of Criminology, and Sir Ian Blair, the former Scotland Yard Police Commissioner.        
	As head of Scotland Yard, Blair had to deal with growing terrorism, including the devastating attack on Londons Underground and bus transport by home-grown British Muslims. How to gather intelligence and tackle terrorism without alienating Britains 1.6-million-strong Muslim population is the challenge the police continue to face.        
	Indian police will be told that interrogation must at all times be law based  torture is out as is intimidation of minority communities.        
	Indias great advantage, as Cambridge dons see it, is that it is a democratic society. In the long run, policing can only work if done with the consent of society at large, they point out. Sherman said: This agreement represents the steady integration of the science of criminology with the profession of police leadership, following the path laid out at Cambridge in 1959 by the universitys first Professor of Criminology, Sir Leon Radzinowicz.        
	The most agreeable part of the programme will be the two weeks the Indian officers will spend in Cambridge. It is understood the programme will begin later this year.        
	It is unclear why the magical number of 420 was chosen  perhaps it reflects the Indian sense of humour  but the selected officers will be drawn from the elite 3,500-member Indian Police Service. The idea is to ensure that when they get to the top jobs, the values they hopefully pick up during the programme will be passed on by osmosis to the 2-million-strong Indian police force.        
	Cambridges Institute of Criminology was picked by the Indian government following an international competition which involved tenders from a number of other universities from the UK, the US, Australia and India.         
	It will provide the training in partnership with Cambridge Executive Education, the executive training arm of the universitys Judge Business School. Working in collaboration with the UKs National Police Leadership College at Bramshill, the institute has educated more than 30 chief constables in the UK.        
	It is acknowledged that conditions in India are very different from those in the UK and that Indian police are not always trusted by members of the public, especially if they come from the bottom rungs of society. Cambridge recognises that part of the problem is that the police in India have been viewed as instruments of oppression right from colonial times.        
	It will really be wonderful if UK, via Cambridge police programme, can bring something back now that helps to reduce such problems, Professor Friedrich Losel, director of the institute, told The Telegraph.        
	The professor displayed optimism and typically dry Cambridge humour: That the Indian police services have commissioned such a course is an indicator that they are open and willing to improve their services and according to western, democratic, liberal standards. If you wanted to make torture more perfect, you would not appoint people from Cambridge to train mid-career students in policing.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Going to CM rally? Beware of travel risks     CPM fears in own bastion
          OUR BUREAU                          Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in Rajarhat on Sunday. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	Calcutta, Nov. 21: When the chief minister holds a rally in traditional CPM stronghold North 24-Parganas, its time to tremble in fear  for the CPM.        
	A party circular today asked supporters to exercise the utmost caution while travelling to the venue, located between Rajarhat and Sashan, to avert attacks by the Trinamul Congress. Avoid bikes or open vehicles and travel cautiously in groups, went the message.        
	We had to issue the circular because of the terror unleashed by Trinamul goons in the Sashan area, district CPM secretary Amitava Bose told The Telegraph.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee addressed the Left Front rally at the Langalpota ground near the 211 bus stand, 4km from Sashan, a former CPM fief where its cadres are now locked in armed battle with Trinamul.        
	If inviting Bhattacharjee was part of the CPMs efforts to boost cadre morale and effect a turnaround in the district, the circular probably sent the opposite message. It was, however, in keeping with the look of the venue  there was just one picture of the chief minister and that, too, had been put up by Trinamul.        
	The poster blamed Bhattacharjee for the bloodshed in the state and asked him to go back.        
	The entire Rajarhat Road, though, was plastered with welcoming posters  showing housing minister and local leader Gautam Deb who skipped the rally. So did land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah and district secretariat member Majid Ali, the local strongman who is also known as Majid Master.        
	CPM leaders had earlier announced that both ministers would be present. Today, Bose said: They were preoccupied elsewhere.        
	Party sources said the ministers had deliberately stayed away to show their disgust at the infighting in the North 24-Parganas unit.        
	Majid Master, on the other hand, had been asked not to come for fear that Trinamul goons may attack him, said Dum Dum MP Amitava Nandy. Majid Master is our strongman in Sashan but he is being targeted by Trinamul goons. So, we asked him not to attend todays rally.        
	The CPMs dwindling fortunes in the area were also reflected in the way the rally, scheduled for 2.30pm, had to be delayed by at least 45 minutes because of a poor turnout.        
	At 2.30, there were hardly 500 people on the ground that can hold one lakh. Even at 3.30pm, when Bhattacharjee arrived, the crowd had grown to hardly 15,000.        
	Leaders such as Nandy, Rabin Mondol and Mortaza Hossain kept requesting the audience to sit close together, apparently to try and present the picture of a successful rally. Most of the rallyists came from Barrackpore, Belghoria, Nimta, Dum Dum and Patipukur.        
	Nandy said many supporters could not come because of threats from Trinamul goons.         
	The rally had originally been planned at Sashan, but the police advised against it citing security concerns.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, March 31: A newly wed couple were gunned down in Punjab allegedly for marrying against their families wishes on a day a court in neighbouring Haryana sentenced five men to death for an honour killing.        
	Nineteen-year-old Prabhjot Kaur had gone to appear in her Class XII examinations accompanied by her husband Pardeep Singh, 40, when they were attacked yesterday.        
	Two policemen, provided following a Punjab and Haryana High Court order last year, were overpowered and some 20 bullets fired as the young woman stepped out of the senior secondary school in Patti town and walked up to her husband.        
	About 20 rounds were fired at the couple. Before anyone could realise what was happening, the assailants escaped (in a car), said senior superintendent of police Sukhdev Singh Brar.        
	According to the police, Prabhjot and Pardeep had been receiving anonymous threats since marriage last year.

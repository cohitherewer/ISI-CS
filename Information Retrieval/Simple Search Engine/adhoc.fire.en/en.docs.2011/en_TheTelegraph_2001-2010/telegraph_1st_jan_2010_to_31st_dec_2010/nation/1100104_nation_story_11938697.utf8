          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Jan. 3: The Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) report portraying the Bihar governments miraculous turnaround story has given the state reason to celebrate.         
	The CSO report described Bihar as the second fastest growing state with its gross domestic product recording a growth of 11.03 per cent, a shade behind Gujarat  where the GDP grew by 11.05 per cent.         
	The CSOs observations have categorically proved now that our claims about the states growth is true and the Opposition has no moral right whatsoever to point fingers at our functioning, deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi said.        
	The deputy CM, explaining the praise as a miraculous turnaround in the states economy, said: The Lalu-Rabri regime had spent Rs 25,000 crore in development activities in its 15 years of power.         
	The Nitish government has spent Rs 35,000 crore in infrastructure building and other development activities between 2005 and 2009, Modi, who is also the states finance minister, said.         
	The CSO report is the manifestation of the hard work and good governance by the NDA government, he added.        
	The deputy CM also pointed out that the state had recorded a negative growth rate during 2003-04.         
	The states GDP had grown by 5.15 during 2003.04 when the Lalu-Rabri regime was at the helm, he remarked.

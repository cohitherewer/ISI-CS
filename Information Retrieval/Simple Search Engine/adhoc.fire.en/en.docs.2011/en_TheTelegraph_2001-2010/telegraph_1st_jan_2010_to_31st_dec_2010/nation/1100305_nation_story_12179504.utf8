The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | With fee bait, IIM awaits NGO managers 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      With fee bait, IIM awaits NGO managers

	Bangalore, March 4: The big daddies with the mega-bucks have begun shopping for the best and the brightest at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM-B) here, but the B-school itself has popped an offer which none has taken so far.         
	The institute is offering a refund of fees to those shunning high pay packets to work in not-for-profit entities such as NGOs for at least three years.        
	P.D. Jose, chairperson-placements at IIM-B, said the refund offer has been in place for the past two months, the move aimed at encouraging graduates to look at socially relevant sectors.        
	But there are no takers, yet, at the institute where annual placements began today. No applications have come to me, Jose said.         
	The placement season goes on for about two weeks, he pointed out, which means that the students still have time to consider the offer.         
	The institute currently allows students wanting to start entrepreneurial ventures to defer placements by two years.         
	The refund offer, however, comes with a rider: the salary offered by the NGO should be a certain percentage of the lowest CTC package bagged by a graduate at IIM-B.         
	This clause ensures that a job with some high paying international NGOs such as the Clinton Foundation wont qualify for the offer, a fear expressed by some at IIM-Ahmedabad.         
	The Bangalore school proposes to refund about 30 per cent of the fees every year in each of the three years the graduate works in the NGO. Currently, the fee for a two-year postgraduate course at IIM-B is around Rs 11 lakh.        
	Nothing is written in stone really, said Jose, explaining that the initiative was more an experiment open to changes. The refund at the moment is not a very big figure, he pointed out. We dont really have to worry about it, Jose said.        
	The defence could come in handy to deflect criticism from some quarters that the institutes should not waste taxpayers money invested in training would-be managers.         
	The IIMs at Ahmedabad and Calcutta, part of the revered trinity of B-schools, said they were so far not considering any such proposal.         
	IIM-A director Sameer Barua said it was too early to respond on the merits of the decision, but the matter was open to discussion. But there are too many grey areas which need clarity, he added.        
	Some faculty members at IIM-A described the Bangalore decision as bold and laudable. At the moment I can only tell you that we are discussing it and a number of professors support this idea, said Anil Gupta, a professor.         
	A source in IIM-C said the institute does not have any established rule to refund the course fee to those students who take up an NGO job. We do not have any such plans right now, the official said.         
	Last year we invited some NGOs for placements as some students showed interest in working in that sector. Similarly we are inviting some film making and film production companies for the final placement this year, said Prafulla Agnihotri, chairman, career development and placement, at the Calcutta institute.         
	An NGO insider, however, didnt find much merit in such a proposal.         
	If the student opts out of the NGO job after a couple of years and joins a fat-salaried job, this course fee will become a bonus for him, he said.         
	An IIM-B alumnus said there was a rising trend among his peers to opt for NGOs and the voluntary sectors, though their number was still small.        
	The social sector is not different from any other. It needs professional skills, said Rakesh Godhwani, head of IIM-Bs alumni association who left his corporate job to work for the institute.        
	Management gurus said fresh graduates who wish to work in the development sector should look at it as a career, rather than as a three-year stint.        
	Very few opt for such careers because most youngsters join IIMs with a corporate career in mind, said Samuel Paul, who runs Public Affairs Centre, an NGO, in Bangalore and is a former IIM-A professor. They want to move up in life. The vast majority still stick to corporate ambition.        
	It is more conviction than the money part that drives those who opt for a career in the social sector, he said. Whether by exemption you will encourage, we have to wait and see. It has not been tried out in a big way anyway, Paul said.         
	Students echoed Paul. Apart from the students who have an interest in this sector, the best ones do not usually go for the NGO sector. And they do not care about the refund as the salary they bag is high enough, said a student at IIM-C.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 20: A pilot survey will be launched next month to assess the number of the poor in the country on a new set of parameters ahead of the scheduled BPL census in April 2011.        
	The government has decided to launch the pilot project in 260 villages across the country to test the parameters suggested by a former Planning Commission member amid a debate on the best way of doing such counts.        
	The project, the first such trial count to be launched in the country, will cover four villages in every agro-climatic region, said an official with the rural development ministry, which helps conduct the exercise.        
	The N.C. Saxena Commission had advocated automatic exclusion and inclusion of certain groups and grading households on a scale of 1 to 10.        
	Under the exclusion criterion, the committee had listed the categories that should not be on the BPL list.         
	This includes families who own double the farmland (partially or wholly irrigated) of the district average per household, those with three or four wheelers and families with at least one farm equipment such as tractor, power tiller, thresher and harvester.        
	The inclusion criterion listed the groups that should automatically find a place on the BPL list. In this category are designated primitive tribes, households headed by a single women or minors, families where a disabled person is the breadwinner, homeless families and destitute households predominantly dependent on alms. MahaDalits, a Scheduled Caste category said to be the most discriminated against, are to be included, too.        
	We will be corroborating the results of the pilot study with the National Sample Survey Organisation survey and a rural appraisal to ensure accuracy, said the ministry official. Once the census is done, BPL individuals will be assigned a number by the Unique Identification Authority of India, he added.        
	Over the past two decades, BPL censuses have been held in 1992 (for the Eighth Five-Year Plan), 1997 (for the Ninth Five-Year Plan) and 2002 (for the Tenth Five-Year Plan). The rural development ministry provides financial and technical support to states to conduct the census, held generally at the beginning of a five-year plan.        
	The poverty count is significant as it forms the basis for issuing BPL cards. The cards, in turn, are required to obtain benefits under the governments poverty alleviation programmes as well as gain access to cheap foodgrains from the public distribution system, subsidised health insurance and even scholarships.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Glider threat in Canada daily
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Glider threat in Canada daily
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          G.K.Pillai      
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: Home secretary G.K. Pillai has said the Lashkar-e-Toiba has bought 150 paragliders from China and Gulf countries in recent months, which could be used to launch airborne attacks on Commonwealth Games venues and visiting athletes.        
	The home secretarys comments to a Canadian newspaper, The Toronto Star, could not have come at a worse time for the Games Organising Committee, which is already swamped with questions from participating nations over the dengue situation in Delhi.         
	Pillai could not be contacted on Thursday to verify the statements attributed to him.         
	In its report, the newspaper has termed Pillais comments remarkable.         
	A senior Indian official made the remarkable claim that Islamic militants from Pakistan have been buying up paragliders that could be used to launch airborne attacks on athletes, tourists and visiting politicians at the Games, the report said.         
	Its very worrisome, Pillai was quoted as telling the paper. Because paragliders dont require a runway, they could launch them from anywhere.        
	Security forces are being advised of the threat and snipers would be prepared to shoot down unknown objects from the sky, Pillai said. He did not elaborate on what proof the government has about the glider purchases.         
	Yesterday, the US state department issued a travel advisory to its citizens, warning them about a possible terrorist strike in Delhi during the Games.         
	The travel alert that expires on November 15 has asked US citizens to monitor future travel alerts on safety and security issues in Delhi. However, the travel alert added: The US government has no information on any specific threat of attack that any individual or group is planning to coincide with the Games.        
	Australia had issued a similar advisory to its citizens on Tuesday.        
	But more than fears of a terror attack during the Games, most visiting athletes and tourists are concerned about the dengue scare.        
	At least 24 participating countries have inquired about the dengue situation, said sources in the organising committee. Some countries have asked their athletes not to take their families with them to India during the Games.         
	As many as 1,000 cases of dengue have been reported in the city.

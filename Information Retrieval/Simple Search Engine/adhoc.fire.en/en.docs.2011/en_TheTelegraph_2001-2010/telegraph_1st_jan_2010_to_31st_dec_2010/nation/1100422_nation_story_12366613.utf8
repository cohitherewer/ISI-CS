          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, April 21: The hunger for votes is forcing leaders to quench voters thirst in poll bound Bihar.        
	The MLA from north Bihars Sakara, Bilat Paswan, had got only 25 hand pumps installed in his constituency from his MLA fund in four years. Now, he has recommended setting-up of 1,000 hand pumps and already sanctioned the money from his MLAs quota.        
	Bilat said: For the past two seasons, residents of my constituency have gone thirsty, So, this year, I am making all efforts to ease their water woes.        
	But, a public health engineering department official, requesting anonymity, said: He (Bilat) has become hungry for votes in the poll year. Thats why he is out to quench the thirst of people. He knows that thirsty residents will not vote in his favour.         
	Kudhani MLA Manoj Kushwaha and Jhanjharpur MLA Nitish Mishra, who had got 15 and 21 hand pumps installed in their respective constituencies in four years, have sanctioned funds for 700 and 375 hand pumps, respectively, this year.        
	Kanti MLA Ajit Kumar, however, has broken the record by sanctioning over 1,100 hand pumps.        
	The MLAs are entitled to a fund of Rs 1 core per annum to carry out development work in their constituencies. Contractors alleged that several MLAs asked for a cut of 30 per cent on their funds and release the rest for projects.        
	But now they fear that voters might ask for an account, said Anil Pathak, the vice-president of the citizens council.         
	The water table sank due to severe drought last year causing drinking water problems in most parts of the state. With pre-monsoon rains missing so far, the state is already in the grip of a heat wave.         
	RJD chief Lalu Prasad also raised the issue of dry rivers leading to drinking water problems in Bihar during question hour in the Lok Sabha today.

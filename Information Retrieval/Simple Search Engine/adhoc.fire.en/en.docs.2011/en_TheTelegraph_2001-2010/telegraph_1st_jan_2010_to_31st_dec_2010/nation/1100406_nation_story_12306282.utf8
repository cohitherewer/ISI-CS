          JAYANTA BASU                               
	Calcutta, April 5: The Bengal government has said it will provide all support to Bangladesh in a campaign to make the Sunderbans one of the new seven wonders.        
	The assurance to Bangladesh forest minister Hasan Mahmud came from Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	Mahmud, who is in Calcutta to attend a workshop on the Sunderbans, said: The campaign is already in full swing and Bangladesh can organise about 5 crore votes but without Indias  and especially Bengals  support, a win for the Sunderbans cannot be assured.         
	At least 11 crore votes would be needed to ensure that the Sunderbans beats the Amazon rain forests to the list of seven to be released next year.        
	Bhattacharjee said NGOs could play an important role in securing the votes of people through the Internet and phone and the state government would support the effort. He also said the central government should support the campaign.         
	Asked about the Sunderbans campaign, Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh said yesterday: We will definitely support the idea once a proper plan is mooted.         
	Bengal environment minister Sailen Sarkar said: We will shortly make a blueprint along with other relevant departments and NGOs will play an important role in garnering the votes.

          K.P. NAYAR                           Hardeep Singh Puri at the UN. Jay Mandal/ On Assignment                                  
	New York, Oct. 13: In the end, only three countries in the world voted against Indias elevation to the UN Security Council for a two-year term beginning on January 1, 2011.        
	The voting system and pattern in the spectacular election in the UN General Assembly yesterday, in the final analysis, offers curious insights into the outdated, perhaps obsolete, ways of the world body in the 21st century when electronic voting is the norm almost everywhere from India to Venezuela or from the US to Japan, both in their legislatures and in their general elections.        
	At the UN headquarters yesterday, when permanent representatives of 191 countries gathered to elect five new members to the Security Council, they were each given three sheets of paper all stapled together the way Indians were given out ballot papers in the first general election in 1952.        
	The UN has 192 members, but one country did not bother to turn up at all for the important vote.        
	On the first of the three stapled pieces of paper, was printed Africa and Asia and below that two blank lines. For some reason, perhaps going back to the era of decolonisation, Africa and Asia are clubbed together in the election to the Security Council, but it is an understanding in the General Assembly that one of the two seats will be filled by an African state, the other by an Asian state.        
	Which explains why one of the three countries which voted against India actually wrote the name of Swaziland, instead, for the Asian seat. Since the voting is secret, it cannot be known who picked Swaziland, but whoever did, obviously wanted both these seats to go to Africa.        
	The second of the three countries which cast their lot against New Delhi voted for Pakistan, which had already endorsed Indias candidature within the Asian group, and was not a declared candidate in yesterdays election.        
	As exclusively reported by this newspaper yesterday, Pakistani diplomats showed their ballot paper around after filling in Indias name on the first sheet of paper, so it was not Islamabad which voted for itself.        
	One of the 191 countries present did not bother to cast its vote in any of the three rounds of elections yesterday. Therefore, the effective votes in the General Assembly were 190 out of which India secured 187 votes or a very rare 99 per cent support.        
	The popular perception is that member countries usually send some of their most experienced and senior-most diplomats to the UN as permanent representatives.        
	But UN officials who conduct elections in the General Assembly, the UN Economic and Social Council or the Human Rights Council do not take the erudition of these ambassadors or even their common sense for granted.        
	Ion Botnaru, director of the General Assembly Division of the UN, the key official in charge of the elections, told UN correspondents in a pre-election briefing that if General Assembly delegates write more names than of countries allowed in, say, the Latin American group, then such a vote becomes invalid.        
	But if one ambassador yesterday wrote Indias name on the second sheet of paper which was for the West European and Others Group or WEOG  instead of on the first sheet where he wrote only one name, that vote for India would be valid, Botnaru said.        
	The intention is clear, he explained, but the entry was only made on the wrong page.        
	The third sheet of paper yesterday was for the Latin American seat, which Colombia won uncontested although it did not have the formal endorsement of the Group of Latin America and Caribbean Countries unlike India and South Africa, which had the unanimous approval by the Asian and African groups respectively.        
	Yesterdays voting was smooth except that some ambassadors did not know where to deposit their ballot paper for a manual count. One or two ambassadors had to be helped by others to fill in the countries of their choice.        
	But Botanru recalled that in 1979, there were 155 rounds of voting with the General Assembly going through the long tedious process of filling up ballots and tabulating the results from October 26 all the way into the next year, till January 7. Eventually, Mexico got the two-thirds vote, which is mandatory even if the group to which a country belongs unanimously endorses that country.        
	In a more recent contest four years ago, Venezuela and Guatemala fought for the Latin American seat through 48 rounds. Eventually, both states withdrew and Panama was elected uncontested.        
	The rules and paperwork involved in the election of Security Council members are so cumbersome and voluminous that Indias Election Commission may be relieved that their lot is not much worse considering that the General Assembly involved merely 192 voters this year.        
	In addition to the paperwork, this year, the General Assembly also had to pass a special resolution authorising all the 192 countries to take part in yesterdays election.

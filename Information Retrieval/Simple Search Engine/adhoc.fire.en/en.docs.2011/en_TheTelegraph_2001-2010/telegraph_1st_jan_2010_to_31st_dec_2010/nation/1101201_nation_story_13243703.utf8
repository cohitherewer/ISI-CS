	Today is World AIDS Day. A message from Preity Zinta, the goodwill ambassador of UNAIDS: Stigma and discrimination because of ignorance about HIV is a big deterrent for people who need to access services.... In this day and age in our country, we must stand up and say that discrimination is unacceptable.

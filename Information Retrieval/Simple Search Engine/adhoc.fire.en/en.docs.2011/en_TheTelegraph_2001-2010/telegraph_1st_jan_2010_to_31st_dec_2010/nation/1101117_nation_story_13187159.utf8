The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court glare on PM telecom silence

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: The Supreme Court today questioned the Prime Ministers silence and alleged inaction in deciding Subramanian Swamys plea for sanction to prosecute former telecom minister A. Raja.        
	Hearing two petitions on the 2G spectrum allocations, a two-judge bench wondered why it had taken the CBI 11 months from the date of the complaint to file an FIR in the case. It then targeted Manmohan Singh for his alleged inaction in deciding the Janata Party chiefs plea.        
	Why was there a delay of 11 months in the CBI filing an FIR? Justice G.S. Singhvi asked after the government said Singh had only deferred taking a decision on Swamys plea till the CBI probe was over.        
	Justice Asok Kumar Ganguly took exception to the language of Singhs letter. He could have just said yes or no (on the basis of the material before him). He is the highest constitutional authority. But saying that the plea is premature means denying a citizens right to seek sanction (for prosecution of corrupt officials).        
	Singhs letter had said that Swamys demand for sanction was premature as the CBI was still probing the case.        
	A court can take cognisance of a case against a public servant under the Prevention of Corruption Act only if previous sanction has been awarded by a competent authority. In the case of a minister, the competent authority is the Prime Minister.        
	At the last hearing, the court had slammed the government for allowing Raja to continue as minister despite the CBI probe and the allegations against him.        
	Earlier, Swamy argued that the government was bound by rules to take a decision on any plea for sanction within three months.        
	But Singhs reply in March this year came 16 months after he had written to him. Swamy said if Singh had immediately taken a decision, he could have moved court in appeal. But no decision was taken for a long time.        
	At this juncture, the bench asked the government counsel, solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium, to explain the delay in filing the FIR and Singhs alleged inaction.        
	Subramanium said though the government had to take a decision on any sanction within three months, it could be deferred if a probe was on.        
	But the bench rejected his arguments. Dr Swamys pleas are not vague assertions, it said.        
	Justice Singhvi also sought the governments explanation on the award of 2G license to Swan Telecom Limited, a wholly-owned unit of Anil Ambanis ADAG, in violation of rules.        
	The bench, which has yet to issue notices to Singh on Swamys petition, asked the government to reply on Thursday, the next date of hearing.

	New Delhi, Sept. 6: The Congress today endorsed the Prime Ministers view that the Supreme Court should not go into the realm of policymaking.        
	Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said: There are limits of judicial review.         
	The Congress also echoed the Prime ministers views on party-government co-ordination, saying: There was no difference, not even the slightest of difference of views.        
	Singhvi said Singh was doing an excellent job, denying any pressure on him to retire.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shivraj springs Nehru surprise
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shivraj springs Nehru surprise
  - Bjp chief minister pays homage to former pM          RASHEED KIDWAI                                                  
	Bhopal, Nov. 14: BJP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan today surprised foe and friend alike by paying tribute to Jawaharlal Nehru on his birth anniversary.        
	Chauhans gesture of garlanding Nehrus statue in Bhopal comes at a time temperatures have risen between the Congress and the BJP-RSS following former sarsanghchalak K. Sudarshans attack on Sonia Gandhi.        
	On October 31, too, the Madhya Pradesh chief minister had garlanded a statue of Indira Gandhi in Bhopal to mark her death anniversary.        
	Such moves are unusual for BJP chief ministers, and both the recent acts of homage were firsts for Chauhan since he assumed office in 2003. State Congress chief Suresh Pachauri declined comment on the matter.        
	However, Chauhans move to honour another former Prime Minister  the BJPs Atal Bihari Vajpayee  on his birthday has angered the Congress. Chauhan has triggered a BJP membership drive, named after Vajpayee, that looks to enroll past beneficiaries of state-run social schemes. Sources said the chief minister hoped to add up to 50 lakh members to the state BJPs rolls by December 25, Vajpayees birthday.        
	These past beneficiaries are apparently being methodically identified by looking up government records relating to dozens of welfare programmes, such as the farmer credit card scheme and the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Upchar Yojana.        
	Chauhan himself had launched many high-profile family welfare schemes, providing insurance to the girl child, wedding funds to poor brides, and rewards to couples who followed the two-child norm. He now wants to cash in on these schemes politically.        
	The deputy leader of the state Opposition, Chaudhury Rakesh, is crying foul. How can the poor and vulnerable who sought the states help... be in a position to say no even if they do not wish to subscribe to the BJPs political ideology? he said.        
	He said many of the state-run schemes received substantial funds from the Centre. It is unethical and misleading to convey to the beneficiaries that the BJP government alone funded these measures.        
	Senior BJP minister Kailash Vijayvargiya, however, said: There is no coercion or pre-condition. Its just that we need to reach out to everyone

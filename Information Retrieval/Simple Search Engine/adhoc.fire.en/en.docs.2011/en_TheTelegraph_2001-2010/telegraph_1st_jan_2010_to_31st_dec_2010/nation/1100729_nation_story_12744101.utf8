                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lalu dares Cong to arrest Modi
          J.P. YADAV                              
	New Delhi, July 28: Lalu Prasad has dared the Congress to lay hands on Narendra Modi.        
	Amit Shah to chuza (chick) hai. Broiler murgi (Narendra Modi) ko pakdo. Congress me dum hai to Narendra Modi par haath dale, Lalu Prasad thundered.        
	Everybody knows that a junior minister works under direction from his senior, the Yadav leader said. But I am sure the Congress will not lay its hands on Modi, he added.        
	Sources said the challenge was part of a strategy worked out by Yadav twins Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh to resurrect the ghost of the 2002 riots in the hope of striking a chord among Muslims.        
	Sources in Lalu Prasads RJD said the Congress was going after Shah with an eye on Muslim voters in poll-bound Bihar.        
	Both Lalu Prasad and Mulayam are facing a resurgent Congress on their home turfs, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Despite their efforts, the Congress has spurned their overtures of alliance and chosen to contest alone in these states.        
	Lalu Prasad said he would not spare the BJP either. He said he would revive memories of the fodder scam to target the ruling BJP-Janata Dal (United) in Bihar. Who has misused the CBI more than the BJP-JD(U) combine? They got the agency to petition the army to arrest me, he said.

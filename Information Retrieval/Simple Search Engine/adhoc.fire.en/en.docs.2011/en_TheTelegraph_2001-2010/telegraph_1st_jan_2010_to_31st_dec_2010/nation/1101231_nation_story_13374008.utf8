	Jaipur, Dec 30 (PTI): The Gujjar community, which wants five per cent job reservation, held the second round of talks with the government today after which the two sides said that the negotiations were moving in a positive direction.         
	The meeting was held amicably and the community is ready for the next round of talks. We have requested all of our public representatives including MP Sachin Pilot and state minister Jitendra Singh to discuss the issue with the community here, and then a collective decision will be taken regarding the time and venue of the next meeting, Roop Singh, a close aide of Gujjar leader Kirori Singh Bainsla, said.        
	Although Singh said the talks were heading in a positive direction, he maintained that the community will continue to block the rail tracks till the matter is resolved.         
	Gujjars are satisfied on several other matters but the five per cent reservation issue is yet to be resolved, G.S. Sandhu, principal secretary of the urban development, said after holding the meeting.        
	We have given them nine points and they after discussing them with their people who would decide about the next meeting, he said.        
	Earlier in the day, a Gujjar delegation met government emissaries and discussed their demands including compensation to the family of those killed in the past agitations, withdrawal of cases against protesters, and sought assurance from chief minister Ashok Gehlot and other leaders on the issue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pranab pat for Mamata
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pranab pat for Mamata
          ARCHIS MOHAN                      Pranab Mukherjee                          
	New Delhi, June 2: Yesterday, Pranab Mukherjees office had told journalists not to expect him to comment on the poll verdict. He was apparently too busy preparing for the G20 finance ministers meeting in Busan, South Korea, for which he was to leave late tonight.        
	However, by this morning, Mukherjee had relented. He gingerly approached the journalists who had gathered outside his office at North Block around 9am.        
	 His change of heart seemed to have been caused mostly by media reports about a secret Congress-CPM deal to stop Mamata Banerjees juggernaut.        
	The reports had said Mukherjee and CPM leader Sitaram Yechury had discussed this deal when they met yesterday.         
	Theres no question of any deal with the Left in West Bengal. I had no talks with Sitaram Yechury on a post-poll alliance in West Bengal. Mr Yechury met me, but it had nothing to do with the elections, Mukherjee said.        
	The clarification had probably become necessary to leave the door open for a Congress-Trinamul alliance for next years Bengal Assembly elections.        
	I will like to congratulate Mamata for her excellent performance both in Calcutta and also in the districts. I accept the failure of the Congress to come up to the expectations we had and I accept the verdict of the people with all humility, Mukherjee said.        
	Till the final results come, it will be difficult to say what has been the net loss or net gain, but we have done badly... there is no doubt (about) that.        
	Mukherjee had, at a campaign rally in Ranaghat, warned Mamata not to repeat CPM general secretary Prakash Karats mistake of dumping the Congress. The Trinamul chief had earlier alleged that the Congress was colluding with the CPM to undercut her partys prospects.        
	Some of Mukherjees aides kept asking journalists about the results in Ranaghat, a former Congress stronghold, where Trinamul has won because of a mass crossover.        
	Mukherjee remained incommunicado for the rest of the day, busying himself with preparations for his South Korea trip. His office refused all requests for interviews.        
	An aide said: Pranabbabus job will be so much easier in trying to strike an alliance with Trinamul for the Assembly polls. There will be no unreasonable demands from Congress workers.

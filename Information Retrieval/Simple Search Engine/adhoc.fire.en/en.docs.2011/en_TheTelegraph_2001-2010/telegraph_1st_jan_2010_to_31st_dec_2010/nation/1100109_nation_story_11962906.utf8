          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, Jan. 8: An Infosys employee hailing from Calcutta has been suspended by the company after he was arrested last week for allegedly tormenting a minor girl working in his house in Bangalore.         
	Pallab Chakravarthy and his wife Sinchita were arrested on December 29 after a non-government organisation complained that they were tormenting the girl, aged around 15, by pouring hot oil on her back, beating her with a rolling pin, making her work long hours and not giving her enough food.         
	We are upset and pained to be informed that an Infosys employee has been charged and remanded in judicial custody for child abuse, said a company statement.        
	After being informed about this incident, Infosys immediately placed Pallab Chakravarthy under suspension, pending an internal investigation, the statement said.         
	A police officer said Pallab, in his early thirties, was a software engineer and had joined the firm only a couple of months ago.         
	The couples arrest came after an anonymous caller tipped off the NGO, the Association for Promoting Social Action (Apsa), about the alleged harassment of the girl, who is also from Bengal.         
	The girl had to get up at 4.30am every day, clean the house, wash utensils, look after the baby and help in the kitchen, said Apsa director Sheila Devaraj.        
	Discharged from hospital, the girl is now in a childrens home run by Apsa.        
	Pallabs bail application will come up for hearing next week.         
	His wife Sinchita was released last Friday. The couple have a three-year-old child, the police said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Talks fail to cheer Posco optimists
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Talks fail to cheer Posco optimists
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 5: A three-hour meeting this afternoon could hardly break the steely resolve of representatives of two strategic villages where South Korean giant Posco proposed to come up with a 12MTPA steel plant.        
	Even after intense discussions, the administration and representatives of the Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti failed to reach a deal on the procedure  how to solve the issue of alleged land rights vis--vis livelihood.        
	While the samiti did not agree to vacate land for the project, the government had no plans to relocate it as per the demands of the villagers.         
	The second round of talks today failed miserably. There is no question of giving up our land at any cost. We will continue with our agitation, said Abani Baral, adviser to the samiti.        
	Revenue divisional commissioner (central division) P.K. Mohapatra, however, told The Telegraph that talks to break the Posco project land deadlock were on track. He also expected a satisfactory result by Monday.        
	After presiding over the second round of meeting between the state government and the samiti, Mohapatra said the talks had continued with same frankness and cordiality as in the first round to reach a satisfactory conclusion. The administration offered a proposal to the samiti delegation to give way for the project survey in the two villages  Dhinkia and Govindpur. But they have taken time till Monday to submit their reply to the Jagatsinghpur collector, Mohapatra said.        
	The survey has been completed in five of the seven identified villages, except Dhinkia and Govindpur.        
	Though Posco signed an MoU with the state government on June 22, 2005, for a greenfield 12MTPA steel plant in Jagatsinghpur district, the project had failed to take off, as the affected villagers had put up barricades to prevent entry of government and Posco officials for land acquisition.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik convened a high-level meeting last month following Poscos apparent threat to shift its project and decided to initiate the dialogue process. A three-hour meeting here on May 29 had also failed to break the deadlock.

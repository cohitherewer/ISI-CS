The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Price of proximity? Karat defiant
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Price of proximity? Karat defiant
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Karat                                  
	New Delhi, July 7: A defiant Prakash Karat has declared he will intensify the price-rise agitation against the Centre, pooh-poohing any danger of the CPM being seen as co-ordinating with the communal BJP.        
	The CPM general secretary has expressed these views in party mouthpiece Peoples Democracy at a time many of his comrades are blaming his hard-line anti-Congress policies for the partys dwindling poll fortunes.        
	Karats article, however, is dismissive of fears that the CPMs perceived proximity to the communal forces, as they both take on the Congress, could cost it further in Muslim votes in next years Bengal polls.        
	The people are not going to be confused by the talk of a Left-BJP combination. They are going to judge each political party by how sincerely they protect their interests in the face of this onslaught through price rise, he writes.        
	As far as the CPM and the Left parties are concerned, such politically motivated propaganda will not deter them. The struggle against price rise and the governments harmful petroleum-pricing policies will have to be further intensified.        
	Patting himself, Karat says that everyone except the Congress accepts that the July 5 shutdown call was a big success. Sections within and outside the CPM are, however, accusing Karat of having provided oxygen to a gasping BJP through his obstinate anti-Congress political line.        
	The charge that the Left parties may unwittingly be helping the dying BJP to bounce back cannot be ruled out completely, a CPM leader said although he stressed that it would be foolish to believe that the Left would ever align with the Right.        
	Senior BJP leader L.K. Advani has squeezed mileage out of the fact that his party and the Left had called a nation-wide shutdown on the same day. He has appealed to the Left to end the political untouchability of the BJP.        
	Further embarrassing the Left, he has revealed in his blog how two senior CPM and CPI parliamentarians had visited leader of the Opposition Sushma Swarajs office in Parliament during the last budget session.        
	Karats article side-steps these issues and takes a dig at the media for its concern about the ideological purity of the CPM.        
	It says the CPM will co-ordinate with all secular Opposition parties to widen the protest against the fuel price hike within and outside Parliament. Inside his party, though, Karat is facing flak for the failure of his third front in the last Lok Sabha polls.

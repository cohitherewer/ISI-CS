The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Uma quits own party
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Uma quits own party
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Uma Bharti                                  
	New Delhi, March 25: Uma Bharti today quit her own party, the Bharatiya Janshakti, which she had founded in 2005 after being thrown out of the BJP.        
	The move set off speculation about her return home to the BJP, but an aide of BJP president Nitin Gadkari said he was in no hurry to re-induct the prodigal daughter. A formidable line-up of leaders, which included Sushma Swaraj, M. Venkaiah Naidu and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, were opposed to her, the aide said.        
	A source close to Uma said she left her party for two reasons. She is unwell and secondly, she felt it wasnt going anywhere. Her followers were seeking explanations why she was not doing anything for the party. They had told her either you are with the party or your are not. But dont keep us hanging. She chose to leave it, the source said.        
	But her return to the BJP may not be easy. Chauhan, into his second innings at the states helm, has made his reservations known. If Gadkari has any such intention, the first thing he would do is to speak to the Madhya Pradesh brass. Nothing of that sort has happened, a Rajya Sabha MP from the state said today.        
	BJP sources recalled Umas short-lived, but stormy, tenure as the states chief minister in 2003. After her exit, the BJP and the state government lurched from crisis to crisis, until Chauhan was brought in to restore a semblance of order.        
	On her part, Uma appears to have been using every opportunity to make it known that she wants to come back. She briefly met Gadkari at a prayer meeting held for RSS veteran Nanaji Deshmukh, who died recently. But according to Gadkaris aide, not much should be read into it. They merely exchanged pleasantries.        
	On Monday, Uma was seen at a programme organised by a new RSS-BJP youth front where Gadkari was a guest of honour. The two did not interact, but her presence was construed as a sign of her intent and longing to get back to the BJP.

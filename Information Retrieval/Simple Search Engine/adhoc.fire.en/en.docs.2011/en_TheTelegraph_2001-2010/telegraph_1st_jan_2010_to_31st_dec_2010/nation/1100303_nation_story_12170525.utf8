	New Delhi, March 2: Signals relayed by Indias Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft before it was lost to science suggest that some craters near the lunar north pole may be reservoirs of water ice, Indian and US scientists announced today.         
	A US-made radar aboard Chandrayaan-1 which bounced radio waves off the lunar surface identified more than 30 craters with unusual reflection patterns which scientists believe may be caused by ice.         
	The total amount of ice will depend on its thickness in the craters which are 2km to 15km in diameter. But some researchers have estimated that there could be 600 million metric tonnes of ice in them, the US space agency Nasa said.         
	But an Indian scientist cautioned that it is too early to quantify the amount of ice.         
	We have a preliminary indication of ice-like signatures from craters, said Manab Chakraborty, a senior scientist at the Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad, and a member of the team that made the discovery.         
	We have detected something unusual, Chakraborty told The Telegraph. But any indirect remote observation involves detection, identification, and quantification. Were still in the first phase of observation, he said.         
	Last year, another US instrument on Chandrayaan-1 had detected water molecules on the Moon  indicating extremely tiny quantities in the top few millimetres of lunar soil from where they rapidly evaporate in the blazing heat of the Sun.         
	The lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1, launched in October 2008, had suffered instrument failures last year, leading to loss of communication with the spacecraft, prompting the Indian Space Research Organisation to end the mission in August 2009. But analysis of data sent by the spacecraft has continued.         
	The new findings are based on an instrument called the Mini-SAR, an imaging radar designed to pick up surface reflections from illuminated and permanently dark areas near the lunar poles.         
	The discovery once again bolsters support for the idea that the lunar poles may have large reservoirs of ice  and has rekindled hope that humans might some day be able to harvest water on the Moon.         
	Scientists have speculated for years that cratered regions of the Moon in permanent shadow, which are extremely cold, may be zones where water molecules ejected by the hot lunar surface may fall back and accumulate over long periods of time.         
	Between February 2009 and April 2009, the Mini-SAR mapped over 95 per cent of the lunar poles. The reflected radio waves revealed more than 30 craters in the north pole region with an anomalous pattern.         
	This anomalous pattern and its appearance in the permanently shadowed polar areas are consistent with the presence of water ice, the scientists said in a paper accepted for publication in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .         
	In the late-1990s, the US lunar spacecraft Clementine had revealed similar patterns from the lunar south pole, indicating patchy ice deposits in permanently dark areas. But some subsequent studies had questioned the findings.         
	The emerging picture... indicates that water creation, migration, deposition, and retention are occurring on the moon, said Paul Spudis, principal investigator of the Mini-SAR experiment at the Lunar and Planetary Science Institute, Houston, Texas. The new discoveries show the moon is an even more interesting and attractive scientific, exploration and operational destination than people had previously thought, Spudis said in a statement issued through Nasa.

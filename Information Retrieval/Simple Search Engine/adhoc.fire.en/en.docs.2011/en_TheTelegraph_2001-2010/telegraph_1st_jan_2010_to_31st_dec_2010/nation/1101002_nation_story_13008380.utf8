          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: The BJP today made it official that Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and MP Varun Gandhi will not campaign in Bihar for the Assembly polls, indicating that the party had buckled before ally Nitish Kumars reservations against the duo.         
	Modi and Varuns names do not figure in the list of 40 campaigners for the Bihar polls submitted by the BJP to the Election Commission.         
	According to election rules, the poll panel has to be informed about the campaigners.         
	Chief minister Nitish, sensitive about his secular credentials and worried he would be seen as anti-Muslim, had communicated to partner BJP that the two communally tainted leaders were not welcome in Bihar.         
	After a meeting with central BJP leaders here recently, Nitish had said he wanted the old arrangement. He was referring to Modi being kept away from Bihar during the last Lok Sabha polls.        
	The list submitted to the poll panel has the names of all senior national leaders such as L.K. Advani, Nitin Gadkari, Murli Manohar Joshi, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Ananth Kumar, sources said.         
	Despite heading a coalition with the BJP, Nitish feels that the policies of his government had endeared him to the Muslims.         
	The presence of Modi, under whose chief ministership the Gujarat riots broke out in 2002, would alienate the Muslims, he believes.

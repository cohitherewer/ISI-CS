The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chauhan on fast track to polish liberal image
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Chauhan on fast track to polish liberal image
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Shivraj Singh Chauhan                                  
	Bhopal, Oct. 23: Shivraj Singh Chauhan has turned to multiculturalism to highlight his role in maintaining communal peace in Madhya Pradesh, and to project a liberal face amid the buzz about the hawkish Uma Bhartis return to the BJP.        
	A couple of months ago, a bearded muezzin was heard giving the call for azan at sunset from the chief ministers bungalow to mark the breaking of the Ramazan fast. Host Chauhan wore a skullcap and offered dates to the faithful.        
	Now he has invited his entire cabinet to observe Karwa Chauth at his residence on Tuesday. During this festival, Hindu women of northern India observe a daylong fast praying for their husbands health and prosperity.        
	On November 21, Chauhan intends to decorate his bungalow with lights to mark Guru Parva, the birthday of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak.        
	The lights will, of course, be in place on November 5 to celebrate Diwali. Sources close to the chief minister said a function might be held at the 6 Shyamala Hill bungalow to mark Christmas too.        
	A section of the RSS-BJP has traditionally been seen as less than friendly towards the states Christian and Muslim populations, but Chauhan seems determined to show he has equal respect for all faiths.        
	Chauhan holds cabinet meetings every Tuesday. But when he was told that some ministers could not be in Bhopal on October 26 on account of Karwa Chauth, he asked his 32 cabinet colleagues to come to his residence with their spouses and observe the festival.         
	The proposal has, however, put a few tribal ministers in a spot since their wives are not known to observe fasts. Sources said these ministers were trying to persuade their wives to rise before dawn on Tuesday, eat a quick meal and spend the rest of the day at Chauhans bungalow.        
	By late evening, led by the chief ministers wife Sadhna, they will look at the moon through a sieve and perform a prayer.        
	For some, the programme would also be an acknowledgement of Sadhnas growing influence in state politics. She has recently been appointed vice-president of the state BJP womens wing, whose executive committee has over a dozen members who happen to be wives or close relatives of state ministers.        
	But the larger picture the religious events at Chauhans residence are expected to highlight is that under his five-year-old rule, communal violence has ebbed in Madhya Pradesh with fewer attacks against Christian missionaries being reported.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | N-tango endures with principal opposition
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      N-tango endures with principal opposition
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: Call it nuclear fusion.        
	The BJP-Congress bonhomie over the nuclear liability bill appears to be enduring for now, with Sushma Swaraj today preventing Shiv Sena MPs from disrupting the House.        
	Yesterday, shortly after the Lok Sabha passed the bill in a rare show of bi-partisanship, the Prime Minister had thanked L.K. Advani and Sushma over the phone.        
	Sources said Sushma, the Lok Sabha Opposition leader, told Manmohan Singh matter-of-factly: We expressed concerns and you responded positively.... We are not here to oppose for the sake of opposing. We wanted an India-centric bill; we got it from you. Of course, we caught out your trickeries but you rectified those.        
	Singh is said to have replied: No, Sushmaji. I am very, very grateful to you.        
	At last a good beginning has been made with the government opening up communication channels with the countrys principal Opposition, Sushma told journalists during a chat today.        
	Her use of principal sounded like a signal that the BJP would not necessarily make common cause with the Left and the regional outfits to fight the government. The message is, we are not an unreasonable lot, Sushma said.        
	She was true to her word today when Sena MPs rushed to the well to protest home minister P. Chidambarams alert against saffron terror to state police chiefs yesterday. The House was then discussing Kashmir.        
	Sushma quickly reined them in and ensured that no BJP member joined them. She later said she had taken a very conscious decision not to let the discussion of a crucial subject like Kashmir be derailed over an issue that could be raised any time. She said it was important to project that Parliament was united on Kashmir.        
	Sensing the mood, the government reached out to BJP leaders today to try and get some remaining bills through during the three remaining days of this session.        
	It met with some disappointment. The BJP was expectedly against amending the Enemy Property Act to allow Indian heirs to claim properties left behind by ancestors who had migrated to Pakistan. So, Chidambaram was told nothing doing at a meeting with Advani.        
	HRD minister Kapil Sibal fared no better when he met Sushma over the educational tribunals bill. I asked him, why the hurry to bring in this bill? The standing committee has raised several objections, Sushma said, but didnt rule out being flexible in the future.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM hosts, Omar hunts for Id present
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      PM hosts, Omar hunts for Id present
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                     
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah arrived here this afternoon seeking to extract a comprehensive Id gift for his irate Valley constituents but remained unsure after a 45-minute one-on-one meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh just how fulsome, or festive, that package will be.         
	The Prime Minister, who has assumed control of Kashmir policy in typically undemonstrative fashion, will probably overrule reluctant elements in his cabinet and stated opposition from the BJP to order revocation of the red-rag Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) from central districts of the Valley but is unlikely, at the moment, to demonstrate too much enthusiasm for unrolling the red carpet for Kashmiri separatists. This is based on the Centres resolve that it will not let the separatists, or the belligerent Kashmiri street, lead the agenda. We remain open to talks across the board with all sections of Kashmiri opinion, sources told The Telegraph shortly after the Singh-Omar meeting at 7 Race Course Road, but the violence has to cease first, they have to get the message we will not respond to bloody blackmail of the kind that we have witnessed since June.         
	It is perhaps noteworthy in this context that while Omar was pleading for the release of political prisoners and opening dialogue with the Prime Minister, his police re-arrested the separatist spearhead Syed Ali Shah Geelani in Srinagar because he had urged a more intensified phase for his Quit Kashmir agitation. It could well be that Omars platter of demands contains clever political subterfuge aimed at recovering credibility in the Valley. While he is showcasing across the board demands to the Centre, he is aware of what the Centre will concede and what it will not, at least for a while.         
	A key meeting of the cabinet committee on security (CCS) is scheduled for Friday, the eve of Id, and it is likely that it will recommend the lifting of the Disturbed Areas Act from certain Valley and Jammu districts to make way for limited abrogation of the AFSPA. The Valley areas earmarked for relief are Srinagar and the adjoining districts of Budgam, Ganderbal and Kulgam, though not all of them may be part of the final decision. Jammu and Samba could also be taken off the purview of the act. This will go some distance in addressing Omars stance that the status quo is not enough in Kashmir.         
	Simultaneously, the Centre is likely to unveil cash and employment-related relief packages for the families of those who have been killed or injured in three months of violence which claimed in excess of 70 lives, most of them young Kashmiris.         
	In a nuanced divergence from Omars line on resolution, the Prime Minister appears more keen on foregrounding economic rather than political measures in the immediate and short term. Apart from pushing the state government to take economic welfare measures more directly to the people, the Centre is also investing a lot of energy and hope in the jobs panel the Prime Minister recently announced. Headed by C. Rangarajan, and comprising N.R. Narayanamurthy and Tarun Das, mentors of Infosys and CII respectively, among others, the panel has had one preliminary meeting and is meant to submit its recommendations by October-end.         
	But the law and order situation in the Valley remains the chief concern for both the Centre and the state governments and New Delhi continues to nudge Omar on streamlining his security apparatus to perform better. The Centre is not in favour of any resort to Presidents Rule in the state and should Omar decide to quit his job at some stage, it will prefer the return of his father and former chief minister Farooq Abdullah in power. An elected government is the best agency to deal through in Kashmir, sources said, past experiments with central rule in the state have not only lacked any sanction, they have also lacked credibility.         
	Kashmir convulsed under renewed eruptions following the killing of four people in the Pattan-Baramula sector on Monday night. Strict curfew had to be clamped in Srinagar and key areas of north and south Kashmir as stone-pelting protesters took on security forces in a rash of clashes. Of greater concern to the authorities is that the separatist vanguard has eschewed any let up in violent protests even through the month of Ramzan.         
	It is this that has sharpened the divide on revocation of the AFSPA. While top BJP leaders --- L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley included --- cautioned the Prime Minister against any step that would dilute the integrity of the Indian state in Kashmir, even the defence ministry is learnt to be reluctant to either tone down or revoke the AFSPA. Union home minister P. Chidambaram, sources say, is not averse to making the AFSPA more humane or even revocable in certain areas of the Valley, but the defence establishment has argued any such move could jeopardise operations in a sensitive and inflamed border state riven with infiltration from across the border. Following the CCS on Friday, the Prime Minister is likely to call an all-party meeting to explain the nuances and necessities of his Id gifts to Kashmiris.

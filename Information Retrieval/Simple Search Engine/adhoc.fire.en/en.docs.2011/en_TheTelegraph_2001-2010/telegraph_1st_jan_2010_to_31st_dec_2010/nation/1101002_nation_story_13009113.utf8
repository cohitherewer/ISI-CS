          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                       Chidambaram                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: The Centre is unwilling to risk a comment on the Ayodhya verdict but the home minister today stressed that the judgment does not justify the Babri Masjid demolition, which remains a criminal act.         
	The judgment in no way justifies the demolition of the Babri Masjid. In my view, it remains a criminal act, P. Chidambaram told reporters, answering a question.         
	Unlike BJP leaders who use the suffix structure with the word Babri, the home minister underlined that it was a mosque that was demolished on December 6, 1992. People who brought it down had taken the law into their hands, he said.         
	Chidambarams remark is significant considering that the UPA governments silence on the judgment has angered sections in the minority community. Indications are that the government would be happy if cases relating to the demolition are fast-tracked.         
	But the demolition cases, being heard in a special CBI court in Rae Bareli, are stuck because there is no judge to hear them. The trial has not moved an inch since July, said Rajeev Srivastava, an advocate in the court. Gulab Singh, the last chief judicial magistrate of the special court, was transferred. The new judge is yet to take over, he said.         
	It was not clear whether Allahabad High Court, which is supposed to nominate a judge, is responsible for the delay or the states department of law, which has to clear the file.         
	Senior BJP leaders, including L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, are among the accused in the demolition. The next hearing in the case involving Advani is due on October 5, but there is no word yet on a new judge.         
	Advani also said yesterday that the title suit judgment in no way pardons the shame of December 6, 1992.

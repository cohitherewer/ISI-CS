The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Spoiler salvo at Mamata
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Spoiler salvo at Mamata
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 30: Bengal housing minister Gautam Deb today accused Mamata Banerjee and her party for introducing the uncivilised culture of complete non-cooperation between political rivals, even on matters of peoples welfare.        
	Deb dubbed Mamatas brand of politics unconstitutional, alluding to the fact that she was not co-operating in the Left governments development efforts despite being a key Union minister.        
	The trigger for the outburst appeared to be Mamatas statement calling Deb a liar over his claim that she had promised him cooperation in putting up electric poles in Rajarhats Chhapna, on the outskirts of Calcutta. The work has been held up because Mamatas Trinamul Congress has been backing locals in a land protest.        
	What he said about me is a lie.... It was an attempt to get cheap publicity by claiming he had spoken to me, Mamata had said without naming Deb on Friday, a day after he claimed to have spoken to her over the phone.        
	Today, Deb, speaking at a media conference, denied the charges. I have no reason to lie. I rang up Mamata Banerjee and discussed the problems regarding supply of electricity in some parts of Rajarhat. She assured me she would talk to the panchayat-level leaders to sort out the problem.        
	The CPM minister claimed many Trinamul leaders were willing to co-operate with the state government on issues such as the one in Chhapna but were too scared of their leader.         
	 Around 75 per cent of the Trinamul leadership, including some top leaders, is willing to co-operate with us for work involving the welfare of the masses. But they are all too scared of her. They repeatedly request me not to tell Mamata that they speak to me.        
	Developer Hidco, chaired by Deb, had acquired the land at Chhapna in 2005 but has failed to take possession because most of the 2,000-odd landlosers have turned the area into a pocket of resistance with Trinamul support.

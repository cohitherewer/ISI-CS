          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 5: Social activist Shabnam Hashmi has resigned from the National Integration Council, Indias apex body to formulate policies against social divisions, to protest the inclusion of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on the panel.         
	In a letter emailed to the home minister today, Hashmi said she was shocked at Thackerays inclusion. Mr Uddhav Thackerays whole political life is based on divisive and hate politics. His entry into (the) NIC is a cruel oxymoron, Hashmi wrote.         
	His brand of communal politics is against the secular and plural value system that the council upholds, she said, arguing that Thackerays entry would further derogate the high credentials and stature of the body forever.         
	Thackeray and the Sena have frequently been accused of inciting violence against minority communities and non-Maharashtrian residents of Mumbai.

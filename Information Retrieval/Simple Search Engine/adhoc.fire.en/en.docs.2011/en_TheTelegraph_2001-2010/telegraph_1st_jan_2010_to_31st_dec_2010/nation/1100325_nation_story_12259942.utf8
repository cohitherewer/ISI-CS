	New Delhi, March 24: The Centre will soon write to the US seeking direct access to David Coleman Headley and wont file a chargesheet against the 26/11 co-plotter till Indian investigators have quizzed him, home ministry sources said today.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram and his senior officials will finalise the letter, to be sent to the US department of justice, saying a team of investigators is ready to visit America once a green signal is given.        
	The sources said the department of justice would put Indias request for direct access before the Chicago court where Headley recently confessed to having done the recce for 26/11 attack in a plea-bargain agreement with the US authorities.        
	The National Investigation Agency had lodged an FIR against Headley and his partner-in-crime Tahawwur Hussain Rana last November.         
	The sources also said the Centre was not taking cognisance of ambassador Timothy Roemers statement yesterday saying the US had not taken any decision on giving Indian investigators direct access.         
	A PTI report quoted Chidambaram as saying in London that the ambassadors comments did not signify a turnaround by the US authorities on direct access to Headley.         
	Special secretary (internal security) in the home ministry, U.K. Bansal, met solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium in New Delhi yesterday and discussed options before Indian investigators after Headleys plea bargain.        
	The BJP today described as a diplomatic failure Indias failure to get access to Headley so far. , Spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman accused Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of going out of his way to befriend the US.

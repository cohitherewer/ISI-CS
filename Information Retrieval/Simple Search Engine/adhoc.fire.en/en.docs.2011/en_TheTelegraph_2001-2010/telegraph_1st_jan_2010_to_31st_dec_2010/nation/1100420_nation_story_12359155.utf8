The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BSNL strike from today 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BSNL strike from today 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 19: BSNL services for both land and mobile connections are likely to be affected across the country as the joint action committee of trade unions and associations of the nationalised telecom service will join an indefinite strike from tomorrow morning.         
	The strike has been called in protest against recommendations of the Sam Pitroda committee to divest 30 per cent of BSNL shares, downsize its workforce and outsource operations, action committee leaders said here today.        
	The strike begins from 6 in the morning tomorrow. There will be no exemptions for any sector during the strike. Our services are definitely going to be affected from the day after, if not tomorrow itself, as all the 15 trade unions and associations representing all levels of employees have called the strike, said Saibal Sengupta, the convener of the joint action committee for Calcutta Telephones.        
	However, we will volunteer to avoid disruptions in emergency services like hospitals and fire services. Efforts will be taken to ensure maintenance of our exchanges, he ad-ded.        
	CPM labour wing Citu and other Left unions have extended support to the strike, Citu state secretary Kali Ghosh said. The committee leaders said the Centre didnt take any initiative to avoid the strike. We are yet to receive any call for talks from the Centre, Sengupta said.         
	He said the committees national leadership met the telecom minister a few days back. But the minister allegedly washed his hands of the matter, saying it was being dealt with by the Prime Minister.        
	The Prime Minister has asked a group of ministers to examine the issues involved.        
	The committee leaders said the proposed divestment was aimed at privatising the telecom service, disregarding the social commitment of BSNL to provide telephone services in rural areas.

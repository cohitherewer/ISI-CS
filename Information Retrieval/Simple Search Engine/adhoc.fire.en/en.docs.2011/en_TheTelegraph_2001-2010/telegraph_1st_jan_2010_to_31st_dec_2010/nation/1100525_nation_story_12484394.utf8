	Bhubaneswar, May 24: Union minister for social justice and empowerment Mukul Wasnik today indicated a huge gap between figures of atrocities provided by the Orissa government and those available with the National Crime Records Bureau.        
	The state governments information needs to be furnished afresh, Wasnik said after a review meeting of the committee constituted to curb offences of untouchability and atrocities against Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) here today.        
	According to the state governments data, the number of cases against SCs stood at 1,252 till 2008, while those against STs stood at 387. However, the National Crime Records Bureau puts the figures at 1,836 and 508, respectively.        
	The total number of atrocities across the country reached 38,943, said Wasnik, adding that while the national conviction rate was 32 per cent, Orissas conviction was a mere 11 per cent. Its a matter of concern, he said.        
	Furthermore, 90 per cent of cases were still pending, pointed out the minister. The reason behind such a large number of pending cases was said to be the absence of exclusive special courts. There are 53 special courts in the state, but no exclusive special courts. Three such exclusive courts will be set up very shortly in the state, he said.        
	The committee requested the state government to implement rules under the Prevention of Civil Rights Act, 1995, and the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act under which vigilance and monitoring committees ought to meet every six months under the chairmanship of the collector.        
	However, the last such meeting in Orissa was held in 2008. There were elections in 2009 and meetings could not be held because of enforcement of the model code of conduct.         
	The next such meeting will be on 26th of this month, the committee said.

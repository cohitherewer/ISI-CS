The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Alagiri rejects brother claim to fathers throne
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Alagiri rejects brother claim to fathers throne
          G.C. SHEKHAR                        Stalin				             Alagiri                                
	Chennai, March 24: The war of succession in the DMK has intensified with M.K. Alagiri, the eldest son of party chief M. Karunanidhi, declaring that he would not accept anyone as the leader after his father.        
	There is no need to think of any other leader as long as Karunanidhi is around. But after him I will not accept anyone else as the leader of the DMK. Nobody has the stature or capacity to fill Karunanidhis place, Alagiri said in an interview to a Tamil biweekly.        
	The remarks of Alagiri, 59, who is the Union chemicals minister, are directed at his younger brother and deputy chief minister M.K. Stalin, 57, who is being projected as Karunanidhis preferred successor as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.         
	Alagiris statement is till now the most open thumbs down from Karunanidhis eldest son to attempts to prepare Stalin as the undisputed heir apparent.        
	Disturbed by the outburst of Alagiri, made a few hours before the Union minister travels to Australia on an official visit, Karunanidhi, 86, wondered why discuss the future now.         
	It is not at all necessary to think about what happens after me, he said in a quavering voice before leaving to address a byelection public meeting at Pennagaram, 240km from here.         
	Stalin, who is spearheading the election campaign, has chosen not to react to the barb from his elder brother.        
	Stalins elevation as deputy chief minister and the pride of place given to him in the government and the party had been clear pointers that Karunanidhi would like the younger and politically more experienced son to take over at least the chief ministership probably before the May 2011 Assembly elections.         
	Keeping this in mind, Karunanidhi had at least twice remarked that he was contemplating retirement from governance after the World Tamil Conference in June this year.        
	But after facing stiff opposition from Alagiri, Karunanidhi backtracked, saying he was yet to decide the timing of his retirement. More recently he asserted that he was physically and mentally quite healthy, though he had been confined to a wheelchair after a spine surgery, indicating that he was not vacating the chief ministers chair in a hurry.        
	Stalin, sources said, was not amused at this dilution, especially after his supporters in the party had recently released a book on him, scripted by a senior journalist, proclaiming his leadership qualities.         
	Almost all editors of leading English and Tamil dailies and magazines were in attendance at that function, singing praise of Stalin., which he watched through a live telecast on the family-owned Kalaignar TV.        
	Though rewarded with a cabinet berth in Delhi, Alagiri has been insisting on a powerful post within the party to expand his control beyond the southern districts which come under his charge presently.         
	After having won all the 10 Lok Sabha seats from southern Tamil Nadu, he even got three Opposition MLAs from those districts to cross over to the DMK. Not to be outdone, Stalin got an ADMK legislator from central Tamil Nadu to switch allegiance to the DMK.        
	Though Alagiri recently said he and Stalin were like a double barrelled gun, in reality they resemble two guns ready to fire at each other  so deep seated is the animosity between them. All efforts by our leader to patch differences have failed. They will be at each others throats the moment Karunanidhi is not in the picture, a senior DMK minister said.

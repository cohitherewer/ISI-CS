                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mamata in central forces challenge 
  Offer to quit if proved wrong          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee at a rail event in Nadia. (PTI)                                        
	Calcutta, Dec. 22: Mamata Banerjee today offered to quit if her claim that the Left government in Bengal was misusing central forces and setting up armed camps in Jungle Mahal was proved wrong.        
	I have been saying this for a long time now. The central forces were called to suppress Maoist activities. Why are they killing our boys? Why are they providing arms to the CPM cadres? If Im wrong I will quit. But if Im proved right then central forces have to be withdrawn, the Trinamul Congress chief declared.         
	She is committed to supporting the UPA government for now on ethical grounds, Mamata told a television channel.         
	Ever since the joint forces started their operation against Maoists in 2009, the railway minister has been alleging that the CPM is taking advantage of the presence of central forces and recapturing territory that it had lost to the Maoists. Central forces are being misused. I am challenging anyone to prove me wrong, she said in reply to a question.         
	She had earlier questioned the logic behind sending security forces to the state, claiming that Marxists and Maoists were two sides of the same coin in Bengal.         
	We have been stating repeatedly that state-sponsored violence is going on. How many times we will have to say this? Our party met Union home minister P. Chidambaram 20 times, Mamata said, adding she had met Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh too.        
	Mamata has decided to mount pressure on the Centre and a delegation of Trinamul leaders will meet the Prime Minister with a detailed documentation of alleged CPM atrocities in rural Bengal, party sources said. The decision was taken at Mondays core committee meeting.         
	The core committee also decided that if the alliance with the Congress did not work out, the party would contest the Assembly elections on its own.        
	I have not said we will go it alone in the Assembly elections. But our options are open. We are a regional party, the Congress is the larger party. They have to decide, Mamata said tonight. We have proved our strength in the Lok Sabha and municipal elections, she said, adding her partys main alliance was with the people.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata is very unhappy with the Centre for its response to her demands.         
	On the 2G spectrum issue she offered total support to the government even after making clear that she will not compromise on corruption. But what did the Centre do? Congress leaders from the state are raising questions and objecting to the way she is performing. Is this the way a cabinet minister should be treated? a senior Trinamul leader asked.        
	The spiralling prices of food items is another issue bothering Mamata, who is likely to skip the next cabinet meeting on price rise, the sources said. She has asked us to carry on with our movement against food price hike targeting both the Centre and the state. In tomorrows rally we are going to raise the issue along with CPMs atrocities, a Trinamul leader said.        
	Mamata today denied that her partys student wing was to blame for the death of Swapan Koley, a second-year student killed during a campus clash in Howrah last week.         
	It was not a SFI-Trinamul Chhatra Parishad clash. CPM cadres from outside were involved and killed the boy. It was our block president Tushar Ghosh who took him to the hospital, she said, describing the death as unfortunate.        
	Party leaders were on the back foot after the youths death, which was blamed on the Trinamul Chhatra Parishad was blamed.

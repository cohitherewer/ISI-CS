                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Police atrocities haunt Bihar again
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Satyendra Bihari. (Deepak Kumar)                                  
	Patna, April 19: Two separate cases of police atrocities have come to light, adding credence to allegations that of late a number of policemen and government officials were taking the law into their hands against civilians in a Bihar that chief minister Nitish Kumar had claimed to have changed for the better.        
	The police beat up a non-resident Indian (NRI) hailing from Bihar and a JDU worker in two separate incidents yesterday.        
	Policemen invaded the home of Satyendra Bihari at Dharhara on the outskirts of Patna and beat up the 35-year-old NRI and his father at 10.30am. Satyendras offence: his vehicle overtook the one in which an IPS officer was travelling.        
	Satyendra today lodged a case against the Jehanabad superintendent of police Vivek Kumar and other policemen in the court of chief judicial magistrate, Patna. He also complained about his plight to the state human rights commission.        
	The owner of a restaurant chain in Russia, Satyendra is on a visit to his native place to open a restaurant chain in Bihar. I was on my way to my native village in a car after meeting officials concerned at Patna in connection with starting my business.         
	Near Masauri, I overtook a jeep in which the Jehanabad SP was travelling, unaware of the fact that my action will hurt the SPs ego and bring about this catastrophe, he said.        
	Soon after Satyendra reached his home at Dharhara, 5km away, he found six gun-toting policemen at his door who beat him and his father, Brijbihari Prasad.         
	Angry villagers took Satyendra to Parsa police station to lodge a case against the policemen and the SP who, Satyendra said, was sitting in the vehicle while they were being beaten up.        
	Case karoge to pura khandan nast ho jayega (your entire dynasty will be destroyed if you lodge a case) said a Parsa police officer refusing to register my case, Satyendra alleged.        
	The Jehanabad SP, however, denied his involvement in the incident. I am not aware about the allegations, he told The Telegraph.        
	JDU worker Ravindra Sinha has alleged that Gaya district magistrate (DM) Sanjay Kumar Singh arrived with at least six armed policemen at his Sandalpur colony house yesterday and asked me to vacate it within 24 hours.        
	His wife Gayatri Sinha lodged an FIR with the police station, while Ravindra went to the chief ministers janata durbar today with relevant documents and submitted a petition urging Nitish Kumar to save him from the greed of the powerful DM.        
	A relative of the DM had apparently complained that Ravindra had acquired the house and land fraudulently. But the court should decide this. How can the DM threaten the occupants, said a police officer.        
	Officers of Bahadurpur police station, under which Ravindras house falls, denied accompanying the DM.

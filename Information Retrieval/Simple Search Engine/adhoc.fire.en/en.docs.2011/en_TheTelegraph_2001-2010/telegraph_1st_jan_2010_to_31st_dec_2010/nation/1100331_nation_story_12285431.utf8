The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | April push for quota 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      April push for quota 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 30: The Centre plans to bring in and pass the womens reservation bill in the Lok Sabha when the budget session resumes from April 15.        
	Yes, we want to have the bill passed in the budget session and are doing the needful before that, law minister M. Veerappa Moily told The Telegraph without revealing what the preparations were.        
	Since the UPA faces heavier odds in the Lok Sabha than it did in the Rajya Sabha, Lower House leader Pranab Mukherjee is expected to meet all the parties, collectively or individually, this week or the next to continue chasing the elusive consensus.        
	Mulayam Singh Yadav has hinted he might reconsider his stand if the quota volume is trimmed from 33 per cent.        
	Asked if the ruling Congress was ready to do that, a source said: It doesnt seem so. The high command is in no mood to compromise, not after the political mileage we derived from the bills passage in the Rajya Sabha.        
	Going by numbers alone, the UPA is better placed in the Lower House since the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) have not made good their threat of withdrawing support. But the BJP, which had succeeded in reining in its quota critics in the Rajya Sabha, now has a problem on its hands.        
	Some of its northern MPs have told a party meeting they were ready to defy the whip, lose their membership and seek re-election on this very plank. BJP sources said Sushma Swaraj, the partys leader in the Lok Sabha, had appealed to these MPs to adhere to the official line. Party president Nitin Gadkari too is expected to speak to the dissidents individually.        
	BJP ally Janata Dal (United) too is divided. In the Rajya Sabha, all but one of its members had followed the whip to vote for the quota. In the Lok Sabha, most of the partys 20 members may go along with quota opponent Sharad Yadav.        
	The government cannot afford to evict unruly quota opponents from the Lok Sabha as it had done in the Rajya sabha. The BJP has said it will not allow any evictions, and Lalu Prasad has dared the government to marshal me out.

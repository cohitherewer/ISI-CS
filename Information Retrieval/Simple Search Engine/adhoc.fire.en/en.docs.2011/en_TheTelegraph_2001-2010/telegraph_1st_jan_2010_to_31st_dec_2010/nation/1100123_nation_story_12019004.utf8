	New Delhi, Jan. 22 (PTI): Lt Gen. V.K. Singh, the eastern commander who has sought the dismissal of four senior officers accused in a north Bengal land scam, was today named the army chief.        
	Singh, 59, will take over from Gen. Deepak Kapoor, with whom he is believed to have had differences over the Sukna land scam case.         
	Kapoor retires on March 31, defence ministry spokesperson Sitanshu Kar said here.         
	The defence ministry issued the order appointing Singh to the top post after the cabinet committee on appointments cleared his name yesterday. He will have a tenure of around two years.        
	A third-generation officer from the Rajput Regiment, Singh is a graduate of the Wellington-based Defence Services Staff College and the Rangers Course at Fort Benning, the US, and the US Army War College, Carlisle.        
	He was commissioned to the 2 Rajput Regiment in June 1970 and commanded it when it was positioned along the Line of Control with Pakistan.        
	Experienced in counter-insurgency, Line of Control and high-altitude operations, Singh was awarded the Yudh Sena Medal for distinguished service during Operation Pawan against the LTTE in Sri Lanka.

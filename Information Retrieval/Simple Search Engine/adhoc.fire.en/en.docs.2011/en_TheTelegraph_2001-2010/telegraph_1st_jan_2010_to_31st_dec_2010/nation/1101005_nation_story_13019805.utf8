The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Decks clear for new CRPF boss
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Decks clear for new CRPF boss
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 4: The Centre has asked Veerappan-hunter K. Vijay Kumar to take over as CRPF director-general on Wednesday, after clearing the decks by making two transfers and sanctioning leave till retirement for one of his seniors.        
	To vacate the post for Kumar, the current CRPF director-general, Vikram Srivastava, has been posted as director-general at the Bureau of Police Research and Development. One other hurdle in Kumars way  an issue of seniority  has also been dealt with.        
	Two special directors-general (SDGPs) of the CRPF are senior to Kumar  who is now the director of the National Police Academy in Hyderabad  which made it difficult to bring him to the top post.        
	So the government decided to post SDGP N.K. Tripathi, who was stationed in Jammu, to the National Crime Records Bureau, sources said. The other SDGP, Vijay Raman, now posted in Bengal, has been sent on leave till retirement because of health reasons, the sources added.        
	Raman is better known for his earlier stint in Maoist-hit Chhattisgarh, where he had a spat with state police chief Vishwaranjan that exposed the fault-lines between the central and state forces. Soon after being transferred to Bengal, Raman is said to have faced health problems.        
	Kumar, a 1975-batch officer from the Tamil Nadu cadre, is best known for leading the task force that killed brigand Veerappan. He will be unable to watch the passing-out parade of the IPS batch he has trained.        
	Kumar is known as a tough taskmaster and an officer who leads from the front. The CRPF now needs just such a person who can motivate and lead it more effectively, a source said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 9: Several Indian Idol aspirants were injured after they were baton-charged by police at an audition in Noida today amid allegations that poor arrangements by the organisers led to the mayhem.        
	The incident, coming a day after a man was killed in a stampede during a recruitment drive by the Maharashtra police in Mumbai, occurred at the Expo Centre in Noidas Sector 62. More than a thousand aspirants had gathered for the popular talent hunt show on Sony Entertainment Television (SET).        
	The initial thrill of performing in front of Bollywood music bigwigs turned sour when most of the aspirants werent allowed to enter the venue despite claims by them that they had enrolled for the audition. Many were forced to leave before their turn came without giving their auditions and accused the organisers of cheating them.         
	They cheated me. I registered with them over telephone and despite having the (enrolment) code, they arent letting me in. I have made so many calls and each costs Rs 25 for two minutes, said Suraj, who had come from Ludhiana. Like many of the other contestants, he had waited for close to 10 hours for the audition.        
	The scene resembled a war zone: many aspirants were lay on the road, some had fainted because of the heat.         
	Although the organisers were expecting a big crowd  previous auditions have also seen a rush  there were no ambulances or medical units on standby at the venue.         
	Another contestant, Rohini, said: I have trained for years and I just wanted them (the selectors) to listen to me. I had all the documents required. They asked me to come back next week but the final auditions in Delhi will be held the day after tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US one-way traffic worry for Delhi 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US one-way traffic worry for Delhi 
  - All-give-no-take fear before Obama visit         ARCHIS MOHAN                       The presidential suite of ITC Maurya where Barack Obama will stay. (PTI)                                
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: Barack Obamas India visit could fetch the US billion-dollar deals, thousands of jobs and a stronger foothold in Asia but some in the government doubt whether India will benefit as much.        
	This section  ministers and bureaucrats  believes the US President wants to return home with his bags full but is reluctant to give India enough.        
	Highly placed government sources say it is time New Delhi insists on a new blueprint for the ties as the relations  which have recovered from the setbacks in the aftermath of Indias 1998 Pokhran nuclear test  have hit a plateau. There is also a feeling that Washington needs to offer more if the strategic partnership is to go further.        
	A sore point is that despite promises, the US has failed to de-hyphenate India and Pakistan. The Obama administration has pledged more aid and weapons to Islamabad in recent weeks, the move apparently aimed at placating Pakistan because the President will not be visiting that country before or after his India trip. It is rare for US Presidents to leave out Islamabad when they travel to New Delhi.        
	The US has recently offered Pakistan defence equipment such as fighter aircraft, weaponry that is of little use in its battle against the Taliban. Then there has been an aid package to Islamabad. Obama has also promised the Pakistani President (Asif Ali Zardari) that he will be visiting that country next year. All this, weeks before he lands in India. Where is the promised de-hyphenation? asked a minister, who didnt want to be named.        
	In fact, home secretary G.K. Pillais comments yesterday that American agencies did not share specific information on David Coleman Headley are being interpreted in government circles as India making its unhappiness public.        
	Another area of concern lies in the civil nuclear sector. Officials believe the US needs to substantially remove restrictions on controls on dual-use technology and take more Indian companies off its list of banned entities.         
	They have promised to make concessions. But till now, these are much lower than our expectations, said a source. India also wants more clarity in the USs position on the deepening China-Pakistan relations.        
	The concerns have found an echo in a report prepared by a US think tank and released around 10 days back. The Center for New American Security says the US should take its partnership with India to a new level by, among other things, supporting New Delhis bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council.         
	The report of the Washington-based institute has been authored by former US deputy secretary of state Richard L. Armitage and former under-secretary Nicholas Burns.        
	But at a curtain-raiser briefing on Obamas India visit at the White House today, the focus appeared to be on economics. The officials described India as the cornerstone of their broader Asia approach focused on expanding US exports to the region and an important market for the next several years.        
	The officials said US exports to India had quadrupled over the last seven years to around $17 billion. Service exports have tripled to $10 billion a year.         
	The pace of investments by Indian companies in the US  through purchase of American firms and business alliances  is second only to the UAE.         
	Indian firms, several of them in the outsourcing industry, have created and supported about 57,000 jobs in the US.        
	Obama is expected to return home with deals worth over $12 billion that promise to create up to 60,000 jobs in the US in the coming years. The officials also stressed that this was one of Obamas longest visits to any country.

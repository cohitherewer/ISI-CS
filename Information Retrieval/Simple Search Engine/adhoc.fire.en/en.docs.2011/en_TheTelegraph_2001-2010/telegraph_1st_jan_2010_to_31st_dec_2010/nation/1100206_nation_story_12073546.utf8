  - Ministers blame NCP chief, Congress Big Two keep mum        SANJAY K. JHA                          Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh at the CWC meeting in Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: Senior Congress leaders today blamed the spiralling prices of essentials at least partly on agriculture minister Sharad Pawars policies and remarks.        
	At the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, neither the Prime Minister nor Sonia Gandhi made any attempt to restrain those criticising Pawar, who had several times said in public that the prices would rise further.        
	Sources said that among those who mounted the strongest attacks on the Nationalist Congress Party boss were Vilasrao Deshmukh, Satyavrat Chaturvedi and R.K. Dhawan.        
	Deshmukhs attack generated curiosity because he is a cabinet minister and might have chosen to abide by the principle of collective responsibility.        
	Manmohan Singh and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee spoke on the prices too but avoided any critical reference to Pawar. They said the government had taken several measures and the impact was now visible.        
	Singh, who shared the CWCs concern at the burden on the common man, mentioned that the government was also grappling with the global economic slowdown and the drought-like situation in many areas.        
	Deshmukh, without naming Pawar, said: Ministers should not make irresponsible statements. We have seen a trend that prices go up whenever the minister speaks.        
	He also blamed the procurement policy, suggesting the government should have bought foodgrains directly from the farmers and stocked them to be released in the market when prices rose.        
	Chaturvedi referred to betuke (illogical) statements and wondered if the ministers job was only to predict that prices would rise.        
	He rebutted the theory that the prices were rising because the farmers were being paid more, and said the main reason was profiteering by suppliers and retailers. He added that state governments, including those run by the Congress, had not done enough to curb hoarding and other illegal practices.        
	Dhawan asked how a minister could blame the Prime Minister for his own failures. There is a tradition that the Prime Ministers name is not dragged into controversies, he said.        
	Pawar had said he alone did not take the decisions and that the Prime Minister was part of the collective decision-making process. He had later clarified he did not mean to criticise Singh.        
	At the news briefing by the All India Congress Committee, Janardan Dwivedi denied that Pawars name had been taken but conceded that the price rise had dominated the CWC meeting with 18 members speaking on the subject.        
	He dismissed reports suggesting there were demands to strip Pawar of additional portfolios such as consumer affairs and civil supplies. He said the Congress had asked Mukherjee, who spoke on the economic situation in the context of the budget, to keep the common mans interests in mind.        
	Maharashtra too figured prominently at the meeting. A.K. Antony, the party general secretary in charge of the state, described the situation as grim because of the divisive agendas of the Shiv Sena and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. He suggested caution, asking the Centre and the state government not to act in haste.        
	Sonia asked the members to concentrate on issues such as the price rise, Telangana, organisational polls, the partys 125-year celebrations and the budget.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram explained the situation on Telangana, claiming the government couldnt have done anything other than form a state reorganisation committee at a time passions ran high.

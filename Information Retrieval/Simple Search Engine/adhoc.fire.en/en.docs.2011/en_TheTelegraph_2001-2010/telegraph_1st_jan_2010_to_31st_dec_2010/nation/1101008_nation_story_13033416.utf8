The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fury over Omar accession remark
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Fury over Omar accession remark
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                      Opposition members disrupt proceedings on Thursday as they protest against Omar Abdullah rsquo;s comment. (PTI)                           
	Srinagar, Oct. 7: Omar Abdullahs statement in the Assembly yesterday that Kashmir had acceded to India and not merged with it triggered a ruckus in the House today, leaving several BJP and Panthers Party MLAs injured.        
	The chief ministers remark, however, appeared to have pleased his most vocal critic in the separatist camp, Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani.        
	BJP and Panthers Party MLAs stormed the well of the House, shouted slogans and sought a clarification from Omar, only to be dragged out by the watch and ward staff. The two parties together have 14 MLAs  all from Jammu  in the 87-member Assembly.        
	BJP legislator Ashok Khajuria said five MLAs  Durga Das, Jugal Kishore, Lal Chand, Chaudhary Sukhanandan (all BJP) and Yashpal Kunal (Panthers Party)  were injured.         
	It (the watch and ward staffs action) is hooliganism. I am a heart patient and I too was not spared. Even our elderly MLA Chaman Lal (Gupta) was dragged out, he said.        
	The ruckus is likely to provide a breather to the embattled Omar as he looks to salvage his image in the Valley. There was good news for him from the streets too, with the situation largely peaceful, no curfew being imposed and some shops opening despite the Hurriyats call for a shutdown.         
	Omar had yesterday said that Jammu and Kashmir had acceded to India and not merged, unlike Junagadh and Hyderabad.        
	It is easy to say that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and it sounds nice to ears, but if there is no doubt in your minds and hearts on this account, why are you time and again shouting this slogan from the top of your voices? he had said.        
	The accession... occurred under an agreement. We have not broken that agreement nor have we taken it back, but you have gradually demolished it and people are aggrieved and angry with you for this. We both were required to uphold and respect the agreement.... For this reason, special provisions were made in the Constitution. When we talk of autonomy, we are talking of granting it under the Indian Constitution.        
	Omar also said that Kashmir was an outstanding issue and that Pakistan had to be involved in resolving it.        
	When the House met today, BJP and Panthers Party members demanded a clarification from Omar. Pakistani agenda nahi chalega, nahi chalega, they shouted. The Speaker said he would not tolerate this mess and asked the MLAs to start business and resume question hour. This irked the members who climbed desks and stormed the well.        
	Panthers Party chairman Bhim Singh has called a Jammu bandh on Friday demanding immediate withdrawal of (Omars) anti-national, anti-India and communally provocative speech. The BJP has decided to boycott the rest of the Assembly session in protest against its members being dragged out.        
	Geelani said Omars remarks had vindicated his stand that Kashmir was a disputed territory. But he said Omar had only spoken half the truth. The truth is, this accession too is doubtful in the light of historical facts. Second, at the time of accession it was promised that the people of J amp;K would be given the right to self-determination after the return of normality.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sangh magazines give away Gadkari story
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Nitin Gadkari                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 1: Nitin Gadkaris coronation as BJP chief got wall-to-wall coverage in Sangh weeklies Organiser and Panchajanya, underlining the importance of the decision to the parent outfit that had tried to distance itself from the move.        
	It is an extraordinary political event in the BJP, unparalleled. It is the first time that any political party in India has picked up an ordinary and relatively inexperienced worker and placed him right on top, Baldev Sharma, editor of the RSSs Hindi mouthpiece, Panchajanya, said.        
	It shows the faith the decision-makers reposed in him. So we have given it the coverage it deserves.        
	Sharmas editorial in the issue dated January 3 said: Organisation and ideology sustain the life of any political party and Gadkari has demonstrated his commitment and priority for both. The BJP was known for its organisation and ideology and had gained popular support and confidence on account of these. The new leaders clear message is that these features will regain their primacy again.        
	The political situation, he added, was fraught with challenges, the biggest of which was restoring credibility in the BJPs trademark slogan of a party with a difference.         
	The editorial was complemented by interviews with BJP functionaries Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, both of whom were confidants of Gadkaris predecessor Rajnath Singh and, by conventional wisdom, unlikely to find a place in the new team.        
	Rudy, who recently withdrew his remarks opposing the BJPs tie-up with the JMM in Jharkhand, said: It is not necessary that only Delhi leaders have the required experience and competence. The BJP is not a family-owned company. Its uniqueness is that it is able to pick competent and experienced persons from any corner of the country because a BJP worker does not belong to a region, he belongs to the country.         
	Like Panchajanya, the January 3 issue of the Organiser heralded Gadkaris arrival with a large cover picture captioned New BJP presi-dent promises a new beginning        
	A report on his first visit to his hometown Nagpur after becoming party president spoke of the unprecedented and historic welcome accorded to the citys beloved Nitin.         
	An article by a Nagpur-based writer and swayamsevak, Virag Pachpore, carried recommendations from non-BJP leaders, including Congress veteran Datta Meghe and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal.         
	While Meghe described Gadkari as intelligent, very practical, efficient and generous with a range of friends from Amitabh Bachchan to Ratan Tata, his Congress colleague Babasaheb Kedar said Gadkaris appointment was a matter of pride for every Vidarbhaite.        
	Despite the Sanghs denial that it had anything to do with Gadkaris appointment, Pachpores piece gave the game away.        
	RSS sarsanghachalak Shri Mohan Bhagwat on a number of occasions voiced his concern over the rumblings, infighting and differences in the BJP and underlined the need for a change in the leadership, the article said.         
	Although he did not project any name, the choice ultimately fell on the young leader from Nagpur.

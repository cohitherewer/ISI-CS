The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata job promise in CPM bastion 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mamata job promise in CPM bastion 
          INDRANIL SARKAR                                            
	Jamalpur, Sept. 18: Mamata Banerjee today promised a job to every family that has lost members in CPM violence across the state if voted to power, the pledge coming in a Left stronghold where her party has made inroads.        
	If we are voted to power in next years Assembly elections, I shall provide a job to at least one family member of those killed in political violence being unleashed by the CPM, the Trinamul Congress chief told a rally at Jamalpur in CPM bastion Burdwan.        
	Mamata said 64 Trinamul activists have been killed by the CPM in the district since her party was formed in 1998, but did not specify till which year the offer would be extended.        
	Trinamul sources said the promise was a ploy to consolidate the partys support in the Left citadel. In last years Lok Sabha polls, we performed better than the previous years in three parliamentary seats in Burdwan district. Now our plan is to consolidate our base in all 21 Assembly segments spread over the three constituencies  Burdwan East, Burdwan-Durgapur and Asansol, said a Trinamul general secretary.        
	Mamata was in Jamalpur today to lodge a protest against the murder of two party supporters on Tuesday, allegedly by CPM workers. The huge turnout indicated the inroads her party has been making here. In the Lok Sabha polls last year, Trinamul won in four of the seven Assembly segments in Burdwan East.         
	Mamata is scheduled to visit Nanoor in Birbhum tomorrow to lead a padayatra. Eleven farmers loyal to her party had been killed there a decade ago in what has come to be known as the Nanoor massacre.        
	Mamata said the CPM had set up over 200 camps in Jungle Mahal where armed cadres had set up base, and gave a seven-day deadline to dismantle them. I am giving a seven-day ultimatum to wind up the CPMs armed camps in Jungle Mahal. If they are not wound up by that time, I shall hit the streets, she said.        
	Sources said Mamatas threat to hit the streets was an attempt to pressure the Centre into taking up the matter with the state government. She has already taken up the issue with Union home minister P. Chidambaram and Bengal governor M.K. Narayanan.        
	Mamata accused the CPM of hiring supari (contract) killers to murder innocent people and threw an open challenge to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to stop the terror and the killings within 72 hours.        
	I am giving an open challenge to the CM to stop these two things within the next 72 hours, she said. If he fails, I can take the responsibility by doing that in a democratic manner.

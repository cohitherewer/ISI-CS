	Mumbai, Nov. 21: Actor Hrithik Roshan was admitted to a Mumbai hospital today after an allergy caused severe swellings in his body.         
	Hrithik, whose latest film Guzaarish directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali released on November 19, was rushed to Kokilaben Ambani hospital in Versova in Mumbais western suburbs this evening around 5pm, family sources said.         
	In a statement released by the Roshan family, Hrithik has been quoted as saying: Ok doctors just confirmed. I experienced an allergic reaction to antibiotic. My lungs just closed, throat went into (a) spasm, couldnt breathe. Lips became ten times bare size. I was rushed to the hospital in time. I am under observation and will be discharged late night. But all good, its always good. I was celebrating Guzaarish at home, now celebrating from here. No different.

	New Delhi, Sept. 12 (PTI): Delhi High Court has said students accused of ragging should not be expelled for life as it would ruin their career and may turn them into anti-social elements.        
	A student in the hands of a principal/head is a child in the hands of a parent and a parent would never want the career of a child to be destroyed by expulsion which necessarily renders him unfit for any other career, Justice Rajiv S. Endlaw said.        
	The court made the observation while directing Delhi University to re-admit two students expelled for ragging juniors in 2009.        
	No college would be willing to grant them admission to enable them to complete their studies, thereby leading to such frustration and disappointment or despondency that may lead to either suicide or turn them into anti-social elements, the court said.        
	Directing the university and Kirori Mal College to re-admit the final-year students, the court said a harsh order such as expulsion results in bitterness.         
	The order came after a plea from the students who said their life and career would be ruined if they were not allowed to complete their course as no other college would admit them.        
	The punishment of expulsion from the college and consequent debarring from admission to any other institution is modified to that of rustication from the college for the academic session 2009-10. The petitioners would thus be entitled to be readmitted to the college after necessary formalities, the court said.

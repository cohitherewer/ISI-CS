          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          AR Rahman in New Delhi on Monday. (Prem Singh)      
	New Delhi, Aug. 16: A.R. Rahman was today showcased at an event to mark the launch of the Commonwealth Games theme song but the music composer said he needed a few more days to put the finishing touches to the number.        
	Instead of putting off the launch till the song is completed, Suresh Kalmadis team used Rahman to deflect the bad press the financial irregularities and construction delays had earned the event.        
	Rahman said: I read a lot of bad stories about the Commonwealth Games during my stay in London. I am sure this is not true. We are doing a lot of positive things here. I would request the media to please portray a positive image of the Delhi Games and India. Thousands of professional people are working on the Games.        
	Rahman said the song was not exactly like Waka Waka, the Fifa World Cup theme song. We wanted to go beyond it. I am sure you will like it when you hear it. The Games disc will be released in 10 days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish justifies AMU action
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitish justifies AMU action
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Nitish Kumar: Hard talk                                  
	Patna, March 30: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today justified his governments decision to set up a branch of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) in the state even as the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) called a Bihar bandh on April 1 to protest the police action on its members here yesterday.        
	A confrontation between the BJP and the JD(U)-led government over the issue came into the open today with a section of BJP legislators questioning the cabinets decision to set up the AMU branch at Kishenganj. The state government has already spared 20-acre land for the purpose.        
	The issue took a bigger political dimension with senior BJP minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey stating that the government should not resort to haste in setting up the AMU branch at Kishenganj.        
	The government should take the view of all parties concerned before going ahead with its decision, he said, while strongly condemning the police lathicharge on the ABVP cadres.         
	He demanded an inquiry into the circumstances in which the police caned the ABVP members who had been protesting setting up of the AMU branch in a democratic way.        
	But differences within the BJP on the issue also cropped up with another senior minister on condition of anonymity saying that it was the Union government, which had sanctioned AMU branches in five states, including Bihar. The Bihar government is simply implementing the decision of the Centre, which the BJP or ABVP cadres should not oppose, he said.        
	Nitish, however, categorically stated that he would not allow any opposition to setting up of the AMU branch at Kishenganj bordering Bengal and Bangladesh. There should be no opposition on the issue as the government is committed to setting up the AMU branch at Kishenganj to improve education in the state. The AMU will be for each and every section of society. It should not be linked to a particular community, he said.        
	Kishenganj is Bihars only Lok Sabha constituency where the Muslims outnumber the Hindus. Muslims constitute 66.7 per cent of the population in Kishenganj. The JD(U) forced the BJP to leave its claim on Kishengaj. But the Congress nominee, Asrarul Haq, won it.        
	The opposition to setting up the AMU might also be a part of the BJPs plan to get its claim on Kishenganj back, for this seat had given Shahnawaz Hussein, a Muslim face to the party. Shahnawaz had won on the BJP ticket from Kishengaj first though now he represents Bhagalpur.

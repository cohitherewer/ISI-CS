The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cabinet clears judge bill

  - Mechanism to look into complaints against judiciary         OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: The Union cabinet today cleared the judicial standards and accountability bill, setting the stage for its introduction in Parliament.         
	This will be the governments second attempt to ensure accountability in the judiciary.         
	The last version  the Judges (Declaration of Assets and Liabilities) Bill, 2009  had met with stiff resistance from all parties in the Rajya Sabha, forcing the government to withdraw it.         
	MPs cutting across political lines had in August last year criticised the bill for a clause that ensured that judges assets were never made public. They had accused the government of laying down different standards for judges, pointing out that politicians were required to make their assets public before contesting elections.         
	The government then promised to work out a consensus before re-introducing a more comprehensive bill. Todays cabinet nod is the first step in that direction.         
	The new bill will require judges to declare their assets and liabilities, provide a mechanism for enquiring into complaints against the judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts and lay down judicial standards.         
	It seeks to replace the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, while retaining its basic features. The 1968 law has been criticised for lacking teeth in dealing with issues such as judicial corruption.         
	Under this Act, in force so far, there is no legal provision for dealing with complaints filed by the public against judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts.         
	Any litigant may forward his complaint to the Chief Justice of India, the chief justices of the high courts or any other judge. Though received, these are rarely dealt with. Thousands of such letters are received daily, according to judicial sources.         
	The new bill will create an official mechanism to deal with complaints. All complaints will go to a scrutiny committee, which in turn will forward them to a judicial oversight committee for action if a prima facie case is made out. The five-member committee, which was earlier to be chaired by the Vice-President, will be headed by a retired Chief Justice of India.         
	At present, judges file their income-tax returns with the Chief Justice of India under a self-set code of conduct for judges. But since this is not done on the basis of a law, the judiciary had sought to avoid making the information public. After much public pressure, they put it on the court website but withheld the details. Those could be accessed only under the Right to Information Act.         
	The Supreme Court registry had also appealed to the apex court against a high court decision declaring the Chief Justice of Indias office under the scope of the Right to Information Act.         
	In the backdrop of a fierce public debate, the government had declared its intention to bring a law to ensure greater transparency and accountability. The enactment of the bill will address growing concerns regarding the need to ensure greater accountability of the higher judiciary, a government release said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish durbar to connect with party
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitish durbar to connect with party
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                         Nitish Kumar      
	Patna, Dec. 27: Nitish Kumars decision to meet his party workers on a regular basis and listen to them is a part of his course correction exercise in his second term as chief minister.        
	There was simmering discontent among the workers who complained about their inaccessibility to the chief minister throughout the first phase of NDA rule. Though Nitish used to meet his workers at party conclaves, the affair was too infrequent to satisfy their interests and wishes.        
	Now the janata darbar programme on every fourth Monday is dedicated to the workers. Todays darbar was the first at which Nitish exclusively interacted with his workers.         
	The move seems to have paid off at the outset. We are happy that the chief minister has decided to meet us regularly, remarked a party worker after meeting the chief minister.        
	Nitish, in a way, has corrected course in dealing with the party cadre. His functioning so far was described by a large section of his own workers as bureaucratic in style. The reason for this was obvious: The chief minister always had IAS officers at his residence and office to assist him. And the workers used to talking in political terms found it hard to have access to Nitish through the officers.        
	One more significant factor that the observers describe as the reason for the chief minister interacting with his party workers is the relatively better performance of the BJP in the Assembly elections. The BJP won 91 seats of the 102 it contested. The Janata Dal (United), in comparison, won 115 seats of the 141 it fielded candidates in.         
	Pundits attributed the BJPs improved show as the outcome of the partys better organisational strength and superior co-ordination between the leadership and its grassroots workers.         
	All of us know that a large portion of the electorate voted for the BJPs nominees in Nitish Kumars name or with the desire to bring the Nitish-led government back to power. But the coordination between the leaders and workers in the BJP was better oiled, remarked a senior BJP leader.        
	Apparently, meeting the workers and getting their feedback every month through the platform of the janata darbar is expected to establish a better coordination between the JD (U) and the chief minister.        
	What might have satisfied the chief minister was the fact that about 800 workers who interacted with him today were drawn from almost all parts of the state. They would have given him their feedback about the state of the party and also the work going on in their respective regions.        
	The chief minister has decided to keep the workers darbar an internal affair. Almost all his ministers were present, but abiding by his guidelines, they preferred not to divulge what transpired between the workers and them.         
	I am not authorised to speak on the issue, said rural development minister Bhim Singh when asked to comment on todays darbar.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, March 6: A 21-year-old computer student said to be an active member of terror outfit Indian Mujahideen was last night arrested close to the Nepal border after police laid a trap following a tip-off.        
	A top police officer said Salman Ansari, a resident of alleged terror hub Azamgarh from where at least seven Indian Mujahideen suspects have been picked up since the September 2008 Delhi blasts, had a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head.        
	Sources in the Uttar Pradesh anti-terrorism squad (ATS) said Salman alias Chhotu was involved in a number of blasts in Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and Delhi.        
	Three explosions killed some 20 people in Varanasi on March 7, 2006, which means if the ATS claim is true, Salman had taken to terror as a 17-year-old.        
	We dont know who Salman is. I dont know if the police have picked up another innocent youth. We are not shocked anymore, said Maulana Ismail Siddiqui, a cleric in Azamgarh.         
	A source in the state police department said Salman, a student of the government-run Azamgarh High School when the Varanasi blasts took place, may not have been involved in that strike.        
	His name began to figure among suspects since the Delhi blasts of September 2008. It was Delhi police who came to know about a suspect called Salman skilled in computer who was helping the Indian Mujahideen and who also happened to be from Azamgarh. So it was Delhi police who wired his name to Uttar Pradesh and other states in December 2008, the source said.        
	Actually, Uttar Pradesh police wanted to keep him for some time in custody for interrogation. So his name was tagged with the Varanasi blasts so that the police could pray for his custody when they produced him in court, the source added.        
	Uttar Pradesh additional director-general of police Brij Lal said Delhi police had announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for any clue that could lead to Salmans arrest.        
	Lal said Salman had in May 2008 enrolled for a course in Bachelor of Computer Applications at a private college in Lucknow. In April 2009, he went underground. His next base was Nepal, the officer added.        
	Another senior officer said Salman couldnt be arrested as he kept changing names. On December 12, 2009, he left for Pakistan to attend a training camp under the name Fahad Ansari, on a fake passport he managed to get from Nepal. After the training, he returned to Nepal on January 22, 2010, he added.         
	In the camp, he learnt to make bombs and trained himself as a fidayeen attacker who could handle sophisticated firearms, including AK 47s.        
	Sources in the ATS said they got a tip-off that a member of the Indian Mujahideen had been helping terror modules in districts of Nepal bordering Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.        
	A trap was laid yesterday at Dhebrua town in Siddharthnagar district which borders Nepal and is about 300km from Lucknow.        
	When Salman reached Dhebrua around 9 last night, the waiting policemen arrested him.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, June 24: The Omar Abdullah government has started arresting separatist leaders and booking them under stringent laws for spearheading the current wave of protests against alleged civilian killings.        
	Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani has been booked under the Public Safety Act, which allows detention without trial up to two years. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who leads the Hurriyats moderate faction, has been placed under house arrest. The actions against both leaders have been taken within the past 24 hours.        
	According to police sources, a few dozen separatist leaders, most of them from the Hurriyats hardline camp, have also been arrested, along with several alleged stone throwers. The trigger for the fresh round of protests has been the death of three Srinagar youths, allegedly at the hands of security forces, over the past week.         
	One of the youths was killed on Sunday when security forces fired at a group of mourners who had gathered in front of a Srinagar hospital.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Deepan Banerjee                           
	Mumbai, Aug. 14: Police said Howrah boy Deepan Banerjee was killed by the person who supplied him food and two of his accomplices when the young engineer tried to stop them from robbing him.        
	We have arrested three persons. One of them is the man who used to supply food to him at his Navi Mumbai apartment. We have seized Deepans cellphone, laptop and camera from him, said ACP Purushottam Karad.        
	He said the trio had come to the techies house at 7.30pm on Tuesday.         
	Deepan seems to have ushered them into his living room. They killed him when he tried to thwart a robbery attempt, Karad said.

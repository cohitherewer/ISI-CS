The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Friendly China border
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Friendly China border
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 21: The Indo-Tibetan Border Police chief today said there were no hostilities by the Chinese on Indias friendly border, the statement drawing notice at a time Delhi has quietly lifted a bar on visits by Chinese defence officials imposed since July.        
	R.K. Bhatia, the ITBP director-general, said: The border is a friendly border... even the government thinks so that is why there is no marking. I am completely ruling out any hostilities or unfriendly activities. To our notice, there is no infiltration.         
	Bhatia was speaking to reporters in the run-up to the 49th raising day of the force on October 24.         
	On October 19, The Telegraph reported that Shen Dingli, a Chinese professor and strategist who advocates that Beijing set up military bases in Pakistan, had been invited to a National Defence College meet in Delhi.        
	Bhatias assertion came close on the heels of army chief V.K. Singhs statement describing Pakistan and China as major irritants and defence minister A.K. Antonys recent warning about Chinas assertiveness in its military posturing. Bhatias words were also in contrast with former ITBP chief V.K. Joshi in October 2007.         
	Joshi had said that in 2007, over 140 intrusions by the Chinese were reported. The remarks had offended Beijing.         
	When told about the army chiefs statement, Bhatia said: The army has its own mandate, the ministry of external affairs is involved and I cannot comment on what they say.

	The anti-India terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan is intact and currently 42 terror camps are being run, army chief General V.K. Singh told PTI.

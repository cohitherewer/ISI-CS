The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Climate change disclosures, but only to UN
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Climate change disclosures, but only to UN

	New Delhi, Jan. 24: India, Brazil, China and South Africa today announced that they would disclose their voluntary climate-change mitigation actions to the UN climate agency by January 31, a deadline set by the Copenhagen Accord.        
	But the four countries iterated that the accord was just a political pact, and that the legitimate process for climate-change negotiations should be the existing two-track multilateral negotiations under the UN system.        
	A ministerial meeting  the first after the Copenhagen climate summit last month  of the four so-called BASIC nations also called on industrialised countries to release during 2010 the $10-billion climate funds for the poorest countries.        
	This is the first milestone that has to be achieved, Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh said after a seven-hour meeting with ministers from Brazil, China and South Africa to determine joint strategies on climate change.        
	Ramesh said the movement of climate funds from the rich countries to Africa, the least developed countries and small island states in 2010 would be a proof of commitment. If they (the funds) do not flow, the industrialised countries are not serious, he said.        
	But the four countries, which had played a key role in finalising the Copenhagen Accord during the summits final hours and pulled it back from the brink of collapse, iterated their support for the existing two-track process of negotiations.        
	Todays call comes amid concerns that some industrialised countries want the accord to evolve into a new legally binding agreement that would, in effect, make the existing two-track negotiations redundant.         
	But the BASIC countries said they would communicate their voluntary mitigation actions to the UN climate agency by January 31. Each of the four countries has on its own announced various steps to curb its emissions.        
	We participated in the Copenhagen Accord process. We feel obligated to what we were part of, said Buyelwa Sonjica, South Africas minister of water and environment. We will meet this deadline. But we are not putting an obligation on others, he added.        
	South Africa has committed itself to a 34 per cent deviation from business as usual by 2020 and a 42 per cent deviation by 2025, but only on the condition that it receives financial aid and technology from the industrialised countries, a South African official said.         
	An Indian negotiator said each country would independently communicate its actions to the UN climate agency. India had earlier announced a domestic commitment of reducing carbon intensity by 20 to 25 per cent from 2005 levels by 2020.        
	The climate-change talks were intended to finalise different sets of actions by the developed and developing countries to curb their emissions of greenhouse gases responsible for global warming.         
	Climate-change analysts believe the declaration of support by the BASIC countries today for the two-track negotiations process reiterates their rejection of suggestions that a new agreement should replace the existing negotiations.

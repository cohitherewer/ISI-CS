The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IITs eye visa freedom to tap foreign students
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      IITs eye visa freedom to tap foreign students

	New Delhi, Sept. 5: The IITs apex decision-making council will meet on Friday to discuss a proposal to allow foreign research scholars get visas faster by cutting out bureaucratic processing of applications in Delhi.         
	The proposed system, akin to what American universities and embassies follow, would require the aspiring research scholar to submit his research proposal to an IIT professor.         
	The proposal will be assessed and if approved, the director of that IIT will issue a letter to the Indian embassy or high commission in the researchers country of residence for issuance of a student visa.         
	The process followed now is different.         
	At present, the applications of foreign students are sent by the IITs to the human resource development ministry for processing. The HRD ministry then sends the applications to the external affairs ministry because it deals with embassies. The applications are also sent to the home ministry for a security clearance.         
	The proposed system will make the process of visa issuance faster and help the institutes get more foreign students, IIT Guwahati director Gautam Baruah said.         
	He said the institutes were unable to give admission to many foreign students as they failed to know whether those students would get student visas.         
	The process now takes more time. If the visa process is done fast, the institutes will be able to better manage the filling up of seats, he said.         
	Baruah favoured giving scholarships to the foreign students. When our students are getting scholarship from foreign institutes while doing research, why should a similar facility not be offered in the IITs? he asked.        
	IIT Madras director M.S. Ananth told The Telegraph: The universities in the US issue I-20 forms to interested students from foreign countries. These forms, which provide supporting information for the issuance of a student visa, are directly entertained by the US embassies. If a similar system is introduced here, the IITs will get more foreign students.

	Hyderabad, Aug. 26: Five candidates caught copying in their law examinations have turned out to be judges.        
	The five district judges have been suspended after they were filmed on camera while cheating during their Master of Law (LLM) examination in Warangal yesterday.        
	One of the judges was found copying from a book hidden under his answer sheet, Kakatiya University sources said. Written slips and pages torn from textbooks were allegedly seized from the other judges. The invigilators seized all the material and stopped the judges from writing any further.        
	Chief Justice Nisar Ahmad Kakru suspended the five judges after receiving an interim report from Dr T. Manohar, the additional controller of examinations of Kakatiya University, Warangal.        
	The chief justice has asked the state government to register cases against the judges, who are all members of the state judicial service, and explore the possibility of disciplinary action against them.        
	If the judges are convicted in a cheating case, they could be jailed for a month but are more likely to be let off with a fine. The government can stop their promotions and increments for three years, and the university can expel them.        
	The judiciary is the final recourse for common people to get justice. If the judges indulge in this kind of malpractice, how can you trust the judgment of the courts? asked Warangal District Bar Association member Ravi Kumar.        
	Clearing the LLM would have made the judges eligible for promotions and pay hikes. They had all taken the universitys distance education course and had appeared in the first-year examinations in Warangal, 150km from Hyderabad.        
	The five judges are: Ajitsimha Rao, senior civil judge; Vijayender Reddy, second additional district judge of Ranga Reddy district; M. Kistappa, senior civil judge of Anantapur; Srinivasa Chary, senior civil judge of Baptla; and Hanumantha Rao, additional junior civil judge of Warangal.        
	Four lawyers too were caught copying and barred from appearing in the remaining two written papers, scheduled during the week.        
	Last year, a senior IAS officer was caught cheating at a law examination of Osmania University in Hyderabad.        
	Many senior IAS and IPS officers in Andhra Pradesh opt to earn law degrees and practise in the courts after retirement. Former CBI director K. Vijayarama Rao had graduated in law and practised in the high court for a while before joining the Telugu Desam Party and becoming a minister in the Chandrababu Naidu cabinet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mumbai date with King Khan   Men in khaki create stage for bravery
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mumbai date with King Khan     Men in khaki create stage for bravery
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Actors Pooja and Kabir Bedi outside a Mumbai cinema where tickets for the first show of My Name is Khan were sold out on Friday. (PTI)                                        
	Mumbai, Feb. 12: Fridays at the INOX multiplex in the business hub of Nariman Point are usually not a huge crowd-puller, except for the first-day-first-show.         
	Otherwise, it is the territory of rich and bored housewives from adjoining tony areas and sundry people who need to kill time.        
	This Friday, though, the audience was not a purposeless bunch out to pass time. For most, it was a planned and pre-meditated visited to the cinema to show solidarity with King Khan.        
	Like Alpana Kamath.        
	Alpana, 22, and her giggling girlie bunch from JJ School of Art had skipped a date with the much-talked-about Raell Padamsee stage-production for the ongoing Kalaghoda Festival.        
	It was not about a movie. It was about making a statement about civil liberties and raising a voice against Shiv Senas time-worn terror tactics, she said in dead earnest.        
	Her friends cooed: Oh yeah? Actually, she ditched a date with Raell for a blind date with Shah Rukh.        
	Alpana, like many others, including Karim Khan, 34, who had come with five cousins, had queued up outside the INOX theatre since 8 in the morning for tickets of My Name is Khan.        
	But the first-day-first-show eluded them as the theatre had to accommodate VIPs like Maharashtra home minister R.R. Patil, his aides and a massive retinue of security personnel.        
	The crowd didnt give up though and waited for the next show. Alpana was the first to enter the theatre with her friends at 2.50pm.        
	On the street outside, police at a checkpoint frisked moviegoers and passers-by alike while shooing off television camera crews.        
	Some moviegoers rehearsed grand statements before their families before delivering them to the cameras.        
	I feel like an evangelist on a mission, said Shanta Dholakia, a 64-year-old woman.        
	Although neither Karim nor Alpana would acknowledge it, the presence of 75 policemen outside the theatre helped most feel secure.        
	Inside, the men in khaki  at least 10 of them  chaperoned the patrons to their seats after a series of checks.        
	There was a general murmur of surprise as the movie began without the mandatory national anthem played in Mumbai halls.        
	As the saga of Rizwan Khan (Shah Rukh) and Mandira, played by Kajol, rolled on, seats kept filling up, though the first three rows stayed vacant as police guidelines had advised.        
	Half an hour later, Priya Damani, 36, floundered her way into the theatre with two autistic children in tow  and almost tripped in the darkness. Karims cousin Shanawaz leaned out from the aisle to help her and the kids.        
	When intermission came, Karim called out to the cops.        
	Kya, abhi Cola, popcorn milega, (Can we get Cola and popcorn)? he asked, speaking for many in the hall. INOX had decided against sale of food and beverages in the theatre for security reasons.        
	Koi Cola screen pe phekega to tu paisa bharega kya (If someone throws Cola at the screen, would you pay for the damages), a cop retorted.         
	The second half began and Karim decided to play to the gallery.        
	Arre yaar, film hai ya fatwa? Khana peena nahin theatre mein to multiplex kya. Upar se yeh pakau movie (Is this a film or a fatwa? What sort of multiplex is this that doesnt allow food and drinks? On top of that the film is a drag), he grumbled to general laughter. A little later he convinced his cousins to leave the theatre with him as he found the movie too slow.         
	A family of seven sniffed in unison as tragedy struck the Khans in the movie.        
	I teach autistic children. I had planned to bring my entire class of 10. But their parents were scared because of the Sena threat  except for Rehaan and Alok, she said.        
	So did Rehaan and Alok like the movie?        
	My Name is Khan, they beamed back.

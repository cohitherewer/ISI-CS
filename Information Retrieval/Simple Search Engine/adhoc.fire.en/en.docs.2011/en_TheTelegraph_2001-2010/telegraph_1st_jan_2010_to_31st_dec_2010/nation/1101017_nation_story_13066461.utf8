  - Kalmadi failed to win confidence: CM        PTI AND OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sheila Dikshit                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 16: Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, who was cheered loudly by the crowds at the Commonwealth Games, today said organising committee chief Suresh Kalmadi was booed because he had failed to win peoples confidence.        
	I think, unfortunately, Suresh was not able to win confidence... they cheered me because I am the face they see, she said.         
	Dikshit said the corruption charges were very disturbing and added that the needle of suspicion points to the organising committee, which had been given Rs 1,600 crore as loan by the Centre.        
	The fact that the Prime Minister has taken almost an instantaneous decision to order a probe into the whole thing and have the picture ready by January, that I think is very heartening, she said.         
	A committee headed by former comptroller and auditor general V.K. Shunglu is probing the corruption allegations.        
	I think only this committee will be able to clear the cobwebs. At the moment the suspicion is very much on the organising committee, Dikshit said.        
	The Centre had given a number of loans and that is where the real corruption is. There may have also been (corruption) in some government departments. I am not ruling that out, she said.         
	On allegations that the Games Village was filthy and unliveable before the event, the chief minister said the builders Emaar MGF, the Delhi Development Authority and the organising committee would have to share the blame.        
	How do you take over from a builder when the railings of the balcony are not there? How do you take over from the builder when the lifts are not functioning? Why did the DDA do that and then if the DDA had done it, why did the organising committee take it over in the condition it was? Dikshit asked.        
	The Delhi government was given the charge of getting the Village ready about a week ahead of the Games. Asked whether Delhi was ready to host the Olympics, the chief minister said: We have the confidence today. We can bid... Whether we can get it or not is a different matter. I think the world also has the confidence that we can do it despite the fact that we got very, very poor publicity.         
	Credit to PC         
	As the race for claiming credit for the Games begins, P. Chidambaram has become a contender.        
	But for the foolproof security arrangements, the Commonwealth Games would not have been a success as they turned out to be, the home minister wrote in a congratulatory letter to Delhi police commissioner Y.S. Dadwal.        
	Delhi police comes under the Union home ministry, so any praise of the force in any case comes back to North Block. Chidambaram also wrote personal congratulatory letters to the venue commanders from Delhi police and asked Dadwal to include these in their annual confidential reports.         
	The minister visited the camp of the womens battalion of Naga police and commended their performance.        
	When Dikshit claimed credit for the Games, Chidambaram lauded the people of Delhi for adjusting to the stringent security measures and not complaining. He said the security arrangements had won the gratitude of both athletes and spectators.        
	He also said his ministry would provide inputs, if asked, for the corruption probe. Kalmadi is under fire but with the audit covering everything from collapsed bridges to overpriced locks, urban development minister Jaipal Reddy and Dikshit might also come under the scanner.

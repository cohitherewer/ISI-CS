                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rahul ends AMU deadlock 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Aligarh Muslim University                                  
	Lucknow, Dec. 20: Students of Aligarh Muslim University ended their two-and-a-half-month agitation today after vice-chancellor P.K. Abdul Aziz promised that the process of reviving the students union, disbanded in 2007, would begin soon.        
	 The university authorities have agreed to start the election process from January 3, 2011, a statement issued by the vice-chancellors office said. Election to fill the students body and also for the 10 student representatives from different faculties to the University Court will commence in strict adherence to recommendations of the Lyngdoh Committee.         
	A spokesperson for the students, Mushtaq Ahmed, thanked Congress MP Rahul Gandhi for taking up the union issue with human resource development minister Kapil Sibal.        
	On October 26, Rahul had received a delegation of AMU students who pleaded with him to urge the vice-chancellor to restore the union. The Amethi MP met Sibal on October 30 to ask why the union could not be restored. Negotiations between the ministry and the vice-chancellor followed.         
	The vice-chancellor in a great gesture came late last night to the protest site and met us. His assurance to conduct the polls as per the recommendations of the Lyngdoh Committee was sincere and sounded convincing to us. So we have decided to call off the 78-day protest, another student, Naeem Khan, said.        
	Aziz, who had to flee his residence on the campus after students gheraoed it in October, decided to return home today from the guest house where he has been staying for the past two months.        
	The suspension order against five students leading the protest will be withdrawn, university authorities said.        
	Rahul had visited the AMU campus in December last year and urged students to join politics. One student had then asked if a Muslim could be Prime Minister of India.         
	Students of Banaras Hindu University have now decided to pressure the authorities to restore the union they had suspended in 1997.         
	Rahul had raised the question of BHU, too, with Sibal in October this year but the authorities had said a students council, which had replaced the union, was doing just fine. But the students are unhappy because the council is not an elected body.         
	Ravindra Shukla, a student leader at Allahabad University, said the demand for holding polls in the university has become shriller after the success of the AMU protest. Elections in the central university have been suspended since 2008 following violence on the campus.

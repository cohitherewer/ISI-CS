          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, March 20: The seal was put today for the countrys first underwater railway network to start in the city.        
	The Calcutta Metro Railway Corporation today signed a memorandum of understanding with a consortium formed by Afcons Infrastructure Ltd and Russias Transtonnelstroy Limited who will build the length of the East-West Metro link from central Calcutta (close to the Central Metro station) to Howrah Maidan  the route running under the Hooghly river bed.        
	Afcons is the infrastructure arm of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group.         
	In the bidding, the consortium bagged a Rs 938-crore deal from Metro, the nodal agency for the Rs 4,676-crore East West Metro project.        
	The Howrah Maidan-Central stretch will have three stations  Howrah Maidan, Howrah station and Mahakaran (near Writers Buildings)  which will also be constructed by the consortium.         
	There will also be a station close to the present Central Metro station, but the Indo-Russian partnership will not build that. The plan is to complete the project in 42 months.         
	At Howrah station, the Metro station will be built underground between platforms 17 and 18.        
	This is the first time in India that a transportation tunnel project is being laid under a river and hence is challenging. The latest technology will be used, said Ramakrishna V. Ramanan, the director, transportation, Afcons Infrastructure.         
	The tunnel under the Hooghly will approximately be 30 metres under the water surface and 15 meters below the river bed, a Metro official said.         
	There will be twin tunnels (under the river), which means two tunnels will be built for trains moving in opposite directions. The tunnels will have connecting passages for maintenance and safety work, said P. Jayaram, the vice-president of Afcons.         
	Officials in Afcons informed that the tunnels would be built using the earth pressure balancing method. A tunnel-boring machine will drill a hole into the earth and a concrete support will be put in place simultaneously so that the soft earth does not refill the tunnelled path. The drilling work will start from the Howrah Maidan end and the target is to drill 300m every month, said Jayaram.        
	In a fortnight, soil testing will start and based on the report, the final design will be prepared. Metro officials said there would be provisions for footpath for safety of passengers inside the tunnels. In case of emergency, the connecting passages can be used, an official informed.         
	The East-West Metro project from Salt Lake Sector V is above ground till Phoolbagan from which point the trains will run underground.

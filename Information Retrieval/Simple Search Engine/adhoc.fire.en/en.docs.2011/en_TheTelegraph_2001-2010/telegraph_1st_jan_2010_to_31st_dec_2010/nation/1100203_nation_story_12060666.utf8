          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Vaishnavi with her parents                                  
	Hyderabad, Feb. 2: The father of the kidnapped schoolgirl whose body was found yesterday died this morning after suffering a heart attack, unable to bear the shock of the loss of his daughter whose freedom he was willing to buy at any cost.        
	P. Prabhakar, 50, a liquor merchant from the coastal Andhra city of Vijayawada, suffered a cardiac arrest late last night, hours after he was informed that his 11-year-old daughter Naga Vaishnavi had been killed by her captors.         
	Vaishnavi had been kidnapped on Saturday morning when she was on the way to school. Her charred body was found in Guntur, around 35km from Vijayawada and 310km from Hyderabad.        
	The police who carried out a futile search claimed to have made a breakthrough by arresting Venkatrao Gowd, a brother of Prabhakars first wife Venkataravamma who was locked in a property dispute with the liquor businessman.        
	The body was recovered near a foundry which is owned by Gowd and his family.        
	Close aides of the liquor merchant said that soon after Vaishnavi was abducted, the second time she met with such a fate in her short life, Prabhakar sent a message through the underworld that he was willing to pay any amount of money in exchange for his daughters freedom.        
	Prabhakar issued appeals to the abductors through TV channels and also via radio not to harm the young girl.         
	The businessman, who had at least a dozen liquor stores in Vijayawada and several in coastal towns such as Guntur and Visakhapatnam, was confident that his darling daughter will be safe wherever she was.         
	He performed special pujas at the Kanakadurga temple and also organised meals for the poor, asking in return for their prayers for the safe return of his child.        
	Prabhakar had married Venkataravamma, who was his niece being his sisters daughter, in the late eighties and the two have a 16-year-old son.        
	Sources said problems arose in the mid-nineties when the businessman secretly married Narmada Devi, with whom he had two children, Sai Tejesh, 14, and Vaishnavi.        
	Sources said that soon after Venkatravammas family severed all business ties with Prabhakar.         
	The quarrel intensified following reports that Prabhakar had transferred his entire property worth about Rs 50 crore in the name of his daughter.        
	Venkataravamma told reporters and the police last night that she was not behind the kidnap and would not dream of harming the child. My fight is against my mava (ex-husband), she said.        
	Today, after news broke of Gowds arrest, she distanced herself from her brothers, Gowd and Srinivas Rao, saying she had no links with them.         
	Along with Gowd, the police have taken into custody his associates Chinni and Marla Srinivas Rao. A massive hunt has been launched for the killer gangs which executed the kidnap and later the gruesome murder of the girl.        
	Investigators said the gang members waylaid Vaishnavi, a Class IV student, when she and her brother were headed for their Nalluri Saint Mathews School in the family car around 8am.         
	The criminals stabbed to death the driver Lakshman Rao and drove the car towards Guntur.         
	Her brother Sai Tejesh escaped.         
	The two motorbikes they had used to reach the spot of abduction had fake registration numbers and were stolen from two separate bars. Both bars belonged to the Gowd family.        
	At Tadepalli railway bridge near Guntur, the captors made Vaishnavi change from her school dress into casual clothes they had brought with them. They then handed over the girl to another gang, which was responsible for her death.        
	The investigators are still not sure how the girl died. One theory us that she protested and cried, prompting the kidnappers to strangulate her. The other theory is that her captors put her in a plastic container to escape the police dragnet at several checkposts around Vijayawada and Guntur. The child died of suffocation.         
	The investigators said after her death, the gang members called up Gowd who apparently instructed them to take the body to a foundry of Sharada Industries owned by Marla Srinivas Rao, his relative, at Autonagar in Guntur. The kidnappers threw her body in a furnace used to melt old nuts and bolts.        
	Vijayawada observed a spontaneous bandh to protest against the gruesome murder. Friends of Vaishnavi and her teachers at Nalluri Saint Mathews School conducted a condolence meeting on the school premises. I miss my best friend, said Prema, her close friend.        
	They described Vaishnavi as a jovial and studious girl who mixed with everyone. They said Vaishnavi would often narrate her previous day of horror when she was kidnapped five years ago and released after almost a day in captivity.        
	 Chief minister K. Rosaiah has asked Vijayawada police to speed up investigations and promised to set up a special court to try the accused.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CM by mistake squirms
  - Rosaiah says he is tired of being teased by his ministers        G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Rosaiah                                        
	Hyderabad, Oct. 28: Ask K. Rosaiah what his mistake is, and he will leave you in no doubt. He is not YSR.        
	The Andhra Pradesh chief minister, tossed into the hot seat after Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys death in a helicopter crash last year, is a frustrated CEO whose writ doesnt even cross the doors of his office.        
	Sometimes orders go directly from his ministers to officials with a note saying the CM has approved.        
	But what riles him the most is the open criticism by not only the Opposition but also his own party leaders.        
	The anger and the frustration slipped out yesterday when the Congress veteran summed up his predicament. I know I have become the chief minister by mistake or misfortune, he told a media conference.        
	I am fed up with the twitters and teasing by my own cabinet members who have been backbiting against me both in party circles and in public, he said.        
	Several times Rosaiah has asked the high command for permission to shuffle his cabinet. But every time his request has been turned down.        
	Four times I went to Delhi with proposals for a cabinet shuffle but the high command does not want to change anything till a decision on Telangana, he said.        
	When Rosaiah raised the issue before Veerappa Moily, the Union minister in charge of the partys Andhra affairs, he was curtly told: You are not YSR and if you do so, the Congress will lose both the government and the state.        
	The comment sums up Rosaiahs position  chief minister by mistake, hemmed in by party.        
	After the Assembly bypolls in July, in which the Congress failed to win even a single seat, the high command pressured Rosaiah to postpone civic body elections, including the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation.        
	The bypolls had followed the resignation of nearly a dozen Telangana MLAs, and the results made the party wary of wading into another poll battle when a decision was still pending on the demand for a separate Telangana state.        
	The party also turned down Rosaiahs request for a probe by the CBI or the anti-corruption bureau into a Rs 1,200-crore land scam in which several Congress leaders, including some close to the late YSR, are allegedly involved.         
	The high command also rejected Rosaiahs plea to change the state unit chief.        
	Rosaiahs latest humiliation was over a government order he had to reverse within 48 hours of issuing it.        
	On October 23, the state government had issued the order renaming Telugu Lalitakala Thoranam, an open auditorium in Hyderabad, as Rajiv Lalitakala Thoranam after the former Prime Minister. The renaming was one of the conditions set by party Rajya Sabha MP T. Subbirami Reddy who donated Rs 10 crore for the theatres modernisation.        
	Following public furore and a campaign by Opposition parties, the Rosaiah administration issued another order within 48 hours renaming the auditorium as Rajiv Telugu Lalitakala Thoranam. His own party had forced him to make the compromise.         
	After the repeated humiliations, Rosaiah wrote a personal letter to party chief Sonia Gandhi, saying he wanted to quit.        
	The 78-year-old leader said apart from health concerns, he could no longer bear the humiliation and insults. In the evening of my five-decade-long political career in the state, I wish to depart with dignity and honour. he said.        
	According to sources in the high command, Sonia personally telephoned Rosaiah and urged him to stay put for some more time. You were chosen as nobody else could have held the party and government intact in those troubled hours. We respect your sentiments and also health concerns. But the party needs you more, she told him, a party source said.

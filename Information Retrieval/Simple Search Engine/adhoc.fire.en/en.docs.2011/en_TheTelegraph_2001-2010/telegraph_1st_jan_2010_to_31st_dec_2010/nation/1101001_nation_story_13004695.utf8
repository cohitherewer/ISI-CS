The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Elders sad, young want to move on
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Elders sad, young want to move on
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          Md Salman                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: As the verdict flashed on TV, Abdus Subhan leaned back in despair.        
	Its a very sad day, said the 65-year-old.        
	For hours he had waited, biding the hours as the clock ticked towards 4.30.        
	We waited long and wanted the verdict to go in our favour. We are very disappointed, murmured the elderly man.        
	Several others, most of them around his age, nodded, faces taut with tension.        
	So it was all over then?        
	Md Iman doesnt think so.        
	What is the point in fighting over masjid or mandir? Let it be what the court says. We should now think how to uplift our community, said the 25-year-old, who owns a shoe shop in Matia Mahal near Jama Masjid. He then walked up to one of the elderly men, who embraced him, tears streaming down his cheeks.        
	The contrast between the two generations couldnt have been clearer  one that has lived through the horror of 92, the other ready to put it behind.        
	So has India moved ahead?         
	Definitely, said Md Salman, 17. And everybody must accept the courts verdict.        
	We live in the present and dont want any disturbance because of what happened 18 years ago, said another young man, Adnan Sagar. We want to move on and we respect the verdict.         
	Sagar, who was six when the Babri mosque was stormed, is now doing his MBA. Its a big day for all Indians that the court has come out with its verdict. There is no reason for any party to celebrate or feel sad, he said as the sound of azaan broke through the brooding stillness of evening.        
	Near the historic Jama Masjid, the streets were almost deserted. Shops were open but there were hardly any customers. The footfall was not even 10 per cent today, people were too scared to come out, said an employee of Karims, a restaurant near the mosque.        
	But this fear was different from the terror of 1992.        
	It was terrible then. The area was under curfew and business was bad, recalled Avtaar Singh.         
	The garment trader in Chandni Chowk, less than a kilometre from Jama Masjid, looked happy that the young generation had moved on. Its a good sign, he said. It sends a positive signal.

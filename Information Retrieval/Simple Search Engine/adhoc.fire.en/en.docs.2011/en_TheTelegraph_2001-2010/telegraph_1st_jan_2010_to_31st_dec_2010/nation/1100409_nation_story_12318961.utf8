          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 8: Madam President, Sonia Gandhi wants to speak to you.        
	Or so the caller claimed.        
	Police are probing several crank calls to Rashtrapati Bhavan after a man who said he was calling from 10 Janpath, the Congress chiefs residence, said Sonia wanted an urgent meeting with Pratibha Patil.        
	At exactly 11am on March 28, the caller, speaking in a smattering of Hindi and English, called the Rashtrapati Bhavan telephone exchange and asked to be put through to Patil.        
	The man, who introduced himself as Shailendra, said Sonia had an appointment with the President.        
	He was politely told this wasnt the number where such calls were made and was given another number.        
	About 9pm the same day, the exchange staff again received a call from him saying he wanted to speak to Patil. He was again told that the Presidents private secretary was available on the hotline only. The caller was asked to leave his number with the exchange and assured that his call would be returned.        
	This is when the caller became abusive. He vented his anger on the staff and then banged the phone down, said a police officer.        
	The exchange staff immediately filed a complaint with Rashtrapati Bhavan police who forwarded it to the special cell of Delhi police.        
	When the police checked with 10 Janpath, they werent surprised to learn that no one by the name Shailendra was part of the staff. The police are now tracking the call.

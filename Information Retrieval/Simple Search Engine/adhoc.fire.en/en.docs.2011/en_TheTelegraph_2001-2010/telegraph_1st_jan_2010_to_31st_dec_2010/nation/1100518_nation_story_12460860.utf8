The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NTR son eyes party reins
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      NTR son eyes party reins
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          NT Rama Rao                                  
	Hyderabad, May 17: Nandamuri Balakrishna was presented a silver comb on his 14th birthday by father and actor N.T. Rama Rao. Now Balakrishna, an actor pushing 50, is eyeing the reins of the party NTR founded.        
	Spurred by the success of his latest film Simha, Balakrishna has set sights on the Telugu Desam Partys (TDP) mantle he believes was usurped by his brother-in-law Chandrababu Naidu. Naidu had opposed NTRs move in 1985 to name Balakrishna as his political heir, saying it would perpetuate family succession. Balakrishna was 25 then and NTR the chief minister.        
	Now, Balakrishna has signalled he wants to break the 25-year-old jinx in politics. Last week, he declared he was keen to take the party top post and contest elections. Balakrishnas move has led to a churning within the Desam, where some want him inducted as a full-time functionary to revive the glamour and charm of NTR, attributes on which the party was set up in 1980.         
	This section feels Balakrishnas star status will help the party recover from the string of poll reverses  including the debacle in last years Assembly and Lok Sabha polls  and counter the appeal of star Chiranjeevis party.        
	But others feel Balakrishna is also trying to upstage another possible family rival  NTR junior, the Desam founders grandson who is also a popular star. NTR juniors father is Harikrishna, NTRs third son. But Naidu himself does not appear to be ready to bow out and wants to usher son Nara Lokesh into politics in 2014.

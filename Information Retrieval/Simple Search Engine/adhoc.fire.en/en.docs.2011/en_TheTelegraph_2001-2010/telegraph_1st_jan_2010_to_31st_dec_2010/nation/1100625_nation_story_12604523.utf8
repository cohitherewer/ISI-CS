          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Jaswant Singh at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi on Thursday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                  
	New Delhi, June 24: The BJP reinducted Jaswant Singh into its fold 10 months after he was expelled for contentious lines on Mohammad Ali Jinnah that the leader had written in his book, and by which he stood today too.        
	The party decided to expel him at a chintan baithak in Shimla in August 2009.         
	Singh, the MP from Darjeeling, had then said he had gone from being BJPs Hanuman to its Ravan.         
	Todays event at the BJP headquarters to welcome him back seemed well orchestrated. It was attended by most of the BJPs top-rung leaders and Singhs family.         
	At a news conference that followed, the leaders revealed only what they wanted to, leaving many questions unanswered.         
	Asked about his comments on Jinnah, Singh told a TV channel: I cannot disown the book on Jinnah... historical facts about Jinnah cant be wished away just because we disagree.         
	He, however, said the Kandahar controversy, which pitted him against Advani on the issue of national security, was a closed chapter.         
	In his book, Jinnah  India, Partition, Independence, Singh has said Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel were more responsible for the Partition than Jinnah. He also said the Pakistan founder was a secular leader  a point of view unacceptable to the Sangh parivar.        
	Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi banned the book in his state.        
	Today, BJP president Nitin Gadkari said the past is the past and hoped that Singh would work to make the partys future bright. Gadkari said the party was in need of Singhs expertise in finance, foreign affairs and defence.         
	Singh profusely thanked Advani for taking the initiative to bring him back to the BJP of which he is a founding member.         
	It is good to be back in familiar surroundings. I wish to unreservedly express my gratitude to Advaniji who took the initiative, Singh said.         
	The 72-year-old leader was flanked by Advani, Gadkari, and Sushma Swaraj, leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, among others.        
	I was hurt and humiliated by what I had encountered, said Singh about his expulsion. Advani said: I am very happy. With happiness there is also a sense of relief. I welcome him (back). He recounted how he had met Singh several years back in Rajasthan.         
	The first signs that Singh would be back in the BJP were seen last month when Advani asked the MP to accompany him to Bhairon Singh Shekhawats funeral in the same aircraft.

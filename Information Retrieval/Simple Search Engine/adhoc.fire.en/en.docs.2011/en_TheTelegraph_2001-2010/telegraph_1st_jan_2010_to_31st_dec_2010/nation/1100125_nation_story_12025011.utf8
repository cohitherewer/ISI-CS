The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 14 safe corridors marked for jumbos
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      14 safe corridors marked for jumbos
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Safety first                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 24: Perturbed over the growing man-elephant conflict, the government recently identified 14 corridors for the animals and decided to implement a corridor management plan.        
	The final plan will be prepared by March-end.        
	A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik here last week.        
	The proposed elephant corridors will be spread over an area of 870sqkm with a length of 420km and width of 0.08 to 4.6km.        
	The identified corridors are Badampahar-Dhobadhobi, Badamapahar-Karida, Deuli-Suliapada, Similipal-Hadagarh-Kuladiha, Telkoi-Palalhada, Karo-Karampada (Jharkhand), Maulabhanja-Jiridimal-Anantpur, Buguda-Nayagarh, Kanheijena-Anantpur, Nuagaon-Baruni, Tala-Kholagarha, Barpahad-Tarava-Kantamal, Kotagarh-Chandrapur and Karlapat-Urladani.        
	Provision for food and water would be made in these corridors besides paying special attention to their safety. As a result, incidents of straying of elephants towards human habitats are expected to come down, forest department sources said.        
	Straying of elephants to human habitats has been a concern in the state, as, on average, they destroy crops in 5,400 hectares and kill 48 persons every year.        
	According to 2007 census, there are 1,862 elephants in the state  35 more compared to 1999 census. Seven per cent of Indias elephant population and 27 per cent tuskers reside in Orissa.        
	As inter-state poacher gangs are active in Orissa in view of large number of tuskers, the government has constituted 51 anti-poaching squads and engaged 98 elephant trackers.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      200 Delhi flights hit on third day of fog
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 27 (PTI): Thick fog affected schedules of over 200 flights at Delhis IGI airport today, affecting thousands of passengers.        
	At least 30 domestic and international flights were diverted, 25 others  including five international flights  were cancelled and more than 150 flights were delayed by up to six hours, an airport official said.        
	An Air France flight to Paris, another to Kabul, a Kuwait Airways flight to Kuwait City and a Jet flight from Dubai and a Kuwait Airways flight from the Kuwait capital were cancelled because of the fog.         
	Jet Airways has also cancelled its flights to New York and Newark from Brussels because of bad weather conditions in the US. But it is operating its flight on Delhi-Brussels and Mumbai-Brussels routes.         
	An Air India flight (AI-101) to New York, which took off from Delhi yesterday, was diverted to Washington because of a snowstorm in the US and heavy snow at New York airport.         
	The flight will operate to New York as soon as the runway at JFK (international airport) opens. Flight AI 144 from Newark to Mumbai of December 26 has also been stuck at Newark due to heavy snow on the runway, an Air India spokesperson said.         
	Fliers had a tough time for the third consecutive day at the IGI airport today. Many were seen running from the airport helpdesk to the airline counters to get the status of their flights.         
	I had to attend the wedding of my nephew in the US on December 30, but my flight has been cancelled today. I dont know how I will attend the ceremony, R.K. Chadda, who was seen arguing with airline officials at the airport, said.         
	The airline is not giving us any update or promising a seat in the flight, he said.         
	According to airport sources, most flights coming from Europe are using smaller aircraft, which have less capacity, because of which there is an acute shortage of seats.        
	Fog started to envelop the airport around 7.30pm yesterday and gradually became dense. The runway visibility hovered between 50 and 175 metres through the night, resulting in disruptions in flight operations.        
	Airport operations were affected for 14 hours from 8.36pm yesterday after fog reduced the runway visibility range to less than 50 metres.         
	Most flights between 12am and 2.30am were diverted, when the visibility range was between less than 50 metres to 75 metres. The procedures were lifted around 10.36am.         
	During the 14-hour period when the procedures were in place, 257 flights operated using various categories of instrument landing system. At least 122 flights landed using advanced Category III-B ILS while 23 used Category III A, 28 Category II and 84 used Category I.        
	Twelve flights to Bangalore, Nagpur, Mumbai, Calcutta and Jaipur could not take off from Delhi because of dense fog while 11 from these cities could not land in the capital.        
	Twenty-three flights were diverted to Bangalore, Lucknow, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and other cities.              
	Yesterday, over 40 flights, including 14 international ones, were diverted while 38 were cancelled.         
	The airlines have asked the flyers to confirm the status of their flights from call-centres before leaving for the airport.

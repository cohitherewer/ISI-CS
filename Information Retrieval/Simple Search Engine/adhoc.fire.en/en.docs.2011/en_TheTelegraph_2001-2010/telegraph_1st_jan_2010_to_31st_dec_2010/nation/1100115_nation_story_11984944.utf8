          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Jan. 14: The controversy over Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) referring to Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumars caste took a new turn today with FIRs being lodged against AICC in-charge of Bihar affairs Jagdish Tytler and state party chief Anil Sharma today.        
	The president of Bihar Dalit Kranti Morcha, Vidhan Chandra Rana, lodged the FIR in a Boring Canal Road-based Scheduled Caste police station here. As a Dalit I feel hurt by Jagdish Tytler and Anil Sharma putting caste details beside names of senior leaders, including Meira Kumar, Baleshwar Ram, Ramswaroop Paswan and 29 others, the FIR read.        
	Tytler and Sharma released the list of the partys executive committee, which included Meira Kumars name and caste among 500 others, fuelling a war in the party with dissidents demanding immediate sacking of Sharma and Tytler from their positions.        
	The BPCC leadership was already in crisis with dissidents seeking Anils head. But release of the list signed by the duo has embarrassed the party high command, too, with Sonia Gandhi reportedly admonishing the duo.

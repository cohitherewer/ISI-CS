	Mumbai/New Delhi, April 14: The web surrounding IPL team ownership and stake-holding has come under the scanner as part of moves to crack down on routing investments through tax havens abroad.        
	Revenue officials, speaking under cover of anonymity, said orders had been issued from the highest offices to look into the funding of the teams in the cash-rich cricket league. The officials said some of the investments in the IPL franchises may have been routed through tax havens such as Mauritius and the Virgin Islands.        
	The tax administrators said they would take a hard look at IPL commissioner Lalit Modi and the owners of the Kochi IPL and also figure out the role of Sunanda Pushkar, a beautician-turned-savvy corporate consultant who is a friend of Union minister of state for external affairs Shashi Tharoor.         
	The order to look into the Kochi IPL team owners and the IPL illegal money channels has come right from the top of the Union government. So far, the probe has been discreet with not much hope of us being able to act as powerful people  politicians, businessmen and celebrities  were involved. This time, the insinuations against a serving minister has raised hackles in the government and we have been instructed to carry out investigations and reveal discrepancies, a top Mumbai Income Tax official told The Telegraph today.        
	At the moment, the probe is a paper-based investigation  a source probe, which is an enquiry that may or may not end up in filing of a case. It is not in response to any formal complaint.        
	The groundwork for the probe, however, had begun after Sahara and Rendezvous paid unprecedented amounts at the Chennai auction for Pune and Kochi.        
	Our main concern is black money parked abroad. Just as we try to prevent black money going out our country, we also try to probe if such money is channelled back into the country illegally. We have some leads on the Kochi team. The ownership pattern in many of the other IPL teams seems hazy and suspicious and are under scrutiny, he said.        
	IPL teams apart, the tax department is also probing Lalit Modis assets. We took up the matter a few months ago when it came to our notice that he spent $25 million to purchase a yacht and a private plane. We are also probing two of his associates, said the tax official.        
	The tax scrutiny has been initiated to find out if there is any illegal flow of funds or whether any black money is being pumped into the sporting extravaganza, including from foreign shores.        
	Last November, the government had rejected a proposal from Jaipur IPL Cricket Pvt Ltd  the owners of Rajasthan Royals  to bring in 100 per cent foreign equity of over $5.82 million (Rs 26.19 crore at current exchange rates).        
	The shares were to be issued to one entity in Mauritius and another in the UK in lieu of the earnest money and franchisee fees paid by the outfits on the teams behalf, sources said.         
	Indian and foreign MNCs have in the past routed investments through tax havens.         
	Often, such havens are used to siphon off profits and reduce tax liabilities by routing goods and services  which may or may not have been actually provided  through shell companies registered there.        
	The shell companies  which may be nothing more than a desk at a lawyers office  often control billions of dollars of investment or trade, and can be set up for fees as low as $4,000 (around Rs 1.8 lakh).

  - Hunt for bodies after Orissa encounter        OUR BUREAU                                    
	Bhubaneswar, May 9: Several Maoists are believed to have died in an overnight gun battle with security forces in Orissas Koraput district but no bodies have been found so far, police said today.        
	The police believe there were some casualties on the Maoist side during the encounter, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said before leaving for Delhi this afternoon, adding that more details were awaited.        
	The security forces did not suffer any injuries in the gun battle, the police said.        
	We dont know the exact (Maoist) death toll, but there are indications of casualties, said Prakash Mishra, additional director-general of police (intelligence).        
	Although not a single body has been found yet, there are marks to indicate that bodies have been dragged from the site. There are bloodstains at the spot and 12 kit bags have been left behind by the rebels.        
	Koraput superintendent of police Anup Kumar Sahoo said: The Maoists try not to leave the bodies of their cadres at encounter sites.        
	The encounter comes a day after a Maoist mine killed eight CRPF jawans and injured 10 in neighbouring Chhattisgarh, following which a high alert was sounded in Orissa.        
	The Koraput battle started last evening during joint combing operations by Orissa polices special operations group and the elite Greyhound unit of Andhra Pradesh in the Gumandi forest, about 500km southwest of Bhubaneswar. The police had received intelligence of the presence of 40 to 50 Maoists in the forests bordering Andhra.         
	The forces returned last night after recovering a powerful mine planted by the rebels, who appeared to have retreated. A fresh encounter, however, began this morning.        
	Yesterday, top CRPF officials had discussed anti-Maoist strategies with chief minister Patnaik. Tomorrow, the Union home ministry will meet top officials of six Maoist-hit states, including Orissa, in New Delhi to try and fine-tune anti-rebel strategies.        
	In the recent past, seven Maoists have been killed in an encounter in Deogarh and two in Sambalpur district, police sources said, adding that the bodies were recovered.        
	In Bisra near Rourkela today, the Maoists left behind posters threatening to blow up the local police station. The posters, written in Hindi, ended with a Lal salaam (Red salute).        
	Security has been beefed up in the area, Rourkela superintendent of police Diptesh Patnaik said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tied to Nitish: Bihars business atmosphere
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tied to Nitish: Bihars business atmosphere
										      SANKARSHAN THAKUR IN PATNA       BIHAR THE GAMECHANGE                              
	For reasons of pride and political accommodation, Bihar has forever had a minister for industry. What they did beyond occupying splendid colonial bungalows in west Patna and profiting on public money would make an absorbing study. Bihar is pre-industrial, it barely even manufactures sundry cycle parts.        
	Tata and Bokaro went with Jharkhand, the sugar and paper mills became serial victims of infrastructural degradation  no power, no roads, no viability. The rest  a welfare state bouquet of agri-based bounty  perished to the predations of the powerful.         
	Tractor and motor-pump factories, fertiliser and food-processing units, canal and irrigation works, a slew of public sector undertakings that were milked to death by the politician-bureaucrat complex for decades, then heaped as unworkable waste; along went the destinies of tens of thousands of unpaid employees, sorry epitaphs to Bihars barren industrial graveyard.        
	We used to laugh amongst ourselves that we even had something called a Bihar Industry Association (BIA), says .P. Shah, a former chairman. It was just a platform for getting together and whiling our time, nothing happened here, nothing was allowed to. Post-Independence, we were among the top industrial states, soon enough we were nothing, there was politics, politics, politics.         
	Its still politics, Shah is happy to admit, but it is no longer averse to industry. In fact encouraging, very encouraging, he says, in our system, even in the liberalisation era, the signal has to come from politicians, the rest follows. Under Nitish Kumar, the signal has been firm and consistent, industry has to be provided the atmosphere to prosper.        
	Shuffling between two beeping BlackBerrys in his air-conditioned chambers in central Patna, Shah elaborates on what that means: First of all, law and order, no haftas (protection money) and kidnappings, smoother regulations, good roads, power. The last is something on which we have a long way to go, but Nitish Kumar has made a start.        
	Shahs flagship is an ancillary production unit for a commodities multinational. His firm has grown big enough in the last few years for him to claim his monthly VAT payout is in excess of Rs 1 crore.        
	 His prospects look good enough now for him to seek expansion  cement, steel, agri-oriented mills. Its happening all across, he says, although it is not so visible, but if this conducive atmosphere continues, industry will become a visible part of our skyline.        
	The former BIA boss is loath to name his political preference upfront but his choice of phrase  if this conducive atmosphere continues  barely conceals his wish. The one thing I can say today without hesitation is that Nitish Kumar is good for the state, without him the gains made will get a jolt.         
	Hotelier Suresh Gupta has his own yardstick to sense somethings changing. There has been a sudden rush over rooms, he says, I run only a mid-level hotel but even here, corporate and conference bookings have become an everyday thing, obviously the Class-A hotels cant take the load.         
	Gupta said he first began to notice the difference about three years ago. Wed have seasons of rush, festivals, a bit of Buddhist tourism, then these business manager type people began coming, and they came all the time, and then conferences began, I was surprised. Now I am planning a new hotel, this one cant cope with the demands.         
	Go to the industry ministry and you might find clues to where the rush might be coming from. It not just a new building, not just a new set of files, its whats in them.        
	 More than a Rs 100,000 crore worth of investment processed since Nitish came to power in 2005. Most of it has not arrived in Bihar yet, and most of it is not even about the kind of heavy industry that could put Bihar on the map  much of it is small and medium scale, a lot in the secondary sector, hospitals, private colleges, housing.         
	Discount none of that, notes Sanjiv Chaudhury, a steel and cement magnate who set up shop in Bihar only last year. These are all signs there exists the prospect of growth, every penny in will attract more, just like every penny flying out earlier took more away.         
	The big boost to Chaudhurys cement and steel enterprise has come from another booming sector: real estate. It is not merely an urban housing phenomenon.         
	The floor area expansion in Patna and some district towns has, of course, been astounding, bettered only by the leap in prices, but the real story is probably unspooling in the industrial areas newly earmarked.         
	Most of the spaces in the four designated industrial regions  Patna, Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga  have been taken. You wont see industry yet, says Chaudhury, but the prospects are getting firmer, my own sales figures tell me that. Should this business-friendly climate continue, a lot of money currently sitting on the fence and watching will jump in.         
	Shahs caution notwithstanding, big business, such as it is in todays Bihar, is not shy of revealing where its vote lies even months ahead of the election. Its fortunes are tied to Nitish.

	Bangalore, Oct. 25 (PTI): Income tax officials today raided the premises of three Karnataka ministers, including the Reddy brothers, and four other MLAs of the ruling BJP against the backdrop of allegations of horse-trading after the recent trials of strength.        
	The premises of G. Janardhana Reddy and G. Karunakara Reddy and their business associate and minister B. Sreeramulu came under the scanner of the IT department, official sources said.        
	Around 60 to 65 places were raided in the mine-rich Bellary, Hospet and Sandur in the home district of the Reddy brothers, who have been accused by the Opposition of trying to lure their MLAs. Bellary is the stronghold of the Reddy brothers.        
	The raids were conducted by 300 income tax officials. A room in the legislators home here was also raided.        
	The BJP said the raids were a political conspiracy and an attempt to take undue advantage of power at the Centre.        
	People sitting in the Opposition in the state are getting frustrated in their attempt to destabilise the democratically elected government and are now misusing the power vested in the hands of the Government of India, BJP leader Dhananjay Kumar said.        
	Sixteen MLAs had withdrawn support to the Yeddyurappa government, forcing it to face two floor tests in the 224-member Assembly. Although the BJP government won the trust vote, uncertainty still hangs heavy as Karnataka High Court has reserved its verdict.        
	Four MLAs have deserted the Opposition ranks. The Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) have accused the BJP of poaching their MLAs.

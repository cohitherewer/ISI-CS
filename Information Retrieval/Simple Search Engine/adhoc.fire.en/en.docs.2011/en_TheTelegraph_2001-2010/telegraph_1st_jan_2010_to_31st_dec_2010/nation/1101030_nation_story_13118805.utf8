The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Defence chiefs letters reveal rule violation 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Defence chiefs letters reveal rule violation 
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 29: Two former army chiefs used their official position to seek exemption from Maharashtras existing laws that barred them from getting flats in a Colaba high-rise, letters written by them reveal.        
	General Deepak Kapoor and General N.C. Vij had been allotted flats in Adarsh Co-operative Housing Society, allegedly built on navy land in violation of rules in one of the costliest real estate zones in the country.        
	However, the allotments were virtually useless because the two generals had not lived in the state for 15 years.        
	According to a government notification dated May 25, 2007, the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960, bars people not domiciled in the state from membership of co-operative housing societies here.        
	The generals then wrote near-identical letters, which are in possession of The Telegraph, to then chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh requesting exemption as senior army officers. Vijs letter is dated June 18, 2008, while Kapoors is dated June 19, 2008.        
	 I am writing to you in my personal capacity as an applicant for membership of the Adarsh Co-operative Housing Society. Though the society was kind enough to accept my request for membership it was pointed out that a member is required to be living in Maharashtra at the time of approval, General Kapoor wrote on his official letterhead (letter no. 17622/DK/DO). He argued that as an army officer he was unable to spend those many years in Mumbai.        
	May I therefore request exemption from the applicability of the notification, wrote General Vij, on his official letterhead as head of the National Disaster Management Authority (letter no. 13710/NCV/DO).        
	On November 5, 2008, an under-secretary of the revenue department, V.B. Latke, wrote to Mumbai city collector Idzes Kundan that applications forwarded by the chief ministers office could not be entertained as the officers had not resided in the state for 15 years.        
	The two generals again approached the chief ministers office on December 17, 2008.        
	Four months later, the principal secretary, revenue and forest department, directed Kundan to treat their pleas as special cases. Kanhaiyalal Gidwani, ex-legislator and Adarsh Society member, confirmed this. There is nothing wrong with it. Bombay High Court had subsequently struck down (this) requirement for military personnel, he said.        
	Ironically, the state government has challenged this ruling. The matter is still pending.

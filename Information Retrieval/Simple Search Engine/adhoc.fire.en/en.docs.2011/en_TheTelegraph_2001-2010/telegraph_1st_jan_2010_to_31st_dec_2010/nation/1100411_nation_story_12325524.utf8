          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 10: Rebels today blew up a portion of a bridge and blocked an arterial road in Koraput district to protest the Centre-state joint operation against them.        
	Six days ago, Maoists had triggered a landmine blast in the same district and killed 11 policemen.         
	Today, the rebels blew up a portion of a 20-feet bridge over a hilly stream on the lone road connecting Laxmipur and Narayanpatna by triggering another landmine blast in the early morning, , said deputy inspector-general of police (south-western range) Sanjib Kumar Panda.        
	The blast took place around 4am at Mathalomba, 6km from Laxmipur and 440km from the state capital.         
	The rebels also blocked Narayanpatna-Laxmipur road by felling trees at many places, paralysing traffic and virtually cutting off Narayanpatna, the block headquarters, from the rest of the world. Official sources said it would take a few days to restore road communication.         
	Maoist posters were found at many places near the felled trees, opposing Operation Greenhunt. We have recovered some Maoist posters from the spot, said a senior police officer of the district.         
	The posters dubbed Union home minister P. Chidambaram and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agents of corporates and multi-nationals. The rebels also opposed the Orissa governments support to Operation Greenhunt.        
	On Wednesday, the chief ministers office received an email threatening a repeat of the Dantewada massacre if the state government went ahead with its anti-Maoist operations.         
	Earlier, an email was sent to the chief ministers office threatening to blow up his residence, state secretariat and other strategic installations. Maoist banners were found near Roxy railway sidings under K Bolang police station in Sundargarh district.        
	The rebels asked the government to stop Operation Greenhunt and called upon the youths to join Peoples Guerrilla Army, police sources said.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ruling in favour of rounding off marks
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 23 (PTI): Delhi High Court has directed the Indian Medical Council to allow registration of a doctor who scored 49.7 per cent in his Plus Two exams against the mandatory 50 per cent, saying rounding off marks should be done to decide eligibility.         
	The court passed the order on a doctors petition whose application for registration was rejected by the council on the ground that he had scored 49.7 per cent marks against the compulsory 50 per cent.         
	The court turned down the contention of the council that 49.7 per cent marks in the Plus Two examination cannot be rounded off to 50 per cent.         
	This court is of the view that the petitioner is right in contending that 49.7 per cent marks obtained by the student should be considered as equivalent to 50 per cent by applying the principle of rounding off, Justice Muralidhar said.         
	He said rounding off of marks should be done as it is based on logic and common sense.         
	The rule of rounding off is based on logic and common sense. If it is a half or more, its value shall be increased to one and if it is less than half then its value shall be ignored, the court said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Health hike but not   for AIIMS 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Health hike but not   for AIIMS 
          G.S. MUDUR                                     
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The central government has proposed a 16 per cent increase in its health expenditure during 2010-11, but leading public hospitals, including AIIMS, may have to scrounge for funds for day-to-day expenses.         
	The 2010-11 budget outlay for the ministry of health and family welfare is Rs 23,530 crore, a 16 per cent increase over the revised estimate of Rs 20,217 crore for 2009-10.         
	But the allocations  particularly the non-plan outlays that go into running existing programmes  for several leading public hospitals will drop sharply under the budget proposals. The AIIMS, New Delhi, will receive only Rs 800 crore in budgetary support during 2010-11, in contrast to Rs 888.5 crore during 2009-10.         
	The Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Pondicherry, and the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, will also receive lower budgetary support than they did last year.         
	Much of the cuts in these institutions are in the non-plan component which goes into the daily running of the institutions. Sections of doctors and health activists believe the cuts in expenditure will force the institutions to raise money by increasing user-charges on their patients.         
	The proposed outlay for central government hospitals has dropped to Rs 982 crore from Rs 1,020 crore in 2009-10.

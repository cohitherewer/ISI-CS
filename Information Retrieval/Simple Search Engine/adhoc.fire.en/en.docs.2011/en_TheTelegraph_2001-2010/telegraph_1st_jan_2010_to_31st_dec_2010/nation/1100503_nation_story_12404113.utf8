          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Villagers fish out dead Gangetic dolphins in Patna on Thursday. (Deepak Kumar)                                  
	Patna, May 2: The state government will submit a detailed report on the killing of four Gangetic dolphins within two weeks.        
	The killing of four national aquatic animals by poachers on Thursday here prompted the Union environment and forests ministry to express its distress over the incident and seek a detailed report from the authorities concerned.        
	We are working on the killing of the dolphins, which serve as a barometer to the health of the Ganga. We will submit the report within two weeks, Working Group on Dolphin Conservation (WGDC) chairman R.K. Sinha said today, expressing his severe anguish over the killing and poaching of the species.        
	Four Gangetic dolphins were killed by suspected poachers on the banks of the river under the Khajekala police station here. An autopsy revealed that the dolphins were trapped and beaten to death, as they bore several injury marks on their necks and heads.        
	A dolphin was found dead on the Ganga bank in Bhagalpur about 10 days ago.        
	The reports of the killing of four dolphins at Patna anguished the Union environment and forests minister, Jairam Ramesh, so much so that he asked his officials to seek a detailed report on it and also the measures that the state government was undertaking to preserve the national aquatic animal.        
	The Centre declared the Gangetic dolphins as national aquatic animal early this year following a pioneering role played by Ramesh and chief minister Nitish Kumar.        
	I received a call from a joint secretary rank officer of the ministry communicating me of the anguish that the reports of the killing of the dolphins have caused to the minister, Sinha said.        
	Dolphins live and thrive only in fresh Ganga water. If there are more dolphins in the river, it means that the rivers health is good, Sinha, an expert on the dolphins, added.        
	Sinha had undertaken a journey through the Ganga from Buxar to Manihari Ghat in Bhagalpur in 2007 in course of which he had calculated the number of dolphins on this stretch to be over 800.         
	But given cruelty and greed on the poachers part and also the failure of the state administration to keep a vigil on them must have brought down the number of the precious mammals in the Ganga, Sinha said.        
	The Gangetic dolphin is one of four freshwater dolphin species in the world. The other three are found in the Yangtze in China, the Indus in Pakistan and the Amazon in South America. Being blind, the Gangetic dolphin finds its way and its prey in the river waters through echo. The same species are found in Bangladesh and Nepal, too.

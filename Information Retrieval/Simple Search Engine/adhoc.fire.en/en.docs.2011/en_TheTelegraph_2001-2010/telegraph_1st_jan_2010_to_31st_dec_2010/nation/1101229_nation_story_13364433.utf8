	New Delhi, Dec. 28: Delhi polices special cell today arrested an aide of underworld don Chhota Rajan near the Uttar Pradesh border.         
	Acting on a tip-off, sleuths picked up Bhupinder Singh Vohra, 33, from Sunauli, a border area in Gorakhpur.         
	Vohra, who hails from Nainital but was based in Kathmandu, carried a reward of Rs 50,000 on his head.        
	Arun Kampani, the deputy commissioner of police (special cell), said: He was a close aide of the underworld don Chhota Rajan. He also had links with other dons like Aijaz Lakarwala and Bharat Nepali.         
	Vohra was wanted by the Delhi police in connection with two cases of extortion registered last year.         
	According to the police complaints against him, Vohra had demanded Rs 50 lakh each from two businessmen and threatened them with dire consequences if they failed to pay.        
	Kampani said Vohra also knew extortionist Prakash Pandey, who was a sharpshooter in Chhota Rajans gang.         
	Vohra, along with Pandey, was involved in several cases of murder, attempt to murder and extortion in Delhi, Uttarakhand and other states.         
	Vohra and the alleged sharpshooter Prakash Pandey had been running an extortion racket in many states over the past several years. They targeted a large number of businessmen who paid them fearing for their lives, Kampani said.         
	Pandey was recently deported from Vietnam and is now in the custody of Mumbai police.         
	Uttarakhand police had declared a reward of Rs 1 lakh on Pandey as he had been evading arrest in a number of cases.

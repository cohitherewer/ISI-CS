   Kasab cant escape   D-day jitters          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Women wait outside the Mumbai court on Monday to learn about the outcome of the case. (PTI)                                               
	Mumbai, May 3: Head lowered and shoulders drooping, Ajmal Kasabs body language today spoke about the end of hope for a terrorist who till last evening was a picture of braggadocio.        
	He would often comment mockingly to the police personnel guarding him how he did not worry much about his fate as he was sure the notoriously slow Indian legal system would drag on with his case till he turned grey, said an official at Arthur Road jail, where Kasab has been lodged for the past 14 months.        
	The only time Kasab raised his lowered head today was when co-accused Fahim Ansaris wife walked into the courtroom, a little after the judge had started reading his verdict.        
	As husband and wife exchanged glances, Kasab looked intently at Fahims wife for a moment, and then slowly turned his head sideways to look wistfully at Fahim sitting beside him. Then he looked down again.        
	Feeling sick and nauseous, Kasab had taken a little longer than usual to get ready for court today. Jail officials termed it routine Judgement Day reaction for most accused.        
	He ate his usual tea-and-bread breakfast but sat in his cell with a vacant look for quite sometime. He offered a namaz early in the morning, and then once before leaving for the court, a jail source said.        
	A little earlier, a team of doctors from the government-run JJ Hospital had conducted routine checks on the 26/11 gunman.        
	His blood pressure, pulse, etc, were fine. He was very quiet. We had examined him before; he has always been a very talkative but shrewd person. On Monday, he was withdrawn, said a JJ Hospital doctor who carried out the health check-up.        
	Hale and hearty with normal appetite till last night, Kasab had complained of headache this morning and was unusually slow and quiet  a demeanour he brought into the courtroom.        
	Gone was the usual sprightly manner. Wearing white kurta-pyjamas, a favoured attire, he slipped into the courtroom almost unnoticed and took his usual seat next to Fahim in the box.        
	The prosecution and defence lawyers had already taken their seats and Kasabs co-accused, Fahim and Sabauddin Ahmed, had been in the courtroom for over 10 minutes. The 70-odd national and international journalists allowed into the courtroom had spent over an hour and a half inside.        
	Kasab sat with his head bent while Fahim and Sabauddin sat ramrod straight and looked relaxed.        
	As judge M.L. Tahaliyani walked in at 12.10pm, Kasab slowly stood up and then sat down and covered his face with his hands briefly.        
	For the next two-and-a-half hours, as the judge read out the operative part of the judgment in English, Kasab mostly kept staring at the floor.        
	He sometimes raised his hands to both sides of his head, covering his ears. Sometimes he moved his lips, probably in a silent prayer, with his eyes closed.        
	He did not even look up mockingly, as he would usually do, when the judge warned some journalists against trying to leave before the verdict had been delivered and the court adjourned till tomorrow.        
	Later, when the judge asked him to stand up in the box to hear the verdict read out to him in Hindi, Kasab held on to the wooden railing of the box for support, his head still bent. As he heard the judgment, he covered his face with both hands.        
	Soon after, he had to be physically supported by two policemen as he left the courtroom for his cell, faltering on his feet and ashen-faced.        
	Fahim and wife Yasmin presented a picture in contrast. Fahim and Sabauddin have been acquitted of all charges on the ground of doubtful evidence.        
	Sabauddin, 25, looked composed but relieved. Fahim, 37, kept smiling at his wife and nodding at his brother.        
	As the court was adjourned and Yasmin got up to leave, Fahims eyes kept following her till the door. She lightly lifted her veil to cast a last glance at him from the exit, and then stepped out of the courtroom to ready herself for a date with the media.

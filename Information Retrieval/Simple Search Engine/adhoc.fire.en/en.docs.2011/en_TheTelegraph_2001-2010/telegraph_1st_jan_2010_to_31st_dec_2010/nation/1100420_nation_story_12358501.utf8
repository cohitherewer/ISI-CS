The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shashi gets a chance   to speak 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shashi gets a chance   to speak 
  - Permission granted but draft needs clearance           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Tharoor leaves Parliament on Monday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                              
	New Delhi, April 19: Shashi Tharoor was allowed small doses of salve today in the form of whispered sympathy from sections of the Congress and permission from the leadership to make a post-resignation statement in Parliament, a day after being scalped over the Kochi IPL fiasco.         
	Tharoor requested that he be given an opportunity to explain my position in the Lok Sabha in the presence of top leaders Pranab Mukherjee and A.K. Antony. He was asked to present a draft which would have to be cleared before he read it out.         
	Having received in-principle assent from party bosses, Tharoor met parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal. It is likely that time will be made for him to make a statement tomorrow.         
	Some colleagues were even ready to spare some kind words for him, now that he has quit and relieved the government and the party of political embarrassment. No guilt has been proved against him, an AICC office bearer said. Tharoor is an extremely talented and valuable person and he is not corrupt, it is just that things have played out badly for him. Perhaps he will learn his lessons and make a comeback some day.         
	None of that is likely to please Tharoor at the moment, though. A close aide said the former junior external affairs minister was extremely upset and angry at the manner in which he was dealt with, both by his party and the media. He feels he has been hung without a trial, the aide said. He is in no mood to concede he did anything wrong, in fact he is livid over the developments.         
	What seemed to have particularly upset Tharoor is that most party colleagues  even those from Kerala  have apparently taken the cue from the Congress high command and shunned him throughout his week-long crisis.         
	Far from speaking in his favour, they did not even bother to come and meet him. He is justified in feeling isolated and angered, the aide said. It is likely, though, that Tharoor will receive some support now that he has been removed from the eye of the Kochi IPL row. Some Kerala MPs, for instance, plan to meet him late tonight.         
	Tharoors only solace, the aide added, is the huge support he is getting from educated middle-class people from all over the country and abroad.         
	Tharoor spent a substantial part of today responding to emails and text messages pledging support for him. Thousands of messages have come in, and they are holding him up in this hour, the aide said. He is keen that he replies to most and builds up what he thinks is a constituency.         
	Asked about Tharoors future plans, the aide was cryptic. He may go to Kerala at the end of the week, but nothing has been fixed yet. He knows he retains the support of the people of his state.         
	Probably under stern advice from the high command, Tharoor was unavailable to the media today, spurning the mill of journalists outside his Lodhi Estate residence and declining requests for interviews.         
	He had also begun shedding the paraphernalia of ministerial office  cars, security detail, staff  soon after his resignation became imminent last evening.         
	This morning, his official aides were asked not to report anymore. Sandeep Chakravarti, an IFS officer detailed to him as personal secretary, is awaiting a new assignment, as are other lesser members of his official staff.         
	Significantly, his more voluble personal secretary Jacob Joseph, a Dubai entrepreneur whom Tharoor had brought along, was not to be seen at the ousted ministers residence. He was not tweeting in his boss defence either. Phone calls to Josephs mobile phones went unanswered.

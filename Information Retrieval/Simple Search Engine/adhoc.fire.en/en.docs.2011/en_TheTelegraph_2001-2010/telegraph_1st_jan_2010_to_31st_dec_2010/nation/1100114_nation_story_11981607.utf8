                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Caste cloud on Cong list
          NALIN VERMA                          Rahul: Bihar visit ahead                                  
	Patna, Jan. 13: Bihar Congress chief Anil Sharma and AICC general secretary in charge of the state, Jagdish Tytler, are facing flak from the the party high command for including the name of Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar in its list of executive committee members with her caste, Chamar, mentioned against her name.        
	But the development has little impact on the youth Congress, which has launched its membership drive in 16 districts ahead of Rahul Gandhis tour of the state. The Nehru-Gandhi scion is scheduled to visit the state late this month as part of his efforts to revive the Congress in Bihar, after doing the same in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Members of the Rahul Brigade, which include Jitin Prasada, Shruti Choudhary and Priya Dutt, fanned out to remote districts yesterday to launch the membership drive, while Sachin Pilot concentrated on Patna to enlist new faces in the Youth Congress  rendered virtually defunct in the state for the past two decades.        
	Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar have lived their life. It is the time for the young and energetic people to take control of politics and governance. And now you do not need Lalus and Nitishes, for Rahul is there to provide you the right platform and opportunity to take India forward, Pilot said.        
	Even as the party was preparing the groundwork for Rahuls visit, the Congress high command is apparently embarrassed at the inclusion of the name and caste of Meira Kumar as a permanent invited member in the states executive committee.        
	Sources in the Congress leadership revealed that Sonia Gandhi was extremely miffed at Sharma and Tytler for inducting the name of the holder of a constitutional position in the partys committee and that too with her caste (mentioned as Chamar) in the list.        
	In fact, caste of all the members who have found place in the Congresss committee have been mentioned which a senior Congress leader described as against party ethics. Sonia, who apparently disassociated herself with the issue, is believed to have admonished Tytler and Sharma for the action.        
	Sources close to Sharma, however, said it was an internal list, which got leaked to the media.

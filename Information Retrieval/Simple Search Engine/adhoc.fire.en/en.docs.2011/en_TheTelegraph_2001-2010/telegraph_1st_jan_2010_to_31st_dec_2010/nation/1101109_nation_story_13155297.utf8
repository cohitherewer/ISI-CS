The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | On horizon: seat at high table
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      On horizon: seat at high table
          K.P. NAYAR                          The message by Obama in the Golden Book, introduced by Speaker Meira Kumar in Parliament on Monday. (Reuters)                                  
	Washington, Nov. 8: It can be said with certainty after Obamas desire for a reformed United Nations Security Council that includes India as a permanent member that on the face of it, New Delhi could take a permanent seat at the worlds high table by the time its elected term in the Council ends on December 31, 2012.        
	The Obama administration was in a minority of 52 UN members which did not sign a letter to the General Assembly president on December 23 last year which finally, after years of aimless prattle, demanded a road map towards expansion of the Security Council.        
	Notwithstanding Washingtons opposition, that process has steadily got under way in nearly a year. In a coincidence with symbolism for New Delhi, on the very day last month when India was elected to the Security Council, Zahir Tanin, permanent representative of Afghanistan to the UN, was re-appointed for one more year as chairman of those inter-governmental negotiations on Security Council reform.        
	Obamas support for India in the Security Council was not born out of any love for India. It is a position which has been evolving in Washington in the last one year and reflects the state departments acknowledgement of changing global realities.        
	Although the Obama administration did not sign the letter which led to Tanins mandate for text-based reform talks last year, sensing the mood of the General Assembly, the US did not stand in the way of a unanimous resolution on the Assembly floor to continue these intergovernmental negotiations.        
	Because these negotiations are not public, because there is a lot of deal-making around other issues in the world body that is typical of quid-pro-quo-diplomacy in the UN, it is easy to wrongly conclude among those uninitiated in the ways of Turtle Bay that a permanent Security Council seat is way beyond Indias reach in the foreseeable future.        
	There is high degree of surprise even among UN diplomats that Tanin has held five rounds of negotiations and that a text has, indeed, been produced that will be the basis for expanding the Security Council.        
	A fresh round of negotiations on narrowing this text, to be announced soon, will have new vigour and significance now that Obama has made public his administrations commitment to Indias claim for a permanent seat. In the past, the Americans had similarly endorsed Japan.        
	The Americans have taken part in three rounds of talks on Security Council reform led by Tanin, instead of sulking as they often do when the majority in the UN does not fall in line with Washington.        
	These negotiations have already covered issues such as categories of a reformed Security Councils membership, the question of veto, regional representation, size of an enlarged Security Council, models for expansion in both permanent and non-permanent categories and so on.        
	So, when Obama spoke in Parliament today, he was not idly airing a sound bite that would appeal to his audience like some pundit in a TV studio: what he said was the outcome of a year-long debate within his administration on this issue.        
	It is known from highly reliable sources in Moscow that President Dmitry Medvedev will also support Security Council expansion with India as a permanent member during his next visit to New Delhi.         
	Contrary to popular belief, Russia has not yet done so, although it is widely seen as a long-time friend of India.        
	Britain and France have already supported Indias case. In the post-Cold War arrangement, the five permanent members of the Council (P-5) make every effort to work together on issues wherever possible.         
	If four of the P-5 support India, it is highly unlikely that China will hold out all by itself against New Delhi, although Beijing may well demand a quid-pro-quo for its support.        
	The big stumbling block against expansion may actually turn out to be Chinas opposition to Japan getting a permanent seat. Deteriorating territorial disputes between the two, bordering on conflicts at sea will have to be defused before China can be persuaded to support Japans claim for a permanent seat.        
	In 2004, China spent hundreds of millions of dollars in Africa in an effort to prevent the 53-member African group at the UN from taking a unified stand on that continents nominee to an expanded Security Council.        
	A unified African stand then may have advanced a claim by the Group of Four or G-4  India, Japan, Germany and Brazil  from staking their claim in the General Assembly for seats at the UNs high table.On two occasions within the last three weeks, India has convincingly demonstrated a groundswell of support for itself in the General Assembly, which has to amend the UN charter, elect new permanent members and go through long and mind-boggling procedures to enable India  and anyone else to take permanent seats in the Council.        
	The support of all but three countries in an election to the Security Council and the top vote in another election to a General Assembly subsidiary are numbers which neither the US not China can any longer ignore in Indias quest for its rightful place in the UN.

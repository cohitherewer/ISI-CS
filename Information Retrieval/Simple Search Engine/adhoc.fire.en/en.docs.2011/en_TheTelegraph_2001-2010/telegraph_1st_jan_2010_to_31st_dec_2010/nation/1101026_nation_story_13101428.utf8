          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 25: The Congress today seized on parts of Prakash Karats Cambridge speech and gleefully construed them as an admission of the Lefts failure to keep up with the changing times.        
	Congress spokesperson Shakil Ahmed said the CPM general secretary had accepted that the Left had failed to change itself and remained frozen in the 1940s.        
	It is good to realise your mistake. We hope that at least now you will not repeat the historical mistakes you committed in the past, Ahmed said in a barely concealed reference to the Left snapping ties with the UPA.        
	On Friday, Karat, speaking in Cambridge, said: The Left in India today is still banking of some of the perspectives and the programmes which were set out in the period of the 1940s.        
	He had added: We need to study in some more depth how capitalism is growing in India.... So we feel acutely the need for theorising and understanding many of the new developments in India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Muivah slams PCs suppression   Sympathy for Maoists 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Muivah slams PCs suppression   Sympathy for Maoists 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Muivah                                        
	Viswema (Nagaland), May 8: Naga leader Thuingaleng Muivah has hit out at P. Chidambarams policy of suppression against Maoists and other dissenting groups, the attack coinciding with his anger at the Centre and Manipurs Congress-led government for refusing to let him enter the state by road.        
	In an interview with The Telegraph, the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) general secretary dubbed the Union home minister arrogant and said the Maoist violence was a natural reaction to an exploitative state.        
	He, however, said he did not support the killing of ordinary people. In 2009, about 600 civilians and over 300 policemen were killed in Maoist violence across India.        
	Whenever there is discrimination, whenever there is oppression and suppression, revolution is a matter of necessity. Discrimination is there. How can you ask Naxalites to obey Chidambaram? The one who has the arrogance of a Brahmin? Will you expect revolutionaries to follow that kind of approach? Stupid, Muivah said.        
	Chidambaram is not a Brahmin, so Muivah may have been speaking figuratively. Muivah is angry with the home minister, the chief advocate of a nation-wide crackdown on Maoists, for saying the government would stamp out all terrorists, apparently including the NSCN-IM within that description.        
	He thinks he can suppress by talking harsh words. By containing the Naxalites, can he solve the problem? Impossible. By suppressing Nagas can he solve the problem? Muivah said.        
	Mr (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee respected (the) reality of the Nagas, he added, suggesting Chidambaram did not want to understand the Nagas history.

	Asked about the Brahmins within the Maoist leadership, however, Muivah said they had understood the ground reality.        
	What does he think of the Maoists model of totalitarian rule?        
	No, a time will come when they will adjust themselves but they will not surrender to democratic principles. The rich class is ruling, so you cannot say it is democracy. In the name of democracy there is exploitation. So your democracy is dangerous for you. Revolutions should not be ruled out, Muivah said.        
	Muivah had visited China in the 1960s and his outfit has had a Leftist leaning although it is based on a platform of Christianity. A few years ago, the CPI (Maoist) had approached his outfit, apparently to help them with arms.        
	Muivah did not specify why the Maoists had approached him but accepted that there was a meeting. Sure, sure. I did not deny that (the meeting). I wont deny that. We had issued a statement also, he said.        
	The meeting had taken place at the NSCN-IMs camp in Hebron near Dimapur (on the Assam-Nagaland border).        
	The Maoists methods, Muivah feels, could be justified in view of the prevailing circumstances. However, he said the killing of civilians was against Naga culture and his own conscience.        
	Not a single innocent Indian individual or family was hurt (by the NSCN-IM). But the Government of India has failed to appreciate it (it) refuses to understand us.        
	Ordinary people have been caught in the crossfire during battles between the NSCN-IM and rival outfits, but Muivahs group is not known to carry out ethnic cleansing or blasts at public places.        
	Muivah wants to visit his native village of Somdal in Manipur but the Ibobi Singh government has refused to let him enter by road, fearing violence because the NSCN-IM wants an autonomous greater Nagaland that includes substantial parts of Manipur.        
	The Naga leader is apparently angrier with the Union home ministry, which, he claims, could have averted a crisis.         
	The Centre, however, has offered him a helicopter to fly to his village  a proposal Muivah has rejected fearing it would lead to a loss of face.

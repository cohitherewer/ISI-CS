The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ignou cancels Karat lecture
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ignou cancels Karat lecture
                            
	New Delhi, July 15 (PTI): A lecture by CPM general secretary Prakash Karat at Ignou today was cancelled as the teacher who was to make the arrangements reportedly did not take the required permission from the authorities.        
	A section of the faculty had organised the programme and NCP general secretary D.P. Tripathi had requested Karat to deliver a lecture on the Indian economy.        
	However, I came to know that the university authorities had locked the hall where the lecture was to take place. In such a situation, I requested Karat to cancel the lecture, Tripathi said.        
	He said the university authorities had behaved in an undemocratic manner. About 300 people were left stranded on the campus.        
	Karat was informed not to come for the lecture one hour before he was to depart for the programme, Tripati said.         
	The university claimed P.B. Sharma, a teacher of the School Of Education under the varsity had booked the hall in his personal capacity but had not taken the consent of the director or the vice-chancellor.        
	We could not allow the programme to be organised in the hall as the teacher who asked us to book the hall had not taken permission from his director or the vice-chancellor, chief security officer of the varsity, S.S. Visht said.        
	The vice-chancellor was unavailable for comment.

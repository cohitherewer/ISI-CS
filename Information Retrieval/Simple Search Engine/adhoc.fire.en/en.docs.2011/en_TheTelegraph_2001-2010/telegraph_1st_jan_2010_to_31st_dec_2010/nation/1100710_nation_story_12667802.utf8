  - Govt clubs job and sanitation schemes        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, July 9: Funds under the rural job scheme will no longer go down the drain but into toilets.        
	Lakhs of pits are now being dug across the country without any objective other than providing 100 days employment under the job scheme. This at a time the Centres Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) aims to build crores of toilets to eradicate open defaecation by 2012.        
	So, the government has done the smart thing and clubbed the two, so that the job scheme can fund the sanitation campaign, spending its money productively.        
	The rural development ministry, which spearheads both flagship programmes, has told the states that National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) workers can now be employed in all sanitation projects. This includes building school and anganwadi toilets, community sanitary complexes, compost pits  and even toilets for private rural households.        
	The convergence of the two schemes will be quite economic as the wages for all sanitation activities will come from NREGA funds, a ministry official said.        
	We hit on the idea when we saw the nature of work being done under the job scheme: hundreds of ponds and pits are being dug just for the sake of creating employment.        
	The states have been asked to plan sanitation projects in such a way that registered rural job scheme workers are employed for the unskilled segment of toilet construction.        
	It (the convergence) will benefit rural families by way of employment as well as (by) improving the condition of sanitation and health, the guidelines sent to the states say.        
	The ministry official justified the plan to use job-scheme workers for building toilets for private households.        
	Although it will be provided at an individual level, it has a social dimension too. If we could achieve total sanitation through this convergence at an easier pace, the impact could be felt across the society, he said.        
	Under the guidelines, six mandays can be earmarked under the job scheme to build household toilets and two mandays for compost pits. Twenty-five mandays can be set aside to build a school toilet, 10 for an anganwadi toilet and 250 for a sanitary complex.        
	According to official records, sanitation coverage among rural households increased from 21.9 per cent in 2001 to 27.3 per cent in 2004, and more than doubled since then to 63.91 per cent (of 2001 census households) by May 20, 2009.        
	Total Sanitation Campaign projects have been sanctioned in 593 rural districts at an outlay of Rs 17,885 crore with a central share of Rs 11,094 crore. Since 1999, over 5.56 crore toilets have been provided to rural households.

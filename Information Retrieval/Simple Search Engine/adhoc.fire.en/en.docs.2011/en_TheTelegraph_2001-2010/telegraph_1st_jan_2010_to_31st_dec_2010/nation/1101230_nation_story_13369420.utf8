The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Protests over, time to party 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Protests over, time to party 
  - Kashmiris hit the dance floor                               A boy kisses a man dressed as Santa Claus on Christmas in Srinagar. (PTI)                                  
	They hit the streets in protest for months. Now many in Kashmir seem ready to hit the dance floor.        
	A Srinagar hotel has lined up what is possibly the first New Year Eve party featuring a DJ in almost two decades as the violence-scarred Valley looks to find a new rhythm of life after the deadliest unrest in years.        
	It is, perhaps, the first time in two decades that a DJ event is being organised in Kashmir on New Year Eve. The purpose is to give people here an opportunity to forget their suffering, Nafi Zargar of Red India Films said about the bash organised at Grand Mumtaz with Mumbai DJ Shaun as the main attraction.         
	Zargar, who has organised such events in other parts of the country for his Mumbai-based firm, expects big crowds. We are expecting some couple of hundred music lovers from Valley and outside to join it. We want to start the new-year with hope that everything would be smooth in Kashmir during the New Year.        
	Sources in the hotel industry, however, said DJs have been roped in by some organisers in the recent past, though the shows have not been as big and as publicised as the one scheduled to take place this Friday night.        
	New Year celebrations were a rarity in Kashmir in the 1990s when insurgency was at its peak. They bounced back for several years until the 2008 Amarnath agitation. The participation has always been thin, though, with several separatist groups coming out openly against such events saying they promote immorality.        
	The Amarnath protest and the backlash over the alleged rape and murder of two women in Shopian last year took out the steam out of such shows, although some small events were organised even during these years.        
	The death of 112 civilians, allegedly at the hands of troops, during five months of unrest this year was expected to act as a damper. But some believe the Valley needs to put the troubles behind it. Thats the reason for this event. The year has been terrible and we want people to make a new beginning, said Zargar.         
	Gulmarg is also dolling up for celebrations, with hundreds expected to throng the ski resort. Some hotels are organising such events. We are providing them logistics support, a tourism department official said. Most of the revellers will be tourists, whose numbers have declined this year though some have been turning up of late.         
	A large number of people, however, do not seem in a mood to party. How do you expect people to join celebrations when we spent almost the entire year mourning our dead, a Kashmir University student Aaqib Ahmad said.

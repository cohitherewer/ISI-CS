          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                              
	Bangalore, March 16: Two strangers fired from a country-made pistol at an Indian Space Research Organisation facility early this morning, a security guard claimed but police arent yet convinced that any attack took place.        
	Jadhav was the lone Central Industrial Security Force constable manning the gate at the Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) complex at Byalalu village, some 30km from Bangalore city. He said the attackers fired two shots from the street outside around 3.20am and that he had retaliated by shooting eight rounds.        
	The police, however, have found no evidence of firing from outside, such as used cartridges from the alleged attackers guns or damage to the complexs walls, said additional director-general of police A.R. Infant.        
	Only six cartridges out of the eight rounds claimed to have been fired by Jadhav were found while no empty cartridges were traced outside the compound, Infant said.        
	On the face of it, it does not appear to be a terrorist attack. Its too early to say whether there was an attack. Jadhav (may have) happened to see strangers at a distance and may have fired in the air.        
	The IDSN was commissioned in 2008 to provide deep space support for Chandrayaan-1, Indias first unmanned moon mission. It houses a deep space antenna, an Indian Space Science Data Centre and a technical services complex.        
	Jadhav has told the police he saw two strangers in khaki uniform standing a short distance from the compound wall, and that one of them fired twice at the complex.        
	Two other CISF officials, assistant sub-inspector Naik and head constable Madayan, who were on duty inside the complex, have said they came running to the main gate after hearing shots.        
	They say they came to the spot a little later and were told by Jadhav about the incident, Infant said.        
	He added: Had there been any firing, there would have been bullet marks on the building, on the gate, or on any object on the premises.        
	The police said some construction was being carried out at the complex and the sand for it was being brought in every night. Last night too, four trucks had unloaded sand outside the complex between 2am and 3am.        
	The police did not rule out the possibility that Jadhav had been alerted by the movement of some of the drivers or labourers. Infant said there was no specific terror alert about the IDSN.        
	Leading scientific institutions in Bangalore have, however, been attacked before. In December 2005, a masked gunman had fired from an AK-47 on a group of scientists at the Indian Institute of Science here, killing a professor from IIT Delhi and injuring four others.        
	An Isro official speculated that todays alleged shooting was a trial run for a possible terror attack.        
	After receiving preliminary reports, Union home minister P. Chidambaram termed the alleged attack an amateurish attempt by two men with country-made pistols and said the IDSNs security would be reviewed.        
	The Centre has asked for a report, and Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa has ordered an inquiry.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The bus with the steel cupboard on top. (PTI)                                  
	Bhopal, May 14: The dowry turned fatal for 28 people from the grooms side: they were electrocuted in their bus when the steel cupboard tied to the roof scraped overhead wires.        
	The dead include 23 women, four children and a man, who were returning from the wedding in Mandla district early this morning when their bus turned into a death trap near Gopalpura village, about 375km from Bhopal.        
	Most of the men were travelling in two jeeps along with the bride and the groom and escaped the tragedy. Seven of the buss 35 occupants are being treated in hospital.        
	It was a Gond tribal wedding and the steel cupboard was given in dowry, a police officer said.        
	Inspector-general of police C.V. Muniraju said from the neighbouring district of Balaghat that the bus had collided with an electric pole, causing the cupboard to come into contact with the high-voltage wires.        
	Twenty-five people died on the spot; three grievously injured persons died in Mandla district hospital, he said.        
	Ramesh Maravi, 22, son of Roop Singh Maravi from Subhariya village, had married his bride amid nightlong festivities in Dubi, a hamlet in Mandla.        
	The rites, which included the bride and the groom walking seven times round a post erected at the centre of the wedding booth, were witnessed by their families, the villagers and the tribal council. Then followed a dinner of goat meat, washed down with country liquor.        
	Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said a magistrate-level inquiry had been ordered. He called off a dinner to mark the conclusion of a Congress-boycotted special session of the Assembly, called to discuss ways of developing Madhya Pradesh.        
	A PTI report said a criminal case had been registered against the bus owner, driver and the conductor, and quoted the police as saying the driver and the conductor had jumped off the bus when it came in contact with the wires.        
	The report said Chauhan had announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh for the family of each of the dead and promised free treatment for the injured.

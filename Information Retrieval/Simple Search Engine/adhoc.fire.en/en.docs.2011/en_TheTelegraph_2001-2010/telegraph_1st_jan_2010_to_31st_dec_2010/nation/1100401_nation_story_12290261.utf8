The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rubber stamp? Not Ramesh
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rubber stamp? Not Ramesh
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 31: Forest minister Jairam Ramesh today questioned the quality of environment impact assessments, denied delays in clearances and said he would try to increase the rate of rejection of projects.        
	An analysis of projects submitted to the ministry for approval suggests that about 95 per cent submitted for environmental clearances and about 85 per cent submitted for forests clearances get approved, Ramesh said.        
	Im trying my best to improve the rate of rejection of projects... my job is not to rubber stamp appraisals, Ramesh said. Where we have credible evidence that a project already approved will have adverse impacts on the environment, were prepared to review the appraisal ... projects that ignore environmental concerns cannot contribute to all-inclusive growth, he said.        
	Ramesh released a note that said the quality of the environmental impact assessments was often mediocre, sometimes unintelligent cut-and-paste jobs on which any responsible committee with integrity had no option but to ask for clarification, adding to time.        
	But among 99 projects across various sectors such as coal, power, roads, airports and steel, still awaiting clearance, environment ministry data shows that only 12 are pending for more than nine months.        
	Eighteen projects were cleared within a month, 44 in one to three months and 17 in three to six months. Among the 67 projects awaiting forestry clearance, 24 are pending for more than nine months.        
	The facts show that a high level of delays is baseless, Ramesh said. In recent weeks, there has been some speculation that ministries such as coal and surface transport have been unhappy with the pace of environmental approvals.        
	An analysis of nine new coalfields has revealed that 35 per cent of the fields are no-go zones where coal mining cannot be allowed, the minister said. In the other 65 per cent fields, mining can take place only after clearances.

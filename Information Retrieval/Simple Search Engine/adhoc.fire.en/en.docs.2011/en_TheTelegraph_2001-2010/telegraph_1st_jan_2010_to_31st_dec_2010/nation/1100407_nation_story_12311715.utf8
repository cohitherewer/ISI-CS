The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | No cheer, no beer at Royals match
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      No cheer, no beer at Royals match

	Jaipur, April 6: Strictly cricket, no frills please.        
	The Rajasthan government has banned indecent dances and consumption of liquor at tomorrows Indian Premier League match between Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium in the city.         
	The order, which extends to all three IPL games in the city, effectively means that the cheer girls, an ubiquitous part of the league with their skimpy but dazzling outfits, pom poms and energetic gyrations, will have to sit out. Also, beer cannot be served in the stadium, another IPL feature that has been criticised in several states.        
	Tomorrows game will be the first to be played in Jaipur, the original home of Shane Warnes Royals, in this edition of the league. The team, in which actress Shilpa Shetty and her husband Raj Kundra have a stake, has so far played its home matches in Ahmedabad, where liquor is barred because of Gujarats prohibition law but there was no ban on cheer girls.         
	The collector of Jaipur issued the order late tonight to the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA), in reply to the permission it wanted for hosting the three matches.         
	The collectors letter says permission was being granted on condition that there will be no indecent dance, provocative music, display of indecent and obscene dresses and no serving of liquor during the matches.        
	Additional district magistrate, south, Loknath Soni said the order was a routine one. Even the Supreme Court has banned late night noises and parties after 10 clock, he said.        
	RCA president C.P. Joshi, also Union minister of panchayati raj, said he knew nothing of the ban. I have no idea about the order. I have just landed here.        
	The cheer girls, who are from South Africa, have already reached Jaipur. Unless the association can find a way around the order, the girls will not be able to perform.         
	During the inaugural IPL season in 2008, the cheer girls and their dance had snowballed into a major controversy with many saying that spectators came to see them perform rather than the cricketers.        
	Observers saw the hand of chief minister Ashok Gehlot, a Gandhian, behind the order. Gehlot, perceived to be a conservative, had raised hackles during the pub attack in Mangalore by the Sri Ram Sene by stating that he was against pub culture.         
	Young boys and girls moving around hand-in-hand is not the culture of Rajasthan, the chief minister had then said.         
	Gehlot, who has on many occasions wielded the moral axe, is determined to reverse the policies of predecessor Vasundhara Raje, considered a liberal. As a first step, he brought down the number of liquor shops  that mushroomed during BJP rule  and enforced their closure at 8pm as against 11pm earlier.        
	At a recent programme, Gehlot came down heavily on lavish weddings, saying he felt ashamed when attending marriages where thousands were invited through invitation cards costing Rs 2,000 or more, delivered to him by hosts who came in expensive cars and guests were served dinner which cost thousands of rupees per plate.

	Bhubaneswar, March 16: The beautiful artefacts designed by primitive tribal groups of Orissa and dying a slow death are set to get a fresh lease of life, thanks to the state government.         
	It will exclusively market the products made by 13 primitive tribal groups under brand Tribes Orissa. As many as 25 items will be shortlisted from the collection at the museum of SC, ST Research and Training Institute (SCSTRTI) here.         
	The move is in line with the success of brand Tribes India promoted by the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India Limited (Trifed), New Delhi. Besides, there is also the idea to preserve the languishing art and artefacts of Orissa.         
	Collection of tribal artefacts in Orissa began in 1952. But many of these creations have gone out of circulation over the past years. The reasons can be largely attributed to the change in trend, culture contact, non-remunerative factor and the non-availability of raw material, said SCSTRTI director A.B. Ota.         
	At a high-level meeting held recently, the state government formed a committee under the chairmanship of state SC and ST development secretary to select the artefacts and chalk out a strategy to market them. It also comprises the director of SCSTRTI, managing director of Tribal Development Cooperative Corporation of Orissa Limited and project director of Orissa Tribal Empowerment and Livelihood Programme.         
	The committee has been asked to list the ethnic products that will be brought under the ambit of the brand based on design components, market need, peoples response and changing trends, keeping the core design intact at affordable cost.        
	Two items, mirgan and dongriakondh shawls, were launched on an experimental basis at Adivasi Mela. The response was great, Ota added.

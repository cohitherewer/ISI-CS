          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 18: A father and son were arrested in north Delhi today for the murder of a 23-year-old man in a case of alleged honour killing.        
	Azad, 40, and his teenage son Monu had allegedly strangulated Mahender Singh after finding out that the youth was in a relationship with Azads 19-year-old daughter.        
	Mahender belonged to a higher caste than Azads family, police said, without specifying which castes.        
	After killing him, the father-son duo packed the body in a plastic bag, loaded it on a bicycle and dumped it in Bawana canal on the night of September 14, said Chhaya Sharma, deputy commissioner, outer district.        
	Azad had become violent after he found Mahender, a neighbour, in his daughters room at their home in Bawana in north Delhi. The girl is a student of a Delhi college.        
	Honour killings have been on the rise in and around Delhi over the past year. As a consequence, many young couples in love are turning to police for protection from their families before any harm is done.        
	This is a new trend where young couples belonging to different castes are now lodging complaints against their parents and relatives. The complaints are basically in anticipation of problems they might face if their kin or parents come to know about their relationships, said a senior officer of Delhi police.        
	Over the past two months, Delhi police have received 40 complaints from couples belonging to different castes who fear they might become victims of honour killings. In Ghaziabad, 50 couples have complained that they fear a threat to their lives from their families.        
	Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the number of complaints from young couples who are in relationships with people from other castes, the officer said.        
	An officer from police headquarters recounted that a Delhi University student had complained against her parents and brothers, alleging they might kill her if they learn that she was dating a man from a different caste.        
	In her complaint she has given her address and the name of her parents and brothers and prayed for protection, the officer said.        
	The police are, however, finding it hard to deal with such complaints as they cannot take any action before a crime is committed. A senior officer said it was difficult to keep tabs on the families of each couple.        
	Most of the complainants are students. The spate of honour killings has triggered a chain reaction, he said.        
	In June this year, two cousins in Delhi killed their sisters Shobha, 20, and Monica, 23, and Monicas husband Kuldeep, who belonged to a different caste. The killers, Mandip Gurjar and Ankit Gurjar, told the police that they intended to murder all Gujjar couples who had defied community traditions and married outside their caste.

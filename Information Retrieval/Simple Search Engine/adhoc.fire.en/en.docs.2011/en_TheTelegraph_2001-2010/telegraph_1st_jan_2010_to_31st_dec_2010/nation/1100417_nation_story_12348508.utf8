          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 16: The problem of tree felling to block roads has never been so nerve-racking for security personnel in Koraputs Narayanpatna.        
	Since Saturday, Maoist-hit Narayanpatna has been cut off from the rest of the state after Maoists blew up a culvert at Mathalomba and blocked the area by felling trees on approaching roads to protest against Operation Greenhunt.        
	Restoration began today with a team of BSF jawans heading to the spot.        
	Six days before that, the Maoists had triggered a landmine blast, killing 11 policemen in the area.        
	The rebels also left posters, asking the government to stop Operation Greenhunt and calling upon youths to join the Peoples Guerrilla Army.        
	We began road clearance today, as the decision had to be taken after analysing all aspects of security and intelligence. Hopefully, things will be normal in two days, said Koraput district collector Rajesh Prabhakar Patel, adding that the culvert was yet to be repaired.        
	A team of BSF jawans, camping nearby, have headed for the area on foot. The work is likely to be over in a couple of days, Patel said.        
	With vehicles carrying essential commodities unable to ply through the Laxmipur-Narayanpatna road, shops and markets have apparently run out of stock.         
	Moreover, local villagers, depending on neighbouring Andhra Pradesh for supplies, have been facing problems.         
	While the police remained reluctant to clear blockades for fear of landmines, the villagers were also not keen to co-operate with the administration.        
	The police were considering security aspects, as it was never about a lone tree on a road. We need to be careful, Patel said.        
	Yesterday, hundreds of tribal women at Narayanpatna, under the banner of Biplabi Adivasi Mahila Sangha, took out a rally protesting against Operation Greenhunt.         
	They demanded immediate withdrawal of central paramilitary forces from the region. They alleged that they would suffer if the anti-Maoist operations continued, as security personnel would target innocent villagers suspecting them to be Maoist sympathisers.

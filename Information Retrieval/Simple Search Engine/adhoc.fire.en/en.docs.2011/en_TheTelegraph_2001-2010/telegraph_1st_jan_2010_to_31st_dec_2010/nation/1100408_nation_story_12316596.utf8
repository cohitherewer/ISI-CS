          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                                            
	Lucknow, April 7: Maoists battered yesterday families for whom they feign to play the messiah. People who struggle to make ends meet anyway, like the three daughters, son and wife of 35-year-old Shyam Lal.         
	The jawan from a backward-caste Uttar Pradesh family was the sole breadwinner for the six of them. His body lay draped in the Tricolour today.        
	At Amausi airport in Lucknow, 29 bodies lay side by side, carrying with them untold stories of misery compounded by the so-called champions of the poor.        
	Of the 75 CRPF personnel killed in the Maoist carnage, 43 were from Uttar Pradesh.         
	As Shyam Lals body was carried towards a truck that would take it to his village  Buajiwala, in Rampur district  his 11-year-old son stood transfixed. I dont want to see him mutilated. I love my father so much, Naresh Lal muttered.         
	At home, his mother Veermati, 27, slipped in and out of consciousness through the day.         
	Shyam Lal and his colleagues from the CRPFs Rampur camp had been sent to Chhattisgarh in March 2009. He had been doing well and became a head constable recently, said his relatives, waiting to take him home dead.         
	Subedar Brijesh Tiwari was in Shyam Lals group on the way to Chhattisgarh.        
	He was the third of four sons of a family from Akbarpur in eastern Uttar Pradesh. His earnings used to feed 10.         
	At a corner of a tea stall outside the airport, Brijesh Tiwaris father Valmiki was weeping. Amid the poverty and hunger in the villages of Akbarpur, jawans like my son were the only source of cheer, but all that feel-good has been punctured in one blow, he said.         
	At least 16 of those killed were from the backward and poverty-stricken eastern Uttar Pradesh. It is a region that has traditionally sent many youngsters to the army and the paramilitary. Even Mangal Pandey, whose revolt acted as a trigger for the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, was from Ballia in eastern Uttar Pradesh, a senior CRPF officer said.         
	The irony now is that these youngsters are being killed by our own misguided youths, says Romesh Dixit, a teacher in Lucknow Universitys department of political science.         
	Six of the slain jawans were from Bihar.        
	There was a wait for coffins at Patna airport as well. Inspector Jeetu Anands father Arvind Singh blamed the government for the deaths. They send jawans (to fight) without equipping them with the knowledge of the difficult terrain and the strength of their opponents, the 60-year-old man said.        
	Asked if he wasnt proud of his sons supreme sacrifice for the nation, he said: It is hard to tell if I am more sad than proud.         
	Jeetu was from Barahia village in Lakhisarai district. Married two years ago, he has a son who is barely a year old.         
	After Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar expressed profound grief, Arvind Singh said: These leaders honour our sons only when they are killed.         
	Rs 38 lakh for kin        
	The kin of each of the slain CRPF personnel would get over Rs 38 lakh, including an ex-gratia of Rs 15 lakh from the Centre. A member from all the 75 families will also be eligible for a job in the force.        
	Besides the Rs 15 lakh, the kin of the deceased will receive. Rs 10 lakh from CRPF risk fund, Rs 3 lakh ex-gratia from state (Chhattisgarh) government, Rs 10 lakh from state government as part of a scheme for anti-Naxal operation and Rs 60,000 from the CRPF central fund, the home ministry said.                    WITH INPUTS FROM NALIN VERMA IN PATNA

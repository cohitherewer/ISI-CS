The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Extort cop calls under scanner 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Extort cop calls under scanner 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, March 16: Haryana police special task force (STF) chief Ashok Sheoran, detained yesterday along with six members of his team for trying to extort money from Panipat businessmen, was formally arrested today.        
	All of them have been remanded (by a local court) in police custody for five days. We are looking into some other unsolved (extortion) cases where the team could have been involved, a senior police officer said.        
	The official and personal cellphones of Sheoran, who holds the rank of assistant superintendent of police, have been seized. All calls on the mobile sets made in the last few months are being scrutinised. Five other personnel of the squad were detained and questioned late last night, but were let off today after being found innocent.        
	We are looking at the call details and hope to stumble on some more cases of extortion. It will take some time to figure whether the team was involved in other cases. We hope people who may have suffered at their hands come forward with their complaints, the officer said.        
	An embarrassed Haryana police top brass has asked the district police chiefs to keep a watch on other personnel of the squad, even former members, after announcing yesterday the STF had been made non-operational.        
	It is a major blot on the force. While earlier there have been cases of individuals indulging in extortion, this is the first time an important arm of the force has been found guilty of terrorising people. The squad was meant to protect people from heinous crimes, the officer said.        
	Sheoran and the six others have been accused of extorting money from two businessmen, jeweller B.K. Malhotra and stockbroker Rajat Kumar, in Panipat on March 11 by threatening to lodge false cases. Gupta and Malhotra were among the businessmen that the squad, set up in 2007 with handpicked unblemished policemen, was supposed to protect.        
	Constable Jagbir Singh, who is among the seven held, was earlier caught on a CCTV camera in Malhotras shop when he came to collect the money alone. Malhotra had paid Rs 1 lakh against the initially demanded Rs 10 lakh. Kumar, too, had been asked to cough up Rs 10 lakh but eventually ended up paying Rs 6 lakh.

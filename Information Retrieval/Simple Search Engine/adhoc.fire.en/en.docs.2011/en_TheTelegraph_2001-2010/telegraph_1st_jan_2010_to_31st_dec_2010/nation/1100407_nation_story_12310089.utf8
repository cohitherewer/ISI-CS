          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 6: Orissa  facing an acute power crisis  is now looking out for alternative sources of energy, including wind, solar and biomass.        
	The state, which is endowed with water resources and coal, relies heavily on the traditional hydro electricity and thermal power.        
	However, the state is now facing a shortfall of 400MW to 500MW because of inadequate rainfall this year.         
	Thermal projects in the pipeline were not taking off because of delays due to land acquisition issues and public agitations.        
	Against this backdrop, the state government has come out with a goal to increase the share of renewable energy to 10 per cent of the total power mix of the state by 2020.        
	State-owned Orissa Renewable Development Agency (Oreda) has drawn up plans to tap all sources of renewable energy  be it solar, wind or biomass.        
	An ambitious target has been set for provision of minimum illumination to all remote unelectrified villages by 2014.        
	The government today decided to electrify 3,000 remote villages  not covered under the Centre-funded Rajiv Gandhi Vidyutikaran Yojana and state-funded Biju Gram Jyoti Yojana  by solar power in the next three years at an estimated cost of Rs 200 crore.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik directed officials to give priority to tribal-dominated and Naxalite-hit villages.

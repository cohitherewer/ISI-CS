                              TRACTOR FACTOR: Farmhands thresh freshly harvested paddy in the Champaran countryside. Picture by Sankarshan Thakur                             
	The story hadnt occurred to us until, finally, it decided to torment us for not noticing. A traffic snarl extended two miles on each side of its vortex on a nameless, uninhabited stretch on the road to Motihari.         
	It took an hour to straighten and when we came to pass the point of stress, an unlikely Bihari tale began to transpire. At the root of the mess was a new tractor showroom abutting the highway; its first orders had arrived, astride half a dozen double-decked trucks, each a hundred metres long.         
	While they unloaded their goods, the ramps drawn right across the passage as it were their private yard, we snapped and cursed. What could be so urgent about coughing out tractors in this nowhere place?         
	Ah, but what age are you living in? wondered one of the truck drivers sardonically when asked.         
	This is harvest time, these tractors will be gone off the showroom in no time, theyre all pre-booked, weve been a little late delivering, there were road restrictions because of the election. Tractor hai sir, demand high hai.        
	Shuffle back along the road to Muzaffarpur. Go even farther, to Darbhanga, Madhubani and Babubarhi, where Bihar peters seamlessly into eastern Nepal. Now run the tape again, look for missed clues. Theyre there, everywhere, tractors bumping around the countryside, in twos and threes, no more, but consistently all along.         
	Youll still find man and ox on ploughs, but thats not new. Whats new, and slowly impressing itself upon rural Bihar, is the tractor. Ten years ago, they were to the state what swallows are to winters, barely ever seen. But that was 10 years ago.         
	Tractors? Theyve become the spine of new Bihar, says Madhup Varma, scion of the erstwhile Shikarpur royals and still elected mukhiya of his domain.         
	They are on the farms, they are on construction sites, they are loading and unloading goods at railway godowns, they are our essential beasts now.         
	The Shikarpur family were the first ones to acquire a tractor in these parts and it used to be a thing of awe and novelty, but today, Varma says, everyone uses them, even small farmers. If they cant buy one, they hire, theyll be left behind if they dont.         
	The Shikarpur clan employs countless machines today to work their estates but tractors are nothing humbler farmers feel deprived of.         
	In the long run, it works out cheaper to rent a tractor than work with ploughs, says Prashant Mahto, a subsistence farmer. Work gets done much faster, better than paying for hired hands.        
	Arshad Karim, region head for a tractor firm, cant suppress his glee enough. This is the big boom industry in Bihar, Karim says, springing a quite unbelievable statistic: 3,900 new tractors are sold in the state every month.         
	The rate of growth in sales was 55 per cent last year and it does not look like it is going to go down. Look at the newspapers, says Karim, earlier you would see motor pump and tube well ads, now there are only tractors, theres not one tractor company in India that hasnt opened shop in Bihar and several have jumped in from abroad.        
	Whats changed? To Karim, the key factor is the streamlining of government loans to farmers and simplified bank financing; you get a loan the moment youve asked for it. But to Shikarpurs Varma, its a string of interlinked factors, not one. Everything seems to be moving up, he says. It is a convergence of positives. Good roads means tractor companies are ready to move deeper into the hinterland and establish businesses closer to clients. For clients, that means tractors come cheaper and faster. In the towns and cities, the improved law and order situation has meant people are loosening their fists to invest. Theres a real estate boom and that has pushed up the demand for tractors. Tractors are key, but they are part of a vibrant loop of prosperity that will only slowly become visible.        
	Varma, feudal by setting but capitalist of thought  hes slowly but surely switching from traditional farming to industrial-grade cash cropping  isnt far off the mark. According to one estimate of the Bihar Association of Industries, steel and cement sales in Bihar have gone up 800 per cent over the last five years. During the same time, property prices have risen 500-700 per cent depending on where youre talking about.         
	We believe the indices of prosperity have become all-round and quite overwhelming by Bihars standards, says .P. Shah, one of the states top industrialists. And it is not restricted to Patna alone, small towns and even villages are in spurt, especially in sectors like construction. It is something that was long pending.         
	Expectation that Bihar will return Nitish Kumar to office is nothing the states businessmen are shy of admitting. A lot of businesses are just waiting for the elections to end, says Shah. Wealth will pour into Bihar if this government is voted back, it has given us and the whole state a new impetus.         
	The tractors popping up all across the state are fair evidence.

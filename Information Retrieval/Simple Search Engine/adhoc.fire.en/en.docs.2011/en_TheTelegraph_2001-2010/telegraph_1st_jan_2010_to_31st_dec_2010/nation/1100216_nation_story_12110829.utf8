          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 15: The Centre will hike its funding share for Panjab University, the Prime Ministers alma mater, to help the varsity fight a growing financial deficit which is burdening students because of increased fees.         
	The human resource development ministry has formed an intra-government panel to revise its funding contribution for the university, the only one in India that is funded jointly by the Centre and a state.         
	The panel will recommend the extent to which the Centre will hike its share of funding for the university, where Manmohan Singh both studied and taught, top sources have told The Telegraph.         
	The move follows repeated interventions by the Prime Ministers Office on behalf of Panjab University to facilitate increased funding from the Centre.         
	At present, the Chandigarh-based varsity receives 60 per cent funding from the Centre  through the home ministry  while Punjab funds the remaining 40 per cent.         
	But the state government, some years back, stopped hiking its funding amount, limiting it to about Rs 15 crore a year. The Centre, by the 60:40 formula, needed to find only Rs. 21.5 crore a year but has over the years hiked its funding amount to about Rs 30 crore a year, taking the varsitys total budget to Rs 45 crore a year.         
	The university, however, registered an expenditure of close to Rs 150 crore last year, leading to a massive fiscal deficit of Rs 105 crore.         
	Panjab University, in trying to meet the deficit, started a number of self-financing courses. Unlike regular programmes  subsidised at government varsities  authorities charge higher fees for self-financing courses to meet the universitys fiscal deficit.         
	This, in turn, was proving a burden on students, some of whom complained to the Prime Minister when he last visited the varsity in 2009, sources said.         
	Panjab University, started in 1947, became the countrys only inter-state university in 1966 after the reorganisation of states led to the creation of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and the Union territory of Chandigarh.         
	At that time, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh had agreed to jointly fund the university.         
	Over subsequent years, however, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana pulled out of the agreement and withdrew their funding, leaving Punjab and the Centre to finance the university.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, July 6: A 25-year-old woman and three others died in alleged security force action overnight as Srinagar again slipped into chaos today, prompting the state authorities to re-impose curfew and call in the army.        
	Yasmeena, Fancy to her friends, was drawing the curtains in her room when the police deliberately fired at her from the violent streets outside, residents alleged. The police claimed she had been hit by a stray bullet.        
	Fancy has become the first woman, and the 14th person overall, to have died in firing by the security forces since the latest wave of protests began on June 11.        
	The Centre, which had earlier in the day issued an order recalling a few dozen CRPF companies from the Valley following hopes of an improvement in the situation, quickly asked them to stay back.        
	Chief minister Omar Abdullah spoke to Union home minister P. Chidambaram and sought reinforcements, saying most of the states security personnel had been diverted to the Amarnath Yatra, a PTI report said.        
	Kashmir police chief Farooq Ahmed said: The army has been called in to assist the civil administration in enforcing curfew. This is the first time the state government has used the army to contain the fresh wave of protests.        
	Thousands had taken to Srinagars streets this morning after Muzaffar Ahmad Bhat, a Class XI student, died in mysterious circumstances at Batmalloo in uptown Srinagar late last night.        
	Residents said the security forces had chased a crowd that had allegedly thrown stones at the car of a minister of state. A police officer said the boy had fallen into a stream and died while being chased by the forces, but residents claimed he was beaten to death and thrown into the waters.        
	The body was fished out early today. When the protests broke out, security forces fired at the mob, killing Fayaz Ahmad, a father of two young girls. The protests spread and clashes between the security forces and the protesters continued for hours. The forces repeatedly fired in the air, an official said.         
	Fancy died in the afternoon. Thousands again marched to Batmalloo to participate in her funeral, leading to fierce clashes. Several vehicles were set on fire.        
	Abrar Khan, 18, became the fourth casualty overnight when the CRPF fired during a protest at Maisuma locality. The killings spread panic across the city and the authorities re-imposed curfew even as protesters blocked roads.        
	Pak firing        
	The Pakistani Rangers today violated the cease-fire and killed a BSF havaldar across the Jammu border. BSF deputy inspector-general J.S. Oberio said Pakistani troops had fired on a night patrol at 5.45am in the Akhnoor sector. We are lodging a protest with Pakistan, he said.

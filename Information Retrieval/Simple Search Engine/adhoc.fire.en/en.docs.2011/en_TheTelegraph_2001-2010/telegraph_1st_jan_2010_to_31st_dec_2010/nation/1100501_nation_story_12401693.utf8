The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Encounter summons on six cops
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Encounter summons on six cops
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, April 30: The CBI has called six serving and retired Gujarat IPS officers for questioning in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, the summons coming days after a top cops arrest and inviting allegations of vendetta against the Narendra Modi government.        
	The officers have been asked to appear between May 3 and 7, CBI sources said.         
	Among those summoned is Geeta Johri, the investigating officer when the case was being probed by the CID. The Supreme Court had pulled her up for concealment of facts and asked the CBI to take over the case. Four IPS officers have been arrested in the case, including DCP Ajay Chudasama on Wednesday.        
	In Delhi, BJP leaders were considering protests against what they perceived was the Congress-led UPAs bid to target Modi by using the CBI. A siege of the CBI headquarters is planned next week.         
	Never has the Centre gone after an entire states police with such vengeance, said a BJP leader. The party is unlikely to move court, though.

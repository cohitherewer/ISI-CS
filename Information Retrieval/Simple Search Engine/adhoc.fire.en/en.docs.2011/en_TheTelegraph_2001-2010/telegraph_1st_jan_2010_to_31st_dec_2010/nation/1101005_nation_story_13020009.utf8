The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Let the Games begin again, on Doordarshan
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Let the Games begin again, on Doordarshan
          ARCHIS MOHAN                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 4: Bharat Bala, the creative head for the Games opening and closing ceremonies, today slammed Doordarshans coverage of the inaugural, saying it had fallen short of expectations.        
	In an interview to The Telegraph, he said he had requested DD to re-telecast the ceremony seamlessly (without advertisement breaks).        
	The public broadcaster has agreed to his request, Bala claimed. It is also believed to be mulling reducing the number of ad breaks during the closing ceremony telecast on October 14.        
	Bala, a Tamil filmmaker, said his team had barely two and a half rehearsals because we got the stadium so late. This has been a learning experience  8,000 performers, two and a half rehearsals at the venue.... We just magically did it.        
	He commended the 60,000 spectators at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium for celebrating the ceremony. The energy of 60,000 people radiated to us.        
	The construction delays at the stadium had forced the creative team to hold rehearsals at Delhi cantonments army parade ground. The first dress rehearsal at the stadium was held barely a week ago.        
	The performance was, however, marred by the telecast on which DD officials today refused comment. They chose to pass the buck to SIS network, the UK-based company contracted to produce the Games for DD that holds exclusive Indian broadcast rights for the event.        
	A deputy director-general in charge of DDs production team suggested the coverage suffered for lack of rehearsals. We could install the cameras only 15 days before the ceremony. We needed a month, he said. Others were at a loss to explain the long ad breaks that marred the coverage.        
	Bala said the poor camera angles might have been the result of international broadcasters lack of awareness of the cultures of India. He has conveyed his suggestions for the closing ceremony to DD.        
	I suppose it (ad breaks) was a commercial decision. That is how television makes its money. But many people who have sent me feedback said the coverage could have been better... it fell short of what was planned, Bala said.        
	He defended the choice to showcase Indias culture and its past rather than emerging India. Traditional ideas of India were presented with a contemporary look. It was to inspire Indians first, not just foreigners. But there were contemporary motifs... modernity does not come without a past. We are an ancient country with a modern outlook.        
	Bala commended the work put in by event producers Wizcraft International Entertainment and its head, Viraf Sarkari. Fifteen months of labour has gone into this. It has been a collective vision. Sarkari and his team gave us immense strength.        
	The filmmaker attributed the initial poor reception to A.R. Rahmans theme song to the video not being released simultaneously. We made the fundamental mistake of not launching the song with its video  important for a sports event which is about glory of competing, of athleticism.        
	Bala said he enjoyed his meetings with the group of ministers tasked with overseeing Games preparations despite the disagreements. One of them was on the show timing. While the GoM wanted a 5pm opening, the creative heads pitched for 7pm.        
	It was only after sunset that the true impact of the aerostat could have been felt. They understood our point and agreed, Bala said.        
	Closing ceremony        
	Bala refused to divulge details, not even if the closing ceremony would feature film stars. Did you miss Bollywood stars? Our stars are folk and traditional performers.        
	He said while the opening ceremony was based on traditional Indian culture and heritage, the closing ceremony would be based on the universal theme of love.        
	The mood will be different. The idea is athletes would be leaving for their homes and we want them to carry something good for their families.        
	The ceremony is unlikely to feature Rahman or tabla child prodigy Keshav. But the aerostat, which will be taken off for track and field events, will be put up again.        
	Sources said Vande Mataram would be sung, with 2,000 children performing to it. The ceremony will end with the handover of the Commonwealth flag to a team from Glasgow, which will host the Games in 2014.        
	We have pulled off one miracle. India will pull off another miracle, Bala said.

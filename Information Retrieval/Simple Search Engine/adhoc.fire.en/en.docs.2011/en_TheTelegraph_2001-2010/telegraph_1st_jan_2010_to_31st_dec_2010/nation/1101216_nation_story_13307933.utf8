          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: The Supreme Court has said notices should be sent to 13 states and Union Territories for their views on 44 deemed universities in their territory that face the prospect of losing the tag.        
	The states and Union Territories where the deemed varsities are located are Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Orissa, Rajasthan, Puducherry, Bihar and Delhi.        
	The order came while the court was hearing a public interest litigation by Viplav Sharma against the Union of India on the grant of deemed university status to private institutions.         
	A review panel of the HRD ministry, headed by P.N. Tandon, has found 44 deemed universities unworthy of the label because of poor academic standards. The panel has recommended immediate withdrawal of the status from such institutions.         
	These institutions were originally colleges and later granted deemed university status by the government. Nearly 2 lakh students are enrolled in these institutions. The apex court has said the careers of students should not be affected in case of any decision against the institutions.        
	If the status is withdrawn, these institutions will go back to their earlier position of being colleges and they will need to be affiliated to state universities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Salary record in Bengal IIT 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Salary record in Bengal IIT

	Calcutta, Dec. 4: The IITs are finally catching up with the IIMs on pay packets, thanks to Facebook.        
	A student bagged a Rs 70-lakh per annum offer from the social networking site, a record in IIT Kharagpurs history, on the first day of placement at the beginning of this month.         
	The highest salary on offer at IIM Calcutta in their final placements this year was Rs 75 lakh.        
	The IIT salary offer is over three times higher than last years on the tech campus  a Rs 22-lakh per annum package by Barclays Singapore.        
	It is a record and we have only started the placement process. This signals a very good placement season ahead, said S.K. Srivastava, the professor in charge of training and placements on the campus.        
	The offer was made to a student of the computer science department for an offshore placement.         
	The all-time high salary offer has created a buzz on the campus and has raised hopes that placements this year will be better than the last two years that had taken a beating because of the meltdown.        
	This kind of salary offer is just the beginning of a trend that has taken a long time to come, said an IIT Kharagpur professor who did not want to be named.        
	But he was quick to point out that there would always be a difference between the students of IITs and IIMs because while companies get fresh engineering graduates from IITs they get post-graduate students, often with work experience, from the IIMs.        
	It is bound to make a difference to salaries at offer at these places. But it is still heartening to see that the IITs are catching up, said the professor.        
	Things are looking really good. We are very happy with how the placement process has started. We are keeping our fingers crossed so that it continues in the same vein, said a final-year student who is also sitting for his placements.        
	At the end of the fourth day of the placement process that will go on till December 20, 167 students out of the 1000-plus students who have registered for placements have already found jobs.

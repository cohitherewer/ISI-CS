The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Prince who was brought up like a king
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Prince who was brought up like a king
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Jaganmohan Reddy at his residence in Hyderabad on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Hyderabad, Nov. 29: In his own mind, Jaganmohan Reddy is not so much a rebel as a prince who has had his crown snatched.        
	Observers say its this feeling of being robbed of what he already had that explains the nothing-to-lose gamble Jagan has taken 22 days before he turns 38.        
	Jagan controlled his fathers government for over five years. It is natural that he is furious at losing his position since his fathers death, a senior state intelligence official said.        
	Even before he had turned 20, Jagan would lord it over local officials, police and politicians whenever he came home to Pulivendula town in Kadapa district during holidays.        
	See, he is a born leader, his doting father, Y.S.R. Rajasekhar Reddy, would preen before followers.        
	Shortly after YSR became chief minister in 2004, all supplicants to him were told to first meet Jagan and family loyalist K.V.P. Ramchandra Rao, who was grooming the young man for high office. Ministers, MLAs and Opposition leaders regularly came to the chief ministers son to have their problems solved.        
	Even before he became an MP in 2009, Jagan would accompany his father to zilla parishad and urban development review meetings to finalise district development plans. It was at his orders that Rs 300 crore was granted in 2007 for road development in Kadapa.        
	Everyone knew Jagan would succeed YSR. When the son campaigned in the 2009 elections, he openly sought votes as the future chief minister.        
	Such was YSRs standing that, sometimes, even Delhi played along. Several central party leaders, while campaigning for Jagan in Kadapa, publicly referred to him as the Prince of Andhra Pradesh.        
	But for YSRs untimely death, Jagan would have officially been crowned his successor. With the support of the family-owned Sakshi TV channel and newspaper, he might then have become too strong for the party high command to control.        
	Already eyebrows were being raised. Sonia scuttled YSRs plan to get his brother Vivekananda Reddy to resign his Lok Sabha seat in 2005 so that Jagan could enter active politics. The sons fortunes changed dramatically the moment YSR died in a plane crash 15 months ago.        
	If Jagan is acutely sensitive about it, Rajasekhar Reddy was no less touchy when it came to his offspring.        
	Once when the Assembly was debating the Satyam scandal, someone alleged that Ramalinga Raju had sponsored Chandrababu Naidus stint at Stanford University. That prompted an Opposition member to snidely mention how Jagan too had been sent to the US for studies but had come back in quick time like return post.        
	My son came back because of homesickness, an angry YSR immediately shot back.        
	The proud father had carefully charted Jagans progress since his late teens, initiating him into family businesses even before the boy had earned his BCom. Even as a matriculate, my son was an income-tax payer, YSR would boast.        
	Jagan ran the bauxite mines of Vijayalakshmi Mining Ltd, named after his mother, in Kadapa. Pulivendula and Kadapa shivered when he arrived in his motorcade of Innovas and Qualises, accompanied by 10 to 20 members of his young supporters.        
	Soon, Jagan became a civil contractor and acquired stakes in several hydel and thermal projects in north India and Karnataka, such as the Saraswati hydel project near Sandur in the southern state.        
	After YSR became chief minister, Jagan is said to have become a partner in steel, cement and paper factories in Kadapa run by the Reddy brothers of Bellary for a time.        
	Journalists and politicians close to Jagan spoke of his ambition to become one of Indias top industrialists and his plans to build e-services across rural Andhra. YSR himself was planning to set up a technology and agriculture commission with Jagan as its chairman with cabinet rank.        
	Jagans profile on the Lok Sabha website attributes to him social and cultural activities as well as literary, artistic and scientific accomplishments. It says he had visited Israel, Singapore, Switzerland, Britain and America with his father.        
	YSR had created what was known as an executive group devoted to furthering Jagans political career. It included IAS and IPS officers and the ministers for industry, agriculture and home.        
	After YSRs death, it took K. Rosaiah almost a year to break this groups stranglehold on land allotments and on postings in the police and tax departments.

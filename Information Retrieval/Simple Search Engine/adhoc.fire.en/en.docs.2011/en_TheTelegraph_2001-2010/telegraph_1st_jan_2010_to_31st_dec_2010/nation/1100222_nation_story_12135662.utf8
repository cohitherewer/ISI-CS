The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MK calls top cops
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      MK calls top cops
          BARUN GHOSH                            MK Narayanan (top) and Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti                                 
	Calcutta, Feb. 21: Governor M.K. Narayanan has summoned the Calcutta police commissioner to Raj Bhavan tomorrow, apparently to review the forces intelligence network.        
	The planned meeting comes less than a week after Narayanan, a life-long intelligence official, called home secretary Ardhendu Sen and state police chief Bhupinder Singh to discuss the Shilda massacre amid reports that intelligence inputs about Maoist activity in the area had been ignored.        
	Calcutta police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, special commissioner Ranjit Pachnanda and deputy commissioner (special branch) Partha Sarathi Ghosh have been called tomorrow, a Raj Bhavan official said tonight.        
	The governor has expressed his desire to discuss things concerning the intelligence network of the city police following the Maoist attack, the official said.        
	Narayanans move to also summon the chief of the special branch, which exclusively handles political activities in and around the city, is being seen as a signal that the governor wants to be updated on intelligence inputs on Calcutta after the Maoist massacre in Shilda last Monday.        
	Asked about the meeting, Chakrabarti did not deny it. He said: I cannot disclose to you whether I have a meeting with the governor or not. This is something that cannot be discussed with the media.         
	A Raj Bhavan source said Narayanan, a former national security adviser, appeared worried about possible infiltration of Maoists into the city.         
	Last June, CPI (Maoist) spokesman Gaur Chakraborty was arrested from Park Street. Subsequently, Prasun Chatterjee and Raja Sorkhel, both al- leged sympathisers of Gaur Chakraborty, were picked up from hideouts in other parts of Calcutta.        
	The source said the governor was likely to seek sharper daily reports on political activities in and around Calcutta. We send the governor daily reports on the citys law and order and political events. But this is often treated as a routine task. The governor may ask us to highlight political activities and programmes in our reports, a senior Calcutta police officer said.        
	The governor is said to have sent the Centre a report expressing happiness over chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees announcement of an investigation into the circumstances leading to the Shilda attack.

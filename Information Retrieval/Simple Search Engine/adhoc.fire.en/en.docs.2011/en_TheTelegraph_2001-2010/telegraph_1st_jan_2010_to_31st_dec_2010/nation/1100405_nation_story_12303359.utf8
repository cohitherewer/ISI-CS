          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, April 4: Mayavati has drawn flak from educationists by writing to the Prime Minister that she cannot implement the right to education law in Indias most populous state unless the Centre sends her the money.        
	The letter was sent yesterday at a time the Uttar Pradesh chief minister is enmeshed in a controversy over her statue-building spree and the cash garlands she keeps receiving at party rallies.        
	Mayavati always looks at an issue from the financial point of view. Yes, there is a problem but money is not the only hurdle. What we expect her to do is to show the political will to ensure basic education to the people and check the high dropout rates, said Sobhit Acharya, a Kanpur-based educationist and former adviser to the state government on the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.        
	Education has never been part of Mayavatis political vocabulary although dropout rates in Uttar Pradesh are among the highest in the country. If the Centre is really willing to implement the Right to Education Act, she wrote to Manmohan Singh, it should bear the financial burden.        
	To implement the act in Uttar Pradesh, Rs 18,000 crore would be needed in one year, of which 45 per cent  Rs 8,000 crore  has to be arranged by the state, the letter said, adding that the state couldnt spare that kind of money.        
	Arundhati, an activist with Asha Project, the states largest non-government education initiative, said: Of course, money is needed but more than that the chief minister ought to have a vision and the determination to implement the projects for spread of literacy.        
	Uttar Pradesh has been among the worst performers in the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, aimed at bringing primary education to all children, with average dropout rates over 50 per cent in rural areas.

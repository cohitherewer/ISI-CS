          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: The government believes Mamata Banerjee was misled into saying that she was not against a joint parliamentary committee probe into the spectrum scam.        
	A senior cabinet minister today said Trinamul leaders had been misled by a BJP veteran who told them the government had accepted the JPC demand and the decision would be announced after a meeting with UPA allies on Monday evening.        
	The mischief, the minister said, prompted Mamata to articulate her stand since the government too had fallen in line.        
	 We asked Mamata today what made her speak like that and she in turn asked what had prompted the government to change its stand. It became clear that the confusion had been deliberately created, the minister said.        
	The meeting of allies called by Pranab Mukherjee was either wrongly interpreted or somebody played a mischief. The truth is the government at no point thought of accepting the JPC.         
	Congress sources said the meeting  later cancelled  was called because of rumours of differences within the ruling coalition and not to reconsider the JPC stand.        
	Parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal proposed to Mukherjee to hold a lunch meeting with the allies on Monday. Mukherjee said call them in the evening as he would be busy with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in the afternoon. So the meeting was fixed for 8pm, a party leader said.        
	The sources said the programme was changed following information trickling in from Calcutta that suggested the government had agreed to form a JPC. By evening, ministers had been flooded with queries on whether the government had indeed changed its mind.        
	At the AICC headquarters, Bansal was confronted by the media. Why did the government accept the JPC? he was asked.         
	The minister, who had been closeted in a party meeting, thought a decision might have been taken while the meeting was on and gave a feeble response, saying there was no JPC as of now.        
	After reaching home, Bansal contacted Mukherjee, who denied any move to accept the JPC demand.        
	Barely an hour was left before the meeting with the allies was to begin. Bansal then said most reports would suggest differences within the UPA if a JPC was not announced after the meeting and the best option was to cancel it. Mukherjee agreed.

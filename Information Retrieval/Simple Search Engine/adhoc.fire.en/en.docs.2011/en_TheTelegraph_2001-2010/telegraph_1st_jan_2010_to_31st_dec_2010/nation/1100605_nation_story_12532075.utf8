	New Delhi, June 4: The home ministry today declared the Indian Mujahideen a terrorist organisation.        
	Although the outfit was being considered a terrorist outfit for all practical purposes, sources said, todays move removed any legal ambiguity in action being taken against its members.         
	The fundamentalist group will come under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

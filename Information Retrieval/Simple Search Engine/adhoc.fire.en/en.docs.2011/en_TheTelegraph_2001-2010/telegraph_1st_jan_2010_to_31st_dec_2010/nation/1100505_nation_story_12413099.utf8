          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, May 4: The unprecedented demotion of an additional judge of Orissa High Court to the rank of district judge has taken a new turn with the Supreme Court refusing to interfere in the case.        
	While officiating as Balasore district judge, L.K. Mishra was appointed additional judge of Orissa High Court for two years on January 17, 2008. He was to be confirmed as a full-fledged judge on January 16, 2010.        
	But on non-receipt of order from the Presidents office confirming him as a permanent judge, the high courts full bench headed by acting Chief Justice I.M. Quddusi issued his demotion order on January 17 and appointed him Kalahandi district judge.        
	Mishra subsequently filed a petition in the Supreme Court for his reappointment and remained on leave.         
	He had expressed his unwillingness to join as district judge on the ground that though the Presidents office had not issued the order confirming him as permanent high court judge, the Supreme Court was yet to reject his candidature.        
	The Supreme Court yesterday refused to interfere with the order demoting Mishra to the rank of district judge. We are not inclined to interfere with the Orissa High Court order, a division bench of Justice Harjit Singh Bedi and Justice K.S. Radhakrishnan said.        
	The apex court said the background of the case left no room for direct interference under Article 32 of the Constitution. For judicial redress, the bench, however, advised Mishra to take his plea to the Orissa High Court.        
	Meanwhile, the state home department had on March 9 issued a notification on the compulsory retirement of Mishra after he continued to remain on leave without joining duty as Kalahandi district judge at Bhawanipatna.        
	The high court followed up with a public notice in an Oriya daily after he refused to receive the notification.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Patna, April 5: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today demanded that the Union government should meet 100 per cent of the financial requirement under The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act.        
	Though we welcome the new act providing free and compulsory education, the Centre must bear with the cent per cent burden on it, as it is beyond the resources of the cash-starved state like Bihar, Nitish told reporters on the sideline of his weekly Janata ke Durbar mein mukhyamantri programme.        
	Nitish said that the state government was irrevocably committed to implement the act. Our intention in the matter is clear from the fact that the number of school-going children have shot up sharply during our over four years of rule, he said.        
	Earlier, Nitish said, there were 33 lakh children dropped out from schools. Now, there are only 7 lakh dropouts in the state, he said, explaining how the state governments initiatives had gone a long way in raising literacy rate in Bihar.        
	Meanwhile, Nitish strongly attacked the central government for allowing Lalu Prasad to go off hook in the disproportionate assets case. The Centre now owes explanation as to why it did not allow the CBI to challenge the lower courts order, acquitting the RJD boss in the higher courts.        
	He said after the CBI director making it clear that the investigating agency had sufficient evidence against the RJD chief and as such it had sought permission from the Centre to go in appeal, it was imperative upon the Centre to explain the matter.

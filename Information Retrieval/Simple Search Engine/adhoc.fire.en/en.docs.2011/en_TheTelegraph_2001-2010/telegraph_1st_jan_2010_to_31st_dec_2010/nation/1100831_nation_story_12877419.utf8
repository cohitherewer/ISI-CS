The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sushma at forefront, dont turn your back to Chair
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sushma at forefront, dont turn your back to Chair
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pawan Bansal                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 30: Parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal was today forced by the BJP to apologise for standing with his back to the Chair when Lok Sabha proceedings were under way.        
	In what came across as a stunning case of trivialisation of parliamentary behaviour, BJPs Sushma Swaraj objected to Bansal speaking with Mulayam Singh Yadav with his back to the Speaker. Her party then kicked up such a ruckus that Bansal was forced to say sorry.        
	Although the rules of parliamentary business stipulate that no member shall stand with his back towards the Chair, such things and worse happen regularly in the House. Senior MPs could not recall the last time a minister was punished for such a crime in the House.        
	The incident happened when Mulayam objected to the enemy property bill, terming it a Congress-BJP conspiracy against Muslims. Bansal tried to assure the Samajwadi Party leader that amendments had been introduced to address his concerns, but Sushma warned the BJP would block the bill if the amendments were brought.        
	Soon after, a furore erupted with BJP and Samajwadi legislators joining in. So, Bansal walked up to Mulayam and told him to read the amendments. Within seconds, Sushma declared: The minister cannot run from seat to seat to hold negotiations.        
	Next, she pointed out that the minister was standing with his back to the Chair, which was in violation of rules. By then, the protests had got so loud that the House adjourned.        
	When the House reconvened at 2pm, BJPs Ananth Kumar raised the same point of order and demanded an apology from Bansal. But all parties, except the BJP and the Janata Dal (United), rallied behind the parliamentary affairs minister. RJDs Lalu Prasad said a minister talking to an MP on the House floor was not a crime.         
	Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda expressed shock that Sushma was advising the members and the minister on how to behave in the House.         
	Then Bansal spoke: With all humility, I assure the Speaker that I uphold the tradition of Parliament and hold him in the highest esteem. At times, I have to go to the leader of Opposition and other members when sharp differences occur. I was performing my duty.        
	I have been reminded that I have committed an impropriety. That was never my intention. There was no space to sit beside Mulayam Singh and hence I had to stand up. I was trying to end the commotion in the House. I meant no disrespect to anyone. But I regret violating the rule.        
	According to rules, no member can speak from any chair not allotted to them. But this is violated almost daily. Also, BJPs Navjot Singh Sidhu today angrily pointed a finger at the Chair, though rules forbid it.        
	There are bigger parliamentary issues that are routinely ignored. For instance, it is exceptional for a minister not to reply to a debate under rule 193. Home minister P. Chidambaram has not replied to the Kashmir debate that took place last week. But the BJP has not raised any objection.

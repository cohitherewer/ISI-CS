The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mango juice   in Pak diplomacy
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mango juice   in Pak diplomacy
                                            Gilani    
	New Delhi, May 25 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today sent a consignment of mangoes to his Pakistani counterpart Yusuf Raza Gilani, taking a bite off the fruit diplomacy nurtured by Indira Gandhi.        
	 About 20kg of Alphonso mangoes were despatched to the Indian high commission in Islamabad, which will pass them on to the Prime Ministers office there, sources said.        
	 Singh has also sent a letter to Gilani, saying that he hoped the Pakistani Prime Minister would like the mangoes sent as a goodwill gesture.        
	 The initiative of sending the mangoes comes after the bonhomie witnessed between the two Prime Ministers in Thimphu last month when they decided to take steps to reduce the trust deficit.        
	 At a media conference here yesterday, Singh said the trust deficit was the biggest problem between the two countries because of which we could not make any headway in the composite dialogue.        
	 Maintaining that it was important for India to have best possible relations with Pakistan to realise full development potential, the Prime Minister said: It has been my effort to try to reduce the gap between our two countries without surrendering or without affecting our vital national interest.        
	 A similar case of mango diplomacy was witnessed in early 1980s when the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, and Pakistani leader Zia-ul Haq exchanged Anwar Rataul mangoes.        
	 In 2001, the then Pakistani ruler, Pervez Musharraf, had sent mangoes to the then Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and home minister L.K. Advani before coming to India for the Agra summit.

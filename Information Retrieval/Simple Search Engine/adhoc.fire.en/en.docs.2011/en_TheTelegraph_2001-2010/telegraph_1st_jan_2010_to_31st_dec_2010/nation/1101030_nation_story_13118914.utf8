          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Lucknow, Oct. 29: Five IIT Roorkee students were suspended today for organising a game show on campus in which boys, holding lipsticks between their teeth, coloured the lips of girls.         
	The game show, organised yesterday as part of the annual fest, sparked protests after it was shown on several television channels this morning. The institute was flooded with phone calls from parents while sadhus in Hardwar burnt effigies of the institutes seniors, demanding an immediate halt to the show of vulgarity in the tech school.         
	Dean N.K. Goel said this afternoon that the five students who had organised the show, called Love Lips and Lipstick, were suspended.         
	We have set up a committee to probe the charges of obscenity committed by the students on the campus and how this was allowed. The authorities had earlier been told by the students that it was a friendly game show with lipsticks. But we were never told about lip contact and male-female involvement. We are surprised by the way it was performed, he said.         
	Twelve pairs of students had participated in the show, on the first day of the two-day annual fest.         
	It was just a harmless game. We just wanted to have fun without being vulgar, said Sanjiv Raut, a student. Another student argued that such competitions were meant to reduce the tension that sometimes lead to suicides on campus.

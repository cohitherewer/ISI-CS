The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Accountability fear in quota seat rotation   Identity crisis for politicians 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Accountability fear in quota seat rotation     Identity crisis for politicians 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                
	New Delhi, March 13: The rotation of reserved seats in the Lok Sabha and Assemblies under the womens bill could reduce the accountability of individual MPs and MLAs to their electorate, public policy experts have cautioned.        
	Such rotation in every election may strengthen the roots of womens reservation but could block the emergence of grassroots politicians, the experts warned.        
	They said the rotation policy could make a politician completely dependent on his party managers for a ticket as he might no longer be able to build a long-term relationship with his constituency.        
	Under the womens bill, a third of all Lok Sabha and Assembly seats will be reserved in each election. The reserved seats will be rotated across all constituencies over three elections so that every constituency would have been reserved for women once over any three-election period. (See chart)        
	Speaking in favour of rotation, the leader of the Rajya Sabha Opposition, Arun Jaitley, had argued that this policy would strengthen the roots of womens empowerment.        
	However, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, president of the Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research, said: What rotation does is hurt independent grassroots politicians. It strengthens the party leadership and leaves individual politicians completely at their mercy.        
	A politician who may have worked in his constituency for decades  and won the Lok Sabha or Assembly seat repeatedly  may lose his ticket not because of poor performance but because of the rotation of reserved seats.        
	For instance, former minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh is representing Vaishali in Bihar for the fifth time in a row in the Lok Sabha but will not be able to contest the seat the next time if it is reserved for women.        
	Rotation may also lead to lower accountability of elected representatives, Mehta said. The principle that you are not eligible to re-contest and that the electorate cannot pass a verdict on your performance is flawed, he said.        
	MPs and MLAs worried about losing their seats to the quota may start focusing their time and resources on neighbouring seats that they hope to be fielded from the next time, said Rajeev Gowda, who heads the centre for public policy at IIM Bangalore.        
	I support the larger public goal behind the womens bill. But it is a valid argument that MPs or MLAs may start spending less time in their constituencies to focus on seats from where they may win tickets, said Gowda, an open Congress supporter who aspires to join electoral politics.        
	Gowda accepted that seat rotation would make things harder for aspiring politicians because they wouldnt know which constituency to focus on. But he argued that all MPs and MLAs would not necessarily ignore their constituencies if these were to be reserved in the next election.        
	If you take a long-term view, you may choose to continue working hard in the constituency because you could get it back after five years of reservation, Gowda said.        
	He argued that a good reputation in ones own constituency could help a candidate win from neighbouring constituencies too. Also, if you are identified by your party as a capable MP or MLA, you are that much likelier to get a ticket from some other seat when your seat gets reserved.

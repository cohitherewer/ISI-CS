The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | If it is Modi, it must be Ahmedabad
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      If it is Modi, it must be Ahmedabad
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Lalit Modi                                  
	Mumbai, April 13: Shashi Tharoor has accused Lalit Modi of pressuring the IPL Kochi consortium members to abandon their bid in favour of another city in a different state but desisted from naming the place.        
	If Modis preference of late offers any clue, that another city has to be Ahmedabad.        
	Sources in the Indian cricket board said IPL commissioner Modis sudden rush to tweet details of the Kochi consortium was in part aimed at helping Ahmedabad get a team for itself.        
	Modi, the sources said, is equally keen to find a new home for Rajasthan Royals, and Ahmedabad is the best bet in case it cant have its own team. At least one of Modis relatives has a significant stake in the Jaipur franchise.        
	The IPL chief has been scouting around for a safe haven ever since his political fortunes dipped after the BJP lost power to the Congress in the desert state.         
	Tharoor is not alone in tasting the bitter tweets of Modi. The Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA), which he once headed, also has had the same treatment.         
	My team and RR (Rajasthan Royals) officials harassed by state officials. Is this the way to hold matches in a state. That is why I have boycotted Jaipur matches, Modi tweeted on Sunday, the same day the entries against Tharoor were made.        
	Sources in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said Modis rant against the RCA was aimed at getting the Royals a home in BJP-ruled Gujarat, whose chief minister Narendra Modi  also the state association president  is keen to have an IPL franchise.         
	Whenever there has been a crisis with RR  be it the Jaipur blasts or Modis loss in the RCA elections some months ago, he (Modi) has threatened to take the team to another city. He has named Ahmedabad quite often as an alternative, alleged a senior BCCI member.        
	Another option was to facilitate a franchise for Ahmedabad and build a team from scratch. Modis sudden keenness to expose Tharoor is driven by his attempt to prop Ahmedabad as an IPL franchise by disqualifying Kochi, the BCCI member claimed.        
	Ahmedabad was home to the Royals for four games this year. Sources said Modi had hinted that Jaipur, which has three matches this year, may not get to host any IPL game next season.         
	Its a joke what rca can do. 60 political party workers were accredited to do ticket checking. Total break down of administration. Future? he wrote on Twitter.        
	Ahmedabad was widely tipped to get an IPL team at the team auction on March 21, but lost out to the stunning bids for Pune and Kochi.        
	The Sahara group picked up Pune while Kochi was bagged by a consortium made up of several behind-the-scenes business tycoons, whose best known spokesperson was Tharoor. The junior external affairs minister described himself as a mentor of the consortium but was sucked into a controversy with Modi disclosing on Sunday that Tharoors friend Sunanda Pushkar had been given free equity by the Kochi franchise.        
	Cricket sources said by taking on Tharoor, the IPL boss had unwittingly raked up uncomfortable questions regarding his own connections.         
	Lalit Modi lives in a glass house. He should not throw stones at others. He will be very uncomfortable if questions are raised about ownership in the Rajasthan Royals team as well as in Kings XI Punjab. Considerable stakes are held in both by Modis relatives, said a top RCA source.        
	Nigeria-based NRI businessman Suresh Chellaram, who owns 44.1 per cent stake in the Jaipur franchise, is Modis brother-in-law. Gaurav Burman, one of the co-owners of Kings XI Punjab, is Modis stepson-in-law.        
	Gaurav, who lives in the UK, is a scion of the Dabur group and is married to Modis stepdaughter. His elder brother is Mohit Burman, another co-owner of the Punjab team.        
	The IPLs exclusive licensee for digital, mobile and image rights is Global Cricket Ventures Limited (in which Gaurav Burmans Elephant Capital is an investor). Modi has unwittingly prised open his own can of worms, said the RCA source.                    WITH INPUTS FROM RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR AND BASANT RAWAT

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sena sour on phone-tap arrest
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                               
	Mumbai, Dec. 30: The Shiv Sena has decided to complain on phone-tapping to the Maharashtra governor after Uddhav Thackerays personal secretary was booked by police last night on the basis of an intercepted conversation in which he instructed another party leader to spark violence.        
	A Shiv Sena-BJP delegation will meet governor K. Shankaranarayanan tomorrow to tell him that tapping phones of political rivals was a constitutional violation of the right to freedom, said the BJPs Gopinath Munde, the deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.        
	Rival NCP today said Pune police, who have booked Milind Narvekar, should investigate the matter and see if he got instructions from the top leadership of the party. The NCP did not name Uddhav.        
	Late last night, the police had lodged a complaint against Pune-based legislator Neelam Gorhe and Narvekar, who operates out of the Thackerays bungalow Matoshree in Mumbai.        
	The police had recorded a phone conversation in which Narvekar instructed Gorhe to spark a riot during the Pune district bandh called on December 28.         
	The Sena was angry with the Pune Municipal Corporation that had removed a statue of Shivajis mentor Dadoji Kondadev.         
	In the conversation recorded on December 27, Narvekar told Gorhe in Marathi: Dangal ghadavun aana (Spark a riot).         
	He allegedly also gave detailed instructions to Gorhe that one Sena mob should stone five to six buses at Pune station, Swar Gate and the state transport bus stand.         
	Another mob should torch two trucks at Lonavala to frighten motorists and stall traffic on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway to make the bandh effective, Narvekar had allegedly said.        
	Based on these recordings, Pune police lodged an offence under Section 153 (provocation with intent to cause a riot) and Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) against the two.        
	However, no arrests were made today. Gorhe and Narvekar both rushed to a Pune district sessions court and managed to get anticipatory bail.

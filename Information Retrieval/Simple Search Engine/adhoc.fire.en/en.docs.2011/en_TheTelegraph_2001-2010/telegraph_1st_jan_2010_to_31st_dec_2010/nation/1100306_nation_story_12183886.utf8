          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, March 5: Orissa will soon formulate a state food processing policy to woo private investment in this potential sector.        
	A draft policy has been circulated among all stakeholders for their comments after which it will be finalised, said chief minister Naveen Patnaik while inaugurating an agri and food processing conclave here today.        
	Inviting private investors to invest in this sunrise sector, Naveen assured all necessary support required to promote agri and processed food products.        
	Stating that Orissa having as many as 10 agri climatic zones is rich in biodiversity, the chief minister said the state had achieved a considerable growth in the production of foodgrain, oil seeds, pulses, fibres, fruits, vegetable and spices.        
	As a result of the diverse agri climatic conditions prevalent in Orissa along with the governments continuous efforts towards bringing more areas under assured irrigation, it provided a suitable environment for cultivation of a wide range of products, including a variety of fruits and vegetables, he said.        
	Although Orissa is one of the large producers of various agricultural products, it is yet to achieve significant growth in the agri industries and processed food sector, he observed.        
	Keeping in view the conducive business environment and vast potential in agri and food processing industries, there is a need to build on Orissas competitiveness and identify critical success factors and issues, he said.        
	About 23,000 agri and food processing units have been set up in small and medium-scale sectors which have so far generated over 1.2 lakh employment opportunities with an investment of Rs 1,000 crore, said industries minister Raghunath Mohanty.                          
	Out of total 43,000 small and medium scale enterprises operating in various segments and out of it, agri and food processing units constitute more than half (23,000) alone, he said.        
	The State government has given enough support to the agri and food processing sector in various policies, added the minister.        
	Finance minister, Prafulla Chandra Ghandei observed that despite the States impressive growth in sectors like mining, industry, hospitality, communication and transport, it had yet to achieve a significant growth in agri and food processing sector.         
	This sector is vital for the uplift of the majority of population of the State who solely depend on their livelihood from agriculture or allied sectors, said he.        
	ASSOCHAM president, Swati Piramal said agri and food processing sector of the State needed more investment in the technological upgradation and research amp; development activities to cultivate vast potential.

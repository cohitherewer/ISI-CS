	Patna, Jan. 27: The Nitish Kumar government has earned the power to confiscate the property of corrupt public servants with the Centre eventually giving its assent to the Bihar Special Court Bill, 2008.        
	The state legislature had passed the bill and sent to the Union government for presidential nod. But the central government failed to clear it for a year apparently because of the pressure of what is learnt to be the IAS lobby. The state government had sent the bill to the Centre for approval in March 2009.        
	However, chief minister Nitish Kumar hinted that President Pratibha Patil had eventually given her assent on the historic bill amid the governments tirade to curb corruption at high places.        
	Sources said the chief minister was intimated about the assent to the bill about four days ago by the Union law ministry. The formal communication from the ministry, however, is still awaited.        
	The Bihar Special Court Bill, 2008, empowers the state governments investigating agency to confiscate the immovable property of a public servant  be an IAS or IPS officer  if it finds prima facie proof about the latters earning through corrupt or illegal means.        
	The bill also empowers the state government to open special designated courts in the districts to specifically try corrupt public servants on the line of fast-track courts trying gangsters and don-turned-politicians in the districts.        
	Though the specific details of the bill are yet to be known, the sources said the states vigilance bureau had no power to confiscate the property of the officials as long as they were undergoing trial in corruption cases. According to the provisions of the special court bill, the investigating agency can confiscate the immovable property of the official in question after lodging a case against him and return the property to the accused with 5 per cent interest if he was proved innocent during the final trial.        
	The Nitish government earned accolades from across the country for seeking the high courts permission to set up fast-track courts, which, in over four years of his tenure have stepped up trial of the don-turned politicians.         
	It has also convicted many of them, including Md Shahabuddin (Siwan), Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav (Purnea), Akhlaq Ahmad, Sunil Pandey and Rajen Tiwary (Bhojpur).        
	The don-turned-politicians, who used to enter they legislature and Parliament in hoards, failed to contest the polls this time because they had been convicted in various cases of crime for more than two years and are in jail.

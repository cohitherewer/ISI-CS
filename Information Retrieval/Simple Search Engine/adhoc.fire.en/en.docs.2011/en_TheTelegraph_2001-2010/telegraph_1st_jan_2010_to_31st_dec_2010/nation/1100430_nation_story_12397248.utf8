The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Asteroid ice sheds fresh light on Earth life

	New Delhi, April 29: Astronomers have detected for the first time an asteroid with ice and organic material, a discovery that lends fresh support to the idea that ancient rocks in the solar system may have seeded the Earth with the building blocks of life.        
	Two international teams of astronomers reported today that they have spotted signatures of ice and organic chemicals in the faint sunlight reflected by one of the largest of known asteroids, 24 Themis, a 200km diameter rock in an orbit between Mars and Jupiter.        
	Both teams have reported their findings in the journal Nature today. This is the first time ice has been observed on an asteroid, said Julie Ziffer, a team member at the University of Southern Maine in the US.         
	Understanding the ice on 24 Themis might help us understand how water and organics arrived on our own planet. Studying primitive asteroids as fertilisers for life may become an area of greater interest to astrobiology, Ziffer told The Telegraph.        
	Scientists have known for long that comets carry ice. In the past, studies have revealed the presence of organics  a class of molecules made up of chains of carbon associated with all known life forms  in meteorites that have fallen on the Earth.        
	This raises the possibility that some of the Earths water may have come from asteroid impacts early in solar system history, said Andy Rivkin, a member of the second team, from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.         
	The researchers say the findings are unexpected. Scientists had previously thought any ice that may have once been present in asteroids was consumed in chemical reactions with the rock to create hydrated mineral compounds.        
	The new observations, Rivkin said, suggest that the ice coatings on 24 Themis are thin  just 0.1 to 0.01 micrometre in thickness  but cover 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the asteroids surface. The scientists said it was still unclear how much of the ice had been removed over the past four billion years of the solar syst ems history. They do not understand the mechanism that might be replenishing the ice.        
	But the researchers say the findings appear consistent with the idea that asteroids may have crashed and deposited water or organic molecules that paved the way for the emergence of life on the Earth.         
	The Earth went through a very hot stage when the surface was covered by molten rock, or magma oceans, which would have destroyed any organic molecules or water that existed before on the Earth, Ziffer said. After the Earths crust had cooled and solidified, impacts with asteroids or comets may have provided water and (organic) carbon-chained molecules, he added.        
	The two teams, which included astronomers from several academic institutions in Brazil, Spain, and the US, used a Nasa telescope in Hawaii for their observations. The findings had been previously been reported at a scientific conference.

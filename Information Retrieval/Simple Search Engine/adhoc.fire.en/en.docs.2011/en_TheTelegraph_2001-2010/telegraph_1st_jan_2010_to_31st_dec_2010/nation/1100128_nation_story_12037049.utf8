The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mumbai for all Indians: Ambani
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mumbai for all Indians: Ambani
                            
	London, Jan. 27 (PTI): Mukesh Ambani today said Mumbai was for all Indians as he slammed the Maharashtra governments now-amended announcement that taxi drivers in Maharashtra must know Marathi to get new permits.        
	We are all Indians first. Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi belong to all Indians. That is the reality, Ambani said yesterday during a panel discussion at the London School of Economics.         
	The Maharashtra government had on January 20 said that taxi drivers must read, write and speak Marathi apart from being a Maharashtra resident for a continuous period of 15 years in order to get a new licence.         
	But under presssure from the Congress high command, chief minister Ashok Chavan said taxi drivers should know a local language apart from Marathi to get new permits, clarifying his governments Marathi-must statement.        
	Ambanis said that while Indias corporate world had moved away from licence raj after economic liberalisation, Mumbais poor taxi-wallah is still dealing with licence raj.        
	He said the real challenge for the country was to create 15 to 20 million jobs every year. Employment is the biggest challenge in the coming years. We are not moving fast enough.         
	Rajya Sabha MP N.K. Singh, whose book Not by Reason Alone: The Politics of Change was being released at the event, said the licence controversy was misplaced populism.

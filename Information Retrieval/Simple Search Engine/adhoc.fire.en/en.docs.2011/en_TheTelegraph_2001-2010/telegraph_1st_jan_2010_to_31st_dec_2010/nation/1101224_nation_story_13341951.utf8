The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rural job rap on Bengal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rural job rap on Bengal
  - Centre pulls up state for consistent poor performance        CITHARA PAUL                                    
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: The Centre has asked the Bengal government to explain its consistently poor implementation of the rural job scheme, where its performance has been among the bottom five so far this fiscal.        
	The rap came at the performance review committee meeting that began here yesterday, attended by representatives from all the states. The committee, which looked at data from April 1 till the end of October, asked Bengal to analyse what had gone wrong and take corrective steps at the earliest.        
	Bengal has provided barely 19 days of work per registered household in the first seven months of the current financial year. The scheme guarantees 100 days of work to every registered rural household per year. Only Lakshadweep (15 days), Assam (18), the Andamans (14) and Manipur (10) have done worse than Bengal.        
	The national average, too, has been poor at 34 days. Andhra Pradesh has done best, providing 46 days of work per household. It is followed by Tripura (40), Orissa (39), Rajasthan (39), Nagaland (38) and Maharashtra (37).        
	Bengal has been performing dismally ever since the (scheme) was implemented. Many other states that lagged in the initial stages have improved over the years, but Bengal shows no such inclination, a Union rural development ministry official said.        
	Bengal had created only 14 days of work in 2006-07, 25 days in 2007-08, 26 in 2008-09 and 31 in 2009-10.        
	Data show that the states performance has been poor in the matter of female participation too. While the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act stipulates that 33 per cent of the work should go to women, Bengal has never touched that mark.        
	Routine bad performers like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat have performed much better compared with the previous year. Gujarat has exceeded the national average while Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have come close to it by providing 29 days and 28 days of work per household, respectively.        
	Except for Tripura, the Left-ruled states  Bengal and Kerala  have always performed poorly right from the beginning despite the Lefts claim that the job scheme is a product of its sustained pressure on UPA I.        
	Nationwide, too, the scheme has had very poor work completion rate. Also, few state governments have given the mandatory unemployment allowance to registered workers, and those that have given the dole have done it for a very brief period.        
	We will not be able to do much as the states are the real implementing agency. The job scheme is a demand-driven project and it has to come from the ground, the rural development ministry official said.        
	The scheme has provided employment to 39 million households so far in 2010-11. It has a budgetary allocation of Rs 40,100 crore for the current fiscal.

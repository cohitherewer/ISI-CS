          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, May 9: One Uttar Pradesh girl was killed for marrying against her parents wishes and another is in hospital after being hurled off a rooftop yesterday, a day after a couples honour killing came to light.        
	The back-to-back incidents prompted calls for a special central law to check such murders and led a senior police officer to urge community leaders to launch a campaign to dissuade parents from resorting to such barbarity.         
	What has set off alarm in Uttar Pradesh is that yesterdays killing didnt occur in the states west where such incidents are common, but in the eastern district of Kaushambi where such killings were thought to be rare.        
	Another worry is that the 19-year-old girl was murdered despite having chosen a man from the same caste. Earlier incidents mostly involved parents who couldnt accept their childrens inter-caste relationships.         
	The girl, identified as Soni Kori, was dragged to a temple by her father, who had come to know that she had married a man of her choice, and killed with a dagger. We have arrested the father, Bachchu Lal Kori, and the girls brother Dinesh, said Kaushambi superintendent of police Kripa Shankar Singh. Another officer said the girls body had been cut into pieces and dumped in a field near the temple. The manner of killing appeared to be straight from the pages of history that describe medieval acts of revenge, said the officer.        
	It is sad that this (such killings) is spreading elsewhere, said NGO activist Renu Mishra who is doing research on honour killings.        
	The other incident, in the western district of Meerut, set off shock waves as the father is a cop.         
	Sub-inspector S.P. Singh, who hurled daughter and MBA student Parul Singh, 21, off their houses roof, was furious because she had secretly married classmate Dilip Kumar Singh, 27, during a college trip to Vaishno Devi recently.        
	Meerut police chief Sharad Sachchan said the girl, rushed to hospital by neighbours, is now out of danger. A storm broke out in the family after the girl spilled the news about her secret marriage, another police officer said.        
	The two incidents came to light on a day a couple claiming to be Ajit Saini and Anshu Tomar  whose bodies were dug out of a paddy field in Muzaffarnagar on Friday  walked into a police station. But before that, Anuj Tomar, Ashus brother, had confessed to having killed the couple.         
	In Lucknow, Brij Lal, the additional director-general of police, said community leaders and social activists should launch a campaign against honour killings. Legal experts in the state joined the growing chorus for a special law on the lines of the Sati prevention act to curb such crimes. Western Uttar Pradesh has become a virtual killing field of youngsters, said Allahabad High Court advocate Devilal Saran.        
	Boyfriend laptop        
	Jharkhand police today claimed that all data had been deleted from a laptop belonging to the boyfriend of Nirupama Pathak, the journalist whose death was blamed on honour killing.        
	Priyabhanshu Ranjan, the boyfriend, claimed he had received a text message from Nirupama, a resident of Jharkhands Koderma who worked in Delhi, asking him to delete their photos and other data days before her death last month. Nirupama was three months pregnant.

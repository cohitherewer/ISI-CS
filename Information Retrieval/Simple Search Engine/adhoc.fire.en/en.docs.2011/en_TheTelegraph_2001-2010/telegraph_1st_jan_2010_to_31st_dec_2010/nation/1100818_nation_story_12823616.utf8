          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: The Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, 2010, looks set to be passed in the ongoing Parliament session with the BJP on board.        
	The government hammered out a consensus with the BJP at a meeting finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had today with L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley.         
	BJP sources claimed Mukherjees body language appeared positive. The government, they said, promised to address the four-five concerns raised by the BJP.        
	The BJPs support essentially means that the government need not worry about the Lefts opposition or work overtime in winning over parties such as the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal. The BJP has ensured that if its concerns were taken care of, the bill would sail through in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The UPA is still battling for the required numbers in the upper House.        
	The government has ceded some ground to the BJP. The compensation cap will be enhanced from Rs 500 to Rs 1,500 crore and the zero liability clause is also likely to be amended. The supplier is expected to be made liable for his share of culpability in case of a nuclear disaster. If the material and equipment the supplier has given are proved to be faulty and responsible for triggering an accident, he will be liable to share responsibility with the power plant operator.        
	The draft bill pins the liability down entirely on the operator. T. Subbirami Reddy, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on science and technology that is recommending changes in the draft bill, said: The compensation cap will be increased. There will be supplier liability which is very clearly mentioned in the bill.         
	Article 17 (b) of the draft enables an operators right to recourse if the nuclear incident has resulted from the wilful act or gross negligence on the part of the supplier of the material, equipment or services, or of his employee.        
	In deference to the BJPs demand, the government is also likely to delete the Convention on Supplementary Compensation from the statement of objects and reasons of the bill.         
	This implies that the bill will not commit India to signing an international convention that would have given India access to international funds in case of a major accident for which the Indian government would have to contribute a specified amount annually, much like paying an insurance premium.        
	The government is also likely to agree to increase the extinction of right to claim compensation for damages from 10 years to 20 years.        
	The standing committees report is expected to be tabled in Parliament on Wednesday. The amendments will be worked upon by the law ministry and cleared by the Union cabinet before the bill is taken up by Parliament.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Where are Sonia amp; son? Its a party secret
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Where are Sonia amp; son? Its a party secret
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Sonia and Rahul Gandhi                           
	New Delhi, July 31: One question everyone is asking is: Wheres Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi?        
	Shhh its a top secret.        
	At least, thats what the Congress reaction suggests. Officially, the party does not know.        
	So queasy is the Congress that it cancelled even its regular media briefing yesterday  lest this question be hurled at it.        
	The cloak-and-dagger atmosphere reflects the extraordinary secretiveness that descends on the party whenever its anything to do with the personal details of any Nehru-Gandhi  a trait that, combined with the other Congress hallmark of sycophancy, has often provoked accusations of a feudal mindset.        
	So where are mother and son?        
	In private, some party leaders are willing to admit they have heard that Sonia has gone to the US where, apparently, her ailing mother is being treated and that Rahul has accompanied her.        
	Yet spokespersons avoid talking about the issue and senior leaders feign ignorance.        
	Asked why a US visit by Sonia to attend to her ailing mother should be kept a secret, a senior leader, without officially confirming anything, said: Its a private affair and she likes to keep it to herself.        
	Besides, the family has always tried to keep Sonias Italian relatives off the media glare.        
	Some within the Congress, though, feel the party could at least have put out the basic information  that she had to travel abroad because of a family emergency  to avoid unnecessary speculation.        
	We need not allow a mystery to build around a normal family trip. There are security concerns but there was no harm in telling a curious media that she was going abroad, a party leader said.        
	Sonias continued absence from Parliament and the cancellation of her meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron  on the ground that she was unavoidably out of town for a compelling reason  had set the stage for wild speculation.        
	While some said she was not well, one report went to the extent of attributing her inability to meet Cameron to her alleged shyness, conveniently forgetting her many past interactions with global leaders.        
	Some Opposition politicians have been quick to scoff at the Congress culture where even senior leaders are in awe of every member of the Family.        
	 This happens in a monarchy, a BJP member of Parliament said, asking Congress leaders to show a little more of the democratic spirit.        
	Congress leaders contemptuously dismissed these charges. We respect both the security concerns and the need for private space in the leaders life, a source said.        
	There are genuine security reasons (for such secrecy) and the SPG (Special Protection Group), which looks after the familys security, does not want to reveal her tour schedules, one leader explained.        
	Especially during private visits, when the usual security drill is not conducted, the SPG insists on complete secrecy. And if two or more members of the family are together, the security concerns are heightened. Even we are not told the details of her tours if it is not a political visit. Her holiday trips are not made public either.        
	Some Congress leaders slammed the medias obsession with the Nehru-Gandhis private lives, claiming that only their political activities were of public interest.        
	The approach should be institutional, not personal, a leader said. What she does as a mother or daughter is not for public consumption. If she goes to the US as a Congress leader, we would certainly inform you, a leader said.        
	So, even if Sonia is down with a minor ailment such as asthma, the Congress is too squeamish to breathe a word about it.        
	Yet, when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh underwent a major heart surgery, every little detail was available to the media. But then, as many in the Congress may say, theres really no comparison.

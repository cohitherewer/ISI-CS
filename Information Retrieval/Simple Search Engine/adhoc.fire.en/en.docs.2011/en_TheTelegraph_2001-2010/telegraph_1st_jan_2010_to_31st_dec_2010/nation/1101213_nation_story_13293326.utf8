The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Woo in Delhi for vote in Bengal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Woo in Delhi for vote in Bengal

	New Delhi, Dec. 12: The Bengal government believes it has found the perfect emissaries to convince the states Muslims how much the Left has done for them.        
	Namely, Muslim labourers who have migrated from Bengal to Delhi  a choice many may find a little surprising.        
	Especially because, as some of these labourers told The Telegraph today, they and their tribe were forced to migrate from Bengal in thousands because there was no development in their areas.        
	This after they had just listened to statistics-laden speeches by two Bengal CPM leaders explaining how much the states Muslims had benefited under Left rule. The Bengal government had got a group of 50 labourers ferried to the seminar at Banga Bhavan, attended by about 100 people in all.        
	Naushad Alam, 21, and Shabir, 20, had no idea why they and the others had been put on a bus and brought there. Our contractor, Nazir, told us to come and we did. Is this an election rally? Which party has organised it? Alam asked, sipping tea outside the Banga Bhavan auditorium.        
	The duo said they were among some 15,000 labourers from Islampur subdivision of North Dinajpur who had been forced to migrate because of lack of jobs. Most of us work in textile factories in Govindpuri, said Shabir.        
	Had there been any jobs available in Bengal, we would not have come here. They might make tall claims but the reality is very bad, said another labourer, Rafique.        
	So, why is the Left wooing migrants in Delhi? These people keep visiting their villages. If we educate them, they will go back and spread it. Its part of a multi-pronged effort, a CPM leader explained.        
	Asked the same question by the audience, former MP Hannan Mollah said: People from Bengal living outside are being misinformed about the Left; so we want to clear it.        
	Mollah and Maheshtala MLA Mursalin Mollah were the two CPM speakers at the show. The Bengal Left has already held two similar meetings in Delhi to woo Muslims ahead of the 2011 polls, the previous one addressed to the Muslim intelligentsia.        
	The Left speakers did acknowledge, however, that Muslims were hardly better off in Bengal than elsewhere in the country. But they had their own logic to explain it.        
	Bengals case is different from other states. All the educated and well-off Muslims (of Bengal) went to Pakistan (Bangladesh) after Partition. The poor Muslims, mainly marginal farmers, stayed back, Hannan said.        
	It takes time to start from zero and reach a level where Muslims can claim their share. We have reached that stage now.        
	Are the Lefts Delhi seminars paying off? The migrants said they would return home to vote next year. The mood is for change, Alam said while the others nodded.        
	The CPM has lined up more seminars.

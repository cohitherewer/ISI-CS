          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 24: Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sen is believed to have expressed his reluctance to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to be part of an inquiry committee set up to probe the Maoist attack in Shilda to avert allegations of him influencing the probe.        
	Sen has been accused of lapses that hampered the personnel from retaliating when the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp had been attacked on February 15, a strike that killed 24 policemen.        
	The inquiry committee comprises the home secretary, additional director-general (CID) Raj Kanojia and inspector-general of police (western zone) Zulfikar Hasan.        
	Kuldiep Singh, who as IG, western zone, had similar charges of lapses levelled against him, had to quit the panel after he was transferred yesterday.         
	There was a proposal that the chief secretary head the panel but the chief minister was in favour of the home secretary leading the committee. However, questions were raised after charges of lapses were levelled against the home secretary, a source at Writers said.         
	There were (also) reports that the home secretary could not shrug off the responsibility for the Shilda attack. This is why he is reluctant to be in the committee.        
	Sen said today that my best possible answer will be no comments.        
	After the attack in Shilda, Sen had claimed that both he and director-general of police Bhupinder Singh had received reports of a Maoist build-up there, three hours before the strike. Bhupinder Singh had denied awareness of any intelligence input.         
	The contradictory statements of the home secretary and the DG was a reason why Bhupinder Singh was not included in the inquiry committee. Otherwise, it would have been difficult to find out whether there were prior intelligence inputs. The home secretary has cited this as a reason to stay out of the committee as he believes his not being a part of the committee will make the probe more credible, an official said at Writers today.

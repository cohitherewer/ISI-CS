	Lucknow, April 19: Two video journalists have been held in connection with the death of an Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) professor who was allegedly harassed after a sting operation revealed his homosexuality.        
	Syed Ali Murtaza and Aashu Malik are among the seven persons, including top AMU officials, whom professor Srinivas R. Siras had named in his complaint. The 64-year-old was found dead in his rented house on April 7 after being hounded out of the campus two months ago.        
	The police had stonewalled the complaint before registering it on court orders three days after the professors death. The complaint accuses the two journalists and other suspects of barging into Sirass residence and clicking him when he was allegedly sharing an intimate moment with a man.        
	They have been arrested on charges of forcibly entering his house, threatening him and torturing him mentally and physically, police said.

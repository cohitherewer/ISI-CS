The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hyderabad under cloud of dope 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hyderabad under cloud of dope 
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Aug. 21: Terror hub, nerve centre of Left-wing extremism, and now drug den.         
	Police in the IT city said they had launched surveillance on dozens of well-known residents, including bureaucrats, people linked to the film world and relatives of top industrialists and politicians, who they claimed had turned drug addicts or peddlers.        
	Officials said the police in the Andhra capital had set up an anti-drug cell after several Nigerian peddlers, arrested over the past 45 days, spilled the beans.         
	What they revealed stunned even the cops  nine upmarket pubs had turned into drug dens.        
	We have information that drug-laced drinks are served in pubs to students, women and affluent kids, Hyderabad police commissioner A.K. Khan said, painting a grim picture of an organised network.        
	On Thursday, the police arrested a Nigerian, Chima Clement alias Victor, and two budding actors, B. Raghunadha Raju and B. Bharat Raju, brothers of a popular actor.        
	The Nigerian was selling drugs to Raghunadha and Bharat when the police caught them red-handed. The cops also seized 40gm of cocaine from Victor.         
	Khan said the Telugu film industry has been reeling after several flops and many bankrupt producers and actors had turned to peddling drugs to make up for their losses.        
	A few months back, a financially broken director landed in custody after a failed burglary attempt.         
	Police sources said the phonebook of the arrested Nigerian had thrown up 500 names, including that of businessmen, an upcoming star, two producers and the grandson of a former MP. We have to find out whether they were drug users as their names were in the Nigerians phonebook, a senior official said.        
	The sources said the drug peddlers, many of them students from African countries, had taken advantage of the police focus on terrorism and the Maoist menace. While the overworked force concentrated on these twin problems, the illegal narcotics trade thrived.        
	Four Nigerians and a man from Uganda have been arrested and the police, the sources said, have launched a hunt for the big fish.        
	The officials said several African students who came on study visas had overstayed. Victor reportedly came to the city on a 20-day tourist visa in 2007 and stayed on illegally.        
	The sources said the police were keeping tabs on nearly 1,700 foreign students, particularly 450 from African and Latin American countries, who are exploited by peddlers.         
	When the Nizams ruled Hyderabad, ganja, or cannabis, was officially grown in Warangal and Nalgonda districts and sold openly in Hyderabad.         
	The Nizams are long gone, but ganja is still cultivated in the Narsipatnam forest belt of Warangal by tribals and smuggled to Mumbai and Chennai and from there to South East Asia and West Asia.

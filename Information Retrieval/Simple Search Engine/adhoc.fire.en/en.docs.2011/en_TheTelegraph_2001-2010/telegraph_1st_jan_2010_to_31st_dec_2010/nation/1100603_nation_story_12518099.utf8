          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                      
	New Delhi, June 2: Mamata Banerjee may yet get what she wants  early Assembly elections in Bengal.        
	Officials said it was an Election Commission practice to hold simultaneous polls in states where Assembly terms end almost together.        
	In Bengal, the term of the current House ends in June 2011, about seven months after the tenure of the Bihar Assembly expires in November 2010. So simultaneous polls in these two states would make logistical sense, they said.         
	According to the officials, another reason the commission might club the elections in the two neighbouring states is the Maoist menace.         
	If elections are held simultaneously in Bengal and Bihar, troops collated from across the country  the commission does not have any of its own  could be easily moved from one to the other. Otherwise, the officials said, they would have to return to the barracks only to come back after a few months.        
	Constitutional experts, however, said Mamata couldnt demand early polls, and it was up to the commission to take a call whether to delay or advance elections.        
	Under Article 324 of the Constitution, the commission, an expert said, has absolute powers to decide the dates on which to hold elections to Parliament or any Assembly.        
	The commission can call elections any time in the six months preceding the date on which the term of a House expires, said Subhash Kashyap, former Lok Sabha secretary-general and adviser to the government on constitutional matters.        
	However, the convention is to wait for a state government to suggest a date to the governor for dissolving the House. The commission usually goes by that date.        
	If a state government shows no signs of doing so, the commission can take a call on the poll dates.         
	Senior lawyer and constitutional expert P.P. Rao said that under the Constitution, six months should not elapse between two sessions of a House.        
	Since an election process takes anything between four and eight weeks to complete, sources said the commission could wait till March-April next year for the Bengal government to recommend dissolution of the House, but not any further.        
	The term of the Bengal Assembly ends on June 12, 2011, five years after the date of its first sitting on June 12, 2006. But should the government wait till then, the reins of governance would have to be handed over to the governor, paving the way for Presidents rule, Rao said.         
	No government in power would want to go for elections under Presidents rule. So theres no reason to believe that the state government would not want to recommend dissolution of the House well in time, he added.        
	Rao said Mamata may have tried to score a political point with her demand for early polls, but it was not constitutionally tenable.        
	He also said local polls were hardly an indicator of what Assembly or Lok Sabha poll results might be, and cited several instances in which governments had gambled on the outcome of local elections only to see their plans backfire.         
	The mandates for local bodies and Assemblies and Parliament are different, Rao said.

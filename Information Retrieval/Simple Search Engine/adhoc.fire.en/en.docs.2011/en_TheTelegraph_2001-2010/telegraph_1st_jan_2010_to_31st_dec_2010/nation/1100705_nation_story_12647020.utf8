The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Media-ban curtain that separates twins
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Media-ban curtain that separates twins
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                           Pakistanis protest in Lahore against the suicide bomb attack on Saturday. (AFP)                                  
	There is perhaps a simpler trick to kick-starting normalisation of cross-border ties than being strenuously attempted on high diplomatic tables in New Delhi and Islamabad: dismantle the information blockade and almost instantly the sinister stereotype of Pakistan as a diabolical diarchy run by the ISI-jihadi complex will fall away to reveal a vibrant plurality across the fence whose daily obsessions are far removed from inflicting the proverbial thousand cuts on India.         
	Youll still find the odd Indian news channel on Pakistani cable distributorships, and almost all entertainment networks; on the other side, the curtain is drawn air-tight. It obliterates the daily realities of Pakistan in Indian eyes and reduces the nation to not much more than a stage from which Hafiz Mohammed Saeed marshals his virulent war.         
	Its such a travesty that two nations talking about peace will not allow their people a real look at each other, said a top Pakistani Track II player who would not be named.        
	I cannot see what harm will come if we could read each others newspapers and watch our respective television programmes. History shows that people are much better at pushing peace than governments, he added.         
	The level of mutual exchange gives a lie to the vows of mutual friendship being announced from both capitals. It remains a private, and often perilous, enterprise, not public policy.         
	Rahat Fateh Ali Khan will be allowed a string of assignments in Mumbai, or Atif Aslam the odd one, but they make only half the song. Asma Jehangir will light a candle on the Pakistani side of Wagah, and Kuldip Nayar on the Indian end. But that doesnt do enough to illumine our views of each other.         
	Spend just a primetime hour surfing what is now a proliferating rash of news channels. Or sample the daily fare of newspapers. Or exercise the far less labourious option of walking into a shop and asking for the latest music. Nine times out of ten they will hand you copy of the Best of Coke Studio.         
	Dont come away thinking its merely music youve bought; youve bought into a raging social revolution, at Rs 150 a disc. We are in the middle of an intense civil war against Talibanisation, says Lahore-based activist-musician Taimur Rehman.         
	Music and liberal philosophy are anathema to them, but the fact that those traditions have been revived and become popular is proof that they are being opposed, Taimur adds.         
	The security scare across Pakistanis such that it had been impossible to hold events like public concerts.         
	Coke Studio was born in retort to Talibani censorship  a TV programme that showcases all manner of Pakistani musicians, from Sufis to liberals to rank Leftists, all rank heretics for the Taliban. But the runaway success of Coke Studio, now into its fourth season, is a raging taunt to militant Islamists.        
	This is the rebirth of our great poets banished by Zia ul-Haqs Islamisation drive, says Taimur, whose main lyrics come from Left-wing writers Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Habib Jalib. This is very much a loud announcement by the people that they will not accept the narrow prescriptions of the mullahs.         
	Pakistans two current hits  Jugni and Bibi Sanem Janam  are loud attestations to Taimurs argument; the former is a Sufi rant sung by the feisty Arif Lohar, the latter a post-modern song of rebellion belted out by two Pakhtun women, Zeb Bangash and Haniya Aslam.         
	Zeb and Haniya come from Pakhtun stock, where women have limited roles and rights. That they have been able to establish themselves as successful musicians is itself a measure of the socio-cultural churning in Pakistan, says Bilal Raja, an old Lahore store-owner who confesses he had cellared the poetry and music of the likes of Faiz for decades out of fear.         
	There was a time it could land you in jail. Now, even with the Taliban all around us, there is a social mutiny in the air. Sales are huge, Raja adds.        
	Much the same irreverence is daily lavished on Pakistans politics and politicians in the opinion pages of newspapers and in TV studios. They stand questioned, challenged, damned, their many acts of omission and commission dragged to harsh scrutiny.         
	One of the most watched anchors, Meher Bokhari, arrives to present her News Beat all tooth, nail and bite; by the time she is done, her guests, mostly ministers and party bigwigs, are crawling for cover.         
	Why cant the state control the Taliban? Where are the great Pakistani generals and the army? Why is Lahore burning? Why is Karachi overrun by criminal gangs? Why are we not able to square up to what happened in Mumbai? If Hafiz Saeed is indeed innocent, why can we not proclaim that from the rooftops? Why is Balochistan being starved of resources? Why are politicians living in palaces while the masses cant make ends meet? What a nautanki (vaudeville) politicians have made of Pakistan and its people, will you explain why? Is this why you were voted to power?         
	The Pakistani establishment may be confused of centre of gravity and weak of nerve, but the same cannot be said of its media. It is creating openings in a society used to being hammered by dictatorship that probably need to resound across the border. The opaque information barriers wont let it.

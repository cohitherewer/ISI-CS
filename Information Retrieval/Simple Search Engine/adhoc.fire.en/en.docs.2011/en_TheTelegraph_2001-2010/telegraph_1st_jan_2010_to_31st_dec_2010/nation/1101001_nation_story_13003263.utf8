The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lawyers snatch their media moment
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lawyers snatch their media moment
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, Sept. 30: Till the last mile, the great Indian security machine rolled like clockwork, not a single element out of place. But when crunch moment dawned, the hijackers took over.        
	A group of some 15-20 advocates, three representing Hindus and the rest hangers-on, today flashed the V-sign and waved triumphantly as they strode out of Lucknow High Court towards the district magistrates office complex across the road, minutes after the judges had delivered the verdict.        
	For a while, the reporters thronging the media centre and millions glued to their TV sets were flummoxed: what on earth was going on?        
	Who were these people, all in lawyers gowns, heading jubilantly towards the media centre? What were they so delighted about? Had the court ruled in favour of one of the sides? How come the group was having a free run? Where were the security personnel, hundreds of whom had been deployed around the court?        
	As the waiting hundreds nudged one another in confusion, the group descended on the media centre. Waving sheets of paper, some of them screamed that the Hindus had decisively won the legal battle.        
	Within seconds, a section of Sangh parivar activists had sprung out of their seats. Jai Shri Ram, some chanted over the deafening din, in defiance of the Mayavati administrations ban on any overt display of victory or defeat. But the voices died away as policemen stared the activists down.        
	By that time, advocate P.N. Sharma had grabbed one of the two microphones. Yelling at gathered mediapersons to lend him their ears, he announced: The disputed site is Lord Rams birthplace. Muslims have no right.        
	Soon after, a man in saffron robes and a flowing beard joined him, as did the others in the group, all speaking at the same time and adding to the chaos. For some 15 minutes, the unofficial media briefing continued with Sharma waxing eloquent that he and his colleagues had brought victory to Hindus.        
	Finally, around 4:45pm, about a half hour after the security machine stuttered, a group of 25 armed CRPF jawans led by Rajiv Krishan, the Lucknow DIG, trooped in and removed the microphone Sharma was speaking into.        
	But that wasnt the end. Immediately after Sharma retreated, advocate Ranjana Agnihotri grabbed the second microphone. The Sunni Central Wakf Boards petition No. 4 has been shot down, she hollered. It has been proved that the land belonged to the Hindus.        
	Agnihotri, who represents the Akhil Bharat Ramjanmabhoomi Punaruddhar Samiti, then fed the crowd some more of her interpretation of the verdict. Earlier, she had waved at the cameras as the group was heading towards the media centre.        
	By the time DGP Krishan finally took control of proceedings, the damage had been done. A typical Indian moment had played itself out on Verdict Day.        
	After sanity was restored, the DGP began distributing copies of the verdict, setting off another wave of madness as activists posing as journalists snatched the documents from police officers.        
	The chaos should have been avoided, was all Krishan had to say. We will look into how some people tried to hijack the issue for a misinformation campaign, said Anil K. Sagar, the Lucknow district magistrate.

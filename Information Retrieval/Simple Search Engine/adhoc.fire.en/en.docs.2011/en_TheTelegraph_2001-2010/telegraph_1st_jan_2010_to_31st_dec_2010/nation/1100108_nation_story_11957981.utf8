	New Delhi, Jan. 7 (PTI): The Supreme Court has agreed to examine whether people murdered in motor vehicles are entitled to the accident insurance claims available to those killed in road accidents.        
	Is it that in murder cases, accident insurance awards are being provided? a bench asked. Lawyers representing insurance companies said that in a number of cases, tribunals were awarding such claims.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sea erosion concern for turtle nesting
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sea erosion concern for turtle nesting
                            
	Kendrapara, March 24 (PTI): For the past few years, the arrival of less number of Olive Ridley Turtles was a cause of concern for environmentalists; but this year, the forest department is finding it difficult to provide security to millions of eggs laid by the creatures in a tiny island.        
	The delicate turtles, at present engaged in second mass nesting along the idyllic Nasi-2 Island in Orissa, are facing severe space crunch with the sea erosion having reduced the unmanned island to about 900 metres in length and 90 metres in width.        
	The marauding sea in the Kendrapara district has altered the geographical contour of the nesting ground close to the Wheelers Island defence installation project now teeming with female turtles.        
	There was hardly any space left on the sandy beach for female turtles to lay eggs. Earlier this month, 1.87 lakh turtles had arrived en masse here and dug out nests along the beach occupying almost the whole of the beach area, said Prasanna Kumar Behera, the divisional forest officer of Rajnagar Mangrove (Wildlife) Forest Division.        
	We are facing a crisis of sorts following fresh influx of turtles in the ongoing second phase of mass nesting of these species. Nearly 1.53 lakh more turtles have again turned up to lay eggs. Never before had such a large number of turtles invaded the beach in second phase of mass nesting, he said.        
	We are concerned about the safety of eggs earlier laid in millions of nests dug out by breeding turtles during the first phase of mass nesting. Each nest contains to 40 to 50 eggs, he informed.        
	The forest personnel guarding the nesting ground were helpless as turtles during the course of laying eggs cause damage to eggs tucked inside the earlier built nests, said the officials.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Education watchdog loses funding power
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Education watchdog loses funding power
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                       Kapil Sibal                          
	New Delhi, March 19: India is for the first time separating the task of regulating higher education from funding of universities, stripping its proposed watchdog of its planned role to also finance varsities.        
	The human resource development ministry has decided to divest the National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER) of its funding role after criticism that it was perpetuating past mistakes, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The commission  an overarching regulator that will subsume existing watchdogs  may also lose the powers of a civil court.         
	The modifications follow nation-wide consultations and represent the Centres attempts to douse concerns raised by academicians and state governments over Indias proposed new higher education architecture. The changes represent a shift in Indias vision of how to regulate higher education.         
	The UGC both regulates standards and funds varsity education. The dual responsibilities have often been linked  through overt or covert threats of fund cuts if a university does not follow the commissions diktat. Several academicians and the UGC have argued that power of funding allows them greater clout in maintaining standards in universities that may otherwise not adhere to norms.         
	But critics, including the National Knowledge Commission, have frowned on the dual responsibility, saying it kills the autonomy of institutions as UGC babus can artificially create cash crunches for varsities that do not kowtow to them.         
	The draft bill on NCHER, which was placed on the HRD ministry website and circulated among stakeholders across the country, also tried to address another key complaint against the UGC  that it does not have enough teeth.         
	Unlike the UGC, the NCHER  under the draft bill  was given the powers of a civil court that could summon officials or varsity administrators and conduct inquiries. But consultations held in different states and academicians revealed opposition to the commissions role as a funding agency, and to empowering it on a par with a civil court.         
	But the task force and the ministry have not decided yet on whether to withdraw the powers of a civil court.         
	Bills cleared        
	The cabinet today approved three key education reform legislation aimed at punishing institutions that cheat students, ensuring quality rating for all higher education centres and setting up dedicated tribunals to settle disputes.         
	Kapil Sibals HRD ministry plans to introduce the bills when Parliament reconvenes in April. The bill to curb unfair practices in higher education for the first time punishes institutions that mislead or cheat students through false promises made through their prospectus or advertisements, or charge capitation fees.         
	The second bill sets up special tribunals empowered to settle disputes in the education sector  students complaining against institutions, teachers against the management or institutions challenging decisions taken by regulators.         
	The third bill is aimed at setting up a National Authority for Regulation of Accreditation in Higher Education that will see the government withdraw from direct quality rating of institutions. The authority will set accreditation norms and issue licences to professional rating agencies.

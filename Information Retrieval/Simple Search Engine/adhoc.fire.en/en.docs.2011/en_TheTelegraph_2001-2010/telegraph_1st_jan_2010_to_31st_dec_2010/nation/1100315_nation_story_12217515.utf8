The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | HRD to promote Islamic art
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      HRD to promote Islamic art
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 14: The human resource development ministry (HRD) is preparing a blueprint for the promotion of the dying art of Islamic calligraphy and architecture, once popular but now not known or studied even by most Indian Muslims.         
	HRD minister Kapil Sibal has asked the National Council for Promotion of the Urdu Language (NCPUL) to broaden its ambit and promote the fast dying art, sources told The Telegraph.         
	Based on Sibals orders, the countrys apex agency for promotion of Urdu is setting up a panel of experts to draft a new vision for the council that will include the promotion of calligraphy and architecture.         
	The minister was very keen that the NCPUL take up this task and raised the matter on more than one occasion at internal meetings, a source said.         
	Sibal himself is a known art afficionado and both his office and home contain several paintings, portraits and other art forms. He is also the MP from the Chandni Chowk constituency, which has a sizeable Muslim population.         
	Calligraphy has traditionally formed a crucial part of art in Islam, particularly as it provided a tool to preserve the teachings of the Quran. The art form has been used in the inscriptions on walls and roofs of mosques.         
	Islamic architecture inspired the construction of some of the countrys best-known and most-loved monuments  such as the Taj Mahal, the Agra Fort and the Red Fort in Delhi.         
	Both Islamic calligraphy and architecture remain popular in West Asia and north Africa but are today practised by few families. Islamic architecture is today only used to build mosques, while calligraphy is used to inscribe on the walls, experts and Muslim leaders have complained to the government.         
	The same families that were pursuing these art forms 200 years ago continue to transfer the knowledge through the generations. But children are turning away because it is not lucrative and we could soon lose these art forms, a senior official said.         
	The ministry has received several complaints over the past few years over the absence of courses on Islamic calligraphy or architecture at the countrys best educational institutions.         
	The NCPUL was set up in 1996 to serve as a national agency tasked with promoting Urdu language and education, including access to textbooks in the language across India.

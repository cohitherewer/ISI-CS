          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Aug. 22: A lieutenant colonel has been dismissed and jailed for his involvement in a milk scam that shook the army at a time thousands of soldiers were locked in a tense border standoff with Pakistani troops.        
	Defence spokesperson Lt Col Biplab Nath said Lt Col Kuldeep Singh of military farms had been cashiered from services  in other words, deprived of his rank and retirement benefits.        
	He has also been sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment in connection with irregularities in the procurement of milk powder, the spokesperson added.        
	A court martial found the officer guilty on Thursday and pronounced its verdict, which is subject to confirmation by the Northern Command and army headquarters, sources said.        
	The sack order came a few years after a colonel was dismissed in Assam for ketchup killings. The colonel had made civilians pose in photographs as dead separatists by splashing their bodies with tomato puree in the hope of winning a gallantry award.        
	The milk scam surfaced during Operation Parakram, launched soon after the December 2001 attack on Parliament when thousands of troops were moved to the northern and western fronts.        
	Sources said between January 2001 and August 2003, 1,526 tonnes of skimmed milk powder worth Rs 10 crore were bought, without formal orders, from the open market despite adequate stocks in army stores. The sources said Lt Col Singh was the prime accused in the case and the general court martial was convened after a court of inquiry booked him on 25 charges.         
	The court martial, presided over by a brigadier, found the officer guilty on 17 counts. He was found guilty of 17 charges, including fraud, irregularities, acts prejudicial to good order and not upholding military discipline under the army act, and for failure to exercise requisite supervision, a source said.         
	He said another officer of the rank of colonel was also facing a court martial for failure of supervision and technical inspection in the scam. He was holding the post of director, military farms, then, the source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bar Council versus HRD
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bar Council versus HRD
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: The Bar Council of India (BCI) has rejected the human resource development ministrys proposed law to create a new overarching higher education regulator and will boycott intra-government consultations planned on the subject.         
	The BCI has written to the HRD ministry formally demanding that the National Commission for Higher Education and Research Bill exempt legal education from the purview of the proposed regulator.         
	The BCI has also said that it will not join consultations slated for February 13 between a ministry task force and higher education regulators, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	We are boycotting the HRD ministry-sponsored consultations because we do not recognise the bill, in its present stage, as a Government of India bill but merely one that is being pushed by the HRD ministry, a BCI official said.         
	The bar councils letter has set the stage for an open confrontation between the apex regulator of the legal profession and the ministry on the bill that aims to restructure Indias higher education regulatory structure.         
	The tussle may be resolved only through an intervention by the Prime Minister himself, sources said.         
	The commission, announced by the President as a key agenda of the UPA in its second term, is envisaged in the bill as a single regulator that will monitor all streams of higher education other than those related to medicine.         
	The University Grants Commission, the All India Council for Technical Education and the National Council for Teacher Education will be wound up, their tasks taken over by the panel.         
	The BCI and the Council of Architecture perform two tasks  regulating education in their respective streams and issuing licences mandatory to practice as a lawyer or an architect in India.         
	The bill proposes to transfer control over legal and architecture education to the new regulator while allowing the BCI and the architecture council to continue as quality monitors of both professions.         
	Two independent government panels  the National Knowledge Commission and the Yash Pal panel to review higher education  have recommended taking regulation of legal education away from the BCI.         
	At present, no degrees in legal education can be offered unless they are approved by the bar council.         
	But the BCIs decision to boycott the consultations reflects that the council is not willing to even consider giving up its powers over legal education. In its letter to the ministry, the BCI has said that it believes it is performing well as the regulator of legal education.

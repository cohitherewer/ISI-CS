The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak keeps ears cocked
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pak keeps ears cocked
          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, Nov. 6: Pakistan had its ears cocked today as Barack Obama vowed to stand in solidarity with all of Mumbai and all of India in working to eradicate terror.        
	From the foreign office to politicians to experts to the common man, all watched Obamas tribute to 26/11 victims on television with interest and utmost care, wondering if he would have anything to say about Pakistan. The American President did not say a word.        
	Yesterday, Pakistan had handed over to India its 13th dossier on the attacks, seeking more data to speed up prosecution of seven suspects and formally requesting it to facilitate the visit of a proposed judicial commission to interview key witnesses.        
	Pakistani analysts today said Obama was unlikely to be critical of Islamabad at a time the US needed its help to pull off its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Besides, Pakistan had a lot of clout among Afghan ethnic groups and had facilitated talks between Hamid Karzai and the warring factions.        
	The US cannot ignore Islamabads role in the safe exit of 150,000 troops from Afghanistan and in promotion of the reconciliation process, a security official said.        
	Because of this, Obama or any US official would not like to say anything adverse about Pakistan, especially on Indian soil, as it never goes down well with Pakistanis.        
	Foreign policy analyst Hasan Askari said: It will be very bad if he speaks publicly against Pakistan when his country needs Pakistan.        
	Askari said the expectation was Obama would not drag Pakistan into any discussion on terror-related issues even if India did. If that happens, I think the implications will be serious.        
	He said Pakistan had two concerns. Will Obama criticise Pakistan is our first concern. The second concern is will he make any significant move to encourage the two countries to start a dialogue.        
	Foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Basit said Pakistan hoped Obamas visit would help promote peace and stability in South Asia. In case the US shows indifference to issues central to peace in the region, then we will obviously be concerned.

	Srinagar, Dec. 14: An air force Mi-26 helicopter crashed at Satwari in Jammu today, injuring seven air force personnel and two railway officials.         
	Defence spokesperson Lt Col Biplaw Nath said the chopper crashed shortly after taking off at 9.30am within the airport premises after tilting dangerously to its left.        
	The helicopter was on way to Surankote area of Jammu when it crashed. The ground staff rushed into action, rescued and shifted them to a military hospital close by, the spokesperson said.        
	The injured air force personnel included two wing commanders, a squadron leader and four others, Nath said.         
	Two of them have suffered multiple fractures. But the injuries are not life threatening, he said.         
	He said a technical snag appeared to be the reason behind the crash. An inquiry has been ordered. The airport was closed to traffic till the debris was cleared.        
	The crash came on a day two CRPF personnel of the 182 Battalion were injured when militants hurled a grenade towards their mobile bunker at Rajpora Chowk in Pulwama. Five civilians were hurt, too.        
	The dead CRPF men are head constable Anil Kumar and constable Manoj Kumar.

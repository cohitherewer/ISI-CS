	Srinagar, July 14: Two girls have allegedly gone missing from police custody in Jammus Kishtwar district, triggering massive protests in the area.         
	Kishtwar police had detained two girls and a boy on July 12 but claimed they had released the girls the same day.         
	But their families claimed they have not reached home.         
	A large number of people took to streets to protest their disappearance, prompting a senior police and a civil officer to rush to the remote area to diffuse the crisis.         
	There were clashes between the mob and the police which used tear gas shells to disperse them. Several people were injured in the clashes, officials said.         
	However, the Kishtwar district magistrate, G.R. Bhagat, said the situation was under control. The police have removed station house officer Farooq Ahmad from the post and registered a case against him.

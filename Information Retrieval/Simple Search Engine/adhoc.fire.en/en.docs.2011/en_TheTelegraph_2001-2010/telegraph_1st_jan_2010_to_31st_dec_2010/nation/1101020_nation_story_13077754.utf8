The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress notices spoilt child
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Congress notices spoilt child
          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: The Congress, which usually avoids reacting to Nitin Gadkaris barbs, today described the BJP president as a spoilt child who would do anything to attract attention.         
	The BJP president has crossed all limits of irresponsibility, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said, responding to Gadkaris attempt to drag the PMO into the Commonwealth Games muck.         
	Barely a few days ago, Tiwari had refused to react to Gadkaris statement on Bihar, arguing that the Congress would not like to honour him by taking note of his views.         
	But the attack on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, whose integrity has never been questioned, has enraged the party that zealously guards the image of its top leadership.         
	The BJP presidents demeanour is like that of a spoilt child who will do anything to attract attention, Tiwari said, adding that this time he had excelled himself and crossed all limits. He described Gadkaris news conference as a diversionary ploy by a scared president of a party whose members are now being caught, in a reference to the income tax raids on BJP activist Sudhanshu Mittal.         
	If Gadkari had any proof of the allegations he was making, he should have submitted it to the inquiry committee or investigating agencies, the Congress spokesperson said.         
	Other Congress leaders said the BJP should wait for the inquiries to be over and appreciate that the Prime Minister did not wait for even 24 hours after the Games had closed to order a comprehensive probe into the alleged irregularities.         
	The BJPs track record on the issue of corruption is pathetic. We have seen what they did in the Tehelka scandal, Tiwari said.         
	The war of words over the Games will continue and probably intensify when Parliament reopens for the winter session on November 9, but the BJP president has finally managed to get the Congresss attention. So far, the partys spokespersons have maintained that Gadkari does not have the political stature to deserve a formal response from the Congress.         
	While any charges levelled by Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj or L.K. Advani are rebutted promptly, the Congress has so far chosen to ignore what Gadkari says.        
	When the partys response was sought on a remark he made about Rahul Gandhis inexperience some time ago, Tiwari had said: Gadkari has not acquired that level of political gravitas to compel us to respond. He is just an extension board of the RSS in Delhi that BJP leaders connect to draw power from.         
	Asked if Tiwari had made a casual remark, a media department member had said: We discussed the matter and came to the conclusion not to take note of what he says. We take a call on who should be given how much weight from the party podium. Outside, if somebody responds to him, for instance on a television show, it is fine. But from the official podium, we have decided to ignore him.

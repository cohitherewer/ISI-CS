The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CBI probe   on radar
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CBI probe   on radar
          SUJAN DUTTA                                    
	New Delhi, Jan. 14: The army is likely to ask the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the role of Siliguri-based businessman Dilip Agarwal.        
	An army court of inquiry has found prima facie evidence of links between Agarwal and military secretary Lt Gen. Avadhesh Prakash, who is said to have used his influence to strike a land deal for the realtor, overriding security concerns in the Siliguri Corridor.        
	In its report, quoted in The Telegraph, the court of inquiry convened by the Eastern Army Commander, Lt Gen. V.K. Singh, gave its opinion in these words: Activities of Mr Dilip Agarwal and his associates need to be verified so as to prevent them from exploiting the army formations and units in future, especially in 33 Corps.        
	Asked if he would request a CBI investigation on Agarwal because the realtor was not in the army, the chief, Gen. Deepak Kapoor, today said: We are going to look into those aspects.        
	While the court of inquiry named Prakash, Lt Gen. P.K. Rath, commander of the Sukna-headquartered 33 Corps, Lt Gen. Ramesh Halgali, commander of the Jalandhar-headquartered 11 corps and Major Gen. P.C. Sen, chief of staff in the 33 Corps, it noted that Agarwal had refused to answer questions on his companies and links.        
	Agarwal had issued a media release last month, saying the land did not belong to the army and, hence, there was no question of any scam having taken place.        
	The generals are covered by the Army Act and army rules but the businessman, being a civilian, is not bound by them.

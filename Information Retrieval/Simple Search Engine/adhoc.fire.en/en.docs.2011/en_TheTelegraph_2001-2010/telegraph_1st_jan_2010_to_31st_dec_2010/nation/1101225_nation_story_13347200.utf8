The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rain bail-out for Maharashtra farmers
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rain bail-out for Maharashtra farmers

	Mumbai, Dec. 24: The Centre today cleared Rs 600 crore for Maharashtra farmers hit by unseasonal rain that has partly caused the onion crisis, the relief coming on a day wholesale prices of the vegetable dipped to Rs 17 a kg.        
	The special assistance was announced following meetings chief minister Prithviraj Chavan held with Manmohan Singh and Sharad Pawar today.         
	The Prime Minister agreed to grant Rs 400 crore from the National Disaster Relief Fund, while Pawar, the agriculture minister, decided to set aside Rs 200 crore for fruit growers.        
	An agriculture ministry team will conduct a survey of the areas where crops were damaged by the rains in October and November and based on its report, more financial assistance could be anno- unced, government sources said.        
	Officials said Chavan and his officials submitted demands to the Prime Minister for another Rs 732 crore to undertake emergency road repairs and Rs 4,000 crore for a permanent revamp. The roads, too, were damaged in the rain.        
	The delegation that met the Prime Minister included, besides Chavan, Pawar, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, the BJPs Gopinath Munde and the Shiv Senas Anant Geete.        
	In his meeting with Chavan, farm minister Pawar offered to waive interest on crop loans taken by the affected farmers and pay 50 per cent of the crop insurance dues if the state sent written requests, officials said.        
	The central grants will be in addition to the assistance the Chavan-led cabinet cleared last evening as part of a Rs 1,000-crore package announced by the chief minister in the Assembly earlier this month.         
	A Maharashtra survey has estimated the number of the affected farmers at 29 lakh.        
	In Maharashtras onion belt, prices seemed to have cooled, but not tempers.         
	Farmers blocked roads at Manmad in Nashik protesting the ban clamped on onion exports earlier this week to rein in prices. At nearby Lasalgaon, Indias largest wholesale onion hub, prices fell to Rs 1,700-Rs 2,300 a quintal from Rs 7,100 on Monday.        
	But the downtrend of the past few days promised customers little relief.        
	The Association of Hotels and Restaurants in Maharashtra indicated hotels may raise food rates by 25 per cent because of soaring vegetable costs.         
	Besides banning onion exports, the Centre allowed imports, including from Pakistan, and waived customs duty.

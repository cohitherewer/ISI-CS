The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shame kills couple after bank fraud
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shame kills couple after bank fraud
          AMIT ROY                            (Above) Bhindi Dhanji and Kishore                          
	London, March 18: An Indian-origin HSBC employee who apparently felt no sense of shame while stealing nearly 120,000 from the accounts of two vulnerable pensioners took her own life in the UK because she could not face the shame of going to prison.        
	In a double tragedy that has shocked police who appear not to understand sub-continental notions of izzat, the bodies of Bhindi Dhanji, 31, and her husband Kishore, were found hanging at 6.40am yesterday from a footbridge, not far from their home, over the busy North Circular motorway in Neasden, north London.        
	Inquests will be held in due course but it was being assumed in Gujarati circles that Kishore felt he would not be able to show his face in the community if his wife went to prison.         
	She fled Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday, minutes before she was due to be sentenced, probably to a six-year term. With good behaviour, she might have got out in three years.        
	Detective constable Malcolm Jolly, of City of London police, who led the investigation into Bhindis fraud, admitted he was shocked that the couple had taken their lives.        
	They were both found hanged, he told the media. They were hanging from a footbridge near Staples Corner. Its very sad. She was going to court to be sentenced and she obviously ran away from that, but it was about 120,000 and life isnt worth losing over that.        
	Bhindi was both audacious and foolish in the way she set about milking the accounts of the two customers.         
	The bank employee confessed later she had thought she would be able to get away with it because the women were old and probably did not routinely check the withdrawal column.        
	Between 2005 and 2008, while working at HSBC branches in Notting Hill Gate and Portobello Road in west London, Bhindi helped herself to 60,000 from a pensioners account after hearing that because of ill health, the customer had moved to France to be with her family.        
	At the same time, she was also stealing from a second of her elderly clients. Bhindi went about it methodically, gained the trust of the woman, who is in her 80s, and siphoned off more than 60,000 from her savings account. Bhindi pretended she was more a friend by taking her victim gifts of flowers and chocolates.         
	But Bhindi then made a bad mistake. The first woman died in France in February 2008 but her family did not notify the bank until 10 months later, at which point the account was suspended.        
	In between the death and the notification, Bhindi had continued to make cash withdrawals from the womans savings.         
	When the womans family asked to see her accounts, Bhindi always found a reason not to provide the statements.        
	In April 2009, the family formally complained to the HSBC management. When an audit was conducted, Bhindi had no explanation for why money had been leaving a dead customers account  she had no option but to confess. The second fraud was also discovered.        
	She claimed a man had threatened her with violence unless she gave him regular cash payments.         
	The truth seems to be she used the stolen money to put down a 80,000 deposit on a house.         
	HSBC reimbursed both accounts and, following a City of London police investigation, Bhindi pleaded guilty to two accounts of theft. After she vanished from court with her husband on Tuesday, a bench warrant was issued by Judge Anthony Pitts for her arrest.        
	Richard Parry, defending Bhindi, told the court she clearly seems to have panicked about the sentence that awaited her.        
	HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Natwest and all big British banks employ significant numbers of Indian staff because they are considered reliable and honest and also because the financial institutions want to strengthen relations with the economically successful Indian community in the UK.        
	Bhindis case does raise the likelihood that many other customers are also having money stolen from their accounts.         
	If Bhindi had not taken money from a customers account after her death, it is possible she would have got away with the theft.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Moily rules out OBC slice in bill
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Moily rules out OBC slice in bill
                            
	Bangalore, March 24 (PTI): Union law minister M. Veerappa Moily today ruled out reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the womens quota bill, saying data on OBCs was not available at the national level.        
	There is no provision in the Constitution to provide for OBC reservation, particularly political reservation, even though for employment and education, reservation is provided, Moily told reporters here.        
	He said no census on OBCs had been done since 1931. So, unless these data are available, it is not possible to pick up who is OBC and who is not.        
	Moily said there would be no change in the bill passed by the Rajya Sabha this month, and expressed confidence that it would sail through the Lok Sabha next month. If Parliament passes the bill with amendments providing for OBC quota, courts will strike it down from day one, the minister said.        
	Asked about Mulayam Singh Yadavs claim that only affluent women would benefit , he said a similar argument had been given when the bill on reservation for women in panchayats was passed.

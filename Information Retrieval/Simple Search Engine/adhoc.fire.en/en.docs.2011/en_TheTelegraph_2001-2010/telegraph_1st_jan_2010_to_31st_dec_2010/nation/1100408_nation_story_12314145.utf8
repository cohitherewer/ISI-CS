          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 7: The Orissa High Court has decided to defer its verdict on PILs seeking CBI probe into the multi-crore mining scam till a Supreme Court ruling arrives on a similar plea for the second time in five months.         
	After analogous hearing on four PILs on two consecutive days, the division bench of Chief Justice V. Gopalgowada and Justice B.P. Das on Tuesday adjourned a ruling to April 16, while directing the state to apprise it about the case pending before the Supreme Court.        
	The high court has been adjudicating on the PILs for eight months.         
	Last December, the high court had first asked the state to submit information on the case filed in the apex court in connection with illegal mining in Orissa.         
	Rabi Das, the convener of Jana Sammelani, a civil society group, had filed a petition in the Supreme Court alleging that valuable mineral, including iron ore, coal and manganese worth Rs 7,000 crore, was being smuggled out of Orissa every year.         
	The apex court asked its Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to investigate and submit a report. But CEC failed to do so as the state had not apprised it with details of the total forest area within the mining lease granted by the state and the extent of the area where the mining operations were going on without prior approval of the Union ministry of forest and environment.        
	The state has strongly defended the vigilance probe. The vigilance department has been given additional powers, the state said.

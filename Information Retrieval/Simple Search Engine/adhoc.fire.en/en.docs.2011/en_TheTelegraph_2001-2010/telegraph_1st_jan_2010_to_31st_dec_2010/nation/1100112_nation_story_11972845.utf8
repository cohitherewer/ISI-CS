The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Minority education cell minus hands
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Minority education cell minus hands
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: Indias apex minority education watchdog has been reduced to an agency with a head but no body because of hectic lobbying over appointments after incumbent members either quit or completed their terms.         
	The National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions, started five years back, is functioning at a third of its strength mandated under the law, crippling its ability to decide on key policy matters.         
	Under pressure from sections within the Muslim community, the human resource development ministry has reappointed the outgoing chairman, Justice M.S.A. Siddiqui, for a fresh five-year tenure.         
	But the HRD ministry is yet to fill the posts of two members  essential for representation of other minority communities  despite pleas from Siddiqui over the past month, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	Sources close to the appointment process said lobbying among prospective members was the principal cause for the delay, but admitted that the vacancies were affecting the work of the commission.         
	The commission was set up in 2004 by then HRD minister Arjun Singh to build confidence among minorities that the UPA would undo any discrimination against their educational institutions under the NDA.         
	The National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Act requires the commission to consist of a chairperson and two members  each with a five-year term. The government appointed representatives of the Christian and Sikh communities as the two members alongside Siddiqui.         
	But Balwant Singh Ramoowalia, the Sikh member, quit in early 2009 to contest the Lok Sabha elections.         
	The ministry appointed Copyright Board chief Raghbir Singh as his replacement but he never took office, sources said.         
	Current St Stephens College principal Valson Thampu was first appointed the Christian member but was forced to quit amid controversy.         
	His replacement Vasantha Stanley also quit to join the Rajya Sabha as a member of the DMK. For the last 18 months, Sister Jessy Kurian, a lawyer, has been member of the commission in this post.         
	But on December 5, 2009, her part of the five-year term, too, ended. Earlier on November 27, Siddiquis five-year term also ended. With the end of Kurians term, the panel was left without either any member or its chairperson.         
	Under pressure from Muslim leaders, the HRD ministry reappointed Siddiqui as the head on December 18.

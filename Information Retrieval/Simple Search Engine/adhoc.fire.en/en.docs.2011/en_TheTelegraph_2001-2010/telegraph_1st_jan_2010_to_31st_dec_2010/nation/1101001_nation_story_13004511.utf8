The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Caution the keyword in Lucknow
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Caution the keyword in Lucknow

	Lucknow, Sept. 30: Vijay was staring at an unfamiliar face of Lucknow: Bahut sannata hai (Its so quiet).        
	The taxi driver, waiting outside Lucknow airport, was ruing a bustling citys sudden transformation into a deserted zone under undeclared curfew hours before the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court delivered the verdict on the Ayodhya dispute.        
	Nobody knows what will happen today. Thats why people are not taking chances and staying indoors, said Vijay, who was about to rush back home.        
	By 3.30pm, Lucknow had started resembling Calcutta on a bandh day as shops  both in the upmarket Hazratganj in new Lucknow and the common mans Lalbagh  were closed.        
	No curfew was declared, nor did the administration impose Section 144 but the fear factor  reinforced by an abundance of armed security personnel across the city  sucked life out of Lucknow on judgment day.        
	Even after the verdict was out by 5pm and the live beams from a makeshift media centre adjacent to the court reached drawing rooms across the city with a population of over 25 lakh, the mood didnt change.        
	The usual evening sights in old Lucknow  crowded streets, busy shoppers and vendors selling an assortment of delicacies  were missing.        
	People are very cautious, said Sageer Ahamed, imam of Masjid Khansama on Nadan Mahal Road in old Lucknow, home to the majority of the citys 40 per cent Muslim population.        
	Caution  ehtiyat  was the key word in Lucknow today, confirmed cousins Arpit and Chirag Jaiswal, both in their early twenties, who were playing a game of chess sitting in a caf in Hazratganj till the shop management decided to down shutters at 3.15pm.        
	We are getting calls from home Our parents are worried and they want us to be back before 3.30pm, said Arpit, a supplier of computer parts to government agencies.        
	The outcome will not affect my life. But we all want a verdict and an end to this uncertainty, said the young man in tight jeans and a designer shirt.        
	The same wish was echoed in the older part of the city as property dealer Md Aslam, with his flowing white beard, said a solution to the stalemate was what he had been waiting for.        
	Our business is suffering. The workers have fled Lucknow fearing trouble. The buyers are deferring decisions on buying properties. Now that the court has given a verdict, I think the matter should end here, he said, standing in front of the Jama Masjid in old Lucknow.        
	His trader friends Md Naseem and Md Moid, who have shops on Nadan Mahal Road, joined the chorus. People here want peace and thats the priority for ordinary people like us, said Md Moid, a bangle dealer.        
	We are trying our best to stall any effort to spread rumours. In sensitive areas, we are sending our volunteers or civil defence personnel to explain the verdict so that people get to know the truth, said a city magistrate camping at the Qaiserbagh crossing.         
	People in different parts of the city admitted that the administration had done its job in maintaining peace.        
	Lucknow doesnt have a history of Hindu-Muslim riots Besides, the judgment had something for everybody. So I dont see any chance of any flare-up, said social activist Sandeep Pandey.

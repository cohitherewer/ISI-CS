	Lucknow, Aug. 14: A policeman and a farmer today died in a clash over land compensation to peasants in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Six government vehicles, among them three police cars, were set on fire on the Aligarh-Mathura Road, about 370km from Lucknow. About a dozen people were injured.        
	The stage of the clash was the village of Bajna, about 30km from Aligarh and on the Aligarh-Mathura border.        
	The farmers are against acquisition of land by the state for construction of the Yamuna Expressway road that would connect Aligarh to Noida.         
	The farmers said the compensation should be equal to what peasants in Mathura had received.         
	The agitation for better compensation has been going on for a week. Today, a farmer leader, Rambabu Kateria, was arrested, sparking the clash late in the evening.         
	Around 7.30pm, over 6,000 farmers from 18 villages in Aligarh assembled on the road and began attacking passing vehicles.         
	The police first denied that they had opened fire but after a farmer died late in the night, a police officer said the force fired in the air.         
	Shivraj Singh, the circle inspector of Aligarh, said the Bajna police outpost on the Aligarh-Mathura road was set on fire forcing the jawans to retaliate by exploding tear-gas shells.         
	The farmers, provoked by the arrest of their leader, indulged in rampant attacks on the police. They threw stones and attacked government officials. The police resorted to tear-gas shelling and a lathicharge. But the farmers went on setting government vehicles on fire. At least six government vehicles were set on fire, said inspector-general of police, Aligarh, Vijay Kumar.         
	Uttar Pradesh additional director-general of police Brij Lal said Provincial Armed Constabulary jawan Brijendra Kumar died after the farmers attacked him with a blunt weapon.         
	The other victim was a farmer. The police identified him as Prasant Singh, 35, and confirmed he had bullet wounds.         
	But Lal added: The police fired in the air while some of the farmers had firearms and they fired at the policemen on duty. We dont know if the farmer fell to police bullets.        
	Additional forces from Agra have been rushed to the spot.

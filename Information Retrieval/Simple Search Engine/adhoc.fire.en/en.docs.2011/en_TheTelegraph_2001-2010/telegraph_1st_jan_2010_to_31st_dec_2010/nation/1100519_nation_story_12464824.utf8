The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Talks offer spurned
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Talks offer spurned
                            
	New Delhi/Bastar, May 18 (PTI): P. Chidambaram today made a fresh offer for talks if Maoists suspend violence even for 72 hours, but the guerrillas rejected the overture saying we cannot give up weapons.        
	Maoists should say we will suspend violence for 72 hours. We will get the chief ministers (of the affected states) on board. We will fix a date, time and place for talks and let the Maoists come for talks on anything they wish to talk (about), the home minister said.        
	But Ramanna, a Maoist leader in Bastar, spurned the offer. He claimed the Naxalites had responded to the ministers earlier talks offer. But the government did not believe us. There is a heavy presence of security forces and their atrocities are continuing every day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tax evasion glare on Reddys
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tax evasion glare on Reddys
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 29: The Reddy brothers in the Karnataka cabinet have evaded income tax of Rs 86 crore in their controversy-ridden mining business in 2007-08, according to the departments internal reports.        
	Under the evasion glare is the Obalapuram Mining Company (OMC), which is owned by G. Janardhana Reddy and his elder brother G. Karunakara Reddy and has mining leases in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. But the sum that the exchequer has allegedly been cheated of is limited to the Andhra side of the operations.        
	The income-tax departments documents reveal that the evasion was done using Mangopub Pvt Ltd, a Singapore-based company with which memoranda of understanding (MoUs) were signed, as a cover to conceal the OMCs actual income.        
	The OMC had three MoUs with Mangopub, which was later bought over and renamed Gali Lakshmi Aruna International, or GLA International.         
	Aruna is wife of Jardhan Reddy, the tourism minister who is a director in the firm.        
	The I-T report indicates that OMC officials fudged the books to show the firm made less money from exporting ore mined in Andhra than it actually did.         
	Documents traced to the Dubai and Singapore offices of the OMC show that high-quality ore was sold at $76 to $98 per tonne, almost half of the global market rates of $144-165.         
	The Andhra government had sought a CBI inquiry on OMC, a stand that was later upheld by the high court.        
	The I-T report has been prepared on the basis of documents related to OMC unearthed during raids that the department had carried out a few weeks ago on Janardhana Reddys offices in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Bhubaneswar.         
	Karnatakas BJP government had termed the swoop politically motivated.        
	The mining operations of Reddy brothers and the controversy surrounding their business is also the subject of Blood and Iron, a documentary by Paranjoy Guha Thakurta due for release on January 8.         
	The documentary looks at Bellarys mining mafia and the alleged cartel of politicians, officials and businessmen behind it. The documentary has been produced with financial assistance from the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment.

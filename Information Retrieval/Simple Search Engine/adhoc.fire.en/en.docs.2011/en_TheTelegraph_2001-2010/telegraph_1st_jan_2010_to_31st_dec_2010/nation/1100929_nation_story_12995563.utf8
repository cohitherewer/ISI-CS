          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Ajmal Kasab                          
	Mumbai, Sept. 28: Pakistani gunman Ajmal Kasab may not get to meet his lawyers in private after the prosecution today produced a CD claiming it had footage of the death-row prisoner assaulting a jail staff member earlier this month.        
	The incident occurred on September 1 when Kasab was performing some illegal act and jail staff had to intervene. He (Kasab) assaulted prison officials which is clearly shown in the CD, Maharashtra government counsel Ujjwal Nikam told the court without elaborating on what prompted the intervention by Arthur Road jail authorities.        
	Kasab is a trained commando and with swift movements can pose a great danger to his own life as well as to the guards, Nikam said.        
	The judges, who viewed the CD along with some other documents submitted by the prosecution, will announce their decision tomorrow.         
	Because of security concerns, the bench has already decided that Kasab will not be present in person when the hearing for confirmation of his death sentence begins in the high court on October 18.        
	Defence lawyer Farhana Shah had sought a legal interview with Kasab inside the Arthur Road prison and requested the court grant them complete privacy as the communication between a lawyer and her client was privileged.        
	But public prosecutor Nikam said at this stage, the question of exchange of instructions with the prisoner did not arise. As such there cannot be any privileged communication between the lawyer and the client, he told the court.        
	Nikam also told the court that after the September 1 incident, the authorities have been monitoring Kasabs movements round the clock through closed-circuit television and an officer was present within a distance of four feet all the time.        
	Maharashtra police sources said the CCTV footage showed the 26/11 convict attacking a constable inside his cell in the presence of jail superintendent Rajendra Dhamne.        
	Yesterday, Dhamne had filed a three-page affidavit before the court citing the reasons for opposing the legal interview between Kasab and his lawyers without adequate security.         
	He cited Rule 11 of the Maharashtra Prisons Rules, 1962, which says every interview with a convicted prisoner shall take place in the presence and hearing of a jail staff. The rule also states that during such an interview, a death-row prisoner and his friends or legal advisers shall not be allowed to approach each other.        
	The affidavit also said that it could be dangerous to leave Kasab alone with his lawyers because of his commando training.        
	This means the state government wants jail staff posted 4ft away from Kasab and his lawyers during any meeting between them inside the jail. There are provisions in law that allow this and, given Kasabs behaviour, this looks like a fit case for the courts consideration, said top criminal lawyer Majid Memon.        
	However, differences seem to have cropped up between Farhana and fellow defence lawyer Amin Solkar.        
	While Farhana, who requested the confidential meeting, defended her move in court, Solkar was not as rigid.        
	I am yet to see the CCTV footage. But I have no objection to guards being present during consultations with Kasab, as long as they are not close enough to hear the conversation, Solkar told The Telegraph.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tata moves to protect privacy   Petition in court against disclosures
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tata moves to protect privacy     Petition in court against disclosures
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ratan Tata                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 29: Tata group chairman Ratan Tata today moved the Supreme Court seeking to restrain the broadcast and publication of purported conversations between him and lobbyist Niira Radia who is under investigation in the 2G spectrum allocation case.        
	The petition, filed through corporate lawyer Ryan Karanjawala, said that the tapes could be used for investigative purposes but should not be made public as it infringed on his right to privacy. Senior lawyer Harish N. Salve will argue the case at the next hearing scheduled for tomorrow.         
	This is possibly the first time a high-profile industrialist has moved the Supreme Court seeking to protect his privacy. Actress Monica Bedi had earlier moved the top court on this ground after her purported photographs in a prison shower were published. The court had then restrained all publications from publishing the photographs.        
	But in Tatas case, the tapes are already in public domain. At best, the court can restrain any repeat publication of the transcripts of the tapes.         
	The tapes are part of the 5,851 calls intercepted allegedly by the income tax department and the enforcement directorate as part of investigations into the 2G scandal. Tatas petition may also prompt the government to take action to prevent any more leaks. The government today ordered a probe to establish how the contents of the tapes were leaked.        
	Tata has also demanded that the court direct the government to take action against those who were responsible for the leaks.         
	The purported conversations give the impression that Tata was not too keen on having DMK leader A. Raja as telecom minister, expressing his preference for Dayanidhi Maran.        
	Tata Teleservices was one of the contenders for 2G licence and Radia handled the companys public relations.         
	In his petition, Tata contended that intercepts of the conversations between Radia and him violated his right to privacy.         
	The Supreme Court had earlier held that the right to privacy was part of the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution. Tata said that the recorded conversations should have been used for investigation alone and should not have been published.        
	His petition said that he was not challenging the governments right to investigate the 2G scam but only the unauthorised publication of the transcripts.        
	The Radia tapes feature purported conversations she had with several journalists, politicians and industrialists, apparently trying to lobby for cabinet berths for particular parties. The tapes have been circulating on the Web and have been published by two magazines.         
	Raja has had to step down in the aftermath of the scam. The CBI has already registered a case against unknown companies and individuals. However, the Supreme Court has panned the agency for dragging its feet on the probe.         
	Reacting to Tatas petition, the counsel for the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, an NGO that has called for court monitoring of the CBI probe, said he would contest the Tata plea.        
	We are seriously considering filing an application in the Supreme Court to ensure that there is no injunction against these tapes and these recordings are put out in public domain, lawyer Prashant Bhushan said. These are not private conversations. These are conversations between a lobbyist and her clients... bureaucrats, journalists and ministers. These show glimpses of all kinds of fixing and deal-making and show how the whole ruling establishment functions. There is enormous public interest in putting these tapes out. It is absurd for Mr Tata to say that this is an invasion of his privacy, he said.        
	The CBI today filed a status report in the court on the 2G scam. The agency said it would take some more time to probe the case and would question Raja as and when the need arose.         
	The CBI said it did not intend to investigate piecemeal and needed more time to complete the probe. The case will be heard tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plea against Bengal quota
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Plea against Bengal quota
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 27: A Calcutta-based lawyer today moved the Supreme Court against a notification the Bengal government issued last week formalising a 10 per cent job quota the Left Front regime had announced for socially and educationally backward Muslims.        
	Why only Muslims? lawyer-activist Joydeep Mukherjee said in his petition. The notification is a gimmick, he added, accusing the state of playing vote-bank politics ahead of Assembly elections just a few months away.        
	The Bengal government had issued the notification on September 24, some seven months after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee announced a policy decision to reserve 10 per cent government jobs for disadvantaged sections of backward-class Muslims in the state.        
	The state already has 7 per cent reservation for Other Backward Classes, which will now rise to 17 per cent. For SCs, the reservation is 22 per cent and for STs 6 per cent.         
	Mukherjee, general secretary of the Calcutta-based All India Legal Aid Forum, cited a recent Andhra High Court judgment that struck down Muslim quotas as unconstitutional. That is pending in the Supreme Court, he said, asking the court to set aside the Bengal notification.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Doubts on moon amp; manned missions

	New Delhi, Dec. 25: The back-to-back GSLV failures, todays and last Aprils, have exposed as premature all talk about future manned Indian space missions.        
	They have also led to fears that the countrys second unmanned moon mission, Chandrayaan-2, could miss its 2013 deadline.        
	A key prerequisite for a manned space mission is to ensure that the launch vehicle failure rate is less than one failure in 99 launches, senior Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) scientists have said. However, todays crash means the GSLVs current score is three failures out of seven launches.        
	Besides, an indigenous cryogenic engine would be crucial to Indias ambitions for manned space missions, but the countrys first such engine developed a snag and led to the April crash of the GSLV-D3.        
	All the other six GSLV launches  including todays  came with Russian-made cryogenic engines. So, Isros aspirations for a manned mission through indigenous technology within the next decade appears a bit too ambitious.        
	Some space scientists believe that todays failure would also have some impact on the Chandrayaan-2 timetable, but Isro sources claimed that once the causes of the disaster were known, the agency could work overtime to launch the unmanned moon mission on time.        
	Isro chairman K. Radhakrishnan said the latest mishap would not affect the space agencys future plans. But considering it already has a cramped launch schedule nine launches are tentatively slated for next year  it remains to be seen how soon Isro can get back on track.        
	Radhakrishnan was backed by former Isro chief K. Kasturirangan and former Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre director B.N. Suresh.        
	Suresh, now director of the Indian Institute of Space Technology, said the crash would not hamper future Isro missions.        
	It (the GSLV) is a very rugged engine. This (accident) seems to have been caused by an unforeseen problem. We will be able to identify and plug it quickly, he said from Thiruvananthapuram.        
	I dont think we need to worry, Kasturirangan said, explaining that his personal view was that the problem could be tracked and remedied.        
	The combined cost of the rocket and satellite today was Rs 325 crore but like other launches undertaken from India, the current mission too was not insured, Isro spokesperson S. Satish said.         
	Transponder bill        
	Isro sources, however, admitted that something had to be done to offset the loss of the GSAT-5P, Indias heaviest satellite that was to be put into orbit today.        
	The immediate fallout of the crash, therefore, could be that India may have to lease several satellite transponders from international service providers, each at about Rs 4.5 crore a year.        
	The communication satellite, with a life span of over 13 years, had 36 transponders devices that automatically receive and transmit communication and broadcast signals. The satellite was meant to replace the ageing INSAT-2E which, sent up in April 1999, has completed its life span of 10 years.        
	Leasing one transponder in the international market costs about $1 million per year, said an Isro scientist who didnt want to be named.         
	India is already struggling with a transponder shortage. In July this year, the Insat-4B, launched in December 2005, lost half its 24 transponders following a failure of one of its solar arrays.        
	India is already leasing 60 transponders from international vendors as the nine Indian satellites in orbit have only 160 transponders.

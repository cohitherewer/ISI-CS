The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | For Rs 325, eat six times with Sonia and Singh
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      For Rs 325, eat six times with Sonia and Singh
          SANJAY K. JHA                          EASY TO DINE?                                   
	New Delhi, Dec 17: The Congress is selling passes to its plenary, at Rs 325 apiece.        
	A counter was opened at the partys 24 Akbar Road headquarters yesterday to sell the passes, which will permit entry to the two-day open session starting Sunday.         
	Apart from getting to share space with Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and other top Congress leaders running the country, the pass holder will get a free lunch too. Make that lunch, breakfast and dinner  and the Congress spread is usually lavish.        
	The Congress leadership is split down the middle on the sale of invites, with one section embarrassed by the cheap gimmickry and the group that has taken the decision and implemented it without wider consultation calling it a valid plan to keep out non-serious people and earn some money for the party.        
	There was a major quarrel yesterday, a party source revealed, adding that many senior leaders are aghast and have lodged a strong protest.        
	Some hangers-on who manage to find a way into every party event said the sale had made things easy for them and added they would have bought the passes in bulk even if they were priced at a few thousand rupees.        
	When concerns were raised in the party that rank outsiders would enter the venue instead of genuine Congress workers, it was decided that the passes would be sold only to those who can produce a recommendation from central or state office-bearers, MPs or ministers.         
	But this safeguard is not enough as office-bearers are recommending any number of passes to their acquaintances who can distribute them as they like, sources said.        
	I know someone who has bought five passes for bringing persons who are not Congressmen, an AICC member said.        
	The thousands the Congress will earn from the sale are a drop compared to the crores being spent to hold the plenary, the sources said.         
	In the past, too, outsiders who are neither AICC members nor PCC delegates used to get into party meetings by managing passes from senior leaders. The leaders who would use the passes to oblige their supporters might now find their importance mercilessly whittled down.         
	Every AICC member pays an annual subscription of Rs 4,600 and a session fee of Rs 725 that goes towards passes to the plenary that is their right to attend. The special invitees will get in paying Rs 400 less.

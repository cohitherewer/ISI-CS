          GC SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, Feb. 22: The debate over the death of senior CPM leader W.R. Varadarajan continued today with a section of the party blaming the top brass for taking a moral stand on an extramarital affair without factoring in the family.         
	Varadarajan, 64, was stripped of all his posts in the party earlier this month following a complaint filed by wife Saraswathi that alleged he was having an extramarital affair.         
	The CPM leader went missing on February 11, leaving behind two notes which hinted at a fatalistic streak. He was found dead in a lake near Chennai yesterday.         
	CPM sources suggested that the All India Democratic Womens Association, the womens wing of the party, got so involved with the matter that it forced the other woman to also file a complaint against Varadarajan before the state committee.         
	This complaint by the woman of whom very little is known said the senior leader had failed to keep his promise of marrying her.        
	CPM functionaries in Tamil Nadu said senior comrades should have played a facilitating role in sorting out the sensitive issue instead of viewing it simply as a breach of party discipline.        
	Since his wife is also a party member, leaders of Tamil Nadu should have helped sort out the matter instead of fixing Varadarajan. AIDWAs state secretary Vasuki Umanath also did not help as she saw it more as an us (women) versus them (men) battle, forgetting that a family was involved, a CPM leader said.        
	Vasuki did not respond to phone calls. She, however, had told the Tamil biweekly Kumudham Reporter that she was not responsible for exploiting Saraswathis complaint against Varadarajan.         
	The proper procedure was followed in conducting an inquiry and it was finally the decision of the central committee. It is not possible to settle scores in our party at the instigation of one or two members, the magazine quoted her as saying.        
	A senior MLA said everyone, including Varadarajan, had over-reacted to the issue.        
	His wife, party leaders and Varadarajan  all of them overreacted to what is normal in the lives of political leaders in Tamil Nadu. If all of them had exhibited some restraint, we would not have lost a good leader and the party need not have suffered this ignominy, the MLA said.        
	The party rank and file are asking if the CPM bosses went too far in punishing a seasoned veteran for his personal failings. Murmurs in CPM circles hinted at the role played by a prominent woman leader in ousting Varadarajan.         
	This member was carried away by her feminist views and she overlooked the sacrifices made by persons like Varadarajan in building up the party in a state like Tamil Nadu where it is not a force to reckon with, said a party member.        
	Varadarajans family members, though, are not prepared to blame the party.        
	 Varadarajans son V. Prashanth made it clear that neither his mother nor he or his brother harboured any ill-feeling towards the CPM leadership for the disciplinary action taken against his father.         
	Even now we have left the funeral arrangements to the party since for my father, the party was everything as illustrated by his last letter where he left everything to the party, said Prashanth, an assistant professor in microbiology.        
	True we cannot fulfil his wish about donating his body to medical research as the internal organs have started to spill out and there is no way it can be embalmed to be kept in an anatomy lab. Otherwise we plan to carry out all of his wishes about donating his bank balance to the party and books and laptop to the party organ, he said.        
	Asked how their discord went to the party forum, Prashanth said his mother, being an adult and a party member, knew what she was doing. I do not want to say anything more, he stated.

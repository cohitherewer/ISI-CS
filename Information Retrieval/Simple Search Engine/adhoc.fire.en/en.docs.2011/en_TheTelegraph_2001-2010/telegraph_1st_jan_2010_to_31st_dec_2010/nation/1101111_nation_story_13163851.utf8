The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM lines up minority meet in poll hurry
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CPM lines up minority meet in poll hurry
          J.P. YADAV                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: The CPM is getting set to sponsor a minority convention in the capital to win back Muslims ahead of next years elections in Left-ruled Bengal and Kerala.        
	Scheduled for December 4, the convention will, however, not be held under the party banner. Cultural organisations known for their party leanings will hold it.        
	This is because the CPM does not want to be seen as obviously playing to the Muslim gallery ahead of the polls. CPM will do everything from behind, a party leader said.        
	Minority affairs ministers of Bengal, Kerala and Tripura will, however, be invited to the convention to talk about how they had worked for the communitys uplift and welfare. This is possibly a follow-up to the extended central committees decision to defend the Left Front in Bengal.        
	The Muslim population in Bengal is as high as 26 per cent. The loss of minority votes is believed to be behind the Lefts recent string of electoral setbacks in the state.        
	This May, CPM politburo member Brinda Karat had taken the lead to organise a tribal convention in the capital. It was aimed at projecting a pro-tribal face of the CPM following the Maoists gaining sway in the forest regions of Bengal.        
	So why is the minority convention being held in Delhi and not Bengal? Party leaders said the idea was to target the Congress-led UPA government. The attack would be based on how the Centre had failed to implement the recommendations of the Sachar Committee and the Ranganath Mishra Commission.        
	In contrast, the CPM would showcase the achievements of its state governments. The biggest of them would be the decision to grant backward Muslims in Bengal a 10 per cent job quota after the Ranganath Mishra commission recommended 15 per cent.        
	The identification of OBC Muslim communities is complete and certificates would be issued soon, CPM leader Hannan Mollah said.        
	Since the Sachar Committee revealed that the socio-economic condition of Muslims in Bengal is one of the worst in the country, the CPM has tried to defend itself. This convention will also attempt to do so.        
	The CPM has prepared documents claiming the share of cultivable land owned by Muslims in Bengal is 25.6 per cent, the highest after Jammu and Kashmir. Sachar committee ignored the fact that West Bengal takes the financial responsibility of paying salaries to all madarsa teachers, the document says.        
	The CPMs decision not to boycott US President Barack Obamas Parliament speech is also being seen as a step to woo minorities. Apart from being black, he is also Barack Hussein Obama, a CPM leader said.        
	The party had also criticised the Ayodhya title suit verdict.

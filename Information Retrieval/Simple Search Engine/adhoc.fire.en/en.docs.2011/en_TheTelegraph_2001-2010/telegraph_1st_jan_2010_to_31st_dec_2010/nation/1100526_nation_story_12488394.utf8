The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak top court relief for Saeed
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pak top court relief for Saeed
                              Hafiz Saeed                            
	Islamabad, May 25 (PTI): Pakistans Supreme Court today dismissed appeals against Lashkar-e-Toiba founder Hafiz Saeeds release from house arrest, dealing a blow to Indias efforts to nail the alleged 26/11 mastermind.        
	The appeals, against last years Lahore High Court order to free Saeed, had been filed by the federal and Punjab governments last year but could not be taken up then for technical reasons. The appeals are dismissed, said Justice Nasir-ul-Mulk, the head of the three-judge bench that heard the matter today. The court also upheld the release of two of Saeeds close aides, Col (retired) Nazir Ahmed and Maulana Amir Hamza.        
	India, which blames Lashkar for 26/11, expressed disappointment. I am sure everybody in this country will share the sense of disappointment, especially when we regard Hafiz Saeed as one of the masterminds of the attack and he has openly urged jihad against India, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao said in New Delhi.        
	Saeeds lawyer A.K. Dogar said the authorities had failed to produce any evidence that linked Saeed, 60, who heads Lashkar front Jamaat ud-Dawa, with the attack. The prosecution failed to prove its case, Dogar said.        
	He recalled that the high court had given the same reason  that there was no evidence against Saeed. The appeals were pending for long. When they came up for hearing today, the bench said the prosecution should take them back or present their arguments. They made their arguments but could not convince the judges, Dogar said.        
	The apex court judges asked additional attorney-general K.K. Agha, who appeared on behalf of the federal government, if he had fresh proof and whether Saeed had violated the law of the land or indulged in any objectionable activity after his release last year. Agha told the court that Saeed was living a peaceful life.        
	The bench then observed that the liberty of a citizen was sacred and the law did not allow anyones detention without good reason.         
	Justice Jawad S. Khwaja, another judge on the bench, said a persons right to freedom could not be taken away on mere assumption. But the bench said the government could file a fresh appeal if it had any new evidence.        
	In Delhi, foreign secretary Rao insisted enough evidence had been given on Saeed, echoing home minister P. Chidambarams earlier assertions that sufficient proof had been provided in the 26/11 dossiers given to Islamabad.        
	Saeed was put under house arrest in December 2008, a month after the Mumbai strike. He had challenged his detention in the high court, which ordered his release on June 2 last year for want of evidence. The appeals against his release were filed following pressure from India and the international community.

  - New forecast model for games venues          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: The India Meteorological Department plans to issue the countrys first three-hourly six-hour forecasts for a city during the Commonwealth Games, but with a weather observation network weaker than originally planned.        
	Such nowcasts to predict the weather a few hours ahead  which have long been generated routinely for the aviation sector and space launches will be issued for specific Games venues between October 3 and 14, IMD director Ajit Tyagi said.        
	The nowcasts are expected to contain forecasts of temperature, humidity, rain or thunderstorms as well as wind conditions  factors that could affect games. Wind speed, for example, must be below 30kmph for high-platform diving, strong wind changes may provide an unfair advantage to some athletes, while humidity may influence velodrome cycling.        
	But the IMDs original plan to set up a dense network of automatic weather stations in an area of 100km within and around Delhi as well as several Doppler weather radars in northern India to generate data for nowcasts remains unachieved.        
	Weather scientists had planned to establish some 50 automatic weather stations, but only 35 have been installed so far. And a single Doppler weather radar has been established in Delhi to monitor the development of clouds in the region.        
	The accuracy of nowcasts  which are generated by crunching weather data from observations  depends, according to meteorologists, on the amount and reliability of available weather data. The better the observations, the higher the accuracy.         
	But Tyagi said the nowcasting models had been configured with the available systems. We had to stabilise our models at some stage with available observational systems. We expect our nowcasts will have 80 to 90 per cent accuracy, Tyagi said.        
	The anticipated late withdrawal of the monsoon this year has given rise to concerns about the possibility of rain hitting the Games. The IMD expects the monsoon to begin withdrawing from northwest India only around September 28 this year.        
	Weather data from the past several decades show that October typically has only two rainy days. But we cant rule out the possibility of rain. There may be clouding (during the Games)  the probability of rainfall is 15 to 20 per cent, Tyagi said.        
	Weather scientists in India have cautioned earlier that the task of nowcasting in Delhi would be particularly challenging for several reasons. Venue-specific nowcasts are being tried for a location near the tropics for the first time. October is a transition month when the monsoon has withdrawn and a period between two seasons  summer or monsoon and winter.        
	A document outlining the proposals for the Commonwealth Games, developed by IMD scientists more than three years ago, had also cautioned that the IMD had a shortage of skilled human resources to handle advanced technology.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal trio tipped for Maoist hot list
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bengal trio tipped for Maoist hot list
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, June 22: The government has decided to expand the list of 34 districts most affected by Maoist violence by including some in Bengal and Jharkhand amid fears that money pumped into lawless areas were passing into rebel hands.        
	Sources in Delhi said the Centre was thinking of adding Bankura and Purulia in Bengal to the list, apart from West Midnapore.        
	Till now, no district in Bengal is officially on the most-affected list.        
	The government is also planning to add Khunti, Ranchi rural and Giridih in Jharkhand to the list, the sources said.        
	Districts labelled most affected get special attention in implementation of development schemes. Stress is also laid on meeting security and infrastructure deficits.        
	West Midnapore MP Prabodh Panda told The Telegraph the district was added to the list during a recent meeting of parliamentarians. However, the district, which includes Maoist hotbed Lalgarh, is not yet officially part of the list.        
	This means if Bankura and Purulia are included, the number of most-affected districts will go up to 37 in nine states, Bengal being the ninth. It will be 40 districts if the three from Jharkhand are added to the existing 11 already on the list.        
	Sources said the Centre was also planning to add more districts to the list of those eligible for the security-related expenditure (SRE) scheme. Bengal and the other eight states want more districts to be added to the 83 now part of the SRE scheme.        
	Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore are already on the list of 83 SRE districts. To be labelled most affected, districts require to be part of the SRE list.        
	However, doubts persist within the home ministry about the efficacy of investing more money in districts where the state has virtually no control over large areas. Instead of pumping in resources, areas where Maoists are likely to spread should be brought under special development schemes, said a home ministry source.        
	In other words, pre-emptive development in areas that could be affected by Maoist violence.         
	Sources said some decisions were taken on Jharkhand when Union home minister P. Chidambaram visited Ranchi earlier this month and that Deoghar and Dumka were among the districts proposed to be added to the SRE list.        
	The Centre, the sources added, may also invest about Rs 100 crore in a training institute for the Jharkhand Jaguars, the special anti-Maoist task force of the state police.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amar sends a reminder on secrets
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Amar sends a reminder on secrets
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Amar Singh                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 15: On a sabbatical from politics, Amar Singh has left the door ajar for the Samajwadi Party with the veiled threat that he carried with him secrets that would remain with him.        
	I have resigned from some posts of the party on health grounds. I am still a member of the Samajwadi Party. I will never utter a word against (Samajwadi chief) Mulayam Singh (Yadav) though his immediate family has hurt and insulted me. Recently I told somebody that Netaji (Mulayam Singh) and I go back a long way and there are things we have participated together in good faith  but given our relationship neither he nor I will say anything on this subject. These secrets will be buried with me, Singh told The Telegraph in an exclusive interview at Janak, friend Amitabh Bachchans office in Juhu.        
	Singh admitted he was on a doctor-advised break, but insisted it was only a break, a sabbatical from politics till June.         
	Over the next five months, he said, he would try and re-invent himself a la the Big B who has reinvented himself time and again to reign over Bollywood.        
	Singh was ambiguous on his political future though he has written in his blog that contrary to speculation, the Congress is not his destination just yet.        
	Some people say I am joining the CongressYes, god forbid, if the situations arise in the future where I may have to find political alternatives, I will have no dearth of options. But will prefer to bid an adieu to politics rather than joining the Congress, he has written.        
	Will those political options include Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress, as some close to him suggest?        
	I am not averse to Mamata, I have campaigned for her in Bengal once before. She is like a sister to me and I have known her since she was a young girl. But she has a mercurial temper and in the last elections, I was a bit  kya bolte hain, dil ko dhakka laga  when she refused to give ticket to a candidate I wanted. Anyway, lets not talk about all this now, my priorities have changed. I want to think about my health, he said.        
	Amar had backed Mamata during the Singur land agitation, but they parted ways after the Trinamul chief refused to give up one seat out of the 42 in Bengal to the Samajwadi in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections.        
	Sitting at Janak and sipping a glass of water, Singh was keen to point out that for the time being his film commitments would keep him busy.        
	I am doing a movie in Malayalam with Dimple Kapadia playing my wife. You will hear an announcement soon. I also plan to dub for Dev Anands film Chargesheet where I play the home minister. I will go on a holiday with friends and family after my work in Mumbai is over in a couple of days, he said.        
	Singhs aides say he will fly back to Dubai and from there go on a vacation.        
	He plans to avoid attending the Samajwadi Party annual fest  the Saifai Mahotsava in Mulayams village later this month. Both Akhilesh (Mulayams son) and Mulayam had called and invited him to attend the fest. He was open to the idea and saw it as an opportunity to settle differences. But later when it became clear that his rivals planned to corner him and get Mulayam to do some plain-speaking with him, Amar Singhji decided to stay away. He is very upset, said a close aide.        
	Amar too expressed disappointment with his leader, though in a restrained manner.        
	He called me in Dubai after my resignation and enquired after my health  he did not raise the issue of my resignation from the party. I know, however, that he was personally present at meetings where his close aides spoke against me in the severest language, said Amar.        
	He would rather be with friends in Mumbai  the Bachchans organised a small private dinner for Singhs inner circle at their Pratiksha home last night.         
	Among those invited were Mumbai-based Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi, industrialist Anil Ambani and actor Sanjay Dutt.        
	Amar took pains to defend Bachchans apparently growing proximity to Narendra Modi, under whose chief ministership thousands had died in the Gujarat riots of 2002. The junior Ambani has also hailed Modi as a leader fit to be Prime Minister.        
	Amitabh Bachchan belongs to the whole country, and Gujarat is a part of this country. He has not expressed his desire to endorse the RSS, but Gujarat. He has praised Modis development work, not his role in the Gujarat riots. As for Anil (Ambani), he is an industrialist and he realised he was not cut out for politics when he resigned as member of Parliament within 40 days of election. He understood the menace that politics was  he came, he saw and he ran. In any case what does ideology have to do with friendship? he said.        
	Insiders said it was this influential coterie comprising the Bachchans, Anil Ambani and moneybag Abu Azmi  the Mumbai MLA who gives the Samajwadi Party a presence outside Uttar Pradesh  that Mulayam does not wish to lose by snapping ties with Amar.         
	Amar knows this well. On Thursday morning he had the Big B personally picking him up from the airport when he arrived from Dubai.

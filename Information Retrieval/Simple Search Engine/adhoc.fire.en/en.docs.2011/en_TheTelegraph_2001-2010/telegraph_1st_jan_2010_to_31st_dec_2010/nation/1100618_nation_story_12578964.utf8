The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rajiv official says Rao let Anderson go
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rajiv official says Rao let Anderson go
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 17: Former foreign secretary M.K. Rasgotra has said Warren Anderson was given safe passage on the advice of then home minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, adding that Rajiv Gandhi had concurred with the decision though he was informed only after the event.        
	The claim has spurred the BJP to reaffirm its charge that Rajiv, then Prime Minister, was involved in the Union Carbide chiefs release but the Congress has refused to respond.         
	Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said: The GoM (group of ministers) is looking into the whole issue and it will respond after making a proper study of facts.        
	Rasgotra, who was foreign secretary at a time Rajiv held the external affairs portfolio, said both Narasimha Rao and then cabinet secretary C.R. Krishnaswamy Rao were aware of the development.        
	So, although he added that Rajiv was not in Delhi that day and had not been consulted, his remarks appear to contradict the Congress stand that the Rajiv government had no role in Andersons release.        
	Rasgotra told CNN-IBN that Gordon Streeb, then deputy chief of the US mission here, had said Anderson wanted to come to Bhopal but only if granted safe passage. Rasgotra said he had told the home ministry and the cabinet secretary about this and waited for instructions.        
	Some Congress leaders said the party had been pushed to a corner because the issue had not been tackled boldly at the outset.        
	We should have said at the beginning that he was released because he was not a proclaimed offender at that time and that arresting him would have created unnecessary problems, a senior leader told The Telegraph, speaking off the record because of the gag order issued by the party.

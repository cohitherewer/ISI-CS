                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Science
										      G.S. Mudur      The Telegraph picks a set of scientists who were toasted in Indian academia in the decade gone by or should be watched in the decade ahead      
	Venkatraman Ramakrishnan
  MRC Laboratory for Molecular Biology, UK        
	Ramakrishnan made a Nobel Prize in the sciences gain an India tag after a gap of 26 years. He shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2009 for helping decipher the structure of a complex biological machine that manufactures proteins inside living cells        
	Thanu Padmanabhan
  Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune        
	Padmanabhan has over the past eight years pencilled a revised mathematical way to describe Einsteins theory of gravity, an effort that may call for a significant change in our ideas of gravity        
	Sankar Chatterjee
  Texas Tech University, US        
	Chatterjees research suggests it wasnt the asteroid that crashed in Mexico that wiped out dinosaurs. He argues a rock from space that crashed near present-day Mumbai contributed to the mass extinction event 65 million years ago        
	Mrigank Sur
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US        
	Neuroscientist Sur has demonstrated that the brains circuitry is a lot more plastic and adaptable than had been previously assumed. His research on the brain promises to hoist some incurable brain disorders such as autism into the realm of therapy        
	Raghavendra Gadagkar
  Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore        
	Gadagkar has been observing wasps to probe some of biologys biggest puzzles and gain insights into how biology shapes insect societies. He helped scientists understand social co-operation among worker wasps and studied queens in wasp colonies        
	Shrinivas Kulkarni
  California Institute of Technology, US        
	Astronomer Kulkarni studies some exotic objects  dead, failed and exploding stars. He is now chairman of the science team of the Space Interferometry Mission, intended to be the most powerful space-based telescope yet for hunting Earth-like planets        
	Shubha Tole
  TIFR, Mumbai        
	Neurobiologist Tole is trying to unravel the full genetic machinery that gives rise to the cerebral cortex, the most complex structure of the brain that is involved in all the higher functions such as language, complex thought and memory        
	Pulickel M. Ajayan
  Rice University, US        
	Ajayan, who grew up in Kerala, is a nanoscale engineer tinkering with tiny materials that have potential applications in medicine and energy. Two years ago, he had helped develop an energy storage device as thin as paper. It was dubbed a paper battery        
	Anindita Bhadra
  IISER, Calcutta        
	Bhadra is an example of seamless research continuity between the two decades. A student of Gadagkar, Bhadra has turned her attention to stray dogs. Her first projects are likely to focus on parental care and territoriality among street dogs

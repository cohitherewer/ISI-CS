          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 25: Armed Maoists surrounded a SAIL-owned mine in Orissas Sundargarh district today and forced employees to stop work before heading towards a nearby town to enforce a two-day economic blockade to protest the arrest of a cadre.        
	Police said the rebels harmed no one but the morning raid was enough to put both state and private buses off roads in Koida town, about 400km from Bhubaneswar.        
	 Eyewitnesses said about 100 Maoists surrounded the Kalta mine owned by the state-run steel maker and ordered the employees not to work during the blockade that began today in protest against the arrest of Subhashree Panda.        
	The rebels also asked the workers not to support the CPI or the CPM and shouted slogans as they moved towards Koida town where they forced all shops that had opened to down shutters.        
	The rebels also snatched mobile phones of some residents which they later returned before disappearing into nearby jungles on the Orissa-Jharkhand border. The Maoists left the spot after issuing the threat and no one was harmed in the incident, Koida police station in-charge P.K. Sahoo said.        
	The rebel raid came on a day an abducted CMP zilla parishad member returned unharmed. Anand Masiharo, who had been abducted on Friday by suspected Maoists from a dhaba in the district, was earlier thought to have been killed.        
	The Maoists have also released two brothers, dhaba-owners Harinath Mundari and Narendra Mundari, who were abducted along with Masiharo from Jamdiha village.        
	Buses stopped plying in Maoist-infested parts of the state after todays raid, crippling normal life.        
	The Orissa State Road Transport Corporation as well as private operators decided against taking chances and kept buses off the Berhampur-Rayagada highway, which runs through a Maoist zone. No buses will also ply in Maoist-hit Malkangiri district, which borders Sundargarh.        
	To make sure that no vehicles can ply on the Berhampur-Rayagada route, the rebels have felled trees to block the route. They have also chopped trees to cut off roads connecting Ganjam, Gajapati and Rayagada districts.        
	No violence has been reported so far from any part of the state. Schools, colleges, private and government offices and shops are functioning as usual, said inspector-general of police (operations) Sanjeev Marik.        
	 A judicial court today again rejected the bail application of Subhashree alias Saswati Panda, the wife of a wanted Maoist leader, Sabyasachi Panda, and sent her to judicial custody.        
	The court had earlier turned down Subhashrees bail pleas on January 16 and 19.

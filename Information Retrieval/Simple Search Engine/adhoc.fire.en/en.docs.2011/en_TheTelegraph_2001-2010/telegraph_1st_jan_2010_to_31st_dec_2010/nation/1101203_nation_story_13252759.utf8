          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: The CBI has filed forgery cases against 30 Indian students who claimed to be Nepalis and sought admission in engineering colleges as foreign nationals.         
	Two institutes, the Malaviya National Institute of Technology (NIT), Jaipur, and the Punjab Engineering College in Chandigarh reported the forgeries.        
	The enrolments of at least 19 students were terminated by the Malaviya NIT after their citizenship documents were found to be fake. Eleven students had tried to get admission to the Punjab college but the institute did not admit them.        
	Prima facie, it (the investigation) shows that these students are Indians. They might have failed to clear the All India Engineering Entrance Examination for admission. They used their SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) scores to get admission under the DASA (Direct Admission of Students Abroad) scheme, a source said.         
	It is not yet known from which states the students hailed. Had they studied under the DASA scheme, they would have paid $2,000 every year as tuition fee. Non-Saarc country students have to pay $4,000 annually.         
	The DASA scheme was launched in 2001-02 by the HRD ministry to attract foreign students to Indian institutions. Students can get admission to BTech courses in 21 institutions  among them the NITs, the Indian Institutes of Information Technology and the Punjab Engineering College.         
	About 2,500 seats are available for foreign students who get admission under the DASA scheme.         
	This year, 724 students took admission, while last year the enrolment figure was 750.         
	Education Consultants India Limited was in charge of implementing the scheme till last year. NIT Surat is the co-ordinating agency this year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bad hair days after caste bar
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bad hair days after caste bar
  - A trim too few here,   too many there        G.C. SHEKHAR                                          
	Chennai, June 15: Price of caste arrogance: an unkempt look with crumpled clothes and overgrown beards and hair.        
	All because the majority Thevars of Irunjirai, located 80km from Madurai, had warned the villages lone dhobi not to press Dalits clothes.        
	The dhobi has shut shop and fled the village of 130 families and so has the barber, fearing the same diktat from the Thevars.        
	Now we have no choice but to travel by bus to the nearest town to get a haircut or shave. Almost no one here bothers to get his clothes ironed any more, rued K. Paandi, a Thevar.         
	A. Periasamy, the dhobi, said: The Thevars had asked me not to iron Dalits clothes or else they would boycott my shop.        
	When he still went ahead and ironed a Dalit farmers shirt, the matter was dragged to the village panchayat which issued Periasamy a warning last January to respect the majority sentiment.        
	That scared barber Maarimuthu too into turning away his Dalit customers.         
	Since the Thevars outnumber all other communities put together in the village, I could not afford to antagonise them, Maarimuthu said.        
	But when the Dalits complained to the Virdhunagar district administration, revenue officials told the barber and dhobi if they refused to serve the Dalits, they would be booked under the SC/ST act for discrimination.         
	So the duo decided to move to the nearby town of Thiruchuzhi after informing the officials in writing that neither wanted to do business at Irunjirai.        
	When the matter came to the notice of Virdhunagar collector Siji Thomas, he got the revenue authorities to appoint a barber and a dhobi as government-nominated representatives at Irunjirai.        
	The barber was given the necessary tools and the dhobi an ironing box (coal-fired) and a cart for pressing clothes. Both were given sheds by the government to carry out their trade in the village.        
	But the Thevars would have none of it and boycotted the two outsiders, who too moved out in no time.        
	But the Thevars appear not to have learnt any lesson. Village headman V. Murugesan, a Thevar, blamed the Dalits for blowing the issue up and complaining to the district administration.        
	The panchayat was ready to resolve the issue amicably but once the district authorities started arm-twisting our barber and dhobi, they moved out. And our villagers refused to support outsiders plying their trades here.        
	The Dalits are not complaining. For the past six months we had to take a bus to get a shave or haircut. Now even the Thevars have to do the same thing. Its all their own doing, said Gurusamy, a farm worker.

          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, May 3: The court in India has given its verdict on Ajmal Kasab but the Pakistani court trying the 26/11 terror accused is far from done.        
	It is difficult to say when the trial will finish as the court is burdened with other cases, a defence lawyer for the suspects, Shahbaz Rajput, told The Telegraph.        
	The Pakistani court is holding a closed-door trial of seven suspects accused by India of involvement in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.        
	The court has so far held over a dozen hearings since May last year, when the five suspects were first produced before it. Two more suspects were arrested in July 2009, a development Islamabad described as a big success for its intelligence agencies. The hearings will resume on May 8.         
	The court had formally indicted the seven suspects in November last year but Rajput claimed that the list of charges, presented thrice in the court, was incomplete.        
	The prosecution claimed that the list of charges, or the chargesheet, is complete to the extent of the five accused, but we do not think this way, he said.        
	The accused, who were taken into custody by the Federal Investigation Agency last year, include Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, a Lashkar-e-Toiba operative who allegedly planned the attacks, Hammad Amin Sadiq, Mazhar Iqbal alias Abu Qama, Abdul Wajid alias Zarar Shah and Shahid Jamil.        
	The two persons arrested later are Jamil Ahmad and Muhammad Younis Anjum. They were arrested after the July 2009 meeting between the Indian and Pakistani Prime Ministers in Sharm-el-Sheikh.        
	According to Pakistani investigators, Mazhar Iqbal was a handler while Zarar Shah alias Abdul Wajid was a facilitator and the terrorists computer expert. Sadiq procured funds and arranged hideouts for the attackers and Shahid Jamil trained the crew of the two sea vessels on which the gunmen sailed from Karachi.        
	Officials said the authorities had closed 16 bank accounts of the Jamat-ud Dawa, considered a subsidiary of Lashkar, blocked six of its websites, detained 71 activists and placed the names of 64 on the exit control list.         
	India, which blames the attacks on the Lashkar, has given Pakistan 10 dossiers since November 2008 containing information about the attack and a demand to hand over Lashkar founder Hafiz Saeed.        
	Islamabad too recently handed six dossiers to India, two of them containing a request for the extradition of Kasab, convicted today, and Fahim Ansari, one of the two Indians who were acquitted.        
	 Rajput said: I think it will be useless even if India agrees to hand over Kasab to Pakistan as the law in both countries is very clear that if a person has already been convicted by a competent court, he cannot be tried by another court of law.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 18: When in Delhi, praise the Sultanate. When in Indore, come out against it all guns blazing.        
	Narendra Modi today slammed the Centre over internal security  referring derisively to the Congress-led UPA as the Delhi Sultanate  weeks after praising the Prime Minister and the home minister for being responsive at a conference of chief ministers in Delhi earlier this month on the same issue.        
	The Gujarat chief minister, speaking at the BJP national council meeting in Indore, appeared to have found ammunition for todays offensive in a central circular that he said sought to limit shooting sessions for cops.        
	I was shocked with a recent home ministry circular. It said because of budget constraints, the government cannot purchase weapons. So security men who could earlier practise shooting three times in a yearcan now do it only once in three years. So my brothers and sisters, tell me what will they do when they have to face the bullets fired by terrorists, Maoists, Naxalites or whatever you call these armed insurgents? I told the Delhi Sultanate, I have enough money to pay for the weapons but I want proper training for these men. But no, they will not listen, Modi told the audience.        
	The Mumbai attackalso figured in his speech. After 26/11, I asked the Sultanate to provide me equipment and boats to beef up coastal security. I asked for 54 boats and was sanctioned 30. I finally got eight, and of these, four are not working, Modi said.

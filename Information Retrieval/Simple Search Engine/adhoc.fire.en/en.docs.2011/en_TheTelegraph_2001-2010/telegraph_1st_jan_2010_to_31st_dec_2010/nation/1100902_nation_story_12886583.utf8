	New Delhi, Sept. 1: The official website of the Common Admission Test (CAT) for admission to the IIMs has come under virus atttack, reminding thousands of aspirants about last years online test ordeal blamed on a similar computer malaise.        
	The site, www.catiim.in, is currently showing warning messages when accessed through certain browsers.         
	Prometric, the American firm conducting the computer-based test, claimed the problem had been fixed but it would take time for the warnings to disappear.

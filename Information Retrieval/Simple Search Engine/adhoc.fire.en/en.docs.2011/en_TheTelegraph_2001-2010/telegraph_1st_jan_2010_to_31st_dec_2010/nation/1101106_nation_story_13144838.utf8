The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Indian in dock for wife murder in UK
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Indian in dock for wife murder in UK
          AMIT ROY                          Harpreet and Geeta Aulakh                                  
	London, Nov. 5: An Indian husband is on trial at the Old Bailey in London, accused of having his wife hacked to death because she had asked for a divorce.        
	It is a year since Geeta Aulakh, 28, a receptionist with Sunrise Radio, was found dying on a pavement in Greenford, west London.        
	After finishing work, she was about to pick up her sons, aged 10 and eight, from their childminder when she was set upon by her assailants.        
	So savage was the attack that Geetas right hand was completely severed.        
	Expressing grief and anger at the time, her husband, Harpreet, then 31, had told journalists: I love Geeta and I would never hurt her. Im disgusted. I had nothing to do with it. CCTV (close circuit television) proves I was in a pub at the time. I was nowhere near the crime scene. Im going to find out who did this . I will make sure they are sorry, even if it takes the rest of my life.        
	But Harpreet, of Chesterton Close, Greenford, is now up before an Old Bailey jury, charged with hiring Sher Singh, 19, of Wren Avenue, Southall; Harpreet Singh, 20, of Elmwood Road, Slough; and Jaswant Dhillon, 30, of High Road, Ilford, east London, to do the actual killing. All claim to be innocent.        
	A pathologist, Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl, said Geeta suffered at least four focused and rapid blows to the head.        
	He revealed the head injuries included a wound cutting through the mouth and the jawbone, and another, 21cm long, across the skull that caused exposure of and damage to the brain.        
	A CT scan of her head described a non-salvageable injury to her brain, the pathologist went on. I do not consider it likely that any treatment given could have saved her. When one considers that firstly, the hand is cleanly and fully amputated and secondly, the keenness of the edge and the cleaving of the bone, this is a heavy, extremely sharp chopping implement. There are very few weapons capable of causing such a wound.        
	The prosecution lawyer, Aftab Jafferjee, said Geeta was executed because she had begun divorce proceedings.        
	So savage and determined was the mission to kill her that when she sought to protect her head, her right hand was completely severed from her arm, explained Jafferjee.         
	The man who organised this murder was none other than her own husband. He planned it. The other three defendants executed it. Geeta Aulakh was in the process of divorcing him and that would not be tolerated. No one else in the world could possibly have wished this utterly innocent and hard-working woman and mother any harm.        
	Jafferjee said the 14-inch machete used in the attack had been bought by Aulakh, and Sher Singh was almost certainly the man who used it.

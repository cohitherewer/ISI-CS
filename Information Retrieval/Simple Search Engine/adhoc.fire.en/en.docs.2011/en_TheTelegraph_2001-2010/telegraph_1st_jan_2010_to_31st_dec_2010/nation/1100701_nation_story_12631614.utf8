The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM lets Omar apply healing touch in protest-hit Valley 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      PM lets Omar apply healing touch in protest-hit Valley 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA AND NISHIT DHOLABHAI                            Singh, Omar                                 
	June 30: Omar Abdullahs resolve to uphold the law appears to have had some effect on the ground today, prompting the Centre to task the chief minister with the responsibility of politically healing the wounds in Kashmir.        
	In line with Omars policy, more areas were brought under curfew in Kashmir today to contain waves of protests triggered by the death of a teenager in police firing on June 11.        
	For the first time in three days when six youths were killed, no casualty was reported in the Valley today. However, no one is yet breathing easy as sporadic protests continued to break out in several parts despite tough restrictions.        
	A strike continues to paralyse the Valley and Srinagar was under a virtual curfew with around 35,000 security personnel deployed.        
	Omars government faces a key test tomorrow when separatists have announced a march to a mosque in the old city.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who returned yesterday to Delhi from Toronto, discussed the affairs in Kashmir with Union home minister P. Chidambaram and his officials for around 2 hours.        
	One of the decisions of the meeting was to let the young chief minister and his ministers visit the affected areas rather than sending ministers or officials from Delhi.        
	We are asking the chief minister and state ministers to visit the disturbed areas so that there can be some political action, Chidambaram told reporters today.         
	At the meeting, the Prime Minister is believed to have appreciated the statement of Omar yesterday that echoed what Delhi said earlier.         
	Omar had blamed anti-national elements and vested interests for fomenting trouble. He had also said: Let there be no misunderstanding. Nobody will be allowed to take law and order in their hands.        
	Echoing Omar and articulating further, Chidambaram pointed fingers at the Lashkar-e-Toiba, saying that the militants holed up in Sopore were probably from the militant group.         
	The home minister said the Centre appreciated Omar statement which largely corrected some impression made by his statement earlier.         
	The government has also iterated maximum restraint by the CRPF while insisting that curfew be imposed and enforced. The CRPF will assist the state police in enforcing the curfew, Chidambaram said.        
	Delhi feels that the trouble in Kashmir can be contained by the state administration at this juncture. Therefore, the onus has been laid on Omar and state police.         
	Chidambaram appealed to parents to ensure that children did not participate in the protests and violate curfew. Many of the protesters are young.        
	We have advised maximum restraint because many of the young boys are misled and so we need to handle the situation sensitively, the minister said.

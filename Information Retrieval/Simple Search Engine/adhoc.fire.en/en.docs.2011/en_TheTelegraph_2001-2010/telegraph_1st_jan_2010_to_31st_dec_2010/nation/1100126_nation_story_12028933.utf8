  - Cadres release sought        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 25: Chief minister Naveen Patnaiks office today received an email which warned of dire consequences if Subhashree, the wife of wanted Maoist leader Sabyasachi Panda, was not released at the earliest.         
	Sources said the mail was purportedly written by one Prakash alias Babuli Behera.         
	The letter, in English and Oriya read: Release Subhashree immediately or your Republic Day meeting at Cuttack tomorrow will be the last meeting of your life. The email also threatened a blast at Jharpada special jail if Subhashree, who is lodged there, was not released immediately.         
	We are verifying the authenticity and the source of the mail, a senior official in the police commissionerate said.         
	Security in and around the chief ministers residence and his Republic Day function venue at Cuttack has been beefed up, said the official. The CPI (Maoist) has called an Orissa bandh tomorrow to demand the release of Subhashree and her accomplices.         
	State director general of police, M. M. Praharaj said arrangements had been made to fly in ministers scheduled to attend Republic Day functions in Maoist-hit districts.         
	Earlier, about 100 Maoists raided the SAIL-owned Kalta mines in Sundergarh district in the morning, forcing miners to stop work, in support of their two-day economic blockade in the state. Soon after, the rebels also raided nearby Koida township, around 420km from Bhubaneswar, and forced shops to down shutters.        
	Before disappearing into the forest after the hour-long operation that started around 9am, the Naxalites asked the workers and people not to support either the CPI or CPM.        
	The Maoists left after issuing threats and no one was harmed. Soon after, buses plying in Koida stopped and traffic on NH-215 thinned, Koida police station in-charge P.K. Sahoo said.        
	Meanwhile, CPM zilla parishad member Anand Masiharo, who was abducted by the Maoists on Friday night, returned today, ending speculation that he had been killed.                                                   
	Both the state-owned Orissa State Road Transport Corporation (OSRTC) and private bus operators kept their buses off roads today.         
	The Bhubaneswar zone of OSRTC has decided not to ply any of its buses on the Berhampur-Rayagada route and has sought clearance from the district collectors and SPs before resuming operation. Similarly, it has decided not to ply buses to Maoist-hit Malkangiri district.        
	The rebels, besides circulating posters and banners urging people to support the bandh, also blocked the Berhampur-Rayagada road by felling trees.        
	No violence has been reported so far from any part of the state. Schools, colleges, private and government offices and shops are functioning as usual, said IG (operations) Sanjeev Marik.

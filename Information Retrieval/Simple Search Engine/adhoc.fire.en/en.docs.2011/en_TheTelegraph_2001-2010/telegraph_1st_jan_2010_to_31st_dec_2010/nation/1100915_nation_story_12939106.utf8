The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NC to fight, keeps quit option open
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      NC to fight, keeps quit option open
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Omar Abdullah                                  
	Srinagar, Sept. 14: The National Conference today vowed to fight if the Centre rejected its demand for partial withdrawal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, but said this did not necessarily mean Omar Abdullah would resign as chief minister.        
	For now, the party has decided to participate in tomorrows all-party discussions in Delhi before deciding whether to remain in the state government and, by implication, in the central coalition.        
	We are still optimistic that something will emerge, senior leader Chowdhary Mohamad Ramzan said after a meeting of the National Conferences core group, chaired by party chief and Union minister Farooq Abdullah who arrived from South Africa today.        
	Ramzan said the party would also wait and watch the outcome of a possible meeting of the cabinet committee on security later tomorrow.        
	He, however, said the National Conference would not repeat the mistake it had made 10 years ago when the then NDA government rejected its autonomy resolution and the party did nothing.        
	Our response this time will be different. We will fight, Ramzan said.        
	Earlier this afternoon, the Union home minister rang Omar and, in a placatory gesture, said Delhis remark yesterday about a governance deficit in the Valley referred not only to the state governments failure but also to that of the Centre, sources said.        
	Omar apparently told P. Chidambaram it was not certain that he would resign if the army special powers act was not withdrawn. All options are open, a party leader said.                    
	The state government had earlier denied reports of Omars resignation and urged the media not to give credence to needless, baseless rumours. Sources said the party was divided on whether to continue in the government. Some leaders want a message sent to the Centre that the party cannot be taken for granted, but others favour a cool-headed response.        
	Airport shut        
	The protests today spread from the Valley to Jammus Muslim-majority districts. In an indication of the worsening crisis, the authorities stopped civilian flights to Srinagar  for the first time since the 1999 Kargil War  for three days.        
	The entire Valley has been placed under curfew following yesterdays violence, which claimed 17 lives. But protesters defied the curfew and clashed with the security forces today at several places in Kashmir and Jammu.        
	Many were injured, one of them critically after taking a bullet in the head at Srinagars Boatman Colony. Jammus Poonch district has been placed under curfew.

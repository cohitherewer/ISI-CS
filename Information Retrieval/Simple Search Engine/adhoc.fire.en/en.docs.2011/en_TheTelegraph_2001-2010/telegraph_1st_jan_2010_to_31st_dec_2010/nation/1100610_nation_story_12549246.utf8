The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Party-less polls to stem rout
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Party-less polls to stem rout
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                                        Mayavati    
	Lucknow, June 9: Mayavati has found just the formula to avoid the humiliation the CPM recently suffered in Bengal  hold party-less civic polls.        
	The chief minister has quietly initiated a move to amend municipal election laws in Uttar Pradesh so that every candidate is an Independent, which means no party can technically be a winner or a loser.        
	Mayavati fears that the 2011 civic polls in the state could deliver her party a morale-busting rout just a year before the 2012 Assembly polls.        
	The Bahujan Samaj Party doesnt have much of a following in the urban local bodies. So, if the 2011 polls are held on the basis of party tickets, it would force as much humiliation on the BSP as the CPM is now facing in Bengal, state Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh said.        
	Bihar and Madhya Pradesh already hold party-less polls to their local bodies, upholding the principles of grassroots democracy as propounded by Jayaprakash Narayan.        
	Mayavati remembers how the 2006 civic polls had jolted and demoralised the then ruling Samajwadi Party, helping her ride to power in the state the following year. She is so jittery that she announced yesterday her party would not contest any by-election till the 2012 Assembly polls  a statement that drew instant derision from the BJP and the Samajwadis.        
	But today, the Opposition was even more furious, accusing Mayavati of having kept her plan for party-less civic polls under wraps to pre-empt a furore.        
	The state government proposed the change in a gazette notification on May 11, giving citizens and political parties the mandatory one month to raise objections before a bill could be tabled in the Assembly.        
	But the state government didnt publish it in newspapers as is usually done, complained senior Congress leader Viren Madan.        
	None except Mayavatis own officials appeared to have read the gazette till today, when Congress leaders told the media about it. The one-month period ends on June 11, so the Opposition parties have just two days to send their objections.        
	Samajwadi spokesperson Rajendra Choudhary claimed the abolition of party-based municipal polls would increase horse-trading, making it easier for the ruling party to buy councillors.        
	This amendment is politically loaded and so crucial, yet it was kept under wraps. Its shameful, Choudhary said.        
	Lucknow MP Lalji Tandon threatened: Well take the issue to the people.        
	But a BSP minister claimed the change was proposed to avoid violence during civic polls. The bill will be discussed and debated before it is passed. There has been no procedural illegality, he said.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 22: A day after a Supreme Court bench had used the word keep as a synonym for mistress in a judgment, it faced the fury of a senior government lawyer and womens rights activist.        
	As a woman, I am hurt. I take strong objection to the use of certain words and expressions in the judgment, additional solicitor-general Indira Jaisingh told the two stunned judges.        
	This is just a literal translation of the Hindi word rakhel. How can you use the word keep when talking of a woman? Can you say that a man was kept by a woman?        
	The bench was yesterday clarifying when a woman live-in partner could rightfully claim maintenance under the domestic violence act of 2005, which Jaisingh had helped draft. A mans keep would not be entitled to maintenance, Justice Markandey Katju and Justice T.S. Thakur had ruled.        
	Neither the Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary nor Websters Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary mentions this sense of the word keep. The OALD has kept woman but adds that its use is old-fashioned, usually humorous.        
	Sanghita Sen, English teacher at Presidency College, said she had heard Americans speak the word which was in its initial phase of colloquialism globally.        
	Jaisingh was in the two judges court today in connection with another case when Justice Katju prodded her to react to yesterdays judgment by calling her the creator of the 2005 act.        
	I had thought I would keep quiet but now that you have sought my comments, I will tell you that I am hurt. Such words are derogatory, she replied agitatedly.        
	How can a Supreme Court judge use such a word in the 21st century? Supreme Court judges should not use words that are not gender-sensitive.        
	As a packed courtroom watched awe-struck, Justice Katju tried to deflect the criticism saying the court should concentrate on the case at hand. But Jaisingh, a firebrand feminist in her own right, wouldnt stop.        
	I am not quarrelling about the ratio (principles) of the judgment... that is correct. I am only objecting to the use of certain words.... I will move an application seeking to have those words expunged, she said.        
	I dont even want to appear before this bench, she added loudly enough for all to hear.        
	Justice Thakur tried to defuse the tension by asking whether concubine would have been a better word. Jaisingh did not take him on but later expressed her disapproval of the suggestion, saying: That would have been worse.        
	PTI quoted Jaisingh as later saying she also objected to the expression one-night stand in yesterdays judgment. The report said the law ministry might be approached to seek deletion of certain observations in the judgment.        
	Last year, Justice Katju had to retract his words after telling a Muslim student, who wanted to wear a beard to school, that Talibanisation of the country couldnt be allowed.        
	Jaisingh has fought many cases for womens rights, such as the Mary Roy case in which Syrian Christian women in Kerala got equal inheritance rights, and the Rupan Deol Bajaj case in which former police chief K.P.S. Gill was convicted of molestation.

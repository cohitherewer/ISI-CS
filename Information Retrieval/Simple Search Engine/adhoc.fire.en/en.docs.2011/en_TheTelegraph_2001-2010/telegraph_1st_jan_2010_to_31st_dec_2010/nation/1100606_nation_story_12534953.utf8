The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia stands firm, Anand gets RS ticket
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sonia stands firm, Anand gets RS ticket
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Anand Sharma                                  
	New Delhi, June 5: Sonia Gandhi today cleared commerce minister Anand Sharmas Rajya Sabha candidature from Rajasthan, brushing aside a campaign by his powerful critics and ending speculation about his continuance in the government.        
	But she listened to those opposed to former Union minister Suresh Pachauri and changed her mind about nominating him.         
	This pattern came up again and again as the Congress handed out Upper House tickets: Sonia accepted state leaders pressure on some candidates but not when their advice went against someone really important to her plans.        
	Despite stiff opposition, she succeeded in giving tickets to all the four Union ministers in the fray: Ambika Soni, Jairam Ramesh, Sharma and M.S. Gill.        
	She had also green-lighted Pachauri, who had the backing of the Prime Minister and Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel. Sources said Manmohan Singh had been happy with Pachauris handling of parliamentary affairs in UPA I and would have liked him back in the cabinet. Pachauri, now Madhya Pradesh Congress chief, too was keen to shift to national politics after the Assembly poll rout.        
	However, powerful leaders from Madhya Pradesh, such as Digvijay Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia, were against the idea. Many senior leaders from other states too thought that selecting Pachauri would lead to heartburn since he had already been given four Rajya Sabha terms.        
	Someone who is around 56 years old has already been kept in the Rajya Sabha for 24 years without any electoral victory. Giving him a fifth term soon after the debacle in the Assembly elections would have sent a wrong signal, a senior Congress official said.        
	Many felt this would give Rajya Sabha members a precedent to claim re-nomination again and again, stifling the opportunities for fresh blood.        
	Sonia eventually agreed to leave Pachauri out but allowed him the final say, as state Congress president, in the selection of the candidate.        
	Pachauri suggested Vijayalaxmi Sadho, a Dalit who had been a minister in the Digvijay government. Sadho had been nowhere in the race but was preferred over the names suggested by other lobbies in the state.        
	In Andhra Pradesh, too, Sonia yielded to state leaders and gave the ticket to N. Janardhana Reddy instead of her original choice, former minister Renuka Chowdhury.        
	But she overruled state leaders in many instances. Mohsina Kidwai was picked from Chhattisgarh despite former chief minister Ajit Jogis claims, and Sharma and Gill chosen in the face of stiff resistance from the Rajasthan and Punjab units.        
	A powerful lobby wanted Congress secretary Mohan Prakash nominated from Rajasthan instead of Sharma, who is from Himachal Pradesh, but Sonia had told the minister not to worry. She, however, listened to state leaders in the case of the two other candidates from Rajasthan.        
	Ask Ali Tak, an aide of chief minister Ashok Gehlot, got the nod and Narendra Budania was retained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tehran concern on US table 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tehran concern on US table 
          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, July 9: US national security adviser James Jones arrives here next week to finalise the agenda for President Barack Obamas visit to India in November with the talks also expected to feature Indias recent overtures to Iran against Washingtons advice.        
	Joness visit is scheduled on July 13-14. His parleys with Indian counterpart Shiv Shankar Menon will include the Afghan situation and the finalisation of the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	When Jones last visited India in June 2009, the post-election situation in Iran had formed an important part of his discussions with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, defence minister A.K. Antony and the then national security adviser, M.K. Narayanan.        
	Sources said Irans nuclear programme and Indias gradual warming up to Tehran had caused consternation in the Obama administration. India and Iran today concluded their two-day joint commission consultations by signing several agreements to increase economic co-operation. The Indian side attaches great importance to the visit by finance minister S. Shamseddin Hosseini.        
	After meeting foreign minister S.M. Krishna, the Iranian minister met the Prime Minister, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and Menon and all the three premier chambers of commerce: Ficci, Assocham and CII.        
	In April, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao had described Iran as a responsible country when asked about its nuclear programme. On Monday, she seemed to take a swipe at the US-backed Iran sanctions.        
	We are justifiably concerned that the extra-territorial nature of certain unilateral sanctions recently imposed by individual countries, with their restrictions on investment by third countries in Irans energy sector, can have a direct and adverse impact on Indian companies and more importantly, on our energy security and development needs, she said.

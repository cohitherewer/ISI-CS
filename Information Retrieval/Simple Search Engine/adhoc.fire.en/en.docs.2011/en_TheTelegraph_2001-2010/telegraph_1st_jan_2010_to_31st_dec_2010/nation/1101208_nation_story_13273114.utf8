The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Teaser allies: Fine with JPC, leave it to PM
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Teaser allies: Fine with JPC, leave it to PM
          OUR BUREAU                          Mamata Banerjee                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: Mamata Banerjee today said she would be happy if the Centre formed a Joint Parliamentary Committee on the telecom scandal but added that she would leave the decision to the Prime Minister.        
	We also want the truth to come out. If the government forms a JPC, we will be happy, she said in Calcutta before leaving for Delhi this afternoon, ahead of tomorrows meeting between Sonia Gandhi and Trinamul Congress MPs.        
	Her statement reflected a trend among key Congress allies to increasingly underscore that they had nothing against a JPC while reaffirming they would go along with whatever the Centre decided.        
	The allies dual strategy seems clear. One, they want to avoid being seen as pushing the government for a JPC probe. Two, they want to distance themselves from the Centres firm opposition to the JPC demand so that the corruption charges do not touch them.        
	DMK leader T.R. Baalu spoke in the same vein despite his party colleague, former telecom minister A. Raja, being the prime target of the spectrum scandal. We have nothing against a JPC probe. We are not opposed to it. But we are with the government and support whatever decision it takes, Baalu said.        
	A third ally, Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party, is learnt to be of the same opinion.        
	Why should we be seen to be supporting corruption? We are with the government but we have a no-tolerance attitude towards corruption. Thereby we want to remain transparent and ready for any kind of probe, a Trinamul MP said.        
	Mamatas party is anxious to deny the Left any chance to exploit the corruption charges against the government, of which Trinamul is a part. On the other hand, a defensive Congress would suit Trinamul nicely during seat-sharing talks for the Bengal polls.        
	DMK sources said they wanted a JPC probe because they resented the Congress tactic of demonising Raja alone.        
	All Rajas decisions were vetted by the Prime Minister. How can the government wash its hands of it and say only Raja was responsible? said a DMK leader, stressing that a JPC probe would expand the ambit of the inquiry beyond Raja.        
	When Sudip Bandopadhyay called on Sonia in Parliament today to seek the appointment for Trinamul MPs tomorrow, he too used the occasion to assure her that his party was stoutly behind the government over the Oppositions corruption charges.        
	Outside, when journalists asked him what his partys stand on a JPC probe was, his stress was unmistakable.        
	We are not scared of a JPC. If it happens, then we are okay with it. We are not opposed to it. But we are with whatever decision the government and the Prime Minister take, Sudip said.        
	He denied, however, that tomorrows meeting had anything to do with the JPC demand. We want to raise the issue of CPM-sponsored violence in Bengal, he said. He could not say whether Mamata would lead the delegation.        
	Mamata, asked if she would object to a JPC, said: Why should we object? We want it discussed on the floor of the House.        
	She added: We are with the Prime Minister and have total faith in him. It is the Prime Minister who will take the decision. We are in the UPA. We will remain with the UPA and that is our commitment.        
	Sources said the leaders of some allies today met Pranab Mukherjee and parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal and were told the government was still not thinking of instituting a JPC probe.

	Jaipur, Nov. 16: The grape-coloured Rolls Royce Phantom II has rolled out the gates of Jodhpurs majestic Umaid Bhavan Palace. Prince Shivraj Singh will not return to his palace till he brings back his bride on Thursday.        
	Looking dapper in a traditional achkan with gold and silver work, Prince Shivraj this evening left for another of the royal familys palaces in Jodhpur in the same car that his father Maharaja Gaj Singh and grandfather Maharaja Hanwant Singh had used for their weddings many autumns ago.        
	Tomorrow morning, the 35-year-old will take a chartered flight to Jaipur for what is being billed as one of the most awaited royal weddings in decades. The day after, he will marry Princess Gayatri of Askot, a small town in Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand, in a lavish but traditional ceremony at Jaipurs Rambagh Palace Hotel.        
	There is much excitement building up because it has been 37 years since theres been a marriage in the Jodhpur royal family. The family spokesperson, Prithviraj Singh Khandela, said the Eton and Oxford-educated prince has been courting 22-year-old Gayatri for a year now, meeting her and exchanging emails with the blessings of family elders.        
	But there is also an element of anxiety as the prince, once known as the poster-boy of polo, had a terrible accident while playing a Birla Cup Match at the Rambagh Polo Ground in February 2005. He had suffered grave head injuries and a brain clot after he was thrown off his horse following a collision with a rival, Sameer Chaudhary. Worse, one of the horses had landed on him.        
	The prince had then been in a coma for several days and had to be taken to the US for treatment. His recovery was a prolonged and slow process. Sources said there was always some worry about his health, but he was absolutely fit and fine ahead of Thursdays extravaganza.        
	The last time the Jodhpur royals witnessed a wedding was way back in 1973 when the princes father, Maharaja Gaj Singh, married his mother Hemlata Rajya, then Princess of Poonch, in Dehra Dun. The princes elder sister, Princess Shivranjini, is single.        
	But Maharaja Gaj Singhs wedding was a low-key affair to which only close family and friends had been invited, said Thakur Sundar Singh, the secretary to the maharaja.        
	In contrast, Prince Shivrajs wedding will be a huge affair, with royals from Nepal, Bhutan, Tripura, Orissa, Mysore, Patiala, Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir on the guest list. The Holkars, Scindias and Gaekwads will also be there. Organisers said the wedding was likely to be the largest congregation of royals since the Delhi durbar of 1911, held to mark the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary of England.        
	About 900 baraatis are expected at the wedding, at which singers Mick Jagger and Sting are likely to perform. The traditional Rajput baraat will comprise men from Jodhpur, dressed in achkans, sherwani and churidars or breeches and colourful safas (turbans). The wedding will be a private affair at which media are barred. Only guests with passes or invitation cards will be allowed in.        
	Family spokesperson Khandela said a lot of wedding arrangements had been made locally. Flowers were not being imported but local marigolds, roses and mogra were being used. Invitation cards had been printed at a local press that had enjoyed royal patronage for decades.        
	Most of the performing artistes would be local, like the 101 Langa and Manganiar musicians who featured at this evenings ceremony. The Ganesha idol that will be installed in the royal household to mark the beginning of festivities has been made locally. The food will be a mix of recipes from Marwar and Uttarakhand.

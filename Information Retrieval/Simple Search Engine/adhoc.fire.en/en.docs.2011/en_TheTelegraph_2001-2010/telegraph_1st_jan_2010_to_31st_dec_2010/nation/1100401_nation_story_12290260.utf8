          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Karat                          
	Lucknow, March 31: Prakash Karat today said the CPM would fight farmland acquisition across the country, in an apparent bid to pull the party organisation out of its defensive shell post-Singur and Nandigram.        
	CPM activists will hit the streets on April 8 opposing chief minister Mayavatis plans to acquire 64,000 hectares (1.58 lakh acres) as part of a countrywide agitation whose cornerstone is concern for the poor.        
	We have made mistakes in Bengal and suffered electoral reverses, the CPM general secretary said in Lucknow. The party will now stand by the poor everywhere, he added. In Singur, his party was seen by many as standing with industry rather than the farmers.         
	Now, the CPM wants the 1894 law that the Bengal government had used to acquire land in Singur scrapped. That is an ancient, archaic law, which needs to go, Karat said.        
	He complained that Mayavatis plan would tear the poor away from their land. The acquisition of this huge tract of land will cause land alienation of Dalits and other backward people. Part of the land is to be used for commercial purposes but farmers are not getting a proper price for their land.         
	Mayavati hopes to complete acquiring the 64,000 hectares by the year-end for the Ganga Expressway, a 1,047km road running along the river that will connect eastern and western Uttar Pradesh.         
	Karat said: The party hopes to mobilise 25 lakh workers (across India) on April 8.         
	A Uttar Pradesh CPM leader said this was the first time the party had formally launched an agitation against land acquisition at the national level. This is a Karat line with a sharper focus on the future, said Prem Nath Rai, a member of the state party secretariat.         
	However, the CPM is known to have taken radical positions on issues such as land acquisition in states where it has little or no stake but pursued different policies in places where it is in power.        
	Karat today defended the land acquisition in Singur. There, the total area of land acquired was much smaller. At least 70 per cent of the farmers had agreed to part with their land.        
	The so-called new Karat line also proposes a united Opposition against the Congresss anti-people economic polici- es and the pro-US nuclear liability law.         
	It is said to be part of the partys policy revision in the wake of the electoral reverses and a bid at damage control before the 2011 elections in Bengal and Kerala. Our new policy will address the grievances of voters in West Bengal, Karat said, adding: We (still) have a vote share of 43 per cent. There is no reason for us to be upset. He has a high personal stake, too. After his controversial decision to withdraw support to the UPA government that facilitated a Congress-Trinamul Congress pact in Bengal last year, the failed attempt at a third alternative with Mayavati and the decline in the partys electoral strength under his watch, a debacle in Bengal and Kerala in 2011 could lead to stiff opposition to his getting a third term as general secretary.         
	Karat is working on issues of land acquisition with other parties. He said he had received suggestions about a new acquisition law from Ajit Singh of the Rashtriya Lok Dal. The new law, he added, should address the public purpose of acquisition and ensure a bigger role for the state in deciding compensation and rehabilitation.

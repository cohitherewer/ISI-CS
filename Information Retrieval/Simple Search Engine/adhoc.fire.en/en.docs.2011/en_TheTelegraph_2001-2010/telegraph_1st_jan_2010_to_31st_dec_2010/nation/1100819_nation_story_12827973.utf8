          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Aug. 18: The man who flung his shoe at Omar Abdullah on Independence Day today said he felt no remorse at what he did and would do it again if he got a chance.        
	I have quit my job in the police. I have no personal grudge against Omar Abdullah. Since he represents India, I threw my shoe at the Indian state, Abdul Ahad Jan told The Telegraph.        
	I have no remorse over what I did. I will do it again for the simple reason that India is killing my brethren here.        
	Jan, a suspended police constable, walked free yesterday after Omar pardoned him and asked police to withdraw all cases registered against him. He reached his Bandipora home today.        
	Omar had called Jan to his residence yesterday. Television footage showed Jan breaking into tears after meeting Omar. The chief minister was later seen hugging him.        
	Jan today said his tears were not caused by remorse. I broke into tears as I was happy over what I did, he said, as thousands thronged to his Ajas home in north Kashmirs Bandipora district.        
	Omar Abdullah was compelled to release me because of mounting public pressure.        
	On pardoning Jan, Omar said: The holy month of Ramazan teaches us to be compassionate and to forgive everyone. My steps are in conformity with the teachings of Islam, which does not teach hatred but love and brotherhood.        
	Jan alleged he was beaten up in police custody and an officer had pressured him to say he threw the shoe at the behest of Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani or PDP leader Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.        
	I was ruthlessly beaten but later Ashiq Bukhari (Srinagar police chief) came to my rescue, he alleged.         
	The police claimed Jan is mentally unstable.

	Mumbai, July 26: An all-party team of Maharashtra MLAs will visit Mumbais Arthur Road Jail and review its functioning, state home minister R.R. Patil said today after Saturdays brawl between Abu Salem and another gangster.        
	Patil made the announcement in the Assembly and said he himself would go with the legislators. The team, he said will also look into allegations that Salem and the other gangster, Mustafa Dossa, received five-star treatment.         
	If any irregularities are found, we will take action against the officials, Patil said.         
	Salem was slashed by Dossa . He was shifted to a Raigad jail yesterday and Dossa to the Thane prison.

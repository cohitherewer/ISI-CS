	Mumbai, Jan. 11 (PTI): Bombay High Court has reduced the sentence of a man by five years on the request of his wife whom he tried to immolate.        
	The interest of justice would be met, if the husbands sentence was cut down as his wife and two children needed him, Justice A.P. Bhangale of the Nagpur bench of the high court said.        
	Chandrashekhar Telegaonkar had been sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment by a Nagpur sessions court on March 6, 2008, for attempting to murder his wife Surekha under the influence of alcohol.         
	She survived because neighbours came to her rescue.         
	When the matter was pending before the trial court, Surekha made an application stating that she needs the company of her husband as she was unable to shoulder the responsibility of two minor daughters and her mother was asking her to leave the house.        
	The trial court did not consider her plea.         
	The high court upheld the conviction but agreed to reduce the sentence.

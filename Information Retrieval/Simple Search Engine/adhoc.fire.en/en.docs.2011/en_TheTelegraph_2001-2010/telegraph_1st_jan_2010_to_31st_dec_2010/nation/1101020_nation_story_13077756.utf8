                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Probe nears Dikshit govt doorstep     Matriarch cuts lonely figure
          ARCHIS MOHAN                          An income tax official during a raid on the residence of BJP leader Sudhanshu Mittal, whose relatives were allegedly given Commonwealth Games contracts, in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: Sheila Dikshit was campaigning in Bihar today but back in Delhi, which she has ruled for 12 years running, the probe into Games corruption allegations was threatening to engulf her government.        
	For Delhis chief minister, the past week has been a roller coaster. On Thursday, spectators cheered her endlessly at the Games closing ceremony. But three days on, at a Dussehra ceremony, she stood forlorn as Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and son Rahul helped the Prime Minister handle the bow and arrow to shoot down Ravanas 40ft-tall effigy. The trio kept their distance from her through the ceremony.        
	Many in Congress circles have forecast this to be the autumn of Delhis matriarch. The corruption probe now looks set to reach her governments doorstep as also the Jaipal Reddy-headed urban development ministry.        
	Dikshits party and cabinet colleagues voiced surprise at her unprovoked outburst at Games organising committee chief Suresh Kalmadi. Late last week, she had said the real corruption seems to be with regard to the money given as loans (to the organising committee).        
	A Delhi Congress leader said: It was uncharacteristic of her. She is generally calm, rarely gets into verbal duels. I read it as a sign she is feeling the heat.        
	The comptroller and auditor general (CAG) and the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) are already asking questions. About Rs 16,560 crore were allotted to the Delhi government to organise the Games.        
	According to a sports ministry report released last month, Rs 2,800 crore was to be spent on a 1500MW power project due to have become operational by mid-2010. The project is way behind schedule.        
	Second, the Delhi government received Rs 900 crore for construction of bus depots. But only one has come up, which has to be demolished as it has been built on Yamunas floodplain.        
	Third, the government spent Rs 1,800 crore to augment its bus fleet. The CAG is probing complaints that about twice the amount was paid for each of these buses that should have cost Rs 40 lakh.        
	Fourth, the government received Rs 670 crore to construct stadiums and training venues. The training venues at Shivaji Stadium and Ludlow Castle are not ready. The budget for widening and strengthening roads was Rs 650 crore but several caved in.        
	Fifth, the government was given Rs 3,700 crore to build flyovers and bridges. Sources said the CAG was looking into complaints of cost escalation, poor quality of work and the collapse of the overbridge outside Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium.        
	No surprise then that Kalmadi asked Dikshit to mind her government instead of taking potshots at the organising committee in an interview to a TV channel today.        
	Kalmadi said his silence should not be construed as a sign of weakness. ...Now that the Games are over, I shall speak out and I did reply to Mrs Dikshit. I said set your own house in order before you show your finger at others, he said.        
	Kalmadi said Dikshit had a budget of Rs 16,000 crore and that was all the construction part of it. I had nothing to do with construction. My budget is just Rs 1,600 crore to organise the Games, to deliver the Games, thats about it. So, she has to answer for a lot of things. She should not put the blame on somebody else.

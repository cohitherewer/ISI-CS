          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          : The Supreme Court                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: The Supreme Court today stripped the issue of judicial integrity of all niceties, saying the people of this country are not fools and everyone knew which judge was honest and which judge was not.        
	With these observations, a two-judge bench rejected a plea by Allahabad High Court to expunge its earlier remarks that there was something rotten in the high court whose uncle judges favoured lawyers related to them.        
	Everyone in the country knows which judge is honest and which judge is not. They may not say anything because of fear of committing contempt of court, Justice Markandey Katju, known for his outspokenness in court, said sitting alongside Justice Gyan Sudha Mishra.        
	Tomorrow, if Justice Katju begins demanding bribes, everyone will know, he added.        
	Justice Katju asked the high courts counsel, P.P. Rao, not to press any arguments. Dont force me to open my mouth, he said.        
	He, however, clarified that the benchs November 26 observations were not intended to damage the high court.        
	We have not painted everyone with the same brush.... There are presently many excellent (and) upright judges (who) are keeping the flag of the high court flying high.... It is totally false to say that all judges are corrupt, or to construe our order in that manner, the bench said.        
	What is mentioned (in the November 26 order) is that there are complaints against certain judges.... It has been mentioned that many lawyers who are relatives of judges are scrupulously taking care that no one should lift a finger (against them). It is clarified that many judges are doing the same.        
	Justice Katju dismissed the high courts contention that his observations seriously damage its reputation and sully its image.        
	(The) reputation of an institution is damaged and its image sullied when some of its members pass shocking orders and behave in a totally unacceptable manner, the bench said, citing the distressing orders passed by some of the high courts judges during this years summer vacation.        
	It urged the high court to take its views in a positive spirit.        
	We can quite appreciate the anguish of some of the judges of Allahabad High Court, but we cannot overlook... that there are times when introspection is required, and not mere reaction. We earnestly request the judges to consider our order in that spirit, the top court said.        
	When Rao said the apex courts remarks would leave rural folk unable to distinguish between honest and corrupt judges, the bench said: Do not tell me all those things about the rustic. They are much more enlightened. Do not think (the) people of India are fools.        
	Later, the bench said in its written order: One of us (Justice Katju) has close attachment to Allahabad High Court as his family has been associated with the high court for over a century. It is, therefore, inconceivable that he would like to damage the high court in any way.        
	The courts November 26 remarks had come in connection with a high court judge flouting his territorial jurisdiction and allowing a circus owner to hold his show on a dargahs grounds without hearing the other party, the wakf board.        
	That order had said: A lot of complaints are coming against certain judges of Allahabad High Court relating to their integrity. Some judges have their kith and kin practising in the same court, and within a few years of starting practice the sons or relations of the judge become multi-millionaires, have huge bank balances, luxurious cars, huge houses and are enjoying a luxurious life.        
	The bench had said that Allahabad High Court, including its Lucknow bench, needed house cleaning and urged the state chief justice to take strong measures, including transfer of the incorrigibles.

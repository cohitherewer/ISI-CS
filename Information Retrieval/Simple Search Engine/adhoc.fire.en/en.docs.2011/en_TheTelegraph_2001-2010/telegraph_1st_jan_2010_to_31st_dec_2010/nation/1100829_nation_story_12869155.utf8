The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MP deaf to Gandhis line

          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Rahul Gandhi                                  
	Bhopal, Aug. 28: The organisational elections in the Madhya Pradesh Congress have made a mockery of the calls given by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi for inner-party democracy and better representation for the weaker sections.        
	Rahuls thrust on democracy and talent hunt has taken a beating with the entire process taking the consensus route. Sources said the central minders and state leaders had kept in close touch with pick party delegates.        
	The result: most of the 502 Pradesh Congress Committee delegates are from one or the other of the six prominent regional camps, led by Digvijay Singh, Kamal Nath, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Suresh Pachauri, Arjun Singh and Subhash Yadav.        
	Add to that the family factor: the delegate list teems with the wives, sons, nephews, brothers and brothers-in- law of prominent party leaders.        
	Sonias plank for a better deal for women, tribals, Dalits and minorities too has gone for a six. Despite her repeated appeals for a 33 per cent representation for women, the gender makes up less than 10 per cent of the delegates.        
	Only 47 of the 502 delegates are women and even among them, there is abysmal representation of the minorities and weaker sections.        
	Madhya Pradesh has a sizable Other Backward Classes population that, if clubbed with the Dalits and tribals, accounts for over 60 per cent of the population. Yet the Brahmins and the Thakurs, less than 10 per cent of the population, occupy more than half the slots on the delegate list.        
	In another violation of party norms, the state unit has inducted those who had fought the official Congress nominees in the 2008 Assembly polls and 2009 Lok Sabha elections. They include Sanjeev Saxena, Narayan Tripathi, Arjun Palia, Mukesh Nayak and Arif Masood.        
	Several Congress panels, though, have recommended a mandatory cooling-off period of two to five years before such rebels are given positions of responsibility.         
	The list of delegates was announced late last night. These men and women, along with other state representatives, will elect an all-India party president on September 17. Sonia is set to be re-elected unopposed.        
	Under the Congress constitution, the party president can nominate 15 per cent of state delegates from the marginalised sections. But even if Sonia uses this discretionary power, the proportion of women, minorities, Dalits and tribals among the delegates will remain far below what she has been advocating.        
	Some state Congress leaders expressed surprise that the All India Congress Committee functionaries in charge of Madhya Pradesh, and the members of the partys central election authority, allowed such violation of the leaderships guidelines. Party insiders said the poll managers had circulated a list of probable delegates among the regional satraps in a spirit of give and take.

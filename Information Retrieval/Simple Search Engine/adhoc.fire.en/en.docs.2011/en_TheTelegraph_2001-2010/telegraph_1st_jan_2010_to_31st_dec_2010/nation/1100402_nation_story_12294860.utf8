          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, April 1: Narendra Modi could face another round of questioning over the 2002 riots with the Nanavati Commission today keeping open the option of summoning the chief minister, a turnaround that prompted Gujarat High Court to comment that things seem to be moving in (the) right direction.         
	The high court had on March 22 asked the panel to clarify by April 1 whether its September 2009 decision not to summon Modi was final.         
	The division bench of Chief Justice S. J. Mukhopadhaya and Justice Akil Kureshi, hearing an appeal filed by the Jan Sangarsh Manch, a rights group representing the riot victims, had sought this information from the government pleader.         
	Advocate-general Kamal Trivedi today submitted a letter, written by the commission and addressed to the government pleader, in which the panel has explained the steps taken by it and the likely future course of action.        
	The Nanavati Commissions letter says that its order of September 18, 2009, is not final, the bench said.         
	In view of the letter submitted by the Nanavati Commission, the matter has been adjourned till June 17, the judges added.        
	Mukhopadhaya then told advocate Mukul Sinha, appearing for the rights group, that things are moving in the right direction as you wanted.         
	Modi has already subjected himself to a nine-hour questioning session by the Supreme Court-monitored Special Investigation Team in connection with a complaint filed by the widow of Congress leader Ahsan Jafri, who was murdered during the riots.        
	The prospect of the chief minister being questioned by the commission has brought some relief to the riot victims who have accused Modi of colluding with the accused.         
	If not tomorrow, some day I will definitely get a chance to grill him, said a confident advocate Sinha.         
	The commission, comprising retired judges GT Nanavati (Supreme Court) and Akshay Mehta (Gujarat High Court), had earlier observed that there is no basis to summon Modi. But it had agreed to direct two personal assistants of the chief minister to file affidavits explaining why they were constantly in touch with the riot accused when the city was burning.         
	Legal experts said todays turnaround may have been the fallout of the SIT summons or it could also be that the commission had found something substantial in the affidavits filed by the chief ministers office assistants, which warrants cross-examination of Modi.        
	Last year, the Jan Sangarsh Manch had moved an application before the commission asking for the cross-examination of Modi and three others  then home minister Gordhan Zadafia, health minister Ashok Bhat and deputy commissioner of police, Zone 5, RJ Savani.        
	The commission had rejected the application, prompting the rights group to move the high court.

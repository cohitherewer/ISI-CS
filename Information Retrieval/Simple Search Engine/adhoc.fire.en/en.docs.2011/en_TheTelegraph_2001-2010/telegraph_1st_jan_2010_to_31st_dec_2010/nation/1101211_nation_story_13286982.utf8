The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM takes up frisk cause
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CPM takes up frisk cause
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: Ambassador Meera Shankar has found an unlikely sympathiser in the CPM, which has not just voiced outrage at the pat-down search she was subjected to at a US airport but also demanded a tit-for-tat policy.         
	It is not enough for the Indian government to say that such frisking is unacceptable. Since the US authorities have stated that ambassadors are not exempt from security searches, what the government should do is to adopt a reciprocal approach. The US ambassador in India should be subjected to security searches on domestic flights in India, a CPM politburo statement said.         
	If the CPM used the issue as a stick to beat US imperialism with, the nationalist BJP picked on the womens angle. The partys womens wing staged a dharna.        
	The CPM appeared to be making up for its vacillating stand during US President Barack Obamas stay  it had protested his visit outside but its MPs had gone to Parliament to hear Obama speak.         
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao today said: It (the frisking) wasnt good public diplomacy. We have also asked our embassy in Washington to give us a detailed report on the incident.         
	US regrets pat-down        
	The US on Friday expressed regret over the incident, reports PTI. We obviously are concerned about it. We will be looking into it and trying to determine both what happened and what we could do to prevent such incidents in the future, secretary of state Hillary Clinton said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sadhu acid on Spanish disciple
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sadhu acid on Spanish disciple
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, Jan. 4: A Rishikesh-based sadhu and yoga teacher has been detained for an alleged acid attack on a Spanish woman disciple inside an auto-rickshaw on Saturday.        
	Police said a quarrel had broken out between Baba Rajgiri, 55, and Gloria Kasnovat, a Barcelona resident who had been staying in the sadhus ashram for the past three years, learning yoga.        
	The two of them had just returned from a visit to Nepal and were travelling to the ashram in the Tapovan area of Rishikesh, Uttarakhand.        
	Inside the auto, Rajgiri picked a fight with the woman and in a fit of anger, whipped out a bottle of acid and sprayed it on her face, said Abhinav Kumar, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Dehra Dun.        
	He is being interrogated by Rishikesh police and may be arrested. We dont know the exact reason for the attack yet.        
	The Rishikesh police said Kasnovat had suffered hand and face burns and was being treated at the Christian Medical Institute in Dehra Dun. Doctors said Gloria was out of danger but her scars would take a long time to heal.        
	In her FIR, the woman has said she and Rajgiri had gone to Nepal on December 30 where he taught her several new yoga postures. They returned to Dehra Dun by bus and took an auto for the remaining 30km journey.        
	But the Babas behaviour became somewhat strange. He kept howling at me, she said in the complaint.        
	Kasnovat said she had not expected Rajgiri to be carrying a bottle of acid. Over a dispute he sprayed acid on my face. I cannot say if the attack was premeditated, she said.        
	After the attack, Rajgiri fled to his ashram and the auto driver brought Kasnovat to the hospital.        
	The Spaniard had come to India three years ago and, attracted to Indian mysticism and yoga, became Rajgiris disciple, police said.        
	She will return to her country with gross physical scars, a doctor at the hospital said. The Spanish embassy has contacted the hospital and made enquiries about Kasnovat.        
	Some 200 foreign women are learning yoga in Rishikesh now. The town became a fashionable destination for westerners after a visit to Mahesh Yogis ashram by the four Beatles in the late 1960s.

	Mumbai, May 3: The court that has convicted Ajmal Kasab named Laskhar-e-Toiba founder Hafiz Saeed and 19 other Pakistanis as conspirators, saying the attack was plotted in Pakistan.        
	Judge M.L. Tahaliyani said at least 20 of the 35 wanted Pakistanis had direct involvement, basing his conclusion on Kasabs 42-page confession and corroborative evidence furnished by the prosecution.        
	In his confession, Kasab had described the hatching of the plot and the arms training the gunmen received. He had named Saeed and Lashkar operative Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi as the masterminds and Abu Hamza, Abu Kaahfa and Abu al Kama as the handlers. India has repeatedly asked Pakistan to deport Saeed.        
	He (Kasab) has graphically narrated the whole thing. He spoke of the training; persons who trained him; he spoke of the leader, the Aamir (Saeed). He spoke of Major General Sahab, Tahaliyani said.        
	The prosecution says Major General Sahab is a retired Pakistan army general who attended the terrorists training. Among others the court named were Mujammil alias Yusuf, Abu Fahadullaj, Abu Mavia, Abu Imran and Hakim Sahib. The court had earlier issued non-bailable warrants against 27 of the Pakistanis.        
	The judge accepted the testimony of the FBI witnesses  Nokia and Yamaha representatives who said the gunmens mobiles and the out-boat machine of their dinghy were bought in Pakistan, and the Callphonex VoIP service providers statement that the calls between the handlers and the gunmen were paid for from Pakistan. Tahaliyani also went by call data records and accepted expert analysis of the gunmens GPS sets.

	Guwahati/Nagaon, Dec. 27: Cardiac surgeon Ramakant Panda, who had conducted a heart surgery on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last year, was injured in a road accident on his way to Kaziranga National Park this afternoon.        
	He was shifted to Guwahati in the evening after being given first aid at Nagaon civil hospital.         
	The principal and chief superintendent of Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, M.M. Deka, said Panda had suffered minor injuries in the head and a leg.         
	He is okay. A special team of doctors is conducting investigations on all those injured in the accident, Deka added.         
	The driver has been shifted to the emergency ICU of the hospital. He has an abdominal injury. His condition is serious but has not deteriorated, Deka said.         
	The accident took place near Down Town Resort at Samaguri in Nagaon district while Panda and his family were on their way to Kaziranga.         
	The cardiac surgeon, who treated chief minister Tarun Gogoi this year, was accompanied by his wife, daughter Sanel, 18, son Swasat, 20, and a relative.         
	Panda, Swasat and the driver, Ravi Sonar, were airlifted to Guwahati.         
	Sources said the vehicle in which the family was travelling hit a truck head on.         
	Sonar said, I made all possible attempts to save my car and even braked hard but failed to prevent the mishap.         
	Nagaon deputy commissioner M. Angamuthu said Panda had a minor scalp injury, swelling in the leg and clavicle fracture, which, too, was minor. His CT scan report was normal, he added.         
	He kept telling us that he did not have any injury and the driver should get better treatment. He left his bed and rushed to the driver to ask about his injuries, said Ranjan Goswami, a senior surgeon.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jhargram, June 6: At two this morning, some 250 people marched through a part of Jhargram town, forced at gunpoint by Maoists.        
	Herded out of their homes, the villagers had no option but to obey the guerrillas flaunting their might 1.5km from a police station where babus from Calcutta and Delhi often deliberate on Maoist combat.        
	They made us walk for about a kilometre. Then they told us to return home, said Anadi Maity, 42, a small farmer at Bhalukkhulia. Please dont publish my name, he pleaded.        
	All names of villagers in the report have been changed.        
	Police said around 150 Maoists and members of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities had raided the area in search of a CPM local committee member. Not finding him at home, they decided to create a fear psychosis among the other residents, said Praveen Tripathi, the superintendent of the newly created Jhargram police district.         
	He refused to answer when asked why his force took an hour to travel the 1.5km. Villagers had called up the Jhargram police station within minutes of the raid.        
	An officer who did not want to be named said the police needed time to prepare for a possible confrontation with the Maoists.        
	When the police reached the area early this morning, there was little to tell what had happened there a while before. The streets were deserted, the frightened villagers had scurried back home.        
	 I was sleeping when I heard a commotion outside a little after 1.30am, said Ram Singh of Chandabila. I saw a large group of men, their faces covered. Some of them were armed. They did not damage my home but forced me at gunpoint to join a march they were taking out in the localities.        
	Before they began the operation, at Balaramdihi in Ward 1 of Jhargram municipality, about 180km from Calcutta, the Maoists had cut off power supply to the area, switching off the junction boxes.         
	Villagers said the guerrillas accused the 40-year-old CPM leader of organising resistance against the Peoples Committee.        
	Realising that the man had fled, they ransacked his single-storey house and torched his motorcycle, parked in the courtyard. Then they attacked several neighbouring houses, breaking the tiles on the roofs and windows.         
	The rampaging rebels then went to Chandabila and Bhalukkhulia.        
	This is the most audacious Maoist raid in Jhargram in recent months. The rebels had killed a Jharkhand Party (Naren) member on the fringes of the town in May after branding him a police informer.         
	Hours after last nights raid, the police set up pickets in the area.        
	Lalgarh murder        
	A Lalgarh CPM branch committee member was killed outside his brother-in-laws ration shop in Bankura last night.         
	Two motorcycle-borne men shot at Nirmal Kumar Singh, 48, thrice. He died on the way to a health centre.        
	Scared of the Maoists, Singh had fled his home at Kanchandanga village in Lalgarh about seven months ago and had been living with his in-laws since.

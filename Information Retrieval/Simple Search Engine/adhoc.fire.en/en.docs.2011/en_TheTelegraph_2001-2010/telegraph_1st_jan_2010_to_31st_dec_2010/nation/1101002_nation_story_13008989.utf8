The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong gets minority jitters
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong gets minority jitters
  - Party worried about fallout in Bihar        SANJAY K. JHA                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: The UPA government may have begun to breathe easy after the initial peaceful response to the Ayodhya verdict but the Congress is preparing to grapple with perceived dormant Muslim anger which could affect its poll prospects in at least Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.        
	Several Congress functionaries feel that apart from the Muslim on the street, party leaders and workers from the community are feeling cheated by the verdict.        
	Although general secretary Digvijay Singh appealed to the minorities not to link the court verdict with politics, many Muslim leaders of the party admitted in private conversations that there was extreme anguish among the people and they were holding the Congress responsible.        
	One leader told The Telegraph: Ordinary Muslims feel the Congress had betrayed the community since the very beginning on the Ayodhya issue and this was the culmination. The Congress should now abandon the dream of revival by the 2014 parliamentary election.        
	Another middle-rung Muslim said: The RSS and the Congress almost spoke the same language yesterday. The whole community feels the judgment was not given on legal merit and the disappointment is mainly with the Congress. They believe at least something should have been said about the anti-Muslim campaign and demolition of 1992. Ordinary Muslims are saying our mosque was demolished and they are now having a sense of vindication.        
	The comment reflects the challenge before the Congress. First, by default of being in power, ruling parties get associated with judicial pronouncements, although the executive and judiciary have separate roles. Somehow, the Congress will have to find a way to get the message across that it had nothing to do with the judicial process  an unenviable task as it would fuel further speculation and invite charges that the party is washing its hands of minority concerns.        
	Second, the judgment does refer to the demolition. But since the verdict is voluminous, not many seem to have noticed it. The party will have to make the general minority population aware of such fineprint, for which a well-oiled organisational machinery  something the Congress lacks in the heartland  is needed.        
	Digvijay tried to address one grievance today, asserting that the crime of the demolition cannot be diluted and those involved should be given strongest punishment. Union home minister P. Chidambaram echoed the sentiments.        
	Yesterday, no Congress leader tried to raise this point  perhaps keeping in mind persistent appeals for restraint  and the Sangh parivars celebratory assertions went unchallenged.        
	Digvijay today said: The demolition is a separate case. There cannot be any sense of vindication. Everybody, including L.K. Advani, who is an accused, should be treated as per law.         
	The Congress, which had an abnormally high number of Muslim candidates for the Bihar election on the first list, included 13 Muslims in the second list of 46 candidates. But party leaders were circumspect, not contesting suggestions that the chances of revival in Bihar had receded considerably.         
	One senior AICC functionary said: It is too early to say. We know Muslims are upset but that is the initial response.        
	Although the regular party briefing had been cancelled, Digvijay answered questions, contending that the Congress never played politics over Ayodhya while the BJP continued to politicise it.        
	He referred to the statements of Ravi Shankar Prasad, who asked Muslims to give up their claim, and described it as very offensive. Asked whether the verdict was based on faith or facts, he said: We respect the court judgment.        
	Asked if the Congress expected the government to initiate any process of reconciliation for an out-of-court settlement, he said: Why only the government? Every side should try to work for a compromise. We will do whatever we can.         
	Asked about a time frame, he said: If a consensus can be reached within the next three months, there will be no need to go to the Supreme Court.         
	He said: A court verdict will go against somebody and in favour of somebody but in this issue, we should not do politics. We should close this chapter by evolving a consensus.

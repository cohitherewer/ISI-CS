          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Mahinda Rajapaksa      
	New Delhi, Oct. 15: Sri Lanka has sought Indias help to carry out its plan of teaching three languages to its schoolchildren: Sinhala, Tamil and English.        
	The plan is aimed at bridging the divide between Tamils and the Sinhalese in the island nation, which recently emerged from a 25-year ethnic conflict.        
	Visiting Sri Lankan foreign minister G.L. Peiris today met human resource development minister Kapil Sibal and requested Indias help in developing the Tamil and English curricula and textbooks, and in teacher training.        
	Sri Lanka wants to create a pool of teachers in the Tamil and English languages who will be recruited in government schools across the country. It expects India to send trainers to help create this pool.        
	Sri Lanka has submitted a proposal for a tri-lingual formula in its school education system. We will help them.... We will send a team next month to Colombo to study how to help them, Sibal said.        
	A ministry official said: Now the medium of instruction is Sinhala in (government) schools in Sinhalese-majority areas, and Tamil in schools in areas having more Tamil people. Introduction of three languages will mitigate the divide.        
	Besides, Colombo hopes that the introduction of English in government schools would help Sri Lankan students compete better with those from other countries.        
	Sunimal Fernando, adviser to President Mahinda Rajapaksa, had last year led a team to India to discuss the three-language plan, which is to be implemented over 10 years.        
	The Indian team that will visit Colombo next month will include experts from the Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysore, and officials from the foreign and human resource development ministries. It will suggest how India can help Sri Lanka carry out its planned school curricula reform.        
	India had helped set up a Sri Lanka-India Centre for English Language Training in Kandy, an official said. Nearly 2,000 Sri Lankan students now study in Indian institutions.

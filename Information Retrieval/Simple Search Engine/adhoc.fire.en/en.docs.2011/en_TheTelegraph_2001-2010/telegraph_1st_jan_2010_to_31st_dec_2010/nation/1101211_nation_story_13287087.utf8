                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Radia tapes: iffy leak finger at service provider
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; PTI                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: The government today raised almost in passing the possibility that the contents of the Niira Radia tapes could have been leaked by a cellphone service provider, offering a fascinating, albeit fleeting, peep into the unnerving business of phone-tapping.        
	The income tax department has no powers with regard to the service provider and if it is established that any service provider was responsible for the unauthorised supply of the information, the ministry of telecommunications or any other competent (authority) will have to take further action, said a government affidavit filed in the Supreme Court.        
	The department was not responsible for the leak, the Centre told the Supreme Court in an affidavit in response to Ratan Tatas plea for privacy. The tapes feature purported conversations Radia had with journalists, industrialists and politicians.        
	This is the first time the government is formally, though indirectly, mooting the possibility of the involvement of a service provider. Sources said at least one of the phone lines Radia was using then was operated by a well-established GSM player.        
	The affidavit also said the income tax department shared copies of the tapes  the originals are now with the Supreme Court  with the Intelligence Bureau and the CBI.        
	Tata, whose purported conversations also are on the tapes, has been accusing a politically well-connected lobby of entrenched operators of running a campaign against him.        
	The affidavit shed light on the sweep as well as tenacity of the eavesdroppers and what prompted the government to pick out Radia. It quoted a tax official as saying some of the conversations were quite sensitive.        
	According to the affidavit, 14 phone lines of Radia and her associates were placed under surveillance and conversations were recorded on 180 days in installments of 60 days each.         
	The first 60-day bracket began on August 20, 2008, which was extended from October 19 for another 60 days. Another round of surveillance was ordered for 60 days from May 11, when the UPA about to launch its second innings.         
	The CBI was handed over no less than 1,450 call records containing about 100 hours of conversations between May 12, 2009, and July 9, 2009. Later in May 2010, the CBI was handed over a copy of the entire recording consisting of about 5,800 calls on the telephone of Radia for the period from August 20, 2008, to July 9, 2009.        
	The affidavit then said the first report on Radias tape had appeared in the media in April 2010  a month before the CBI got custody of the full copy.        
	The government said the conversations were recorded as part of the surveillance ordered by the directorate general of income tax (investigation) following a complaint received by the finance minister on November 16, 2007, alleging that Radia had within a short span of nine years built a business empire worth Rs 300 crore. It was also alleged that she was an agent of foreign intelligence agencies.        
	Never in the past had any electronic intercepts made by the income tax department appeared in the media, the eight-page government affidavit said. Nevertheless an inquiry is in progress and there is no reason to believe that the telephone intercepts have been leaked from the income tax department.        
	The Tata Group chairman had sought a court directive to the government to prevent further leak of personal information.        
	But the government listed practical difficulties in preventing the publication of the transcripts. It is not possible or practical for the government to take steps to retrieve the various copies of some of the transcripts which have appeared in the print media or in the electronic media and which are being circulated on the Internet, the affidavit said.        
	On the affidavit, a spokesperson for the Radia-owned Vaishnavi Communication said the matter was sub judice and added: There are corporate vested interests which circulated an inadmissible and forged letter with malicious, baseless and derogatory content in November 2007. As responsible corporate, neither we nor our promoter have ever indulged in any anti-national activities.

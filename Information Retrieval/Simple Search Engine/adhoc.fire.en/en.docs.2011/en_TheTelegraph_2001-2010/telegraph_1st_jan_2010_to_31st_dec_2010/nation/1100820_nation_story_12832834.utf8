	New Delhi, Aug. 19: A Group of Ministers (GoM), headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, has decided that the Opposition will be consulted for its views on the modalities of including caste in Census 2011.          
	The GoM that met this evening was of the view that unless there was a consensus on the methodology and timing of the caste headcount it was expedient to not embark on the exercise. The GoM in its last meeting had decided to recommend caste enumeration to the Union cabinet.

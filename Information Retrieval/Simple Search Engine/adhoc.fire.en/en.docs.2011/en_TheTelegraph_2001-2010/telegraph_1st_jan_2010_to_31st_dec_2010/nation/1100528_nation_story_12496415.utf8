                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Karat lesson for Mamata 
  - Pranab asks Trinamul leader not to make CPMs mistake        OUR BUREAU                          Pranab Mukherjee in Ranaghat on Thursday. Telegraph picture.                                        
	May 27: State Congress president Pranab Mukherjee today warned Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee against making Prakash Karats mistake: withdrawing support to the UPA.        
	If we could complete the first term of the UPA with 147 Congress MPs, we can also complete the present term with 207 MPs. So dont make a mistake like Prakash Karat, Mukherjee told a campaign meeting at Ranaghat in Nadia this evening. However, at no point in his speech did Mukherjee name either Mamata or Trinamul.        
	Mukherjees remarks were seen as a rebuttal of Mamatas threat yesterday to go it alone.        
	 I am a veteran in parliamentary politics and not a three-season wonder, Mukherjee said, slinging colloquial barbs in the last leg of the campaign. At one point, the Congress leader, who had wondered aloud two days ago whether other parties should cut grass, today referred to the fish market.        
	Does an alliance mean that a party will have to fold up? We wanted an alliance on honourable terms. We did not go haggling in the market over the price of prawn, said Mukherjee.        
	He advised Mamata to speak to the Prime Minister if she had any problem. We had a seat adjustment in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls and they (Trinamul) got a cabinet berth and six ministers of state. If you are facing any problem, speak to the Prime Minister instead of talking to the media, Mukherjee said.        
	The Minister said that in the 2001 Assembly polls, Mamata broke her alliance with the NDA and entered into a poll pact with the Congress.         
	The Congress went in for a poll pact with her and agreed to contest only 59 seats. We did not give nomination to 16 sitting MLAs. But when she could not win, she again went back to the NDA.        
	In last years Lok Sabha polls, our workers helped her. Now we are being told that the situation has changed. I want to see how the situation has changed. In the municipal polls, I want to see whether she can win without our help, said Mukherjee.        
	In Calcutta, Mamata continued her tirade against the Congress without naming the party.        
	The Left Fronts alternative in Bengal is Trinamul. So, dont waste your vote because those who are in the middle (Congress) are there to strengthen the CPMs hand, Mamata told a meeting in Behala. You (the Congress) remain in Delhi, we will bid the CPM adieu in Bengal. But we will not keep quiet if you help the CPM go forward.        
	Mamata said Trinamul was not with the UPA because of the Congress. We are with the UPA because people want us. We made a commitment before the Lok Sabha polls that we will remain with the UPA and we are keeping it, she added.

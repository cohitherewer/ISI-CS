          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                  
	BJP not to yield on number of seats in Bihar                                  
	Patna, July 15: The BJP has made it clear to ally JD (U) that it would not settle for anything less than 103 seats in the coming Assembly elections in the state.         
	The party might have allowed chief minister Nitish Kumar to have his way on the Narendra Modi issue, but it seems adamant about retaining the 103 seats it contested in the last Assembly elections.        
	There may be some exchange of seats between the BJP and the JD(U). We are sure of contesting at least 103 seats out of 243 in Bihar, said state party chief C.P. Thakur.        
	The BJP had contested 103 seats against 137 of the JD(U) in 2005 Assembly polls.         
	But there is a lurking fear in BJP circles that Nitish, known as a hard bargainer, can mount pressure on the BJP leadership to yield more seats to the JD(U) after winning the battle of nerves on the Narendra Modi issue.        
	According to sources, the JD(U) leaders are talking of sparing only 85 to 90 seats to the BJP in view of the delimitation exercise that changed the demographic and geographical profile of the constituencies.         
	But the BJP state chief reiterated: We can exchange a few seats keeping in mind the suitability in the wake of the delimitation. But we will never settle for anything less than 103 seats.        
	In the 2005 Assembly polls, Nitish took away the Kishenganj Lok Sabha constituency from the BJPs share. Ironically, the JD(U) lost the seat to the Congress. The defeat has, in a way, strengthened the BJPs campaign to not give away its prized seats to the ally.        
	In course of his visit to New Delhi yesterday, Nitish met a few senior leaders of the BJP  Arun Jaitely and Anantha Kumar  and informally discussed the seat sharing issue. But none of them divulged the content of discussions.

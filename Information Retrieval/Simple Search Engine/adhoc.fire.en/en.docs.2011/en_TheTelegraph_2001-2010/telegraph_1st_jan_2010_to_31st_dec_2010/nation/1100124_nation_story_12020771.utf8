          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          RED ALERT                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 23: A day after Orissa and two other states decided to launch a joint operation against Maoists, the rebels blew up a passenger jeep, killing four civilians and abducted three persons in two Naxalite-hit districts.        
	The rebels blew up a jeep carrying 14 people, including 10 policemen, by triggering a landmine blast near Jogipallur village in Koraput district, about 500km from here, around 7am.        
	Four civilians were killed in the blast. However, all policemen are safe, even though six of them sustained injuries, deputy inspector-general of police (south western range) Sanjeev Panda said.        
	The policemen were on their way back to camp after conducting search operations in the area.        
	The deceased persons were identified as Uday Tadingi, Kaushalya Kuisika, Jyoti Mahanandia and Kumudini Suna.         
	The vehicle was badly damaged in the blast.        
	Combing operation was going on to arrest the Maoists, Panda said.        
	In two related incidents, a group of about 50 rebels, including 10 women cadres, blew up a BSNL mobile tower at Machhkund in the same district a little after midnight. They also damaged the Machhkund tehsil office. Road communication between Machhkund and Lamtaput was disrupted as the ultras blocked the road by felling trees.        
	The engine of a passenger train was derailed last night between Bhansi and Bacheli station under Visakhapatnam division, as the Maoists had removed railway tracks. However, no casualty was reported.         
	In Sundergarh district, about 50 rebels abducted three persons, including a zilla parishad member, from a dhaba at Jamudihi village under K. Balang on Orissa-Jharkhand border last midnight. The abducted persons  zilla parishad member Anand Masih Haro, dhaba owner Haridas Mundari and his brother Narendra Mundari  were yet to be traced. Combing operations were on to locate them, Rourkela superintendent of police Diptesh Patnaik said over phone.        
	The extremists had looted the shop of abducted Narendra Mundari, taken away two motorcycles and left behind a few anti-government posters.        
	All these incidents took place ahead of an economic blockade called by the CPI(Maoist) on January 25 and Orissa bandh on January 26, demanding immediate release of Subhashri, alias Saswati Panda, wife of Orissas most wanted Maoist leader Sabyasachi Panda.

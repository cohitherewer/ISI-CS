The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In-house backlash on haughty duo
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      In-house backlash on haughty duo
  - Personal opposition to PC, Sibal tells on enemy property and study tribunal legislation        SANJAY K. JHA                          Keshava Rao                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: Making a law requires legal and political acumen. In the Congress, it needs plotting and politicking, too.        
	Two bills  the education tribunal bill and the enemy property bill  that could not be passed in the just-concluded monsoon session have exposed the disarray in the government and the party.        
	The dominant feeling is that the government was left red-faced on the bills because of the arrogance of the ministers concerned  human resource minister Kapil Sibal and home minister P. Chidambaram.        
	A senior minister told The Telegraph: The education tribunal bill fell in the Rajya Sabha not because of its contents but because of opposition to the minister. The opposition was less legislative, more personal.        
	Sources said what was surprising is Kapil Sibal himself believes the bill was opposed because of personal reasons and he had conveyed as much to the Prime Minister. Congressmen said there were many in the party who want to cut ministers to size.        
	K. Keshava Rao, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs who took the lead in demolishing the bill, however, asserted the opposition was strictly on merit and there was no personal or political motive.        
	But many leaders did not endorse this claim in private conversations. They said Sibals domineering attitude and tendency to rebuff suggestions had created a situation where many MPs wanted to teach him a lesson. Sibal is said to be adamant still and refusing to review the bill.        
	Sources said speculation that Sibals refusal to accept the recommendations of the standing committee  which includes Rahul Gandhi as a member  prompted a backlash from Congress MPs was not entirely true. But the fact that Keshava Rao has not been rebuked is a measure of the majority view in the party.        
	While general secretary Janardan Dwivedi defended Rao saying there was democracy in the party, parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal said: The essence of democracy is that MPs express their views. Bansal rebutted the charge that opposition to the bill reflected poor floor management, a charge levelled by Sibal.        
	The enemy property bill, too, fully demonstrated Congress intrigues. Sources said minority affairs minister Salman Khursheed was compelled to politick when Chidambaram refused to listen to his views, saying the matter did not fall in his ministrys domain.        
	Khursheeds views were not entertained even after he made the Prime Minister tell Chidambaram to discuss the issue with him. Party leaders cite this as an illustration of intellectual arrogance that Digvijay Singh has talked about.        
	Sources said Khursheed approached Sonia Gandhi and took M.A.M Khan, the Raja of Mehmoodabad whose property worth thousands of crores was at stake, to her. Khan narrated his story to Sonia but she refused to intervene, telling Khursheed to sort out the matter with Chidambaram.        
	Khursheed had to finally mount pressure on the Prime Minister by virtually gheraoing him along with 20 MPs, including Muslim leaders from different parties. Only after this did Chidambaram agree to make amendments.        
	In normal circumstances, this would have become a big issue but the Congress is too busy to analyse parliamentary pitfalls. It is now in celebration mode as Sonia is about to be elected president for a record fourth term. The last date for filing nominations is tomorrow and she would be declared elected unopposed the day after.        
	No nomination has been filed so far but several will be filed tomorrow, all in her favour. In addition to Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee, most Congress chief ministers, state unit chiefs and senior leaders are expected to file different sets of nominations for her.         
	 Party sources expect at least 50 nominations to be filed in her favour. She faced a challenge only once in 2000 when the late Jitendra Prasada unsuccessfully fought against her.

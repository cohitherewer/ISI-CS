	Islamabad, Nov. 20 (PTI): Pakistani Bollywood fans scored over their Indian counterparts for the first time when Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Guzaarish was screened in that country two days ahead of its home release.         
	Guzaarish, starring Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai, was released in Pakistan on November 17, becoming the first Hindi film to be released in Pakistan before in India.         
	The movie was set for release in both countries on November 19 but Pakistani cinema owners began screening it earlier to coincide with Id celebrated on November 17.         
	The film was initially set for release on November 12 but was delayed by a week. Exhibitors in Pakistan, who had already obtained prints of the film, decided to release it on Id.

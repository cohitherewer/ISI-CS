The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | No tape probe by home, says PC 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      No tape probe by home, says PC 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          P Chidambaram      
	New Delhi, Nov. 30: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today distanced himself from the Niira Radia tape probe a day after his ministry said that it had asked the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and the intelligence bureau to investigate into the leak.        
	Chidambaram said it was not his ministry but the CBDT that had ordered the tapping and was now conducting the probe into the leak of the tapes. There is some misunderstanding. We have not ordered an inquiry. We have learnt that the CBDT is inquiring into the matter. It was the CBDT which had ordered the interceptions and it is looking into the alleged leakage of the tapes, he said.         
	A home ministry release yesterday titled MHA (ministry of home) inputs said: MHA has asked IB and CBDT to probe the leakage of tapes concerning Niira Radia.         
	A ministry official also said yesterday that the probe directive had nothing to do with Tata Group chief Ratan Tata moving the Supreme Court with a petition contending the leaking of the tapes infringed upon his fundamental right to privacy. This is just a coincidence that the order has been issued today. The decision to order a probe had been taken several days ago, the official said yesterday.        
	In the Lok Sabha today, minister of state for home Ajay Makens written reply said tapping telephones of any individual was permissible under Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act. Maken did not take names but the message could be for Tata.        
	The ministers reply added: To ensure that the power to intercept is utilised in a strict legal manner, an institutional mechanism exists at the Centre and at the state level, to both, authorise interception and to conduct an oversight of the power so exercised.         
	Maken said only the Union home secretary at the national level and the state home secretary at the state level could allow interception of messages in the interest of public safety or sovereignty, the integrity of India, security of the states, public order or for preventing incitement to commission of an offence.         
	He added: These decisions are further subject to review by an oversight committee headed by the cabinet secretary for the Union of India. Thus, such monitoring as may be necessary to fight crime for national security or for counter-terrorism efforts is subject to multiple checks and oversight.

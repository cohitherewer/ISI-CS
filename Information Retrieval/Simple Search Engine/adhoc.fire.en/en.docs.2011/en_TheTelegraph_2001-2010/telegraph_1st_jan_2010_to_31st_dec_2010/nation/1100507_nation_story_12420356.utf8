                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Anti-Maoist cop schools in Bengal
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 6: Director-general of police Bhupinder Singh today said three schools would be set up in Bengal to impart counter-insurgency training.        
	The schools will be set up by the state government and funded by the Centre, Singh said.        
	Two of the training schools will come up in Maoist-hit West Midnapore and Purulia and the other in north Bengal, where there are forests.        
	Singh said that a few months ago, the then state chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti and the then home secretary Ardhendu Sen had requested Union home secretary G. K. Pillai to help set up such schools in the state.         
	The Centre has agreed to the proposal and has asked the state government to select possible locations for establishing the schools.         
	We had been waiting for the Centres nod in this regard. Now that we have got it, work has begun for selecting the sites, especially where forest areas are available. Strict vigil will have to be maintained on the quality of training imparted in these schools as counter-insurgency operations have become vital now, Singh said.        
	He said such schools had been set up in other Maoist-affected states like Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Chattisgarh.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: A Bengal environment activist today requested the Supreme Court not to allow IPL matches under floodlights as it meant extravagant wastage of energy and night matches also increased the risk of terror attacks.        
	Subhas Dutta, who has been waging a battle to ban smoke-belching vehicles from Calcuttas streets, said day matches would mean less global warming and also reduce noise pollution.        
	A public interest petition filed by Dutta and his Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samity said power cuts were common to all parts of the country. It is, therefore, a better and wiser option to fix the schedule of the matches exclusively during day hours. This can help avoid the extravagant wastage of electrical power, the PIL said.        
	Moreover, the probability of extremists attacks is more during night hours and there is the added difficulty in security arrangements after dusk, it said. The petition also said all costs  electricity, stadium, security arrangements  of holding such matches should be recovered from the BCCI as the cricket board was a private body.

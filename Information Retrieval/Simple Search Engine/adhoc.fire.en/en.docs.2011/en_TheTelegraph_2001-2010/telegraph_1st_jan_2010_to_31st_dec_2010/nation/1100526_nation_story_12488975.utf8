The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Storm buffets, job drought uproots
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Storm buffets, job drought uproots
										      RITH BASU       A YEAR AFTER AILA                        The top layer of a field in Khulna, in Sandeshkhali I, is still covered with salt. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha				                                 
	Hingalganj (North 24-Parganas), May 25: Tero number (No. 13) Sandeler Bil is a village of elderly people, children and the infirm.        
	The 2,000-odd residents of the village in Hingalganj block of the Sunderbans depend on remittances from their younger kin, including children of school-going age, who left in search of a livelihood after Aila wreaked havoc.        
	Following widespread flooding of farmlands with saline water, farming in the Sunderbans has taken a hit and incomes from agriculture  around Rs 520 crore annually  have dwindled by 15 to 20 per cent. Production in fisheries, which used to generate around Rs 100 crore every year, has plunged too.        
	Unless somebody from the family leaves the Sunderbans and starts earning elsewhere, a family will starve, said Gopal Biswas of Sandeler Bil. He adds that of the villages over 1,200 working-age people, 700 have left in search of livelihood.         
	People from this village can be seen anywhere and everywhere, Biswas said. From a flourmill in the Andamans to a construction site in Rajarhat and from a jewellery-designing unit in Bangalore to a remote village in Tamil Nadu  skilled and unskilled workers from the Sunderbans have fanned out across Bengal and beyond.        
	Biswas, who himself had gone to Bheralpeti village in Tamil Nadus Karur for work, has come back because of failing health. But not his 14-year-old son Soumitra, who stayed on in the southern state to earn for the family.        
	According to the Bengal governments Sunderbans affairs department, of the 3.19 lakh hectares of farmland in the area, 1 lakh hectares had been affected by Aila; over 50,000 hectares have not yielded any crop after Aila.        
	The condition of the fisheries is worse, salt water having contaminated both sweet- water ponds and flooded salt- water bheries (fisheries) near embankments. After Aila, the flourishing fishing industry in the Sunderbans has been crushed and we have not been able to get it back on track, said fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda.        
	With the two major sources of income for more than 90 peer cent of the Sunderbans people almost drying up, migration is the biggest truth. The families of those who have left have had to face several problems.         
	But Swapna Mondol, 32, who lives in Sandeler Bil, said the harsh realities of life had taught her to live alone. My husband is in Tamil Nadu. Its true that living alone with only my kids is difficult and at times, I get scared as well. But we cant afford such feelings as feeding our children is a bigger concern, she said.        
	The exodus effect can be seen in the long queues in front of banks and post offices to collect the money sent by family members working outside. There is a long queue whenever I go to withdraw money from the Hingalganj Uco Bank branch, said Swapna. Her husband changed the remittance mode from money order to bank deposit as the post office was more crowded.        
	With several people not having bank accounts, some middlemen have devised an innovative way to earn money. Someone elses account is used to transfer the money against a commission of around 10 per cent. Then the money is delivered at the doorstep of the recipient, who doesnt have an account, said an employee of a public sector bank in the Sunderbans.        
	Economist Aviroop Sarkar is not surprised by the migration. According to him, the government has to get the infrastructure back on track to create alternative employment options quickly to ensure the migrants come back. The first six months can be very tough for those making the move from villages but then you get used to it so much that you dont want to go back, said Sarkar.        
	Government officials claim that 778km of embankments damaged by Aila were repaired and compensation packages worth Rs 10,000 offered to people whose homes had been flattened. But breaches in the embankments belie the first claim. In the second, it is difficult to trace the beneficiaries of the government largesse.        
	We do keep getting information of an exodus of workers. But that can happen in the face of a calamity of such proportions (Aila). We are trying to get people work through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGA), which has been a success in the Sunderbans, said North 24-Parganas DM Binod Kumar.        
	But Swapan Bhuniya of the Trinamul Congress-run Sehara gram panchayat in Radhanagar disputes the claim. He alleged that he had worked for 70 days under the central scheme but did not receive full payment. I know that it is madness to stay on an embankment in this season of norwesters. If I had received the Rs 2,000 due since March, I could take my family and think of starting life elsewhere, Swapan said, glancing at the swelling Dansa river. Those close to the ruling party always get paid in time, he added.         
	The panchayat member from his area, Namita Mandal, denied the charge. We try to co-ordinate with the district officials to make the list as flawless as possible and include members of the families worst affected by the cyclone. There are discrepancies sometimes but that has nothing to do with political leanings.        
	A senior district official told The Telegraph that the discrepancies could be traced to the supervisors, who often did not make the entries in the job cards of the workers, such as in the case of Mahadeb Bhuniya, 25, of Atapur. I worked for around 70 days but got paid for only 50 days. There is confusion because thats the way they want it. I feel cheated, he said.         
	There isnt a single entry in his job card but his bank passbook shows payments which were supposed to be on the basis of job card entries.        
	Joly Chaudhuri, the NREGAs nodal officer in North 24-Parganas, acknowledged that both the supervision and the process of disbursement of funds needed improvement. We are holding meetings at different levels to streamline the process.        
	According to Sunderbans expert Tushar Kanjilal, the government has done practically nothing worthwhile in the past 12 months by way of disaster management. They should have sent out their agriculture scientists into the fields to give tips to the farmers on how to test the salinity of their soil and reduce it, said Kanjilal.        
	The cyclone of May 25, 2009, had killed over 150 people and affected one and all in Sunderbans. But septuagenarian Arabinda Kumar Mandal, an ailing bachelor, believes he is one of the worst sufferers. I was the owner of a two-bigha plot where landless labourers worked. And now, I have to live on a portion of a relatives hut and depend on them for food because my house was destroyed by Aila and the land has turned barren, said Mandal. I would be glad to have died that day (when Aila struck) he sighed.

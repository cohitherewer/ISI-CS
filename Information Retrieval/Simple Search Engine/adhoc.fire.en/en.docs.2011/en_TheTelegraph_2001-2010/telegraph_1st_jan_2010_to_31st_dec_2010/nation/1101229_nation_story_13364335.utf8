	New Delhi, Dec. 28: The CBSE has asked the management of a Kerala school to take action against its principal for issuing a transfer certificate to a Muslim student because she was wearing a headscarf.        
	The school board has warned the management of the Believers Church English Medium School at Gurupuram Avalookkunnu in Alappuzha district to ensure such mistakes are not repeated.        
	Sources said the school management had suspended principal Mary Jessintha and started departmental proceedings which could lead to termination from service.        
	An inquiry committee visited the school and conducted a thorough probe, a source said. It said the action violates affiliation rules that say no school should discriminate any student on the basis of caste, creed or religion.        
	The CBSE then asked the school to take action against its principal. It also issued a warning to the school not to repeat such mistakes in future.        
	The CBSE committee found that many Muslim girls were allowed to wear headscarves. The school administration failed to justify its discriminatory action. The Kerala government, which conducted a separate inquiry, also found a discrepancy in the decision.        
	The student was about to be promoted to class X and was allegedly issued a transfer certificate earlier this year.

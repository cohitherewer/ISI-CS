          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 23: The Supreme Court today threw out a women panels appeal against a lesser sentence to a rape convict who cleared the IAS, saying a third party could not contest verdicts in a criminal case.        
	Only the prosecuting agency or the complainant can file an appeal, the court said, adding there was no scope for a third party.        
	The order came despite the fact that an apex bench headed by former Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan had admitted the appeal.        
	The law mandates a minimum of seven years for rape but also allows the court to exercise its discretion to allow a lesser sentence, an apex court bench of Justices H.S. Bedi and B.S. Chauhan said today. Anyway, the conviction (for rape) stands, the bench observed, refusing to hear out National Commission for Women counsel Priya Hingorani.        
	The panel had appealed a Delhi High Court verdict last year that said the convict had redeemed himself by qualifying for the IAS while behind bars.         
	Ashok Rai, 29, had repeatedly raped his 21-year-old student, Sunita, and promised her marriage. When he backtracked on his promise, she committed suicide. The high court cleared him of the charge of abetment saying Sunita was 21 and aware of what she was doing.        
	The prosecuting agency in this case, Delhi police, had filed an affidavit saying they did not agree with the high court reasoning  qualifying for the IAS  for reducing the sentence but would not file a formal appeal.

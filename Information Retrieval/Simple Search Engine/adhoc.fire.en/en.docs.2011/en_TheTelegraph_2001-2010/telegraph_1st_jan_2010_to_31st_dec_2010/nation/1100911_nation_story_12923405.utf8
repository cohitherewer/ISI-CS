The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Id message of restraint
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Id message of restraint
  - Focus on conciliation ahead of Ayodhya verdict        RASHEED KIDWAI                                    
	Sept. 10: The call is for restraint as Muslims across the country prepare to celebrate Id, which coincides with the 9/11 anniversary and comes two weeks before a crucial verdict on the Ayodhya dispute.        
	Mosques in Bhopal, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Delhi, Aligarh and elsewhere today heard imams deliver sermons whose content was conciliatory.        
	Like last Friday, the clergy sought the Almightys help to get a favourable verdict on the Ayodhya dispute. But more significantly, the prayers called for whatever is in the best interests of the community rather than for victory.        
	The community was told to observe restraint, accept the verdict and not to get provoked under any circumstances.        
	For those who had frequented the mosques in November and early December in 1992, there was a subtle shift in the message. Then the focus had been on irrevocability and the need to assert oneself and be counted.        
	The head of the All India Muslim Personal Law board, Maulana Rabey Nadvi, has gone public to insist that the community will accept the court verdict, whatever shape it takes.        
	Nadvi has also chided some within the law board for suggesting negotiations or an out-of-court settlement if the September 24 judgment does not go down too well with everyone.        
	Nadvi, a moderate from the Lucknow-based Nadwa seminary, says virtually every Muslim sect represented in the law board agreed to abide by the verdict when the law board, rather reluctantly, agreed to include the Babri issue in its agenda.        
	Among the Muslim elite, The Messenger  The meaning of the life of Muhammad, a book written by Tariq Ramadan and published by Penguin, is being widely read.        
	Ramadan, a professor of religion, conflict and peace-building at the University of Notre Dame, the US, has explained the relevance of Muhammads teachings in todays pluralistic world.        
	He has cited the Prophets love for his uncle Abu Talib even though Talib would not accept Islam despite the nephews efforts. Ramadan observes that throughout the Prophets life, he established relationships based on trust and respect of principles, and not on religious affiliation.        
	Referring to pluralism, the author says the Prophets covenant with Madianan Jews represents a model to be emulated today.        
	The terms of the covenant were primarily based on the recognition of diverse affiliations and did not demand conversions. The Prophet had met a delegation of Christians from Najran; he invited them to meet, share and live together peacefully.        
	Two weeks ago in Bhopal, a radical group had called for a protest against a small-time pastor in Florida who had announced a provocative move coinciding with Id and the 9/11 anniversary (the pastor withdrew his threat today but did not rule out another change of mind).        
	Bhopal, with its large Muslim population, has a history of violent protests on religious issues, ranging from Salman Rashdies book to a seemingly insignificant scene in the film Gadar where actor Sunny Deol is shown saving a religious text.        
	Call it a sign of maturity, or thank the quick condemnation of the Florida pastors threat by the Obama administration and Christian leaders, the Bhopal protest proved a non-event with not even a crowd of 100 turning up.        
	As Id preparations gather steam in every Muslim household, on peoples lips there is the constant prayer that the country remains safe and secure after September 24.        
	The Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government are already scouting for mediators to reach out to groups involved in the Ayodhya title suit. Mayavati is seeking to beef up security around the temple town.

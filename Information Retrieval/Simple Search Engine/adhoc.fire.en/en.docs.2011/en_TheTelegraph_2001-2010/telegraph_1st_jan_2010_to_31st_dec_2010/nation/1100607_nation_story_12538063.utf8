	New Delhi, June 6: The Supreme Court has said it is the exclusive prerogative of employers to fill up vacancies and courts cannot order recruiting authorities to absorb every candidate who finds a place on the merit list.        
	The top court also cleared the air on the term empanelment, a straw of hope for many of Indias educated jobless, saying it did not amount to a vested right to be appointed.        
	The observations came as the top court upheld an appeal by the Orissa government against a high court directive over recruitment of junior clerks. The high court had ordered the state to appoint all those who had moved the state administrative tribunal for jobs on the ground that they figured on the select list of a test conducted in 1995.        
	It is (the) exclusive prerogative of the employer/state administration to initiate the selection process for filling up vacancies occurred during a particular year, the apex court said.        
	Vacancies may be there but for financial constraints, the state may not be in a position to initiate the selection process for making appointments, the bench added, making it clear that courts or tribunals were not competent to issue directives to initiate selection process and fill up vacancies.        
	The court also said figuring on the merit list did not amount to an absolute right to be appointed.         
	Empanelment at best is a condition of eligibility for purpose of appointment and does not amount to selection or create a vested right to be appointed, it said.        
	The Orissa government had, on June 25, 1995, advertised for 15 posts of junior clerks in Sonepur district. The advertisement said the number of vacancies could be increased.         
	A written test was held but, before the selection process was over, the number of vacancies was increased from 15 to 33 and a merit list of 66 candidates was published on November 6, 1995.        
	After appointments had been made to the 33 posts, some of those not offered jobs since their names were at the bottom of the merit list moved the tribunal.         
	In an April 2000 order, the tribunal directed the state to appoint all the candidates on the list till it was exhausted.        
	The Orissa government appealed to the high court, which modified the order, restricting it to those who had moved the tribunal. The state then appealed to the Supreme Court.        
	State counsel Janaranjan Das argued that vacancies couldnt be filled up over and above the number advertised. Once the advertised vacancies are filled up, the selection process is exhausted and comes to an end, he added.         
	He also argued that rules, in this particular case, said vacancies were to be filled up annually. So the life of the select list, he said, couldnt be more than a year, and once the life of the list expired, no appointment could be offered from the panel prepared.        
	The tribunal and the high court, he argued, had both committed an error in issuing directives to appoint candidates from the unexhausted part of the select list.        
	The apex court upheld his plea. Filling up vacancies over notified vacancies was neither permissible nor desirable, the court said, adding that it amounted to improper exercise of power and should be done only in rare and exceptional circumstances.

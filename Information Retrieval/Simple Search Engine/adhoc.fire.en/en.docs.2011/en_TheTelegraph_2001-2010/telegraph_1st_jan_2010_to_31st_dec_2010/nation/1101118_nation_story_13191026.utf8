The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Boy dies at Lalu rally
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Boy dies at Lalu rally
          AMIT BHELARI                              
	Kochas (Rohtas), Nov. 17: A 11-year-old who chose to visit a Lalu Prasad rally here today while his family was celebrating Id died after a stage collapsed as supporters clambered on to it to watch the leaders chopper take off.        
	Salman Siddiqui, a Class III student, had gone to see Lalu Prasad speak in a local college ground 175km from Patna.         
	The former chief minister spoke for about 15 minutes and had got into the helicopter around 11am when there was a surge from the crowd desperate to get close to the flying machine.         
	The makeshift stage, made of wood planks and bamboo, had been set up barely 20 metres from the helipad. The same dais had been used by cricketer-turned-Congress MP Mohammed Azharuddin two days ago to campaign for the last phase of the Bihar polls on November 20.        
	Sri Ram, a local resident who was among the crowd of about 500 people, recounted the tragedy. The boy was standing next to the stage and wanted to take a closer look at Laluji and the helicopter. Many others were also keen to do so and had jumped onto the dais. Suddenly, the stage started caving in. The structure crashed on him along with the people. People started running helter-skelter and ran over the boy. His head then struck a big stone under the stage.        
	Salman was declared dead at the local hospital. His father Hayat Siddiqui, a cycle mechanic, refused to send his sons body for post-mortem.         
	Salmans grandfather Khalid Siddiqui said the stage had become weak as it was used by Azharuddin and other local Congress leaders on Monday. Politicians give speeches but the poor give up their lives. The stage should have been removed.        
	Salmans uncle Abdul Gaffar Siddiqui did not feel Lalu Prasad was to blame. I dont think its the fault of Lalu Prasad. The blame lies with the administration, which did not take enough measures to control the crowd.        
	Another child injured in the stage collapse is in hospital but out of danger, police said.

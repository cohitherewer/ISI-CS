The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata slams police chief over Eden
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mamata slams police chief over Eden
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 31: Mamata Banerjee today accused Calcutta police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti of submitting a concocted and politically motivated report on the Eden Gardens floodlights fiasco to embarrass state cricket boss Jagmohan Dalmiya at the chief ministers behest.        
	She said the police had overstepped their authority in carrying out the unilateral probe that apparently blames the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) for the lights failure during the recent India-Sri Lanka ODI.        
	The CAB is an autonomous body and Calcutta police have no jurisdiction to probe its affairs to interfere in the CABs affairs, the Trinamul Congress chief said.        
	Why does a city police commissioner get involved in the CABs affairs? Is Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti eyeing a CAB post? This is just going to pollute Bengal cricket.        
	Mamata said the move was a political vendetta against Dalmiya. When Jagmohan Dalmiya defeated Prasun Mukherjee (then police commissioner) in the CAB elections, the chief minister called it the victory of evil over good, she told STAR Ananda.        
	It is unfortunate that whoever defeats the chief minister or his men is branded evil. I feel the police commissioners actions are politically motivated. This is nothing but a calculated attempt by the CPM to take control of the cricket body.        
	Dalmiya has said he does not accept the one-man inqu-iry, which involved neither the cricket association nor power utility CESC which the CAB blames for the disaster. He has dubbed the report one-sided.        
	Chakrabarti dismissed Dalmiyas remarks today, saying: False, false, false. These allegations are absolutely false.        
	He added: Its not my job to ensure people are satisfied. I was supposed to conduct an inquiry and file a report and that is what I have done.        
	The police chief said the probe committee, whose lone member was joint commissioner Debasish Roy, had checked all the details of the power connections to each of the four floodlight towers.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said the government had seen and accepted the report. He refused to reveal its contents.        
	A new committee under the principal secretary of the sports department and representatives of CESC, Calcutta police, the CAB and the PWD (responsible for overall maintenance of the stadium) will help implement the reports recommendations, Sen said.        
	RSP leader and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami echoed Mamata, saying it was not the polices job to conduct such a probe. Dalmiya declined comment on the remarks by Mamata and Chakrabarti.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Party holds fire on Jagan TV ambush
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Party holds fire on Jagan TV ambush
          SANJAY K JHA AND G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                             
	Nov. 21: The Congress high command is likely to ignore the attack on Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh on a television channel owned by the late YSRs son and party MP Jaganmohan Reddy, sources in the party said.        
	For one, Sonia does not want to open another front in Hyderabad when the party is already burdened by problems in Delhi.         
	Besides, the Congress can act against its MP for political or organisational lapses  Jagan has made many, the sources said  but not for a report in the media irrespective of who owns the channel.         
	This, however, is another evidence of Jagans defiance and would be remembered, a senior Congress leader said.         
	Sakshi TV had in a one-hour programme telecast on Friday night and rerun on Saturday described Singh as a rubber stamp Prime Minister and said Sonia was dictating the policies of the country though she was neither the President nor the Prime Minister.        
	Within minutes of the telecast, Congress leaders in Hyderabad and the district towns condemned it. Chief minister K. Rosaiah, who too was attacked on the show, described it as highly distorted, with malice and far from the truth in a signed statement.        
	Congress workers across Andhra Pradesh targeted the offices of Sakshi TV and newspaper, with ministers Danam Nagender and Komtireddy Venkat Reddy joining a dharna outside the channels office on Banjara Hills.         
	Over 200 people were taken into custody for staging protests and attacking the offices, which were provided police cover.         
	Congress Working Committee member K. Keshav Rao, former chief minister N. Janardhan Reddy and several state ministers and MPs spoke out against the telecast.        
	The channel promptly cited the independence of the media and said Jagan did not control its day-to-day activities. We are functioning as an independent media house and not as a mouthpiece of the Congress party ever since we were born two years ago even when Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy was around, said CEO Priyadarshini Ram.        
	Denying any malice, Ram added that the comments on Sonia were not Sakshis own but a summation of media reports.         
	Although the Congresss central leadership is unlikely to take any action now, it would not like to be seen as ignoring the sentiments of the local leaders either. So, the Congresss media department chairperson Janardan Dwivedi said: The party has sought a report from the state unit on the issue. The state unit promptly sent the CD and an English translation of the transcript to Delhi.         
	Titled Hasta Gatham (History of the Hand), the programme on the Congresss 125th anniversary said: Sonia is neither the President of this country nor the Prime Minister but she decides on all matters and dictates policies. It called the Congress president a poor orator and said she was guided by a coterie and was losing touch with the people.        
	The show further said that under Rosaiah  whom Jagan, who has his sights on the chief ministers chair, has been targeting ever since he succeeded YSR  the state lacked strong leadership and was slipping fast.        
	The Sakshi newspaper published a report yesterday that the PMO was in the know of the 2G spectrum allocation.         
	Jagan, 38, is being watched by the high command ever since he defied it and went ahead with his Odarpu yatra across the state. This latest development only adds to the volume of evidence against him, sources said.        
	The Kadapa MP is desperate to chart his independent political course and might have planned this telecast to precipitate a crisis and provoke the Congress into sacking him, the sources said. Perhaps Jaganmohan wants the party to take action against him so that he can become a hero but a party like the Congress will not act in haste, senior leader Keshav Rao said.        
	The Congress would like to defang the rebel and isolate him before forcing his exit, sources said. A delayed response will ensure much weaker public sympathy for YSRs son.

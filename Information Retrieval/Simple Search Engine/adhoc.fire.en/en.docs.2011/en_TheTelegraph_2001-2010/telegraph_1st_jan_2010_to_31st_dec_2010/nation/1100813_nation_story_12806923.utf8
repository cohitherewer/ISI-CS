The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Arjun speech vetted by party
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Arjun speech vetted by party

	New Delhi, Aug. 12: The Congress leadership had been working on Arjun Singh for long and the text of his speech yesterday on the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy had been cleared by the party, sources said today.         
	The sources said the veteran leader had decided to deal with the controversy surrounding the release of Warren Anderson in his autobiography but was told to speak up in Parliament as fingers were being pointed at then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.         
	They said Pranab Mukherjee had contacted Arjun sometime back and conveyed to him the partys desire that the controversy about the former Union Carbide chief be laid to rest.         
	Arjun, according to the sources, said he would do anything for the party but expressed his keenness to meet Sonia Gandhi first. He eventually met the party chief just before she left for the US a few days before the start of the monsoon session.         
	In the meantime, the group of ministers set up on the tragedy checked the records to see if there was any mention of Andersons release and found nothing.        
	Arjun, too, had told the party leadership that Rajiv had nothing to do with Andersons release but there was a sense of disquiet, heightened by the general perception that the veteran was unhappy with the state of affairs in the party.         
	The sources said Sonia, too, wanted the controversy to be over and hence Arjun, Madhya Pradesh chief minister at the time of the gas leak, was persuaded to use the opportunity when Parliament was debating the Bhopal gas tragedy yesterday.        
	Although the top leaders may have been aware of the plan, Arjun formally expressed his desire to participate in the debate yesterday morning, claiming that leader of Opposition Sushma Swarajs attack on the then Rajiv government had disturbed him.         
	The sources said Arjun then sent the text of his speech to parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Kumar Bansal, who took it to finance minister Mukherjee for vetting.        
	It is not known if Pranab had to edit any portion but sources in the government confirmed that the leader of the House went through the speech, much before Arjun was wheeled out by his party to take part in the Rajya Sabha discussion.         
	Arjuns loyalty was always questioned by a section of party. It was necessary for him to clear Rajivs name in the controversy as his word carried maximum weight in this episode, a party leader who worked closely with Arjun told The Telegraph.        
	The party refused to analyse Arjuns statement at its formal briefing, saying it had nothing to add to or subtract from what he said.        
	There was no attempt to defend then home minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. We believe it is important to look forward, party spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan said, asked by reporters how the Congress viewed Arjuns insinuation that Rao was to blame for Andersons release.        
	Asked if the party endorsed Arjuns statement, Natarajan said: I am not a spokesperson for Arjun Singhji or the home ministry of that time or the government of that time.

  - Finance minister plays down talk of demanding explanation for Lalgarh remark        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee at Mamata Banerjees home on Saturday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	Calcutta, Aug. 14: Pranab Mukherjee today met an ailing Mamata Banerjee at her home and said the visit was personal and had not come at the behest of the Prime Minister or the high command or anybody else.        
	His comments seemed an attempt to play down media reports that the Centre and the Congress were unhappy at the Trinamul Congress chiefs remarks on Maoist leader Azad at her Lalgarh rally, and had sent him to demand an explanation.        
	I came to enquire about her health as she is unwell. The Prime Minister is concerned about her health. We are similarly worried. Today is a holiday and so theres no Parliament session. Thats why I came, the Union finance minister said after spending nearly 50 minutes alone with Mamata.        
	At Lalgarh, Mamata had demanded a probe into the encounter killing of Azad. Both the Left and the BJP had targeted the remark in Parliament and alleged a Mamata-Maoist nexus, prompting Mukherjee to say he would speak to her and inform the House.        
	Mamata has been in Calcutta since the August 9 rally, recovering from injuries suffered when a truck rammed into her convoy on her way back from Lalgarh.        
	Referring to the media reports about the Prime Minister or the party sending him to Mamata, Mukherjee said: Its not true. I came at my personal initiative.        
	He added: I have been reading and watching news that I have come today to show a red card, green card, or yellow card to her. Thats absolutely bogus and baseless. Nothing of that sort happened and let that be clear.        
	The finance minister, though, hinted that the Congress central leadership wanted Mamata to return to Parliament at the earliest.        
	I hope she gets well soon and can take part in the monsoon session of Parliament. However, I have told her to do whatever she wants to after consulting her doctors, Mukherjee said.         
	Sources said that one of the reasons for Mukherjees visit could be to remind Mamata about the statement she would be expected to make in Parliament on her Lalgarh speech before the end of the monsoon session.        
	Asked what Mukherjee and Mamata may have discussed, a Trinamul MP close to the railway minister said: She narrated how the accident occurred. We have been told she also explained what she had said in Lalgarh. It is likely that Pranabbabu told her to think about making a statement on this in Parliament. We also presume he assured her that the Centre was standing by her.

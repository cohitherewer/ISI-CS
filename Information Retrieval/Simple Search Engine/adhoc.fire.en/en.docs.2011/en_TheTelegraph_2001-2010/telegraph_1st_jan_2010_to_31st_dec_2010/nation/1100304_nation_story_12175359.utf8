The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Echo from   an obituary
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Echo from   an obituary
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                       Lt Commander Rahul Nair            Saraswathi, Nair rsquo;s mother. (Prem Singh)            Deepti, the sister of the pilot. (Prem Singh)                                
	New Delhi, March 3: Around two years ago, Lt Commander Rahul Nair had written a moving obituary of a friend who had died in an air crash.         
	Today, as his seniors and family members remember Rahul who died in the Hyderabad crash, the lines he had written for his friend came back to haunt them.         
	He (Rahul) was never cowed down by the many accidents around him. He always kept a positive attitude. When he lost his friend he was deeply affected and missed him and he wrote a moving piece, thinking of which makes me all the more sad, said Commodore (Retd) Lokesh Batra, who had served with Rahuls father, Wing Commander (Retd) R.M. Nair, for 30 years in the navy.        
	But that loss didnt deter him (Rahul) from flying. He was passionate about it and thought of nothing else. It was difficult to believe at first that it was Rahul who had died in the crash, but when his sister called me frantically and asked me to come over to their home, I was heartbroken. The two ladies were alone at home. He practically grew up on my lap and was like my own children. He was a fine officer and a great human being, Batra added.        
	Rahul, who was stationed in Goa when he was assigned to perform in Hyderabad, was an alumnus of Apeejay School in Noida. He was originally from Kerala but his parents chose to stay on in Delhi along with his younger sister, Deepti, because of his fathers long association with the city.        
	Rahul had gone home three months ago to meet his family and stayed for five days. His father and his elder brother were in Kochi while his youngest sibling was in Singapore when the plane crashed.        
	He was a nice boy, always jovial. He loved his south Indian food, said the maid of the household, who walked out of their modest flat in East Delhi, dabbing her eyes with the edge of her saree.        
	Nairs mother Saraswathi and sister Deepti have left for Mumbai en route to Goa. His brother and father are travelling by road from Kochi and his youngest brother will reach Delhi today and leave for Goa tomorrow. Although he not as experienced as Commander S.K.Maurya (the flight commander who also died), Nair was being groomed for excellence in aerobatics. We have lost a good officer, said Navy spokesperson Commander P.V. Satish.

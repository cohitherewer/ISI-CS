The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Police wives bare home torture
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Police wives bare home torture
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 17: Law-keepers at work but law-breakers in the bedroom.        
	Huh? Is someone playing dirty pranks on Delhi police?        
	Nah. Sound out their wives, and you might just be surprised.        
	A rash of queries on how to file complaints against abusive or violent husbands has flooded the mailbox of Delhi polices RTI cell, baring secrets that remain behind the walls of policemens homes.        
	Sample one such letter from Harleen (name changed): My husbands been beating me up for no rhyme or reason. Things are going from bad to worse. I tried to lodge a complaint at the police station but the officer insisted I should bring my husband along. What do I do?        
	Or another from Anoushka (name changed): My husbands a constable. I have videographed how he tortures me on my cell phone. I am scared that if I lodge a complaint, he will come to know. My life will become more miserable. What do you advise?        
	An officer of the RTI cell of Delhi police, who mentioned these letters, said there had been nearly 90 complaints of domestic violence from wives and family members of policemen in the past five months, leaving the police brass with a never-before problem on hand.        
	Its so embarrassing. Most of the complainants are wives of police personnel. They have alleged that their complaints are not being entertained at police stations because the accused are men in uniform, he said.        
	The complaints, he said, ranged from unpleasant verbal abuses from the minute the policeman returned from work to more serious ones of physical and mental torture.        
	Initially, we thought someone was playing a prank but the number of complaints went up drastically in the last two months. So senior officers had to be informed, another officer said.        
	A four-member team has been set up to probe the matter. Senior officers are angry that such complaints are pouring in from unexpected quarters, he said.        
	This is humiliating. Protectors of law are turning into law-breakers. We have asked our men to investigate each complaint and submit reports to ascertain if the complaints are fake or genuine, an officer said.        
	Another good-humouredly took a dig at his tribe: Going by the complaints against men in uniform, it seems we need to set up a domestic violence cell exclusively for complaints about our personnel.        
	Delhi police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat, however, said he was not aware of specific complaints. Well, there may be one or two, but I have to check it out. We get lots of queries and complaints at our RTI cell daily. It is difficult to remember all the cases, he said.

	Feb. 12: NCP leader Sharad Pawar today ridiculed the Shiv Sena by saying that even Marathi-speaking people had rebuffed the threats to My Name is Khan and joined the spontaneous crowds who had forced theatres to screen the film.        
	Pawars statement came days after his meeting with Bal Thackeray where he had appealed to the Sena chief to allow Australian cricketers to participate in the IPL. The meeting had left the Congress fuming.         
	Pawar today told his party not to behave like the Sena and impose its authority. There is an autonomous institution in this country which decides which film to be screened for public viewing and with what cuts and, in such a situation, no one should create his own authority for it, he said.        
	Pawar said the failure of the so-called agitation against the film showed that citizens of Mumbai, including the Marathi people, had neither participated in it nor backed it.        
	His statements found an echo in comments of Congress leaders. Union minister Ambika Soni said that by turning out in large numbers to watch the movie, the people of Maharashtra had asserted their right to freedom of expression and people across the country had given the Sena a lesson in unity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Posco lease set aside
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Posco lease set aside
          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Cuttack, July 14: Orissa High Court today set aside the state governments recommendation to grant mining lease on the Khandadhar mines in Sundargarh to Posco.        
	However, the court has allowed the state government to bypass the first-come-first-served criterion while making the selection afresh within four months. The criterion was the key basis on which a private company had challenged the governments recommendation.        
	Adjudicating the writ petition filed by Geomin, a Karnataka-based company, challenging the governments decision to grant prospective licence to Posco over 2,730.63 acres of iron ore, a division bench of justices B.P. Das and B.P. Ray directed the state government to consider grant of mining lease for Khandadhar afresh within four months.         
	The court said the states mineral policy is in a mess.        
	It is not clear whether Posco would be eligible for consideration of its application afresh. The full text of the judgment will be available only later.        
	In 2007, the Kudremukh Iron Ore company, a public sector undertaking, had approached the high court to challenge the state governments recommendation to grant mining lease to Posco India in Khandadhar. That time, the government had allotted 6,204 hectares to Posco.        
	However, the high court had referred the matter to the Centre in April 2007. The Centres revision court, a quasi-judicial body, had asked the state government to consider all applications afresh.        
	After hearing the 200-odd applications for the prospective licence for the Khandadhar iron ore reserve, the state government had recommended Poscos name again on January 9, 2009.        
	This was challenged by Geomin on the ground the decision was taken without giving equal opportunities to all applicants, especially the applications filed earlier. The company had said it was the first applicant for the mining lease at Khandadhar in 1991 when the mine was dereserved.        
	In 1961, the Orissa government had reserved the Khandadhar iron ore mines for exploitation by the public sector.

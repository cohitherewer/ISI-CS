  - He changed Bengals post-Independence politics but not as much as he would have wanted                                              
	In 1996, when he was 82 and had completed 50 years in public life, Jyoti Basu nearly made a new beginning. But the man who was the most recognisable face of communism in India was held back by his own party. He never forgave his comrades for not allowing him to be Indias first communist Prime Minister, that too at a time when communism was a fallen creed in most parts of the world.        
	Indian politics and the Lefts role in it could have been very different if Basu could have had his way with his party. He failed to carry his party again in 2004 when he wanted the CPM to join, and not merely support from outside, the Congress-led government at the Centre. Had his view prevailed, the CPM would have been able to resolve a dilemma that Indian communists had faced since the time of the Comintern  whether or not to ally with the Congress, the party of the national bourgeoisie.        
	In 1996, Basu called his partys decision a historic blunder. But he also realised his own contribution to this experience of failure. He had failed to reform the party he led as much as he had wanted to, just as he had failed to change Bengal radically enough for a new era of modernity.        
	Yet, no other leader changed Bengals post-Independence politics as much as Basu did. He was chief minister for 23 years but his impact on the states politics lasted nearly half a century.        
	Opinion will continue to differ on his politics and its effects on Bengal and Bengalis. But few can doubt that the present history of Bengal is largely the story of Jyoti Basu. To his critics, it was a story of unmitigated disaster, but in his time, Basus popularity was a phenomenon unmatched in Indias political annals.        
	Similarly, no other leader changed communism in India as much as he did, making it give up the line of armed struggle and accept parliamentary democracy. Extremist fringes like the many Naxalite factions remained, but mostly on the margins until the rise of full-blown Maoism.        
	No wonder Basu had an impact on national politics unrivalled by any Bengali politician in a long time. The CPM  and the Left as a whole  is still an insignificant force in Indian politics. The partys new-found power in national politics during Manmohan Singhs first term in office, when the Left had 61 members in the Lok Sabha, is fast becoming a thing of the past.        
	But Basus image had little to do with his partys failings or with his rule in Bengal. Even critics who saw nothing but decline and decay in Bengal during his reign were awed by Basus image and stature.        
	Image and substance conflicted through much of his career. After his 23 years in power and Bengals economy, education and self-confidence in tatters, both the faithful and heretics increasingly wondered how much of him was the image and how much the substance.        
	His long stint in office brought out the contradictions  between communist orthodoxy and the politics of power. And he sought to constantly change stances and lines to suit fast-changing world and national scenarios. But the contradictions seem to have been there all along  in his personality and style of functioning.        
	In the late 1960s, British writer Geoffrey Moorhouse argued that Rabindranath Tagore and Basu were the two people who had made Bengal what it is today. Basus admirers and critics would, of course, react to the remark very differently. But when Moorhouse met him, he found it quite impossible to tell whether his (Basus) bearing and his mannerisms come naturally or whether they are carefully cultivated to fulfil a role.        
	Some of these mannerisms young Basu had picked up in England where his doctor father had sent him to train as a barrister in the 1930s. He would have come back as a member of the coveted Indian Civil Service if he had passed the examinations.        
	Instead, he came back a communist, baptised by British communist leaders Harry Pollitt and Rajani Palme Dutt, and plunged straight into trade union activity among railway workers in undivided Bengal.        
	The railway workers constituency first elected him in 1946 to the provincial Assembly where he returned ever after, with the exception of 1972 when a rigged election had him defeated.        
	He thus found his role early enough  to lead a people whom his social background would have normally taught him to ignore, if not despise.        
	For all his work among workers and peasants, he remained an icon the Bengali bhadralok class so loves to create  upper middle class, foreign-educated and, of course, a rebel-hero.        
	No wonder Basu was idolised by people who had little in common with him and less sympathy for his politics. His admirers thought his flexibility marked him apart from the whole lot of his fellow travellers. Critics saw in this the hallmark of the archetypal politico who was all manner of things to all manner of people.        
	If that sounds like the stuff political compromises are made of, Basu perfected it almost to a fine art. One communist chief minister before Basu had shown a somewhat similar skill  Achutha Menon in Kerala in the 1970s, whom senior Congress leaders put out as the best Congress CM weve had.        
	Basus approach was, however, far more significant, not just for his party but for national politics as well.        
	Consciously, if also quietly, Basu steered his party to a consensual approach in politics. This was immensely significant for a party that had always seen itself as anti-system and for which class war was still a hallowed doctrine, at least on paper.        
	He was always considered a moderate in the undivided CPI. So much so that many thought that his joining the CPM after the 1964 split in the party was rather accidental. Temperamentally and ideologically, he was more inclined towards the CPI. Even at the Calcutta congress which formalised the split and gave birth to the CPM, Basu and E.M.S. Namboodiripad, the two centrist leaders, played a leading role in modifying the original Left programme of an all-out confrontation with the national bourgeoisie and its party, the Congress.        
	Soon after, Basus line was put to a crucial test. After the 1967 Assembly elections in Bengal, the CPM was deeply divided on the question of joining a coalition government led by the Bangla Congress.        
	The then secretary of the state unit of the party, Promode Dasgupta, vehemently opposed the idea. So did the majority of the party, which argued that the Bangla Congress was very much the same Congress by another name and its leader, Ajoy Mukherjee, a typical Congressman.        
	Basu not only managed to get a majority for his line at the state secretariat but left it to Dasgupta to put down a possible revolt from the party rank and file. An organisation man in the Stalinist mould, Dasgupta not only bowed to Basus line but actually got down to building the partys mass base on it. Basu in the government and Dasgupta in the party also met the Naxalite challenge to the CPM, although the movement unleashed street wars and killings for a few years.        
	That was the beginning and neither Basu nor his party in Bengal looked back. With every election, the Basu line thrived. By 1977, the CPM had absolute majority in the 280-member Assembly. But Basu  and now the CPM  kept the Left Front intact.        
	His political fortunes soared as those of his possible rivals declined. Even the big victory in 1977 came rather unexpectedly as the former Congress chief minister and leader of the newly floated Janata Party, Prafulla Chandra Sen, refused to allot more than 100 seats to the Left Front in an anti-Congress alliance. That forced the Left Front to fight the polls on its own. Sens miscalculation helped launch Basu in his new role as the first communist chief minister of Bengal.        
	Basu, though, was never considered half as good a theoretician as Namboodiripad and M. Basavapunniah or as impressive an organiser as B.T. Ranadive. In the undivided CPI, there were stalwarts like Hiren Mukherjee, Bhupesh Gupta and Somnath Lahiri whose intellectual brilliance and oratory skills became part of Bengal communist lore.        
	But Basu outstripped them all with his pragmatism. He spoke the language of the masses that did not smack of communist jargon. In other words, his resilience proved smarter than their foggy rhetoric.        
	The year 1977 was a time of hope and promise. Basu knew, however, that swaying the masses was an easy sport compared with keeping the basic promises. Since the time of the first United Front in 1967, the CPM had made land reforms the mainstay of its economic as well as political programme, with Harekrishna Konar acting as the rabid standard-bearer.        
	From 1977, the party and its government got down to the business of tackling the issue in a more organised way. Land distribution began, now under the leadership of Benoy Choudhury, resulting in the swelling of the partys agrarian base. By the time Indira Gandhi returned to power in 1980, the Left Front under Basu had struck roots in the Bengal villages.        
	The 1982 Assembly elections saw the CPM retain absolute majority in the now 294-member House with 174 seats. Next year, the second panchayat polls confirmed the Marxist hegemony. Rural society and agrarian relations changed to the advantage of the less privileged.        
	But the first flush of optimism was over: the rural magic paled. Party functionaries and their associates seemed to be prospering at faster rates. Urban centres offered telltale signs of decay. It was time to face up to the dismal realities of massive unemployment, industrial sickness and the collapse of the public sector economy.        
	Communists who had survived and thrived on anti-private sector, anti-multinational and anti-work slogans still clung to their lost causes. Basu called his wits and his resilience to try and stem the rot.        
	At the CPMs 12th congress in Calcutta in 1985, he pushed through the new economic agenda for the party. It was time, he told hostile delegates, to break away from obstructionist policies. He could persuade the Congress to pass the resolution on joint ventures between the state and the private sector: it was the first step towards going further and wooing multinationals. The inspiration came from the experiments launched in the new economic zones in China. Basu once again managed to get the majority of party functionaries behind him on a new approach.        
	The attempt came before Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1985 took the first steps to open India to multinationals, the free market and the latest technology. After economic liberalisation was introduced in India in 1991, Basu was the first chief minister to come up with a new industrial policy in 1994.        
	But the contradictions that had long plagued him and his party continued to take their heavy toll. The party that he created now shackled Basu. It was no coincidence that the CPM central committee turned down his plea to join the United Front government in Delhi.        
	The gap between him and his party widened in the last few years he stayed in power in Bengal. Basu wanted to hand over the decrepit, state-run Great Eastern Hotel to a French hotel chain, but failed to break through the opposition of trade unions, including his own partys. He knew that the only way the sick Indian Iron and Steel Company at Burnpur could be revived was through privatisation. The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (Citu), of which he was one of the vice-presidents, would have none of it.        
	But his greatest failure seems to have been in education. In the name of democratisation, the party adopted policies that patronised mediocrity and destroyed standards of excellence in higher education. Even primary education became a playground for building the local party base. Its devastating result has been documented by Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, who has been otherwise sympathetic to Basus achievements in rural reforms and poverty alleviation. All levels of education became a prey to a new variety of trade unionism by party-backed teachers bodies.        
	Its no coincidence, therefore, that Basus tenure had seen large numbers of talented and skilled Bengalis leaving Calcutta in search of jobs and careers in other Indian cities and abroad.        
	Bengal gave Basu a long reign and a national image that remained largely unsullied despite occasional corruption charges against his government, party and his son Chandans affairs. In return, he gave the state peace and political stability and some degree of economic freedom to the rural masses. But the need of the hour was for a complete reversal of their basic economic arguments. Neither Basu nor his party seemed ready for the big leap forward.        
	It was left to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to change Basus Bengal. For a brief spell, Bhattacharjees big leap made him look like the reformer that Basu never was. The story thereafter has been very different  Bhattacharjee now seems to be destined to preside over the last days of communism in Bengal. But it is only partially his own doing; ironically, the coming collapse of his partys rule is ultimately a legacy of Basus long reign in Bengal.                    ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

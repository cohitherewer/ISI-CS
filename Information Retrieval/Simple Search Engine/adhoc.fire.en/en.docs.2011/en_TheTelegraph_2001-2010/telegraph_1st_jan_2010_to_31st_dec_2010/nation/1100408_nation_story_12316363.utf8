          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A grieving relative of a massacre victim in 1997                                  
	Patna, April 7: Sixteen members of an erstwhile militia of upper-caste Bihar landlords were today given the capital punishment for butchering 58 Dalit Maoist supporters 13 years ago, a rare instance of so many death sentences in a single case.        
	Additional district and sessions judge (I), Patna, Vijay Prakash Mishra, described the December 1, 1997, massacre by the Ranbir Sena members as a stigma on civil society and rarest of rare cases of brutality.         
	Ten other people were sentenced to life, but the mastermind, Ranvir Sena founder Barmeshwar Mihiya, and another person were never brought to book as they are still absconders according to police records.        
	The massacre, which occurred in Jehanabads Laxmanpur-Bathe village, was the result of a series of clashes between upper-caste Bhumihars and farm workers, primarily Dalits, who enjoyed the patronage of the then Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) and the CPI-ML. The two outfits had later merge d to form the CPI (Maoist).        
	In March 1999, the Maoists had avenged the Laxmanpur-Bathe carnage by massacring as many as 34 Bhumihar young men  all between the age of 19 and 34 years  in a village in neighbouring Gaya.        
	The retaliatory attack on Senari village, an affluent village of Bhumihars, had virtually set in motion the process of dismantling of the Ranvir Sena, with the Maoists gaining in strength and firepower.        
	Of the 46 accused, charges were framed against 44 persons. Eighteen of them were acquitted for lack of evidence. The 10 accused who have been served life-terms have also been slapped with a penalty of Rs 50,000 each.        
	The Ranvir Sena marauders had descended on Laxmanpur-Bathe and used guns and swords to butcher the 58 Dalits, including 27 women and 10 children, over hours in an orgy of violence that had shocked the nation.         
	Defence lawyer Sunil Kumar said the order would be challenged in the high court. Prosecution lawyer C.K. Sinha described the verdict as an achievement of the Nitish Kumar government, which has facilitated speedy trials of pending cases.        
	The Laxmanpur-Bathe case was pending with no witnesses turning up and the police sitting over it. But it was only in December 2008, that charges were framed against the accused Ranvir Sena men, said Rajesh Kumar, another prosecution lawyer.

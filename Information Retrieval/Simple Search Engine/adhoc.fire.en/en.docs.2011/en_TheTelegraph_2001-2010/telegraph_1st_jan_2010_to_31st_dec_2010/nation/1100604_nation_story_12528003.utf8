          BARUN GHOSH                                            
	Calcutta, June 3: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and seven of his cabinet colleagues have lost in their Assembly constituencies  if the results of the civic elections are taken as a barometer of support.        
	The ministers are Asim Dasgupta (finance), Ranjit Kundu (transport), Naren De (agriculture), Manab Mukherjee (tourism), Anadi Sahu (labour), Debesh Das (Information technology) and Pratim Chatterjee (fire services).        
	The outcome mirrors the trend in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls where the Left Front nominees lagged Trinamul candidates in 191 of the states 294 Assembly segments, spread over the 42 parliamentary constituencies. Trinamul leaders had then claimed that at least 30 state ministers had lost, going by the same yardstick.        
	But CPM state secretariat member Rabin Deb disagreed. We dont accept that eight ministers (including Bhattacharjee) have lost, going by the results in the municipalities. The simple reason is that it (the civic poll results) is not a complete picture. Civic polls were held only in the urban areas, not in the vast rural areas, Deb said.        
	Mamata Banerjee had yesterday demanded the chief ministers resignation, saying Trinamul nominees had won in six out of 10 wards in Bhattacharjees Jadavpur Assembly constituency. The picture was different in last years Lok Sabha polls: the CPM had a lead over Trinamul MP Kabir Suman in all the six wards.        
	Leader of Opposition, Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee, said tonight it was a shame Bhattacharjees party could not win the wards. It was a shame the chief minister could not (get his party) to win the 10 wards in his Assembly segment despite resorting to rigging. His party was down by 11,000 votes in his constituency.        
	Finance minister Dasgupta appears just as shaky. In North 24-Parganas Khardah municipality, which falls under his Khardah Assembly segment, Trinamul wrested the civic board from the Left by winning 14 of the 22 wards. Only 30 per cent of Dasguptas Assembly constituency is located in the rural areas, which come under panchayats.        
	A member of the CPMs North 24-Parganas district committee admitted what senior leaders were loath to. There was no denying that people voted against Dasgupta in his Assembly constituency, 70 per cent of which is under the Khardah municipality.        
	The picture was similar for the other six ministers.

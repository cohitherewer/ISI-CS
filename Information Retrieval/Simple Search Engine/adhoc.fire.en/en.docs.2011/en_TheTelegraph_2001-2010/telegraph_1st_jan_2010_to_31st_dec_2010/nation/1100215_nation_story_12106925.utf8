          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 14: The BJP today urged the Centre to reconsider its decision to resume talks with Pakistan in the wake of yesterdays blast, while the CPM steered clear of the planned parleys and blamed intelligence failure.        
	What has happened in Pune is a grim reminder to all of us about the fragility of our security and the adventurist traps we are walking into. Terror and talks cannot co-exist. When terror threatens India, not talking is a legitimate diplomatic option, the BJP said in a statement. The party also called for a rethink on government plans to allow Kashmiri residents from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (Pok) to return to the Valley.        
	The partys core committee met this morning to discuss the Pune attack. The response was in keeping with the spirit of the BJPs nationalist outlook but, unlike similar occasions earlier, did not sound too shrill.        
	After its counter-productive campaign against the government in the aftermath of 26/11, the party thought it was best to lower the pitch and not score a self-goal again, a source said. Its campaign had polarised Muslim votes towards the Congress in the Delhi and Rajasthan elections held around the time of the Mumbai attack.        
	A statement from Arun Jaitley, Opposition leader in the Rajya Sabha, reflected the nuanced approach. This (Pune) blast establishes that those inimical to India are continuing their war. India is not, and Indians will not, accept India as a soft state, he said, adding foreigners had been targeted in Pune to create an international impact.        
	Sushma Swaraj, Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha, rushed to Pune with the BJP president Nitin Gadkari, skipping a programme organised by the BJP Mahila Morcha to felicitate her on her birthday. She felt it would not be proper to celebrate at a time people were in a state of shock after the blast, said Gadkari.        
	The CPMs response focused on the alleged intelligence failure and did not comment on the blasts impact on the dialogue with Pakistan, scheduled for February 25. A statement from the politburo said: Media reports on the prior warnings are, indeed, disturbing as these attacks have taken place despite this. Politburo member Sitaram Yechury said it would be premature to speak about the fate of the planned talks because the government was yet to uncover the identity of the people and groups behind the attack.

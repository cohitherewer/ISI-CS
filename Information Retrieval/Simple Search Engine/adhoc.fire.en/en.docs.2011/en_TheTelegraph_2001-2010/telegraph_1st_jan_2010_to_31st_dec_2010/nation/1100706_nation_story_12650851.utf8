          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 5: The Supreme Court today rejected a public interest litigation that demanded a scrutiny of the Indian cricket boards accounts of the last 10 years by a public authority such as the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.        
	Petitioner Alok Varshney had alleged that although the government had woken up to wrongdoing in the Indian Premier League, it had been silent on the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias allegedly ill-gotten wealth. The petition alleged the board had misappropriated crores of rupees.        
	Varshney said, through his lawyer Manjusha Wadhwa, that while the accounts were being audited, all politicians should step aside as board office-bearers.         
	A three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia, refused to accept his plea. Are you implying that the boards accounts are not being audited under the company law? said Justice Kapadia, an expert in finance and taxation matters.        
	The petition said the board had earned most of its wealth by selling telecast rights to private broadcasters rather than Doordarshan, and alleged: The board had made a mockery of Indian laws by indulging in misappropriation.        
	It blamed the influential non-cricketers who manned the board at a time former cricketers, it said, were forced to take up TV commentary to earn a living.

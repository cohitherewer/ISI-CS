The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Judum jab at state from apex court
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Judum jab at state from apex court
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 11: The Supreme Court today asked the Chhattisgarh government why it should not disband the Salwa Judum, an armed group of anti-Maoist vigilantes, after petitioners alleged that miners were being given guns to drive out tribals from forests.        
	The state government, however, claimed the Salwa Judum had already been disbanded and its members absorbed in Chhattisgarh police.        
	The Salwa Judum does not exist, state counsel Manish Singhvi said confidently, and claimed he could prove that by citing a National Human Rights Commission report.        
	The court, hearing a petition filed by academics and activists on the plight of tribals caught in the Maoist-Salwa Judum crossfire, was not convinced and warned it would itself take action against the Salwa Judum. We will call the Salwa Judum and ask what is happening, the bench said.        
	The court asked the state to file an affidavit tomorrow explaining why the vigilantes should not be disbanded and, if it wanted, state under oath that the Salwa Judum did not exist any more. Providing wherewithal to security forces is a different issue. We are not questioning what arms and ammunition you are giving them. But arming private groups is another issue, the bench of Justices Sudarshan Reddy and S.S. Nijjar said.        
	It was always known that the state had armed villagers to take on the Maoists but the petitioners opened a new line of attack today by alleging miners armed by the state were, in the guise of the Salwa Judum, driving tribals out systematically to capture the mineral-rich forests.        
	The court asked the government to explain why the security forces should not be asked to vacate the schools and ashrams they were occupying; what steps the state had taken to rehabilitate those affected by the violence; and what it had done to investigate all rights violation complaints.

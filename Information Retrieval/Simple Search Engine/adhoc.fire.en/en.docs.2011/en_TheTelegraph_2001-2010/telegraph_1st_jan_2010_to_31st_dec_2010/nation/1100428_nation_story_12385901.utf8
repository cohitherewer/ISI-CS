	Cuttack, April 27: The decomposed body of Ramesh Chandra Pradhan, 55, who had been kidnapped on April 16, was found in a ravine 200ft below near Kalingaghati in Kandhamal, police said today.        
	Pradhan, a real estate agent, was reportedly kidnapped by unidentified persons soon after he had left his house at Samadhipatana on April 16 morning.        
	According to the police, the abductors had apparently first shot him and later disfigured his face beyond recognition with a stone. Pradhan is suspected to have been killed within a day or two after the abduction and his body was thrown into the gorge 300km from Cuttack.        
	Kandhamal police recovered the body in a decomposed state and his relatives identified it, said Cuttack deputy commissioner of police Rekha Lohani.        
	Pradhans son and brother-in-law, sources said, could identify it only with the help of a talisman hanging from the bodys neck and clothing.        
	Around 8.45am on April 16, Pranati (49) had last seen her husband accompanying an unknown person to a car already waiting on the other side of the road near their house.         
	When he did not return even after six days, she grew suspicious and filed a complaint at the Malgodown police station on April 23. She had insisted that it was a case of abduction.        
	The police detained three persons for interrogation in connection with the case.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Successor asks Amar to give up RS seat
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Successor asks Amar to give up RS seat
          OUR BUREAU                          Amar Singh (left) and Sanjay Dutt at a news conference in Delhi. File picture                                  
	Jan. 27: Mulayam Singh Yadav has found another Thakur to fill the shoes of Amar Singh in the Samajwadi Party, the anointment of Mohan Singh falling on the 54th birthday of the angry political gadfly.        
	Mohan did not waste time, asking Amar to forfeit his Rajya Sabha seat.         
	A Thakur from east Uttar Pradesh like Amar, Mohan has been appointed Samajwadi general secretary and national spokesperson  posts from which Amar had resigned.        
	The Samajwadi Party has also accepted actor Sanjay Dutts resignation as general secretary. Sanjay, who had been brought into the Samajwadi fold in January 2009 by Amar, had quit as general secretary earlier this month and declared that he would remain with his elder brother Amar.        
	Since Amar Singh has resigned as the partys general secretary, as member of the parliamentary board and as spokesperson, he has already detached himself from the party. Rajya Sabha membership is given by the party and, therefore, he should resign from the Rajya Sabha also, Mohan said.        
	However, Amar made it plain he would not take the slight from a kinsman lightly. His penchant for lifting lines from Bollywood was on display today.        
	If in Om Shanti Om, the character played by Deepika Padukone beseeched her cavalier lover to adorn the parting on her head with a chutki bhar sindoor (a pinch of vermilion), Amar today alluded to sindoor in an act of defiance. His response to Mohans demand was: Main koyi udhar ka sindoor thodi hun (I am not mere borrowed vermilion).        
	Asked by reporters if he would quit from the Rajya Sabha, Amar said he had been duly elected by Samajwadi MLAs. In the last (Assembly election), every poster carried my photo and Mulayam Singh Yadavs. These MLAs were elected under our banner and it was with their votes that I got my seat, Amar added.        
	But Amar appeared to have been politically isolated. Other than MP Jaya Prada and the Bachchans, it was not known if other VIPs called on him today.        
	Mohan, who on a previous occasion had admitted to Amar underwriting his election costs, sugar-coated his demand and said Amar alone was not culpable for projecting the socialist Samajwadi as an outfit of the rich and the mighty. People felt the Samajwadi has become a party of corporates. We, too, are responsible for being mute spectators, he acknowledged.        
	Mohan, however, hinted that the Samajwadi decision to back UPA II was taken by Amar. One person without taking the partys opinion went ahead and announced our support. We dont want to trivialise the party by withdrawing support in a hurry. Such decisions take time, he said.        
	Like Mohan, a socialist and a contemporary of George Fernandes, those of similar provenance who went into hiding when Amar ruled the roost were rehabilitated by Mulayam. Vishambhar Prasad Nishad and Ramasare Kushwaha, both from the backward classes, were also made general secretaries.        
	The party is now awaiting the return of Azam Khan, Amars most trenchant critic.

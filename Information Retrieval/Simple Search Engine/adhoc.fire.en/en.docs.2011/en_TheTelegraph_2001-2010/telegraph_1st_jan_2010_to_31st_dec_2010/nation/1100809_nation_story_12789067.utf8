	New Delhi, Aug. 8 (PTI): The management of a hospital cannot be penalised if a patient dies or suffers because of medical negligence, only doctors can be punished, Delhi High Court has ruled.        
	The court said the management of a hospital would be held guilty in case of administrative negligence or failure to provide basic infrastructure to patients.        
	The hospital/company cannot be held liable for the personal negligence of a doctor in giving wrong treatment, Justice Shiv Narayan Dhingra said, while quashing criminal proceedings against Delhis Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals.        
	If there is administrative negligence or negligence of not providing basic infrastructure which results in some harm to an aggrieved person or such negligence which is impersonal, the hospital can be held liable, the judge said.        
	But in the case of medical negligence, which is personal to the doctor who gave treatment, the corporation would not be liable and it is the doctor who can be indicted for medical criminal negligence, the court said.

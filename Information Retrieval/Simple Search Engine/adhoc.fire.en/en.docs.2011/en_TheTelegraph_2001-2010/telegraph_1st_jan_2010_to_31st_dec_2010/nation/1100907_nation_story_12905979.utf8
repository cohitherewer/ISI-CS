          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today confirmed what has been predicted in the capital over the past few days: there would a cabinet reshuffle before the winter session of Parliament, which begins on November 6.         
	In reply to a question, Singh said he would like to see the average age of the cabinet reduced.         
	Asked about suggestions that he gave an impression of marking time while Rahul Gandhi was spreading wings, Singh chuckled and said: I think politics is a competitive game and some people or politicians feel that they should not be in the Opposition but they should be in the place where I am sitting. I dont think you can hold that against me.        
	Singh was categorical that he was not retiring.        
	The Prime Minister iterated that the strategy to tackle Naxalism had to be a nuanced one because it involved valid social and economic issues. Development cannot happen unless law and order is in place. But there is no royal road to success in dealing with intricate problems like Naxalism and Jammu and Kashmir.         
	Singh said he proposed to call a meeting of the cabinet on security affairs to discuss the Kashmir issue threadbare.

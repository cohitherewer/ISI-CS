The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Survey leads to Bihar truce

  - reality check for polls          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                                  
	New Delhi, June 27: Forget pride, ground realities are more important.        
	The BJP and the Janata Dal (United) have salvaged their Bihar alliance from near wreckage after independent internal assessments revealed that together they might just hit the majority mark in the October elections.        
	Alone, both will be restricted to dismal double digits, the internal surveys showed, while the RJD-Lok Janshakti Party duo might sail comfortably towards the halfway figure.        
	The BJPs conclusion was without the Dal (U), it might end up picking barely 45 of the 243 Assembly seats, while its allys tally could be 10 less. Which means even if they wanted to patch up after the elections, they would be far short of the 122 seats required for a simple majority.        
	The Dal(U)s reading, too, wasnt vastly different.        
	A political aide of Nitin Gadkari said the BJP president had commissioned a survey when the alliance was in rough waters and a section of state leaders clamoured to call it off. We keep doing such surveys especially when elections are round the corner. So this was one such exercise but it was also more significant than the others because our relation with our partner was shaky, the aide said.        
	The startling revelation prompted the leadership to conclude that the Bihar hotheads  who railed against chief minister Nitish Kumar after he returned Rs 5 crore his Gujarat counterpart Narendra Modi had sent as flood relief  would have to be reined in.        
	We had to balance our pride against ground realities. Both of us would have lost in the polls, a Bihar BJP leader conceded.        
	But a more substantive consideration that weighed with Gadkari and the BJP brass was the threat of the NDA coalition dissipating had Nitish walked out. The BJP, which once trumpeted its ability to attract allies like bees to a flower  Atal Bihari Vajpayee had coalesced 24 parties with disparate ideologies  is left with just three. Apart from the Dal(U), they include the Akali Dal and the Shiv Sena.        
	Our claim to be the Congresss only alternative would have gone for a toss. Apart from Bihar, we had to look at the national picture, said a general secretary.        
	So Gadkari asked general secretary Arun Jaitley and Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Modi to mollify Nitish without giving in too much.        
	By then Nitish, who looked like he was willing to forego his remaining tenure in office and fight the elections solo, had also figured out that his own credibility might be at stake if he forced a confrontation.        
	He thought things over with a cool head, especially the issue of Muslim votes. He realised that if in the Lok Sabha elections (of 2009) he could have got 20 per cent or so of the minority votes with (L.K.) Advani as the NDAs prime ministerial candidate, he can get much more if the coalition stuck to the development agenda. After all, the BJP-Dal(U) government ran largely on our agenda, a party functionary said.        
	It was also admitted that his act of returning Modis cheque didnt go down well in the flood-affected areas where people were asking if the colour of donations was more important than the relief they would bring and also why the chief minister had not used the funds so far.        
	Although the partnerships endurance will be tested when the modalities of seat-sharing and campaigning are discussed closer to October, it is understood that Nitish has agreed to stick to the 2005 formula of giving 103 seats to the BJP and keeping 140 for himself.        
	The BJP has conveyed that Modi will be kept out of a development-centred election that is expected to revolve around local issues.        
	Gadkari and Nitish are likely to meet in New Delhi in the first week of July.

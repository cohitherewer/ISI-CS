	Mumbai, June 11 (PTI): The CBI today arrested a senior official of Kingfisher Airlines for allegedly conspiring with a senior IPS officer who has been booked on the charge of misusing power and seeking illegal gratification.        
	Leslie Missal, assistant vice-president (security) of the airlines, was arrested after the CBI found he had arranged for the stay of Manoj Malviya, additional commissioner of the bureau of civil aviation security, in five-star hotels several times.        
	The CBI had registered a case against Malviya for allegedly abusing his position and by seeking illegal gratifications between May 2008 and February 2010.         
	Leslie had arranged several things for Malviya and used to stay with him in five-star hotels. When he was questioned by the CBI, it seemed to us that he was suppressing facts, following which we conducted a probe and arrested him, CBI official Pravin Salunkhe said.         
	Malviya had visited Mumbai on several occasions and stayed in five-star hotels, the bills of which were paid by a private firm GVK, Airport Authority of India and Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL), CBI officers said.         
	The CBI is questioning several senior officials of Kingfisher and Jet Airways in connection with the case.

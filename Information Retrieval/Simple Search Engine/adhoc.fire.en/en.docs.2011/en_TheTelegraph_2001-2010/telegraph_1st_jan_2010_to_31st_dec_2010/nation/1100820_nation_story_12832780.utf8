	Bangalore, Aug. 19 (PTI): Seventeen beggars of a Bangalore relief home have died in the past two days, with doctors who treated some of them blaming the mysterious deaths on very unhealthy conditions at the government facility.        
	Eleven boarders of the Beggars Relief Centre, the only one in Bangalore and which houses 2,500 mendicants, died yesterday.         
	Six more succumbed to ailments in a hospital today, authorities at the healthcare unit said.        
	Of the 15 inmates admitted with severe gastro-enteritis today because of extreme unhygienic conditions prevailing in the centre, six died, a hospital official said.         
	Authorities of the Karnataka governments social welfare department, which runs the centre, said the deaths were mainly because of old-age related ailments.        
	The explanation appeared at odds with the assessment of some of the doctors who said after a visit to the centre that the deaths occurred because of very unhealthy conditions.        
	D. Sudhakar, the social welfare minister, visited the centre yesterday and ordered an inquiry.

	Chennai, June 11: P.C. Alexander, Rajiv Gandhis principal secretary during the Bhopal tragedy, appears unsure about the extent of his bosss involvement in Warren Andersons release.        
	Yesterday, he had told this newspaper: The PMO was kept out of that decision and I was in the dark. I am not sure if Rajiv Gandhi was in any way involved. I dont think the decision would have been his.        
	But today, he told a news channel that Rajiv could have taken the decision in the national interest. Rajiv Gandhi and Arjun Singh were in a long conversation after the meeting of the CCPA (cabinet committee on political affairs). Maybe the decision was taken then.        
	Asked about the contradictory remark, Alexander said maybe the political decision was taken by Rajiv on Arjuns advice. He had been Prime Minister for less than two months then. It is possible that the more experienced Arjun talked him into it.        
	Alexander had drifted away from the Nehru-Gandhi family after the Congress ignored his presidential ambitions.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 29: Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim today fell ill in the House and had to be given oxygen after protesting Trinamul Congress MLAs tried to stop him from returning to his chamber.        
	The Trinamul MLAs, led by leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee, had sought to move a motion demanding a discussion on the failure of the state government on all fronts. They had also demanded that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee be present in the House when the issue is debated.         
	Bhattacharjee was not present in the Assembly at the time of the protest.        
	However, when Halim refused to move the motion, they rushed to the well of the Assembly and started squatting. The Speaker waited for five minutes and adjourned the House. When Halim got up from his chair to return to his chamber, the Trinamul MLAs, including Chatterjee, Arup Biswas, Bobby Hakim and Sonali Guha, blocked his path and started protesting.         
	Halim complained of uneasiness while trying to wriggle past the crowd of scuffling Opposition MLAs and security staff. He had to use his hands to stop the protesters from falling on him.         
	The Speaker was rushed to his chamber by the security staff and CPM MLA Rabin Mondal. A doctor was called and Halim had to be administered oxygen.         
	After 20 minutes, Halim emerged from his chamber and said he was feeling better. I have not been keeping well. It is normal that I will feel sick after all the jostling.         
	The Trinamul MLAs tried to obstruct my way, Halim said before leaving for home, escorted by his son.

	New Delhi, June 30: George Fernandes, the Emergency lion who led some of Indias most famous strikes, wouldnt have missed the irony if Alzheimers hadnt laid him low.        
	Jaya Jaitly, his companion of 25 years, today threatened to sit on dharna outside his official MPs bungalow from tomorrow.         
	Dont shame and insult Georgesaheb is what her placard would read to protest her mal-treatment at the hands of Fernandess wife Leila Kabir, who has taken control of his life after walking out in 1984 with their son Sean.        
	Jayas threat came a day before Delhi High Court takes up the next hearing in the case she and Fernandess four brothers are fighting against Leila and Sean.        
	The battle, apart from rights for the 80-year-olds custody, also involves money. With the court recognising that Leila and Sean have a greater right over Fernandes than anybody else, his brothers and Jaya now plan to fight their battle on Delhis roads.        
	Jaya and Fernandess brothers Michael and Richard today reached his 3 Krishna Menon Marg bungalow that he will have to vacate after his Rajya Sabha term ends on July 7.        
	A caretaker now looks after the bungalow. Fernandes lives with Leila in her south Delhi house.        
	Jaya claims her belongings are in the bungalow. She says there are photographs of Mahatma Gandhi and Ram Manohar Lohia that she fears Leila will sell to a junk dealer. Leila said she had told the police to allow only Jaya in.         
	Jaya didnt contest this but wanted Fernandess brothers to accompany her. But they were stopped by the police and the caretaker. Fernandes never shut his doors on anybody. They are insulting him. I will sit on dharna from tomorrow, Jaya said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong to meet only where it rules

	New Delhi, Oct. 13: Most Congress leaders believe a party-ruled state should host the AICC plenary in December, their preference betraying a lack of organisational grit and ruling out the shortlisted Calcutta and Lucknow.        
	A party meeting today ended without any decision on the venue but the leaders indicated the choice had narrowed down to a city in the north. Rajasthan, Delhi and Haryana are said to have emerged as the most suitable options at this stage, primarily because the three states are ruled by the Congress. Mumbai, also on the shortlist, was considered but ruled out as it had hosted the centenary celebrations of the Congress.        
	Calcutta lost out because the Congress is playing second fiddle to Mamata Banerjee in election-bound Bengal. Two, the partys state unit is seen as lacking the wherewithal to organise a show where 20,000 delegates will arrive from across the country and have to be provided with accommodation and food for up to three days.        
	A section of the leadership was keen to hold the plenary in Uttar Pradesh as it will bolster the partys revival before the state elections in 2012. Allahabad and Lucknow were mentioned as probables but it was felt the cities were in a state where the ruling BSP is hostile to the Congress, a problem also seen in Left-run Calcutta. Also, it was felt the Congresss Uttar Pradesh unit may find it difficult to generate resources for the meet.         
	Sources said the AICC leader in charge of Uttar Pradesh, Digvijay Singh, expressed confidence about holding the plenary in Allahabad or Lucknow at todays meeting, but the state unit was not as enthusiastic and felt at least three months were needed to plan such a huge exercise.         
	But the plenary, to celebrate 125 years of the Congresss existence, has to be held by December 20 and three months cannot be given for planning it. This might compel the high command to fall back on party-ruled states.        
	The last plenary, in Hyderabad in 2006, was a government show, with the late Y.S.R. Reddy getting the entire state machinery involved in the event. The same had happened at the Bangalore plenary in 2001 when S.M. Krishna was Karnataka chief minister.

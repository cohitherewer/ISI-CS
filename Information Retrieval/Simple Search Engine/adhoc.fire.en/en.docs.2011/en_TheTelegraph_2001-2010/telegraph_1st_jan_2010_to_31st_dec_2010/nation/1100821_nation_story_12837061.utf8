	 New Delhi, Aug. 20: The Supreme Court has refused to set parameters for dividing existing states or creating new ones saying it was a political question, and declined to intervene in the now-shelved plan for Telangana.          
	This is a political question, why should the court interfere? We are of the view that at this stage, the larger constitutional question does not arise for consideration, a bench of Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia and Justice K.S. Radhakrishnan said, rejecting a petition by K. Srinivas Reddy to frame norms for new states.          
	The judges also refused to address another plea that challenged moves to create Telangana by carving out areas from Andhra Pradesh. The plea had been filed at the height of the statehood movement last December. Reddy was represented by counsel Harish N. Salve.                  
	 Mumbai (PTI): Four Indian warships  INS Mysore, Tabar, Ganga and Aditya  have been deployed on a goodwill visit to several maritime nations of Africa and the Indian Ocean. The warships will hold exercises with the navies and coast guards of Tanzania, Kenya, South Africa, Seychelles and Mauritius and also make port calls at Reunion Island and Mozambique.                  
	 Chandigarh (PTI): Three men, among them two Australians, have been arrested for allegedly plotting to kidnap a youth for ransom. The accused have been identified as Grant Alen Austin, Symond Gimpy and Gulsher Singh.

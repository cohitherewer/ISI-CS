	 New Delhi, April 26: Allegations that the government had tapped phones of senior politicians across party lines rocked Parliament today, providing the latest thrust to Opposition attacks on the government after the IPL controversy.           
	BJP leader L.K. Advani demanded that the Prime Minister explain in the House reports in a magazine that accused intelligence agencies of listening in to conversations of politicians. Labelling the alleged phone-tapping an assault on democracy similar to the Emergency, Advani said the Lok Sabha would only be satisfied with a statement from Manmohan Singh.           
	Speaker Meira Kumar adjourned the House after MPs from the Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Dal (United), CPM, BJP and the Akali Dal gathered at the Well in support of Advanis demand. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh later rejected the Oppositions demands for a probe by a joint parliamentary committee into both the IPL mess and the phone-tapping controversy.

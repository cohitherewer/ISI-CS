          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 27: Three Italians who had checked into a city hotel this week and left soon after have been detained after a chance search of one of their rooms revealed a packet containing live cartridges hidden in the AC duct.        
	The trio were picked up today, one from Mumbai airport and the others from a Pune hotel, following a lookout notice from Delhi police.        
	Sources said the Italians, who were visiting India for meetings regarding a deal their company was bidding for, were carrying the cartridges in a laptop bag. CCTV footage from Indira Gandhi International Airport has revealed that the bag was surprisingly not checked by airport officials, though a scanner had pointed to a suspicious object inside.         
	Police sources said Giovanni Ceccomello, Donato Dngello and Giulio Ponetto, all working with petrochemical company Petronas, had checked into three rooms on May 24 and left after seven hours.         
	Later, when housekeeping staff called in a mechanic to probe the source of a sound emanating from the air-conditioner of one of the rooms, he found the packet containing ammunition in the duct of the machine.        
	When Delhi police officials opened the packet, they found 24 live cartridges and two empty magazines of Italian make. A probe is on to find out if they were also carrying a gun and whether it had a licence.        
	Cartridges were recovered after hotel staff went inside the rooms for cleaning. They noticed that there was an unusual sound from the air-conditioner. A mechanic found the cartridges in a polythene bag in the AC shaft. There were 24 live cartridges, two empty magazines and two springs. The magazines were dismantled, DCP (south) H.G.S. Dhaliwal said. A case has been registered under Section 25 of the arms act.        
	Police officials said Ponetto was detained at Mumbai airport where he was planning to board a flight to Munich.         
	The other two Italians were picked up from a Pune hotel along with two Indians, Andheri resident Balraj Singh Suri and Thanes Rajesh Shetye.

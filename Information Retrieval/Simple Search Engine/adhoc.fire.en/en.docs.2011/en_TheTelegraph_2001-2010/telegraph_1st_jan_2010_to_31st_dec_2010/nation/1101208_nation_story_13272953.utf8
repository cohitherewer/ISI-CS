The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jagan fires family-break salvo at Cong

          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 7: Jaganmohan Reddy today vented his pent-up anger at Congress elders in Delhi, accusing them of breaking families and toppling regional leaders to keep their hold on power.        
	Lashing out at Sonia Gandhi a week after he quit the party, Jagan said he had tired of hearing that the Congress chief was waiting for a chance to expel him. That is why I quit when Delhi stooped to the mean act of using my uncle (Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy) as a pawn to break my morale after insulting and humiliating my family.        
	He claimed that Congress leaders lacked human values and that they were always conniving to exploit gullible party workers for political gain.        
	Addressing supporters at the Lingala mandal headquarters in Pulivendula, his native town in Kadapa district, the 37-year-old announced he would launch his political party within 45 days.        
	I am fighting not for the chief ministers post but for my atma-gowram (self respect), he said, adding he had even been barred from holding the Odarpu yatra in his fathers memory though lakhs of people still adored Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy.        
	Looking back at the events of the last 15 months, I find I have not committed any mistake, Jagan asserted. He said he had never tried to topple the Rosaiah regime but had exercised restraint despite having the support of 150 MLAs at one point.        
	I swallowed my self-esteem and went to New Delhi to persuade the Congress high command to let me undertake the yatra. Even my mother Vijayalaxmi met Sonia Gandhi and pleaded for the yatra, but the plea fell on deaf ears, Jagan said.        
	Soon after YSRs death last year, the Congress in Delhi and Hyderabad forgot his fathers contributions, Jagan claimed. If the Congress is in power in the state, it is only because of my late father. But the Congress split such a great leaders family by playing bizarre politics.        
	Jagan said the bypolls, likely in January to fill up the Assembly seats vacated by him and his mother, would be a semi-final for him and his loyalists and the 2014 general elections the final.        
	If we endure whatever hardships for three more years, we shall get back the golden era of YSR for the subsequent 30 years. Have no doubt, the Congress will be wiped out in the next three years, he said.        
	To keep Jagan in check, the Congress high command has been working on weaning away YSR loyalists from his influence. Chief minister Kiran Kumar Reddy has retained 28 members of the YSR cabinet and kept on hold all proposals to do away with political advisers appointed by Rajasekhar Reddy.        
	The high command is also being extremely cautious about finalising the deputy chief minister, Speaker and the PCC chief so the appointments dont misfire and spark more instability.        
	Political observers say Andhra has virtually been under high command rule since September 2009 and could well remain so till the 2014 elections.

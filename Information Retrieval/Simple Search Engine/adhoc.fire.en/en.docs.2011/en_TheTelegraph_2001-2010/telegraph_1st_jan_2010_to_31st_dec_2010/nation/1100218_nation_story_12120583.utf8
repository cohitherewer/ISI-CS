          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                    (From top) Gadkari at the BJP national executive in Indore; Rahul and Sonia				                                 
	Indore, Feb.17: When Nitin Gadkari had addressed the Delhi media for the first time last December after becoming BJP president, he had taken a leaf out of Rahul Gandhis political guide  declaring an end to the boot-licking and cut-out culture.         
	Today, addressing the partys national executive at Kushabhau Thakre village on the outskirts of Indore for the first time as BJP president, he took more cues from the Congresss first family.        
	Gadkaris first diktat to the BJP has, however, gone unheeded, going by how the gigantic cut-outs of every central leader worth the post he holds have overshadowed the small tents pitched for the delegates.         
	At the meeting today, it seemed as though some of his lines were culled out of Congress chairperson Sonia Gandhis speech at a book release in Delhi last week.         
	Gadkari spoke at a closed-door meeting and his speech was not given to the media. Spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad later briefed journalists.         
	Without treading on the tricky issue of whether sainthood and politics could co-exist, something Sonia had deliberated on at the book release, Gadkari told his colleagues that respect should be commanded and not demanded. Sonia had advised politicians to avoid arrogance if they wanted to win peoples respect.        
	Like Sonia, Gadkari reminded the gathering that hankering after power and showing off were not virtues. Nothing large is achieved with a petty mind. Every BJP member, whether a leader or a worker, should enhance their self-esteem in others eyes rather than lower themselves, he said.         
	He quoted lines from a poem by Atal Bihari Vajpayee to put forth his point of view: Nobody with a petty mind can become big, nobody with a broken mind will be able to stand on his feet.         
	At the core of the address that is expected to spell out the political direction the BJP will pursue for the next three years was a message that had less to do with politics and more with attitude and behaviour. Carry a large heart and mend human relationships, Gadkari told the gathering.        
	The BJP president said the problems that had beset the party in the recent past had not been caused by workers but by the culture of giving election tickets to candidates based more on what he said was patronage and personal networks than on their abilities.         
	The issues (we face) are not because of small workers but because of those who have got a lot from the party, he said, alluding to those whom Sonia had labelled status-seekers.         
	Tickets are given on individual whims, on this tera-mera (yours and mine) business. But who will take responsibility for those candidates who got their tickets through this process and were defeated? Only those candidates who are most popular at the grass roots should get tickets, Gadkari said.         
	We should not feel weak, we are ruling in nine states. We have more than 1,000 MLAs and 175 MPs, Gadkari said.         
	The shadow of the Gandhis was not only visible in Gadkaris speech but his actions as well.        
	Gadkari, 52, like Rahul, 39, had dinner at a Dalits home at B.R. Ambedkars birth place Mhow, 30km from Indore, where he went yesterday to pay homage to the Dalit icon.        
	Gadkaris host, however, was a former BJP councillor.         
	Spokesperson Prasad denied the Rahul connection, saying: There is no political agenda in this. Rahul has the right to travel wherever he likes. But remember the Congress also suffered defeat in places where he had campaigned. Gadkari and me were ABVP (the RSSs student front) activists. Our anthem began with a tribute to Dr Ambedkar.         
	L.K Advani today welcomed Gadkaris plainspeak and endorsed his point about leaders being obsessed with protocol and power.

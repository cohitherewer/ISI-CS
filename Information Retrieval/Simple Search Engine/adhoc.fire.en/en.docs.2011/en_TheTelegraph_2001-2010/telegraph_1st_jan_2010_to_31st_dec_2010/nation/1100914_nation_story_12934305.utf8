          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Calcutta, Sept. 13: The CPM leadership today asked party cadres to fight back against Maoist anarchy in West Midnapore, the open call coming before a planned offensive to reclaim rebel hotbed Lalgarh.        
	The appeal to stand up to the guerrillas came on a day suspected Maoists gunned down four brothers in West Midnapores Nayagram for refusing to reveal the addresses of local CPM leaders.        
	People (in rebel-affected areas) must stand up to Maoist violence, resist their onslaught and fight back, state CPM chief Biman Bose told a party meeting at Rani Rashmoni Avenue to highlight the Maoist-Trinamul Congress nexus.        
	The fightback cry follows recent victories in Pirakata, Dharampur and Ramgarh, recaptured areas in West Midnapore where the CPM has managed to reopen party offices.         
	Last week, party sources had hinted the three places would be used as launch pads to reclaim Lalgarh any time after a rally by party youth wing DYFI in Midnapore town on September 15.                     Biman Bose      
	Bose alluded to the recapture but didnt mention armed CPM camps around the three places. People are coming out on the streets in large numbers with CPM flags and raising their voices against the terror unleashed on them, he said, urging the cadres to carry on with the task that has now begun.        
	People who were driven out of their homes in villages of West Midnapore by the Maoists have now started protesting against their muscle power and violence. The more they fight back, the easier it will be for the homeless to return to their villages.        
	CPM West Midnapore district secretary Dipak Sarkar said his party would meet stone with stone. How long will our men take things lying down? Now the time has come to hit back, he said. If they (Maoists) try to beat up our men, we will counter them similarly. Ora int marle, patkel khabe (If they throw bricks at us, they will have stones hurled back at them).        
	A CPM leader explained the partys new-found aggression. Six months back, we were on the back foot, but no longer so, the leader said. We have been recapturing places from where we had been driven out by the Maoists. Reclaiming Dharampur was the turning point and there is no looking back now.        
	A West Midnapore district leader said the camps set up around Dharampur, Ramgarh and Pirakata would help us move into Lalgarh after the joint forces clear the way.        
	Bengal home secretary Samar Ghosh, too, hinted that the battle against the Maoists was on in full swing when he said the state government had turned down a central request for state police forces for the Bihar elections.         
	The Union home ministry had asked for 20 companies of state police forces. But they are needed in Jungle Mahal. With the festive season coming up, they cannot be spared, Ghosh said at Writers Buildings this evening.

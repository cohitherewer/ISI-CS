The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Flare-up wary Cong dilutes Maoist acid
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Flare-up wary Cong dilutes Maoist acid
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Manish Tewari                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: Unnerved and angry though it is over the Opposition paralysing Parliament for 15 days in a row, the Congress does not want to lose the battle of perceptions by doing something rash.         
	This is why it has so far avoided taking an extreme step like adjourning Parliament sine die, hoping that the man on the street, too, will get exasperated by the Oppositions disruptive routine.         
	It is also why media department chairperson Janardhan Dwivedi promptly pulled up spokesperson Manish Tewari, who had this morning likened the Opposition MPs to agents of Maoists.         
	Tewaris remark triggered an ugly war of words, with BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar retorting that Congress members were agents of Quattrocchi but the situation was quickly controlled by the Congress asking its spokesperson to explain his statement.         
	Soon after both Houses were adjourned amid turmoil today, Tewari told reporters outside Parliament: There is a propaganda of the Maoists that Indian democracy does not reflect the aspirations of the people. The manner in which the Opposition has disrupted Parliament, it gives credence to the propaganda of Maoists. It almost seems as if the Opposition is behaving as their agents.         
	This remark would have further united the Opposition because the Left and other non-BJP parties, too, found it exceptionally objectionable.         
	At the regular Congress briefing in the evening, Tewari diluted his attack but appeared firm about his message. He did not repeat the word Maoists or agents but stuck to his stand that such a prolonged paralysis of Parliament would bolster forces who do not believe in the democratic system.         
	India had preserved its democracy traditions for 63 years, he said. Now if the entire session of Parliament is wasted because of political protest, which are the forces that would gain from it?        
	People should understand what kind of internal security challenges India was faced with and that these forces wanted to topple democratically-elected governments through violence, Tewari added.         
	It was clear he was referring to the Maoists. But asked why he did not repeat the agents of Maoists phrase, Tewari said: If rhetoric and metaphorics are lost on people, what can I say? I made a sarcastic remark and did not want to hurt or insult anyone. The point is that this kind of politics has consequences beyond the immediate. Parliament cannot be paralysed and reduced to a slogan-shouting akhara despite political differences.         
	Asked if the demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe was undemocratic, he said: This demand per se is not, but holding up Parliament like this is certainly undemocratic. You cannot want Parliament to be a slave of your politics.         
	To a question about BJP leader L.K. Advanis insistence on a JPC, he said: Advani should ponder over what his colleague Murli Manohar Joshi said, that the public accounts committee is supreme and competent enough to probe the 2G scam. He should also recall what his other colleague, Arun Shourie, said.         
	The Congress is determined not to fold up the session early and some leaders have suggested extending it beyond the scheduled closure on December 13 to show people that the governments serious intent to run Parliament was defeated by an irresponsible Opposition.         
	The government completed its pending financial business in the Lok Sabha today by passing the supplementary demands for grants for railways amid uproar and slogan-shouting by the Opposition.

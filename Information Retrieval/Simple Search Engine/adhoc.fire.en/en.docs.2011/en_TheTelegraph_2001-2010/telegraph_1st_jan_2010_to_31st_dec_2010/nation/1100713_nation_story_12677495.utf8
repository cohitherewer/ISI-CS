The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong long rope to Jagan 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong long rope to Jagan 
          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, July 12: The Congress high command is in a fix over Jaganmohan Reddys defiance but does not want to aggravate a crisis in the party by pushing him to the wall.         
	Sources said no disciplinary action would be taken against the Kadapa MP, who on Saturday said ministers and MLAs were feeling tortured as they were being prevented from taking part in his yatra  a swipe at K. Rosaiah, the current Andhra Pradesh chief minister and successor to Jagans father, the late Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy.        
	Although, a section in the Congress strongly feels Jagan has crossed the limit by openly attacking Rosaiah, the central leaderships official response did not betray that feeling. Asked about the possibility of action against Jagan, spokesperson Manish Tiwari only said: We dont discuss intra-party or inter-party matters with the media.        
	The central leadership knows that Rosaiahs position as chief minister is a temporary arrangement.         
	Though the high command would ideally like to protect Rosaiah, it is not ready to throw the state unit into turmoil by confronting Jagan, who has resumed his yatra in Andhra despite party chief Sonia Gandhis reservations.         
	According to PTI, Rosaiah today fumed in Hyderabad: How come he (Jagan) make a claim that ministers and MLAs are feeling tortured, as if I have prevented them from taking part in his yatra?        
	Senior leaders admit the situation is grave in the state, the Congresss strongest support base in south, but they are prepared to move cautiously. What do we get by acting in haste? We are giving him a long rope. We have managed to keep the flock of MLAs intact and ensure that the government is safe. Jagan is impatient but has so far not given any indication that he wants to break away. The party and the young man will perhaps have to learn to live with each other, a senior leader said.         
	Jagan, too, has revised his strategy by restricting his criticism to state leaders instead of attacking the high command.        
	Sources revealed that, contrary to popular opinion, the level of understanding between the high command and the young MP had increased after he met Sonia recently. They said Jagan assured Sonia there was no need to suspect his loyalty to the party and he was not planning to break ranks with the Congress.         
	Sonia, who was angry with Jagans bullying ways, has now decided to respond keeping in mind the long-term interests of the party.

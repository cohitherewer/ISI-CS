The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Soren out, Maoists under fire
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Soren out, Maoists under fire
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, June 3: The Centre has decided to go all out against Maoists in Jharkhand after the exit of chief minister Shibu Soren, who was seen as being soft on the rebels.        
	The indications to this effect came from governor M..H. Farook. The operations will continue, he said after meeting P. Chidambaram today, two days after the state was brought under central rule.        
	Asked if the strategy would change, Farook didnt give details beyond saying it would depend on the field officers.        
	The home minister is likely to visit Ranchi on Saturday. Tomorrow, CRPF director-general Vikram Srivastava, whose force is engaged in the operations along with the state police, is scheduled to hold a co-ordination meeting with top cops in the state capital.        
	But it is clear that the home ministry has made up its mind on a tough stance. Chidambaram is likely to visit Ranchi on Saturday while CRPF director-general Vikram Srivastava will hold a co-ordination meeting with the state police on Friday in Ranchi.        
	Jharkhand has six battalions of the CRPF  over 6,000 jawans  to fight the rebels. The state claims 16 of its 24 districts are affected. More battalions may be sent to step up operations, sources said. But Farook refused comment when asked about the matter.        
	Jharkhand is the most volatile of the Maoist-hit states, serving as a corridor for the extremists into Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Bengal. But the states political rulers have often lacked the will for a crackdown.        
	Soren was perceived as being soft on them. The Congress was seen to be tough, with Chidambaram at the helm. But a section of the Congress, fearing reprisals from the rebels, feels the offensive should not be very harsh.         
	Two block presidents of the Congress have been killed by the Maoists over the past few months. Youth Congress leaders have been threatened. A fortnight back, a local Congress leader, Hemant Bage, gunned down.              
	Earlier, the CPI (Maoists) had threatened Congress party leaders and workers in Jharkhand to snap ties with the party or face consequences. The Maoists had also gunned down Dalbhumgarh block president of Congress, Gobardhan Mahali in Dalbhumgarh under Maoist-affected Ghatsila sub-division on March 30.        
	Even now, sources said the Congress is facing a tough challenge as Youth Congress workers are shying away from coming into the open due to threats, sources said.         
	Jharkhand came under Presidents rule yesterday after chief minister Soren resigned could not prove majority in the Assembly. The legislative assembly has been put under suspended animation and state put under central rule.         
	Farooq said appointment of the advisers to the governor will take a few days. Who will be appointed as advisers to governor would be significant as it would also indicate the tone of the Centres strategy in its fight against Maoists in Jharkhand.         
	Meanwhile, the CRPF seems to have pulled up socks for a fresh offensive in Jharkhand. Today, the force was in high spirits as Srivastava received a laudatory note from Bengal DGP Bhupinder Singh on the forces role in Bengal. CRPF men also killed two Maoists in Munger, Bihar after an encounter that lasted more than 12 hours.

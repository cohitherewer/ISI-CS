The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PC can smile, Green Hunt is hurting 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      PC can smile, Green Hunt is hurting 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                      on guerrilla guard                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 8: The Maoists have admitted losses to leadership and ranks that have affected them seriously, saying these mostly happened after May 2009.        
	A two-page message, purportedly circulated by the CPI (Maoist) central committee among the guerrillas and various party wings, owns up to setbacks in Andhra Pradesh, north Chhattisgarh and north Orissa. It also appears to hint at fissures within the organisation over strategy.        
	The message, of which The Telegraph has a copy, says that since the party was formed in September 2004, it has lost 1,500 martyrs to the enemy. The losses since May last year have been heavier and more serious than before, it concedes and attributes this to the so-called Operation Green Hunt.        
	The Centre has never acknowledged the existence of Green Hunt  supposedly a country-wide offensive against the rebels  but there is enough in the message to please Union home minister P. Chidambaram.        
	Let us consolidate our party as an impregnable fortress and avoid huge losses to leadership and ranks! says the circular, apparently issued by Maoist central committee spokesperson Abhay on September 21, the rebels party formation day.        
	It says that although the movement has suffered setbacks in Andhra and north Chhattisgarh and though we suffered heavy losses in North Odisha, the successes won filled the revolutionary camp with self-confidence.        
	But it concedes that the arrest of politburo member Khobad Ghandy and the killing of Cherukuri Rajkumar alias Azad has hurt the rebels.        
	It says that between May 2009 and July 2010, eight topmost comrades including... Azad and 10 state-level comrades have been caught and killed, and so have been many district-level and lower-rank operatives. These losses all affected our party and movement seriously.        
	In what may be seen as an admission of internal differences, the message stresses the need to look into our strengths and weaknesses, the favourable and unfavourable conditions for the revolution on this occasion.        
	A senior Chhattisgarh police officer said the differences among the Maoists often stemmed from the fact that the CPI (Maoist) was formed by the merger of two parties: the Peoples War Group (PWG) and the Maoist Communist Centre. PWG leader Muppala Lakshmana Rao alias Ganapathy is now the CPI (Maoist) general secretary.        
	The message says the outfits unity congress, held two years ago, had strengthened party unity and chalked out a plan for the advance of the revolution.         
	But the unity congresss success prompted the government to launch Green Hunt and intensify its war on the Maoists at an unprecedented level to annihilate the party leadership, it adds.        
	Since we celebrated our party formation day last year, the war between revolution and counter-revolution... has intensified, says the message, meant for the Peoples Liberation Guerrilla Army, revolutionary peoples committees and all the Maoists mass organisations and cadres.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chatwal at the awards function in Delhi on Wednesday. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, April 8: The home ministry has told a right to information applicant not to share details on the Padma awards with the media, a diktat that smacks of bureaucratic paranoia and has no legal validity.        
	The above information is for the consumption of the applicant and not (repeat not) for publicity in the press, says the ministrys reply to RTI applicant Subhash Chandra Agrawal.        
	The reply contains details of personalities denied the awards despite recommendations from offices as high as that of the Prime Minister. The awards this year have been mired in controversy, particularly over the governments decision to confer the Padma Bhushan on US-based hotelier Sant Singh Chatwal, who faced cases of money laundering till recently.        
	The ministrys instruction has no legal validity. Under the RTI Act, once information is disclosed, it ceases to remain secret and can be accessed by anyone.

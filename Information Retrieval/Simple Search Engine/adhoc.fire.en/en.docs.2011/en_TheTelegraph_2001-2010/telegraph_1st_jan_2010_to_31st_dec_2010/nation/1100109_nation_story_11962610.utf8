          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           HRD minister Kapil Sibal				                                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: The Planning Commission has questioned the human resource development ministrys identification of 374 educationally backward districts that have been promised model colleges, seeking drastic revisions to a landmark project already long overdue.         
	The HRD ministry erred in selecting educationally backward districts and should rework the list in consultation with it, the Planning Commission has commented, responding to the ministrys cabinet note seeking project approval, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The commission in its comments has also asked the ministry to take over the projects implementation completely.         
	Under the present blueprint, the project is a centrally sponsored scheme  the Centre funds states which will set up the colleges. The commission wants the ministry to itself take on responsibility for starting and managing the colleges.         
	The Centres track record in implementing such critical projects is far better than that of the states, commission sources said, explaining their response to the HRD ministry cabinet note.         
	If the Planning Commissions proposals are accepted, the present scheme would need a major overhaul that is likely to further delay a project first promised in 2007. But the ministry may present the plan in its current form to the cabinet  and let it decide whether to tweak the blueprint  sources indicated.         
	Attempts by the HRD ministry to stonewall the Planning Commissions concerns are also likely to delay the project as it may not find unanimous support if placed before the cabinet in its present form.         
	The plan represents a key component of Indias college expansion initiative aimed at assisting the country raise its rate of enrolment into higher education  at present just 12.8 per cent, less than half the global average.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had, in 2007, announced that the government would set up model colleges in educationally backward districts  where the college gross enrolment rate is below the national average.         
	A University Grants Commission panel had in 2007 identified 374 districts  out of around 600  as educationally backward.         
	The XIth Five Year Plan included a promise to build model colleges in each of the identified districts, to act as exemplars for other colleges in the region to emulate.         
	Under the current blueprint, the Centre doles out funds to different states based on their projected requirements and New Delhis independent assessment of the costs required to set up the colleges.         
	But as the launch of the proposal kept getting delayed, the HRD ministry suggested a key change.         
	Existing colleges  set up after the 2007 date when the XIth plan was accepted  should also be allowed to take central funds to upgrade themselves into model colleges, the ministry suggested.         
	The Planning Commission objected to this change, even accusing the ministry of introducing changes in the project blueprint without the sanction of necessary authorities.         
	But the ministry, it is learnt, ignored the Planning Commission objection in preparing the note for the cabinet, which needs to clear the proposal before it can be launched.         
	In its comments to the cabinet note, the commission has iterated its opposition to the HRD ministry proposal to allow existing colleges to benefit from central funds meant for the model institutes.

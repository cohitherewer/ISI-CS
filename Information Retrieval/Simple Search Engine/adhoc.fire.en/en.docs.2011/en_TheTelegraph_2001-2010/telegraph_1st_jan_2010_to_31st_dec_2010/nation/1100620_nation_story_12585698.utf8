                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP sour on aid snub 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, June 19: The BJP today wondered if Nitish Kumar had also returned the feeling of empathy along with the money Gujarat had sent as aid, but Janata Dal (United) chief Sharad Yadav scrambled to defuse the latest spat between the allies.        
	Sharad said the episode was already a thing of the past and wouldnt affect their alliance in poll-bound Bihar.        
	The ties between the two parties are old and they will continue. There is no question of any break-up, he said and added that the unpleasantness over a recent advertisement carrying an old photograph of Nitish and Narendra Modi, arms aloft in solidarity, was a thing of the past.        
	Despite Sharads statement, Nitishs move to return the Rs 5 crore the Gujarat government had donated during the 2008 Kosi floods has left a sour taste.        
	When the money was given it was as a token of solidarity, empathy and grief felt by the people of Gujarat for the flood-affected people of Bihar, BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said.         
	The money was received in the same spirit.... Now because of a certain advertisement, the chief minister has chosen to return the money. I wonder if only the money is being returned or also the feeling of empathy, solidarity and the spirit of togetherness is also being returned, the spokesperson added.         
	The suggestion was Nitishs decision had more to do with pleasing minority community voters with Assembly elections barely months away.        
	Actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha told PTI the move reflected Nitishs arrogance and he urged BJP president Nitin Gadkari and leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj to immediately call Nitishs bluff.

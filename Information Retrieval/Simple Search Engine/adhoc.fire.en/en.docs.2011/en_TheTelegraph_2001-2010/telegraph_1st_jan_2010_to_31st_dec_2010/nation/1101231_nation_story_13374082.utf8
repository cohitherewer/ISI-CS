          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: A two-member team probing allegations of financial irregularities against the Aligarh Muslim University vice-chancellor is likely to be asked to complete the job by January end.        
	The committee, comprising retired high court judges B.A. Khan and A.N. Divecha, had recently come under flak for delay in completion of the probe. President Pratibha Patil had asked the HRD ministry to find out the reasons for the delay.        
	The human resource development ministry is likely to give the committee a final extension till January 31, 2011, to submit its findings on the allegations against P.K. Abdul Azis, sources said.        
	There are eight allegations pending against Azis. He had been accused of drawing leave travel allowance in a fraudulent manner just after joining as VC. Eight former members of the AMU executive council had levelled the allegations.         
	The ministry set up the committee in July this year. It was supposed to submit its report by October 15 but failed to meet the deadline. The ministry then gave it an extension till December 31.        
	The university has spent Rs 43 lakh on this committee till September 15. It has held 10 hearings so far.        
	We have done major part of our work. We had fixed the final hearing for December first week. But the university wanted a deferment. We hope to complete our work at the next hearings on January 14, 15 and 16, Khan said.        
	AMU Court member and former MP Wasim Ahmed today demanded speedy completion of the probe. He met human resource development minister Kapil Sibal on Monday.

          VIVEK CHHETRI                           Mamata on the Toy Train before a ride. (Suman Tamang)                                  
	Darjeeling, Sept. 27: Mamata Banerjee today offered Darjeeling a bouquet of railway initiatives and her blood but sought unity between the plains and the hills and promised to revive a British-era decentralisation gesture.        
	By announcing the package, Mamata has met most of the development demands made by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha.         
	By appealing to the people of the plains and the hills to work together, the Trinamul Congress chief has also sent a message  aimed at both the hills as well as her critics in the plains  that she would not do anything to divide Bengal.        
	The package largely deals with railway infrastructure in the hills. Two promises that will be of interest to tourists: the broad gauge line will be extended to Sukna, which means Darjeeling Mail can travel up to that point, and a luxury train between Siliguri and the hills.         
	Addressing a gathering at the Darjeeling station this afternoon, the railway minister, who was on a two-day visit to the hills, said: Right now, I am only looking after one small place (railway ministry). If I happen to be in a position to give more, I will give more. Trust me as I trust you also. I am ready to give my blood for you.        
	But aware of the adverse fallout that any hint of support for a separate Gorkha state could have on her vote bank in the plains, Mamata made it clear that the people of the hills and the plains would have to work together for the state.        
	There should be no fighting, no divide between the hills and the plains, Mamata told the meeting, the venue of which was packed with Morcha supporters.        
	The people of the hills and the plains have to work together. I am ready to negotiate for the hill people at any forum.        
	Mamata said that she had her own plans to make the hills and the plains interact in harmony. I have lots of ideas for Darjeeling. When I get the place (the state government), I will tell you all the ideas. A secretariat of the state government will be set up in Darjeeling.        
	By promising a secretariat in Darjeeling, Mamata has gone a step ahead of Siddhartha Shankar Ray who, as chief minister, used to shift his office to the hills for a brief period every summer.        
	Ray had picked up from where the British had left off so as to strengthen the ties between the administration and the common people in the hills, said former state Congress PCC chief Pradip Bhattacharya, who used to be the minister of state for labour in Rays cabinet. Every summer, senior officials of the chief ministers secretariat would shift to the hills for a brief period, which could be from a week to a fortnight, sometimes even longer, and even cabinet meetings would be held there.        
	Although some attributed the shift to the cooler climes in the hills, others pointed out that the move did ensure interaction between the local populace and some wings of the administration.        
	However, no permanent secretariat was set up in the hills in Rays days, which Mamata has promised to do in case she becomes the next chief minister. The lieutenant governor of Bengal used to shift his office to Darjeeling every summer during the British Raj.         
	Mamata did not forget to fulfil another assignment that has become obligatory when politicians travel.         
	She spoke briefly to the audience in Nepali: Mato mero atyantai pyaro/Pahar mero sapna/Darjeeling ko bhai bhaini haru ramro rahun/Theyi cha mero kamana (My land is my love and the hills are my dream. My best wishes to the boys and girls of Darjeeling).         
	I am learning Nepali and this is what I could learn within a day. I need to come here frequently.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Aug. 26: The Jammu and Kashmir government today transferred several top civil and police officers and appointed to sensitive posts people who are not local residents in the first major shake-up since the relentless street protests began in June.        
	The posts of Kashmir police chief, the additional director-general of police (law and order), and the principal secretary to the chief minister will be held by experienced officers who are not natives of the state.        
	K. Rajendra, the additional director-general, CID, has been handed law and order.        
	In respect of law and order matters, the two zonal IGs of Kashmir and Jammu shall report to ADGP armed/law and order under the overall command and control of the director-general of police, a police spokesperson said.        
	Earlier, the two inspectors-general had to report directly to the director-general. But with law and order emerging a bigger threat than militancy since the current unrest began, the post of additional director-general, law and order, has been created.        
	Kashmir police chief Farooq Ahmad has been replaced by S.M. Sahai, officer on special duty in the resident commissioners office.        
	Sahai was the Kashmir police chief during the 2008 Amarnath land agitation but was given an insignificant posting last year following his mishandling of the alleged Shopian rape and murder case.        
	Chief minister Omar Abdullah has appointed B.B. Vyas as his principal secretary in place of Khurshid A. Ganai. On the civil side, Samuel Verghese, the financial commissioner, home, has made way for B.R. Sharma, an IAS officer from Jammu.

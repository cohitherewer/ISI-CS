	Patna, Nov. 24: Neither morning nor Vijay Krishnas bluster showed the day. The giant-killers pale face did, three hours later.         
	The landslide day that many Biharis thought their children would never see had a drowsy air about it when counting began at 8am at AN College in Patna.        
	The stillness was probably because of the tight security that regulated the flow of vehicles and diverted many to other routes.        
	At the counting centre, things were heating up  not over the answers locked in the electronic voting machines but because of a breakfast of kachauris and piping cups of tea. The counters and the agents had fortified themselves well before disappearing into the many rooms and sinking their teeth into more weighty matters.         
	The count was on.         
	The first politician arrived around 9am.         
	Krishna, the RJD candidate from Barh, took confident strides towards the counting centre.        
	Known as a giant-killer for defeating Nitish Kumar in the Lok Sabha elections in 2004, Krishna was leading Gyanendra Singh Gyanu of the chief ministers party, Janata Dal (United). I will win. And so will the RJD, Krishna said as he went inside.        
	 When Krishna came out three hours later, a shadow was creasing his face. A wan smile still in place, he folded his hands and left.        
	As if any confirmation was needed, word then spread that Krishnas rival Gyanu, as Gyanendra is fondly known, had picked up pace and was far ahead of Krishna.        
	Krishnas timing was good. Sometime after he left, Gyanu was declared the winner.        
	Then the dam broke.        
	Within hours, everything seemed crystal clear: it was going to be a landslide for Nitish.        
	Half an hour past noon, knots of the ruling combines supporters had taken up position outside the counting centre, chanting slogans, sprinkling colours, dancing and singing.        
	Swelling by the minute, the crowd closely listened to the announcements after each phase of counting.         
	By now, the celebratory cottage industry had caught the sweet smell of success. Vendors selling marigold garlands set up shop yards away from the counting booths. It is a good day. In half an hour, I have sold more than 5kg of gendaphool (marigold). It is really a good day, said one.         
	Not everybody was smelling of roses, though it appeared so in the deceptive initial hours.         
	Ritlal Yadav, lodged in jail for a suspected bomb attack, was way ahead of the BJPs Asha Devi. Yadav was contesting as an Independent from Danapur constituency.         
	Ritlals current hosts  the cops  were taken aback. How can that happen? Had the public gone crazy? How could they have voted for a criminal? asked a policeman.        
	The public soon salvaged their reputation. By 2pm, Ritlal had started to trail and was soon out of the picture. Asha Devi won by a huge margin.         
	But the public did not have much of a choice in Mokama, where the result of a half-proxy fight between dons was unfolding.        
	Anant Singh, the chhote sarkar of Mokama, was trailing. His opponent, Sonam Devi, wife of don Lallan Singh, was winning. Anant contested on a Dal (United) ticket, while Sonam had been fielded by the LJP.         
	Towards the afternoon, the trend changed. Sonam started trailing and soon lost, though the margin of defeat was not too wide.         
	Surrounded by his bodyguards and supporters, Anant came prepared to celebrate and allowed himself to be mobbed.        
	The win is for Nitish Kumar, he said, and moved on.         
	Losers, meanwhile, tried hard to slip away unnoticed. Kamal Pervez, who fought on an LJP ticket in Kumhrar, smiled as he walked out.         
	Second aaya hoon (I have come second), he said, walking away fast.        
	 Pervez Ahmed, who lost to Nand Kishore Yadav from Patna Sahib constituency, did not proffer similar mathematical consolation.        
	Some went by the age-old advice not to count chickens before they are hatched.        
	 Nitin Naveen, the BJP candidate from Bankipore constituency, smiled profusely when he came out of the counting centre but said: I am leading but it is just the early phases. So, I am composed. I will be back again, he said and left.         
	By evening, Naveen had won by a big margin.         
	The morning definitely did not show the day.

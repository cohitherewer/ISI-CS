The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Celibacy rethink after priest abuse 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Celibacy rethink after priest abuse 
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, April 2: The scandal over an American priests abuse of nearly 200 deaf boys on which the Vatican allegedly sat tight has led many Catholics to wonder if the matter of clergy celibacy deserves a second look.        
	It is time we took a second look at the demand for celibacy. It (the celibacy rule) has little to do with spiritual purity and more to do with the offspring of priests inheriting property. The scriptures say nothing about the supposed virtues of celibacy, said a priest with the Changanachery Diocese in Kerala.        
	A former nun who had left to pursue a more honest life after over 20 years in her order said that the insistence on celibacy was the root of many evils that plagued the Church.        
	Since I have lived the life of a nun for more than two decades, I know how celibacy affects the lives of nuns and priests. All sorts of deviant sexual behaviour happens inside monasteries  all because of this inhuman insistence on celibacy, she said.        
	However, Father M.D. Thomas, the national director of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI), said: A minority section in the Church feels that celibacy is unnecessary. The majority of Catholics across the world are of the view that celibacy is very important for a priest.        
	The CBCI document on celibacy says: Celibacy is not an essential element of priesthood, or, in other words, there could be a priesthood which is not celibate, but it is considered an important part of priesthood and a sign of the priests commitment to be free to serve God and his people.        
	There are married Catholic priests in some countries, however, after exceptions were made to the celibacy tradition recently.         
	The Protestant Church allows its priests to marry. The Orthodox Church in India allows married men to be ordained priests but does not allow those already ordained as priests to marry. The Anglican Church allows its priests to marry, with special permission from Rome, but they cannot marry again if their wives die.        
	The Indian Catholic Church, like most other Catholic denominations, has supported Pope Benedict XVI, whose name has surfaced in the abuse scandal because he was the Vaticans chief doctrinal enforcer in the 1970s.        
	There is also evidence that Reverend Lawrence C. Murphy, the priest accused of sexual abuse between 1950 and 1974, wrote to the Pope, who was then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger in Germany, and requested leniency.        
	The Vaticans rationale is that Father Murphy was elderly and in poor health, that he was living in seclusion, and that no allegations of abuse had been reported against him in over 20 years.

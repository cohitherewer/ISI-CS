          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Lalu Prasad at the Yadav Jagaran Manch convention in Patna on Friday. Picture by Deepak Kumar                                  
	Patna, May 21: Caste politics  a synonym of Bihars statecraft  is becoming intense with the polls getting closer.        
	Its master player Lalu Prasad was at his best today, as he succeeded in disassociating the Yadav Jagaran Manch (Yadav Awareness Forum) from the ruling JD(U) and getting it in the RJD fold.        
	It was once friend-turned-foe Ranjan Yadav, who formed the manch to replace Lalu as the Yadav leader. Ranjan succeeded in his gamble to an extent as he delved into the Yadav vote and combined it with the JD(U)s base to defeat the RJD boss in Patna Sahib in last years Lok Sabha poll.        
	But the manch today expelled its founder, Ranjan, and accepted Lalu as its leader. Its convener Dharmendra Yadav adorned Lalu with a silver crown, shouting: Desh ka neta kaisa ho, Lalu Yadav jaisa ho (The countrys leader should be like Lalu).        
	Lalu was at his eloquent best once he saw the huge gathering of the Yadavs at the meeting. Yadavs are the largest caste in Bihar and constitute about 15 per cent of the states population. Nitish Kumar tried to make inroads into the Yadav votes by getting Sharad Yadav as the JD(U) president and Ranjan winning against Lalu.        
	But the Yadav Manch crowning Lalu came as music to the ears of the self-claimed Yadav chieftain  Lalu. Yadavs endowed with strength and numerical preponderance should spearhead the battle of other poor and downtrodden castes and social groups, the RJD boss said, asking his caste-men to show Nitish the door.        
	Though fighting against each other, Lalus RJD and the Congress have been consistently targeting the base of Nitish-led JD(U). The Congress is keeping a close watch on the JD(U) rebels led by party MP from Munger, Lallan Singh.        
	Lallan, of late, has been praising the Congress and abusing the chief minister and his government. Nitish has done nothing in over four years except pocketing the credit for spending the funds given by the Congress-led government at the Centre for carrying out development work, Lallan and other members of the Kisan Mahapanchayat  the forum of JD(U) rebels  have been repeating these days. Most of the JD(U) rebels also belong to the land-owning upper castes that suit the Congresss politics in this part of the country.        
	Before inducting the manch, Lalu organised a rally of the Vaishyas (business caste) and flagged off a vaishya rath in a bid to rope in the Telis (a sub-caste of the Vaishyas), primarily living in the rural areas from the JD(U)-BJP fold.

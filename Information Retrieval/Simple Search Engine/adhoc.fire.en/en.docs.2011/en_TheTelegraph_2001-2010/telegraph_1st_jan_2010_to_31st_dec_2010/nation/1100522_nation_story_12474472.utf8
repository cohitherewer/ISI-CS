The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPI rejects 300 acres formula
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CPI rejects 300 acres formula
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 21: Rejecting chief minister Naveen Patnaiks formula of excluding 300 acres of private land from the proposed Posco steel plant site near Paradip, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan today reiterated the partys demands for total relocation of the project.        
	Just leaving 300 acres of private land out of a total land requirement of 4,000-odd acres is a ridiculous idea. This cannot be a solution to the problem, Bardhan told reporters here today.        
	Its not just a question of land acquisition, it involves the livelihood of thousands of people. They have been cultivating paddy, betel and cashew nut on this fertile land since a number of generations. The entire project should be shifted to a site where displacement will be much less, he said.        
	Yesterday, Naveen had told the media, after holding a meeting with local MP and legislators of the district, that his government would ask Posco to squeeze its land requirements by 300 acres of private land located in Dhinkia, the epicentre of the anti-steel plant movement.         
	Terming the outcome of the meeting as very disappointing, the CPI stalwart said since some 4,000 acres were needed for the plant, leaving out only 300 acres private land in Dhinkia village made no sense. What is the point in requesting Posco to give up 300 acres? Posco is not the master of the land. Its for the state government and the people to decide when, where and how much land to be given to an industrial project, he said.        
	Stating that the state governments decision to hold talks with the affected people has opened up a small window after five years, the CPI veteran said: We are prepared to have talks. But we will raise the question about the status of 3,000-odd acres of forest land and livelihood issues.        
	Any effort to acquire land pending dialogue would be opposed by our party, he said.

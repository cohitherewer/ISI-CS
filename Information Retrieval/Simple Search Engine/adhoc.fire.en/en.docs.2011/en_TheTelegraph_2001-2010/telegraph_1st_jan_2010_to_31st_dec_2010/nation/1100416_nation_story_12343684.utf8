	Chandragama (Bihar), April 15: Their world came crumbling down even before they could figure out what had struck them.        
	Nazimul, a resident of Lukani village in Bihars Purnea district, his wife Sakeera Khatun and their five children, aged between five months and 13 years, were sleeping in the verandah of their one-roomed mud house on Tuesday night when the storm struck. Their eldest daughter, Sahira Begum, 16, was sleeping at a neighbours house.        
	Woken up by the lashing rain in the darkness, they found their tin roof blown away by the storm, which, scientists said, was a tornado-like phenomenon.         
	Exposed to the storm, Nazimul, Sakeera and the kids tried to take shelter beneath a charpoy. But by then, the mud walls of their hut had already started to cave in.         
	Not thinking about his own life, Nazimul threw his children out into the open. But before he could reach Sakeera, she was crushed under a wall.         
	She died despite my best efforts, Nazimul, who has been left with a broken back after a wall fell on him, said on way to hospital. The children have escaped with minor injuries.        
	The storm has left in its wake utter destruction. Most of the 1,000 houses in Lukani have been destroyed, their roofs blown away. The villagers have lost their cattle, their maize plants have been damaged.         
	Rubble of fallen houses, roofless homes, affected maize fields, uprooted trees and electric poles complete the picture of destruction in the 30-km stretch covering Baisi, Pokharia, Lukani and Chandragama.         
	The Telegraph found Nazimuls children standing helplessly amid the heap of the debris of their home on Thursday. Five-month-old Naz Fatima was crying in Sahiras lap, apparently hungry. Sharifan Bano, their step-grandmother, had been seeking alms from neighbours and passers by to buy food for the children.        
	Nazimuls family, like the majority of the villagers, are landless farmers. Most of the residents of the Muslim-dominated village live below the poverty line.         
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar yesterday announced compensation of Rs 1.5 lakh for the dependants of those killed in the storm. He has also promised financial assistance to re-build the houses.         
	But none of the help has reached Lukani so far. Not a single government official was visible at the village today.         
	Not to speak of district officials, even the village head has not visited us so far, said Sikandar Mia, 70.         
	Many villagers could be seen walking barefoot in search of the tin roofs of their homes. More than 83 people have died in Bihar so far.

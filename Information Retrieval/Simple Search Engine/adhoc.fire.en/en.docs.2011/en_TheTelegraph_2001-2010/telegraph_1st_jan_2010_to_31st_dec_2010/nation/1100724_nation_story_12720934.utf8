The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hands tied, cops brave attacks
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hands tied, cops brave attacks
  - Stone-throwing youths mock police with no power to fire        SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                                   
	Sopore (North Kashmir), July 23: A mob that has wreaked recurrent mayhem demands the removal of a police officer who has stood in their way and repulsed their daily assaults. The government pulls him back.         
	In another district, a station chief locks up half-a-dozen miscreants for stoking anger with rumours that jawans have been attacking interior village mosques. He is phoned within an hour by superiors and instructed to release the men.         
	At an embattled barricade in downtown Srinagar, an inspector threatens tear gas and fire on masked boys if they dont halt hurling stones and retreat. Go on, go on! mocks one of them in challenge, undeterred in his offensive. We know you have no power to fire, your bosses wont let you! The boys press on with their violent barrage, the inspector retreats in defence.         
	Security forces across the Valley are getting trampled in the trenches in pursuit of thankless tasks, rampaged by angry throngs, reined in by a government that cant seem to summon the resolve to exercise authority and put a lid on this protracted eruption.         
	We have been deployed with our hands tied behind our backs, complains a top police officer. We are getting slammed equally for not being able to control violence and for quelling it. They are throwing stones at us, we cant be firing flowers in return, we are almost in a civil war, there will be deaths and injuries if we are to end it.         
	Another officer, recently returned from failed crowd control in South Kashmir, sounded harsher and more helpless. The government should realise these are not Gandhian protesters, they know we have no orders to take hard measures, they are emboldened, they are getting harsh on us, what is a policeman like me meant to do faced with an inflamed mob, apply the healing touch? The government is just leading them on, and my jawans are getting trodden over. The chief minister says this is a battle of ideas and ideologies, then let him wage it, policemen are not trained for ideological warfares, we are footsoldiers, have us on the ground fighting or just withdraw us.         
	The barracks are fuming at being barred their quotidian powers and at being blamed for failure. Let the police behave like the police does to restore law and order and it shall lie restored, they promise. But if strong medicine is what the forces are prescribing, it is a prospect that shivers the Omar Abdullah government. It doesnt want deaths, it doesnt want crackdowns, it doesnt want street confrontation.         
	The problem is, the angered street does, it is looping the government into daily confrontation, inviting crackdowns, inviting more deaths. Thats the fodder secessionists and their anonymous backers feed on. Theyve caught Omar Abdullahs government in a tight cleft  it cant draw too much blood, it cant be itself bloodied beyond a point, it rocks precariously on that slippery dilemma. The issue is that every death will bring another round of reprisal, says a senior bureaucrat, in defence of the governments kid-glove mode. Things need to calm down, and they probably will in time, we have to wait and watch.         
	His words ring less of policy, more of prayer. Indeed, there are those among the sympathisers of this confounded dispensation who have begun to look heavenwards with hope: perhaps the onset of Ramazan, the holy month that begins on August 11, will turn this ugly tide, wait and helplessly watch.         
	But the hardline Hurriyat underground is already dispelling speculations of peace during the introspections of Ramazan; they arent about to repeat the error of the land agitation of 2008 when they took a Ramazan break and the movement lost its temper. Another calendar of restrictions is already on the anvil, the promise of continued unrest to the people by the hardline Hurriyat underground.         
	But for how long? The Valley has been in ferment for more than a month now. Seventeen have fallen to street hostilities. Scores lie injured, among them many jawans. Civil shutdown has become the norm. The adversaries of the State have become the State, they dictate closures and openings, they order disruption and calm, they have the agency on command and compliance.         
	Life in the Valley erupts and evaporates to their widely-circulated time-tables. Curfew all week, the separatists bid, and it has been curfew all week. Hukumat kiski chalti hai yahan? asks a peeved bakery owner in old Sopore who has barely had reason to stoke his ovens recently, Hukumat hai masjidon ke eilaan ki, sarkar ki nahin. Woh dam dikhate hain, sarkar dande bajati hai.        
	(Who rules this place? The call from the mosques, not the government. They have the power, the government only beats its batons.)        
	Ask Kashmirs policemen and theyd tell you if only the government had beaten the baton hard enough.

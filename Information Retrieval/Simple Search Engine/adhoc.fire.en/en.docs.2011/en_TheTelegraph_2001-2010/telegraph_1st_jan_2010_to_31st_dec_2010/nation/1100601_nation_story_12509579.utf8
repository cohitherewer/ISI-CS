The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tribals snub Morcha
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tribals snub Morcha
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Siliguri, May 31: The Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad, the dominant tribal organisation in north Bengals Terai and the Dooars, has ruled out any understanding with Gorkha Janmukti Morcha in its statehood movement.        
	Morcha chief Bimal Gurung had announced before a Darjeeling gathering yesterday that he had rechristened Gorkhaland as Gorkha Adivasi Pradesh in an attempt to make the demand more palatable to the tribals who dominate the Terai and the Dooars. The Morcha wants the two areas to be part of the proposed state.        
	We are not ready to attach the slightest importance to what Bimal Gurung said yesterday. And, under no circumstances will the tribals in the Terai and the Dooars join the Morcha or express solidarity (with it) for its so-called demand for Gorkha Adivasi Pradesh, Birsa Tirkey, the state president of the Parishad, said today.         
	Gurung had appealed to the Parishad to sit for a meeting soon saying we have changed the name for them. Gurung had also announced that he would hold three public meetings in the Dooars jointly with the Parishad.         
	The Parishad has already released a map comprising the tribal belts demanding Sixth Schedule status which, it believes, will help develop the backward tribal region.         
	We will continue to strive for our cause and have already met officials and ministers at the state and central levels. There is no question of changing our stand. The Nepali-speaking people comprise 8 to 10 per cent of the population in these areas. The tribals make up around 80 per cent. It is sheer irrationality on the part of the Morcha leadership to think that the majority population will allow themselves to be governed from the hills by the minority, Tirkey said.         
	Asked if the Parishad would attend any meeting with the Morcha, Tezkumar Toppo, state secretary of the tribal outfit, said: We will not attend any such meeting called by the Morcha. Who are they to call us for talks, that too, on an issue which we are opposing? However, if the state or the Centre invites us to discuss our demands, we will definitely attend it.        
	Toppo said Gurungs announcement is a conspiracy to derail our movement and create tension. We will not part with any portion of the Terai and the Dooars for the separate state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | College files under CBI glare missing 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      College files under CBI glare missing 
  - Documents of 5 Calcutta tech institutes vanish during probe          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     
	New Delhi, June 3: Files of seven technical colleges that the CBI has been probing for corruption have gone missing, triggering a frantic search.         
	Five of the seven cases, in which institutions allegedly bribed top officials at Indias apex technical education regulator in return for looking away from violation of quality norms, pertain to Calcutta engineering colleges.         
	The CBI has now formed two teams of investigators to trace these missing files, which officials suspect may have even been destroyed to cover up crucial evidence of corruption, top investigating officials have told The Telegraph.         
	Crucial files related to corruption have a way of disappearing when cases are being investigated. We are determined to pinpoint responsibility for the disappearance and, if possible, trace the files, a source said.         
	The CBI summoned S.S. Mantha, the chairman of the at the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), which is the apex authority for technical education, to its headquarters near Lodhi Road here on May 26, sources said. Mantha was quizzed about the missing files.         
	The meeting was attended by three deputy inspector-generals and a superintendent of police  all from the CBI  investigating the corruption cases, the sources said.         
	It was decided at the meeting to set up two probe teams to search for the missing files and track responsibility for their disappearance.         
	The chairman (Mantha) has been extremely co-operative and has assured us his support in finding the missing files and pursuing the cases, a source said.         
	The sources refused to divulge at this stage the names of the institutions that allegedly bribed AICTE officials but disclosed that apart from the five Calcutta institutions, the remaining two cases pertained to Rajasthan institutions.         
	They also confirmed that they had informed the human resource development ministry about the missing files.         
	The CBIs glare on the AICTE over missing files is the latest in a steady stream of embarrassments, which the technical education regulator has been facing since last year.         
	Investigators from the CBI conducted a series of raids at AICTE offices across the country in July 2007. AICTE member-secretary K. Narayan Rao was arrested after sleuths caught him red-handed accepting a bribe.         
	The CBI also filed an FIR against the then AICTE chairman R.A. Yadav and raided his Delhi home.         
	Yadav was suspended by the HRD ministry, which had earlier given its consent for action against the AICTE and its officials.         
	Over the following months, the CBI raided several colleges and AICTE offices, even appealing publicly to ordinary citizens to come forward with complaints against the tainted regulator.         
	The punitive action against the AICTE and its officials followed years of complaints and allegations from institutions that the regulator would demand bribes in exchange for granting recognition.

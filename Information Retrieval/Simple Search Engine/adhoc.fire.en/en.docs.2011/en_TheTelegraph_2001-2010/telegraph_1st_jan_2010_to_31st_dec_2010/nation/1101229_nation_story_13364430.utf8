          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Dec. 28: The Uttarakhand Kranti Dal today formally withdrew support to the Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank regime, claiming the BJP had trampled over the common minimum programme agreed on in 2007.        
	The pullout is not likely to have much effect on the BJP-led government as the party has 34 legislators in the 70-member Assembly and the support of two Independents. The UKD has only three MLAs.        
	An 11-member UKD team, led by Trivendra Singh Panwar, met Uttarakhand governor Margaret Alva in Dehra Dun this morning and said the party was pulling out because of the present political situation and in the interest of the people of the state.        
	Among the issues the UKD is cut up over is the proposed shift of the state capital from Dehra Dun to Gairsain. The party has been pitching for it on grounds that Gairsain is centrally located between Kumaon and Garhwal, so it would lead to development of Kumaon and stop people from leaving the state.        
	It said the BJP had done nothing despite the sacrifice of Baba Mohan Uttarakhandi, who died in August 2004 after fasting for 39 days for Gairsain.        
	The UKD also alleged that the BJP did not try hard enough to keep dam projects going from the state, including the Loharinag Pala power project that was scrapped in August after environment groups forced a review. It said it would have to dissociate itself from the BJP if it had to stand by the people of Uttarakhand.        
	Although there is no immediate threat to the stability of the Nishank government, sources said trouble could brew if chief minister aspirants B.C. Khanduri and B.S. Koshiyari rear their heads.

	Houston, Sept. 9 (PTI): Indian filmmaker Vijay Kumar has pleaded no contest after being convicted of illegally carrying brass knuckles in his luggage, so he can finally return home.         
	Kumar was convicted yesterday of illegally carrying the knuckles in his checked airport baggage. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanour weapons charge in exchange for time served and could be returned to India in about a week.         
	The filmmaker has been sentenced to 20 days in jail and given credit for time served. Kumar agreed to the plea deal to avoid further jail time and immigration charges.         
	Hes just a victim of circumstance, said his attorney, Grant Scheiner. They should have just dismissed the case once they found out he had relied on a transportation security administration website, he added.         
	I dont think he wants to come back to America again, the attorney said.         
	Forty-year-old Kumar, a resident of Malad in Mumbai, was detained at Houston airport on August 20 by security personnel who said he was acting suspiciously and had Islamic fundamentalist literature in his bag.         
	The filmmaker had been invited to Houston to participate in a Hindu outfits conference.

	Mumbai, Aug. 29 (PTI): A Right to Information activist who had exposed corruption in the public distribution system in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra has been found dead in Nanded.         
	Police in Nanded, about 650km from Mumbai, registered a case of sudden death, after 43-year-old Ramdas Ghadegavkars body was found late on Friday night.        
	The post-mortem report revealed excess alcohol in the body, the police said. His brother has told the police that Ramdas had left home around 8am on Friday.        
	Ramdass death comes weeks after the murder of another RTI activist, Amit Jethwa, in Gujarat. He had exposed illegal mining in the Gir forest region.         
	Jethwa was shot dead near Gujarat High Court on July 20 after he filed a public interest litigation against illegal mining.

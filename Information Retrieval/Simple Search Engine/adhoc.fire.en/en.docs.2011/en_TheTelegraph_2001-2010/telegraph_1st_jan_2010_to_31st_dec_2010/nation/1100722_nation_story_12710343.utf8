The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihar ruckus continues
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bihar ruckus continues
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          An RJD MLA being marshalled out of the Assembly in Patna on Wednesday. (Deepak Kumar)                                   
	Patna, July 21: As many as 67 Opposition MLAs were suspended and marshalled out of the House today after they created a ruckus louder than yesterdays, inside and outside Bihar Assembly, which saw slippers and flowerpots flying freely.        
	The two houses of the bicameral state legislature saw the worst ever turmoil in nearly five years of the Nitish Kumar-led NDA rule for the second consecutive day with Speaker Udainaryan Choudhary visibly clueless about how to keep the House in order.        
	The otherwise sober legislative council too was taken over by the bedlam. Unable to restore order in chaotic upper House, the marshal and watch and ward staff threw out 16 Opposition members from the House. But this was not the end of the drama. A woman Congress member, Jyoti Kumari, turned hysterical and got into a scuffle with the watch and ward staff and threw flower pots in the corridors.        
	The Opposition  comprising RJD, LJP, Congress and the Left  have been demanding resignation of chief minister Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi in the wake of Patna High Court ordering a CBI probe into an alleged Rs 11,412-crore scam. The amount was drawn from the state treasuries between 2002-03 and 2007-08.        
	While the Bihar legislature replicated the scene of the Uttar Pradesh House yesterday, it replicated the Karnataka Assembly scene today with at least 80 members sitting in dharna in the well of the House and five others doing the same outside the House throughout the night demanding resignation of Nitish and his deputy.        
	If Nitish stayed out of the House throughout the day, his silent and sombre deputy, Sushil Modi, and his ruling coalition colleagues were there to receive the flying flowerpots.         
	Sources in the House revealed that the security men foiled Lalu Prasads efforts to enter the House in the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday.        
	The RJD boss, however, today admitted that he did try to enter the House. I did nothing wrong while trying to enter the House I have represented several times, Lalu said.

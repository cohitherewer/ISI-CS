          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, July 28: Mamata Banerjee today met Manmohan Singh and was learnt to have sought a CBI probe into the Sainthia train crash, saying she feared foul play in the police probe in Left-ruled Bengal.        
	The railway minister termed the meeting, coming at a time the Left is girding up to turn the heat on her in Parliament over the recent spate of accidents, merely a courtesy visit.        
	But Trinamul Congress sources said Mamata had told the Prime Minister she didnt trust the CID probe and alleged that the Left was out to defame her ahead of next years Assembly polls.         
	Railway Board chief Vivek Sahai has also sought a CBI probe. Earlier, the Centre had ordered a CBI probe into the Jnaneswari Express accident on Mamatas demand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP price jab at govt, not Pawar
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP price jab at govt, not Pawar
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: BJP chief Nitin Gadkari today belatedly woke up to rising food prices and warned that the Congresss hand was out to strangle the poor, refusing to pin all the blame on food minister Sharad Pawar.         
	The over 100 per cent rise in the prices of wheat, rice, sugar and pulses over the last few months made the BJP president wonder: Is the UPA government competing with (Sachin) Tendulkar, (Virender) Sehwag and (M.S.) Dhoni to score centuries in economic achievement?         
	Despite NCP chief Pawars role as the protagonist in the food-price saga, his potential as a coalition wrecker and importantly, the Maratha-leader aura shrouding his persona and politics, checked the BJP and its Maharashtrian chief from launching an all-out offensive against him.        
	Pawar is responsible but he alone is not responsible. Can a decision to export 48 lakh tonnes of sugar be passed without the cabinets endorsement? The PM, finance minister, commerce minister and Sonia Gandhi are equally responsible for the mess. The Congress and the NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) are together skimming off the cream that has been collected from the insider commodities trading.

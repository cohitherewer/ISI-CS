	New Delhi, Sept. 20: Delhi police today did a somersault by saying yesterdays shooting outside the Jama Masjids gates could be a terrorist act but confessed they were clueless about the attackers identities.        
	We are probing all the angles, police commissioner Y.S. Dadwal said about the 11.25am attack, when a motorbikes pillion rider sprayed bullets on a group of six Taiwanese tourists as they stepped out of the mosque, injuring two.        
	Told that the police spokesperson had yesterday ruled out the involvement of any organised group and blamed some disgruntled youths, Dadwal said: I dont know who said that.        
	A police source suggested a possible reason for the change of heart: the discovery of traces of the explosive ammonium nitrate and two timers (improvised clocks) in a suspected car bomb that went up in flames 60 metres from the firing spot, two hours after the shooting.        
	Yesterday, the police had denied any link between the two incidents  nor did they or the home ministry acknowledge any connection today  but sources said the polices special cell, specialists on terror cases, had been asked to help with the probe.        
	The police said yesterdays terror email, sent purportedly by the Indian Mujahideen two hours after the firing, had been traced to Mumbais western suburbs. The connection was in a womans name but it appeared to have been obtained with the help of forged papers.        
	Sleuths from the National Investigation Agency and the Maharashtra anti-terrorist squad searched the area but found no one by that name. Authorities declined to give the name or the location.        
	One of yesterdays victims, Zeweie Ku, whose skull was grazed by a bullet, was discharged from hospital today. Chiang Kh, operated for a bullet in the abdomen, is still in critical care.        
	The other four members of the group checked out of their hotel in Safdarganj. They were very scared, a hotel employee said.        
	Joy Yen, director, Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in New Delhi, said the four had been shifted to a safer location. She said the group, which worked for a TV channel, had dropped its plans of shooting a documentary in India. She said around 24,000 people from Taiwan visited India last year.        
	A senior officer said the investigation had not made much headway. Teams have left for Azamgarh, Saharanpur and Meerut (all in Uttar Pradesh) to look for leads.        
	The police have sent the car bombs contents, which include the upper lid of a pressure cooker, some wires and a plastic box, for forensic tests whose results will be known tomorrow. But officers insisted that the car fire was not the result of an explosion caused by the crudely circuited device.        
	The police beefed up security across the city, sent 200 personnel armed with automatic rifles to patrol around the Jama Masjid, and posted plainclothes personnel inside.        
	Most of the shops near the scene of the shooting stayed closed but over 300 foreign tourists visited the mosque today. It was unbelievable, a policeman said.        
	Hart Crawford and his girlfriend Jill from Canada didnt look worried. We knew that the day after such an incident, there would be enough security, Crawford said.        
	The US, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, though, have issued travel advisories to their citizens. The shooting has raised security fears over the October 3-14 Commonwealth Games, and many countries that are expected at the event had yesterday made anxious calls to the Delhi police.

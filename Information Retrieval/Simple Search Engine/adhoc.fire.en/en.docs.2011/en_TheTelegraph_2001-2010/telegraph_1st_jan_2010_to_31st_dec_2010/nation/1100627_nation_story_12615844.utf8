	Fighter aircraft and mid-air tankers of the Indian, French and Singaporean air forces are taking part in Exercise Garuda 2010 over the Istres Air Base in France.         
	An IAF officer said the aircraft had flown more than 60 missions in the war games that are to conclude on June 25. Six Indian Air Force Sukhoi-30MKI (in picture) along with the Mirage-2000-5 and the Rafale of the French Air Force and the Singaporean Air Forces F-16 practised air defence manoeuvres like implementation of no-fly zones and large force engagements during day and night.         
	The SU-30 also took part in the high-value air-borne asset protection as well as protection-busting missions.         
	Air Marshal K.K. Nowhar of the IAF said: Our participation in the exercise has reinforced the manner in which we conduct our operations. It has also helped us refine our doctrine. In future, there is a slim chance that a country will operate in isolation, especially in a co-operative defence scenario. Thus knowing each others best practices... is the main objective of this exercise.

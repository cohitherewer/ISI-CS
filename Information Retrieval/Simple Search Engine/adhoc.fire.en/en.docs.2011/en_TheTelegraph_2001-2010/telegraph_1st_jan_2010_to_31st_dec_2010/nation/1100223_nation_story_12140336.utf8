The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Terror core concern at Pak talks: Rao
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Terror core concern at Pak talks: Rao
          AMIT ROY                          Nirupama Rao in London on Monday. (AFP)                                  
	London, Feb. 22: Indias core concern will be whether the Pakistani government is able to dismantle the terrorist groups that have found safe havens on its territory, Nirupama Rao, Indias foreign secretary, said in London today on the eve of her talks in Delhi with her Pakistani opposite number Salman Bashir.         
	After she had given an overview of Indias foreign policy in an address to the International Institute of Strategic Studies, she was asked by a Pakistani journalist whether Kashmir would figure in the talks.         
	The issue here is how does cross-border terrorism and terrorist safe havens in territory contiguous to ours  Pakistan  how do you tackle that? That really is at the core of our concerns today, she said.         
	As far as the issue of Jammu and Kashmir is concerned, this is something we must discuss bilaterally and resolve peacefully. The talks would be slow and deliberate.        
	Our core concerns are terrorism, she repeated. When we talk to Pakistan this has been an issue we have consistently emphasised: terrorist havens in Pakistan must be dismantled.        
	She argued that India had legitimate interests in Afghanistan. The greatest threat to peace and stability in our region emanates from the shelter terrorists find in the border of Afghanistan/Pakistan and in Pakistan itself. India was not too keen on the western policy of talking to the Taliban, she indicated.         
	The prudence of reintegration should be tackled with prudence, the benefit of hindsight, foresight and caution. We believe that any integration process in Afghanistan should be Afghan led and should include only those who abjure violence, give up armed struggle and terrorism and are willing to abide by the values of democracy, pluralism and human rights as enshrined in the Afghan constitution.         
	India is an important neighbour of Afghanistan and we share undeniably close ties that have endured through centuries into present times.        
	This led her on to analyse Indias ties with Pakistan. Our relationship with Pakistan is complex. Out of our desire for peaceful and good neighbourly relations with Pakistan, we have repeatedly taken initiatives in the past to improve the relationship. You are aware that the dark forces of terrorism have sought to erase the good that stemmed from such well intentioned initiatives. We are now making another attempt at dialogue.        
	She included a warning: However, calls for jihad, hostility and aggression continue to be made openly against India. This reflects the real and tangible difficulties that we face in dealing with Pakistan. If the process of normalisation that we desire with Pakistan is to be sustained and taken forward, effective action against such groups by the government of Pakistan is an absolute must.        
	She acknowledged the Pakistani government had made some progress in this regard. Under pressure and faced with the threat of terrorism in its own country, Pakistan has initiated some steps to fight this scourge but unfortunately such steps are selective. Distinctions between the Taliban, al Qaida and terrorist outfits such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba are now meaningless since they are now, in effect, fused both operationally and ideologically.        
	We have consistently maintained that Pakistan should bring the perpretrators of the Mumbai terrorist attack to justice expeditiously and in a transparent manner. It should act decisively to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism on its territory.         
	Rao, who flew back to Delhi immediately after delivering her keynote address, said: India is making another sincere attempt to initiate dialogue with Pakistan. I have invited my counterpart, the foreign secretary of Pakistan, to Delhi for discussions later this week. We hope we can build in a graduated manner better communication and a serious and responsible dialogue to address issues of concern between our two countries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Reddy there, Yeddy next door: high commands face southern revolts
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Reddy there, Yeddy next door: high commands face southern revolts
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Jaganmohan Reddy, B.S. Yeddyurappa                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: The BJP was not short of alibis to explain why B.S. Yeddyurappa was retained as Karnataka chief minister despite the fact that the moral pedestal atop which it delivered homilies on public probity to the Congress got shaky: he was a powerful Lingayat leader, an adept election winner, a friend of the farmers, etc.         
	As fresh graft allegations tumbled out after the reprieve Yeddyurappa earned, nobody in the BJP would admit to the stark reality its cadres were beginning to accept: the writ of the high command had diminished.        
	Yeddyurappa might have neutralised his Delhi bosses. But his nemesis, the Reddy brothers of Bellary, were unlikely to leave him alone for long, his aides admitted. Perhaps Yeddyurappa has a soulmate in K. Rosaiah, the former Andhra Pradesh chief minister.        
	The Reddys piled their fortunes by mining the shallow iron-ore pits strewn across Anantpur and Kurnool in Andhra, bordering Karnataka, under the indulgent gaze of Rosaiahs predecessor, the late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. Nobody in the Congress openly spoke of the alleged links between the Bellary barons and YSR. But there were enough hints that his son and political legatee, Jaganmohan Reddy sustained the relations nurtured by his father.        
	At least Jagans followers suspected a political motive when Rosaiah suspended the mining leases the Reddys held in Andhra soon after becoming the chief minister. However, unlike a weighty central leader of the BJP who was often seen in their company, Jagan was never open about the Bellary connection.        
	He had at least 58 more Reddys to bolster his political ambitions in the 158-member Congress legislature party. Thats the kind of support he had when YSR died until he began blowing up his legacy by letting his ambitions surpass that of the Congress high commands expectations.        
	The Delhi leaders wanted Jagan to abide this time until they absorbed the political ramifications of the vacuum his father left in the Congresss electoral gold mine and sorted out the Telengana tangle.         
	The MP refused to heed the signals from 10 Janpath and did everything he could to provoke action: from going on an independent yatra and daring his leaders to sack him to allegedly vilifying Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh on a news channel he owned.        
	If P.V. Narasimha Rao was helpless against YSR as he revolted against a cabal of M. Channa Reddy and K. Vijayabhaskar Reddy created by the late Prime Minister to check YSR when he headed the Andhra Congress, history very nearly repeated itself when the iron hand refused to discard the velvet glove it wore.        
	Instead, the Congress pulled out less lethal arrows from its quiver to deal with the impatient Jagan: it appointed staunch YSR loyalist Kiran Kumar Reddy as the chief minister and eased out Rosaiah who was blamed for the effete way in which he dealt with Jagan.         
	The Congress, sources said, hoped to kill three birds with this move: erode Jagans influence within the legislature party, sweeten him up if necessary and keep the influential Reddys happy so that their votes remain intact.        
	The Congresss strategy, said sources, will unfold when Kiran Reddy reconstitutes the cabinet. He might induct Jagans loyalists to checkmate his plans, a source said.         
	But the overwhelming view in the Andhra Congress was articulated by an MP from the coastal region who said: The concept of loyalty was turned on its head. Rosaiah left no stone unturned to restate his allegiance, whether it was protesting against Jagans TV channel or (K.S.) Sudarshans attack on Sonia. He went out. This man stays.        
	The regional chief  who leveraged his fathers virasat (legacy) to spook the high command  has put the Congresss nerves and acumen to test. Nobody was sure of the outcome, everybody just hoped that the self-styled satraps of the north like Bhupinder Hooda and Sheila Dikshit would not emulate Jagan.        
	Yeddyurappa crossed the red line betokening obedience when he not only secured a lease of life. He got it on his terms. His only concession to the BJP high command was a vague promise to cleanse the rot. He did it by asking his son and daughter to move out of his official residence.        
	Like Jagan, Yeddyurappas survival in a party structure supposedly reined in by a high command was partially explained by the quality of the BJP leadership in Delhi. It was made up of those who owed their Rajya Sabha berths to its chief ministers (Arun Jaitley to Narendra Modi, M. Venkaiah Naidu to Yeddyurappa) or won their Lok Sabha seats with their help (Sushma Swaraj with Shivraj Singh Chauhans and L.K. Advani with Modis).        
	The word in the Congress was central minister M. Veerappa Moily won his Karnataka election because of YSR and Jagan which was why as the partys Andhra minder, he seemed reluctant to get tough with Jagan.        
	When Prithviraj Chavan sought re-election to the Rajya Sabha, he had to kow-tow to his internal rivals in Maharashtra and his bete noire, Sharad Pawar.         
	The Congress and the BJP, in their own ways, privately admit their loathing for regional parties and their leaders. If either had the powers, they would spirit away the likes of Pawar, Nitish Kumar, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayavati. A Congress source added they might as well add Jagan.

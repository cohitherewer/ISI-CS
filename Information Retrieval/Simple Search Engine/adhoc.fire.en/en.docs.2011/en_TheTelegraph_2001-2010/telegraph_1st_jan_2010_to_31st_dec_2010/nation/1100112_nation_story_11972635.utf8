The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rathore denied immediate relief
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rathore denied immediate relief
                            
	Chandigarh, Jan. 11 (PTI): Disgraced former Haryana DGP S.P.S. Rathore today moved Punjab and Haryana High Court to challenge a sessions court order denying him anticipatory bail in two cases linked to the molestation of Ruchika Girhotra.        
	The court has listed the 67-year-old Rathores petition for hearing tomorrow without giving him any immediate cover against possible arrest.         
	The judge had earlier said the matter would be taken up on Wednesday, but posted it for tomorrow after Rathores lawyer-wife Abha pleaded for an early hearing.        
	 Two fresh first information reports charge Rathore with attempt to murder, wrongful confinement, giving false evidence and doctoring the post-mortem report of Ruchika, who committed suicide three years after being molested by the former IPS officer on August 12, 1990.         
	The trial court had handed Rathore a lighter punishment of six months jail and a fine of Rs 1,000 for molesting the budding tennis player.         
	Abha alleged in court that the cases had been registered under media pressure. We have always maintained that we are ready to join the investigations at any time, she said.        
	 The judge, however, did not pass any order on her submissions.        
	The CBI will probe the fresh FIRs registered by Haryana police against Rathore and others, according to a central notification.

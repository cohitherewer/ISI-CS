          OUR BUREAU                                             
	July 8: The Orissa government today finalised a compensation package for families that will be affected by the Posco project, offering almost twice the market price for paddy fields.        
	The scheme, which offers land, house, a job, unemployment dole and transport allowance (see chart), has been rejected by a resistance group but another organisation took part in the meeting that finalised the package and said its demands had been accepted. Posco India also welcomed the announcement.        
	The affected farmers will be offered Rs 17 lakh per acre for paddy fields and private land, Rs 11.5 lakh per acre for betel vine, 10 decimals of land for each ousted family and an unemployment allowance of Rs 2,250 per month. The price of a paddy field is much more than the Rs 8-10 lakh it fetches in the open market now.        
	The oustees will also be rehabilitated in pucca houses of 443sqft each. Those who have domesticated animals will be given 203sqft more. Prawn cultivators will be compensated by Rs 2 lakh per acre of pond area.        
	This was decided after a four-hour meeting of the rehabilitation and peripheral development advisory committee (RPDAC) at Jagatsinghpur today.        
	Posco had signed an MoU with the Orissa government on June 22, 2005, for setting up a steel plant at an estimated cost of Rs 52,000 crore. However, the project failed to take off because of the land resistance.        
	A breakthrough was made last month after chief minister Naveen Patnaik intervened and directed the district administration to start talks with the locals. He had held talks with both opponents and supporters of the Posco plant separately. Naveen had persuaded the opponents to co-operate with the survey work.        
	Posco Pratirodha Sangram Samiti has rejected outright the compensation package. We are demanding the shifting of the Posco project. We will stick to it. The compensation packagewas just a mockery. It would only intensify the anti-Posco movement, said Samiti president Abhay Sahu.        
	Changing its earlier stand not to attend the meeting, members of the United Action Committee turned up. The committees vice-president Nakulananda Sahu said: Our demands have been accepted. We will now talk to the farmers.

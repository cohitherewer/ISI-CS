The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | DMK tension hint in Maran denial
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      DMK tension hint in Maran denial
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, Nov. 20: DMK leader and former telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran today denied any culpability in the current 2G spectrum controversy, but his remarks appeared to reflect tensions within his party.        
	He indicated that the allegations against A. Raja, who has stepped down as telecom minister over the controversy, could not be extended to him but left Raja to defend himself.        
	Maran, now Union textiles minister, denied media reports suggesting he had pressured Manmohan Singh into changing the terms of reference of a group of ministers over 2G spectrum when he was the telecom minister.        
	The media is making a mountain of my letter to the Prime Minister in 2006 by taking only a selective piece and connecting it to the present scenario, he said.        
	In the letter, released by news channels, Maran had asked for the GoMs terms of reference to be restricted to the quantum of spectrum to be released by the defence ministry while leaving matters of allotment and pricing to the telecom department.        
	Maran said that at that time there was a shortage of spectrum, which he had sought to release from the defence and information and broadcasting ministries.        
	In 2006, there was no controversy over spectrum pricing as spectrum was being given only to existing operators, including BSNL and MTNL, to expand their operations, he said.        
	Its possible to see the claim as implying that the current controversy has its roots in Rajas decision on pricing. Maran exhorted the media not to view all politicians to be guilty till proved innocent.        
	He said Raja was capable of defending himself and was doing a good job of it  a nuanced comment at a time DMK boss M. Karunanidhi and his daughter and MP Kanimozhi have given an explicit clean chit to Raja.        
	When the DMK asked Maran to resign as telecom minister in May 2007, Kanimozhi had helped Raja bag the job. Observers believe there is some tension between the Maran brothers and their cousin Kanimozhi.        
	Maran said the media had taken a routine letter from him to the Prime Minister out of context. Our Prime Minister is a bold and honest leader and it was only a normal interaction between us, he said.        
	That makes Maran the first DMK leader to come out openly in support of Singh, something Karunanidhi and Raja are yet to do at a time the Opposition has targeted the Prime Minister for his silence.

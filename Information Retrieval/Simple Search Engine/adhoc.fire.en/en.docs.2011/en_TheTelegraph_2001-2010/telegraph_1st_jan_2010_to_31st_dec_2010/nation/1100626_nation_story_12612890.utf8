The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong defends petro hike
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong defends petro hike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Jayanthi Natrajan                          
	New Delhi, June 25: The Congress was cautious and hesitant on todays fuel price hike, avoiding even the customary shedding of tears for the aam aadmi.        
	As the increases announced by the Manmohan Singh government evoked scathing criticism from all parties, the Congress leadership appeared to have reconciled to the governments policy of deregulating petroleum pricing despite the realisation that the move was bound to hurt the common man in the beginning.         
	Instead of the rollback cries heard on similar occasions in the past, the Congress defended the decision, with spokesperson Jayanthi Natrajan saying: The government must have been constrained to take these steps.         
	Asked if the party would demand a reduction, she only said: We hope the impact is cushioned as much as possible.        
	Asked about the timing of the decision, when food inflation is hovering around 17 per cent, Natrajan said: The food inflation issue is not unidimensional. It is a very complex matter and not linked to petroleum prices alone. Containing food prices is an ongoing battle which the government is fighting at all levels.         
	Told that the hikes, particularly of diesel, would have a cascading effect on the prices of all commodities, she said: The government would have considered all aspects.        
	The partys measured response indicates its readiness to understand the need for fiscal prudence and the inevitability of freeing petrol pricing from government control.         
	Senior leaders admitted that the decision would hurt the party politically, but also said there was no better time to implement it. The next general election is four years away and people need time to get accustomed to such drastic measures. Bihar is the only state that goes to polls this year and the Congress does not have high stakes there.

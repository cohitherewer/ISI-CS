          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, July 4: For those seeking justice in India, writing in an Indian language can prove a bar.        
	The National Commission for Scheduled Castes has refused to probe allegations of forcible land acquisition in Orissa on the ground that it does not understand Oriya, the language in which the complaints have been made.        
	The commissions Calcutta office, which covers cases relating to Orissa, has written back to its headquarters in Delhi saying it is not in a position to take any action on the complaints from Dalit villagers.        
	The complaints say the Orissa government, in collusion with contractors, has been forcibly displacing thousands of poor Dalits since 2008 to make way for the Salandi Sanskar irrigation project in Bhadrak district.        
	The commissions Delhi office had in May last year forwarded the complaints to its Calcutta branch for a probe. But the deputy director of the Calcutta office, S.K. Naskar, said in his reply: There is nobody in this office who has even a little bit of knowledge of reading or writing in (the) Oriya language.        
	A senior police officer in Calcutta said official complaints can be lodged in any Indian language, and it is up to the government agency to get it translated. Theres no pool of translators with the government; its the agencys responsibility to look for translators, he said.        
	The commissions Calcutta office has returned the complaints to the Bhadrak collector for action. This amounts to asking the accused to deal with a complaint against them, Orissa lawyer Radhakant Tripathy said.        
	Tripathy had filed the first complaint  in English  on May 4 last year. After that, many villagers from the area sent their own petitions in Oriya.

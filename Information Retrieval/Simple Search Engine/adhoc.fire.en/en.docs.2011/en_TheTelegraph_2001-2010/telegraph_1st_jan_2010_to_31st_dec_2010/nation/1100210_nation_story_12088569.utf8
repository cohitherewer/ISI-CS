The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul to visit   Azamgarh
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rahul to visit   Azamgarh

	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Rahul Gandhi could soon be on the road to Azamgarh as part of the Congresss healing-touch policy for the maligned heartland district, unfazed by protests over a party veterans recent visit to the cradle of terrorism.        
	Sources said Rahuls visit would be aimed at correcting the negative impression about the Uttar Pradesh district, which shot into notoriety after police picked up several alleged terror suspects following the September 2008 Batla House encounter in Delhi.        
	In Azamgarh, Rahul is expected to meet students at Shibli National College, a respected institution established by scholar Allama Shibli Nomani that had patrons like Mahatma Gandhi, Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru and Zakir Hussain.        
	Some of those facing terror charges also studied in this college. But there is a deep sense of anguish among current students and the local population in general that the whole of Azamgarh  also the home of dons Dawood Ibrahim and Abu Salem  was being painted with the same brush.        
	Sources said Digvijay Singh, who met Sonia Gandhi today to submit a report on his visit to Azamgarh, made a forceful plea for Rahuls visit to address this sense of hurt.        
	Although the dates of Rahuls visit have not been finalised, the sources said he would visit soon.        
	Digvijays February 3 visit had sparked protests by the BJP and other groups that accused the Congress of trying to reopen old wounds for political gain.         
	But the perception that Digvijay wanted to reopen the probe into the Batla House encounter proved to be wrong.        
	Digvijay said he had merely impressed upon the families of the accused not to demand a fresh probe but to settle for speedy trial in a special court. My report is neither on fresh investigation, nor Batla House-centric, he said.

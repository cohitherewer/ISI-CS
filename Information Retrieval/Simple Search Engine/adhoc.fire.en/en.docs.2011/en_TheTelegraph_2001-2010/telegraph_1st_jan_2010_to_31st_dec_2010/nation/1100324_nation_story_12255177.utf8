The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cylinder explodes: Twenty minutes inside an inferno 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cylinder explodes: Twenty minutes inside an inferno 
                              A man rappels down from one of the floors on fire in Stephen Court while another waits at the window. Picture by Amit Datta                            
	Imran Ahmed Siddiqui and Tamaghna Banerjee of The Telegraph entered Stephen Court at 3.50pm on Tuesday afternoon and stayed inside the burning building till about 4.10pm. Heres what they saw and heard:              
	The fire official stood at the foot of the staircase on the first floor and shouted at his three subordinates.        
	Someone bring me a torch; I cant make out anything in this darkness. How can one find out if people are trapped?        
	It was pitch dark and stuffy, and I (Imran) stumbled twice on the stairs. Then we remembered our cellphones and made our way up slowly in the light from our handset screens.        
	On the second floor, the firemen were coughing and gasping in the suffocating fumes.        
	One of them blocked our way. We pulled out our identity cards and asked whether we could watch for some time. He refused at first but our persistence paid off.        
	Okay, but dont move around on your own, he warned.        
	A sudden bang from somewhere inside the burning building sent us running for cover.        
	Hey, dont run, you will skid on the staircase. Its just a cooking gas cylinder exploding, one of the firemen shouted.        
	A little later, another blast.        
	If these explosions continue I fear the worst. Chunks of the building will come crumbling down like a matchbox, a fireman said.        
	He turned to us. Write about this, write about the dangerous condition in which we have to work, staking our lives.        
	As we climbed up, we found no flames on the third floor but the choking, thick fumes were becoming unbearable. My (Imrans) shoes were soaking as I splashed about through the water, once almost tripping on one of the hoses.        
	We reached the fourth floor to find it enveloped in darkness, pervaded by a foul stench. The heat scorched our skins. It was a scene of devastation  all the offices and flats were gutted. One of the firemen picked up two burnt computer keyboards and tossed them into a corner.        
	Shards of glass were strewn across the place and the firemen asked us to watch our step.        
	Some of the fire-fighters set about breaking the doors of two rooms open so they could spray water inside. Others were using an electric saw to get into a burnt-down office.        
	A group of police commandos arrived and asked the firemen to accompany them to the fifth and sixth floors  both ablaze  where two people, one of them an elderly woman, were believed to be trapped.        
	I (Imran) found myself mumbling a short prayer as I climbed up to the fifth floor.        
	The ceilings of the fifth and sixth floors have become too hot and may collapse, one of the firemen warned us as he wiped sweat off his face with a piece of cloth.        
	Where is your fire mask? I (Imran) asked. He stopped what he was doing to stare at me for a few seconds.        
	We dont have enough masks. Our bosses are hardly bothered about our safety, he finally replied.         
	We stuck our necks out from a window on the fifth floor and saw hundreds gathered on the street below, their eyes fixed on the top two floors where the leaping flames were making even the firemen nervous.        
	We cant allow you to go any further up. Please return downstairs and pray for us, and for those who are trapped. Tell their families that we are doing our best to save them, one of the firemen said.        
	His voice was crisp and for a moment, he looked a little proud.        
	We slowly climbed down the stairs with a burden on our hearts.

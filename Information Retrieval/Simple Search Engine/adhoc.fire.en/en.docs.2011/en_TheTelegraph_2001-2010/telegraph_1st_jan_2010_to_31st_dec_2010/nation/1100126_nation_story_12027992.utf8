	New Delhi, Jan. 25: Punishments like community service, censure and fines are being considered to keep jails free of petty criminals awaiting trial for years, law minister Veerappa Moily said today.        
	The Republic Day-eve announcement, if implemented, could become part of an ambitious plan that kicks off tomorrow to unclog jails. As the first step, the government has asked the Chief Justices of all 21 high courts in the country to form task forces to identify undertrials languishing in jails for years. Only 30 per cent of the 3 lakh-odd jail population has been convicted by a court, 70 per cent are undertrials, the minister said.        
	In the process starting tomorrow, those who have already spent more time than warranted by their crimes and those who have completed their terms but whose release had been held up for some reason could be released.         
	Why must they rust in jail? Moily said. The first batch of prisoners could be released as early as Wednesday. Women, children, the handicapped and senior citizens will get preference, Moily said.        
	Attorney-general G.E. Vahanvati said, however, that those jailed under preventive detention laws would not be considered for early release. The exercise will not cover those detained under laws relating to the states security, he said when asked if the process would apply to Jammu and Kashmir .

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 30: Suspected Somali pirates have forcibly taken eight Indian vessels and their crew of about 100 hostage in the waters off the Seychelles and East African coasts but the Indian Navy is advising a wait-and-watch policy to secure their release.         
	The navy has told the director-general of shipping that despite several warnings from it over the last year, little has been done to restrain small Indian vessels, called dhows, mostly from Gujarat from plying in these waters.         
	The Indian vessels were said to be sailing from Mogadishu to Dubai and were anchored off the coast of Kismavo in Somalia, which is described as rebel-controlled territory. The small vessels do not afford the pirates lucrative ransom demands unlike bulk carriers.         
	An Indian naval frigate, the INS Betwa, is currently on an anti-piracy patrol near the Gulf of Aden.         
	Despite calls for action, the navy has said from its experience in patrolling the waters for more than a year now, that too many lives could be at risk. It would be better to contact the pirates to negotiate the release of the crew, but even that is difficult.         
	The dhows, of about 300 to 400 tonnes each, have been identified as the MSV (Merchat Sailing Vessel) Al Quadri, Al Ijaz, Faiz Usmani, Sea Queen, Nar Narayan, Krishnajyot, Vishwakalyan and AKPCT, all based out of Jamnagar, Veraval and Porbandar in Gujarat.         
	The dhows regularly ply the route along east Africa, carrying charcoal and small items of trade. A navy officer said if pirates board a dhow, the incident is rarely reported immediately and the information usually comes from the master of another dhow a few days later.         
	Pointing to the many warnings, that it has issued many warnings, the officer said that this January an Indian dhow, the Sultan Nadeem, was boarded by pirates who intended to use it as a mother ship to board a larger carrier. The Nadeem was spotted with a skiff (a smaller boat the pirates were said to have used) by a British navy vessel. They fired at the British warship with small arms.         
	The Indian Navy escorts Indian-flagged cargo vessels through the Gulf of Aden through a channel recognised as an international trade corridor. Since the patrolling mounted by the Indian Navy, a coalition task force and others, incidents of piracy off the Horn of Africa have come down. But Somali pirates have ventured further out to the Arabian Sea and have increased the number of attacks near Seychelles.         
	We have told the DG Shipping that these waters are dangerous and the dhow owners should be advised accordingly, said navy spokesperson Commander P.V.S Satish. We understand the shipping authorities are waiting for more information from Gujarat, he said.         
	Last year, marine commandos on board an Indian warship thwarted a pirate attack using helicopters. In 2008, an Indian naval ship fired at and sunk a Thai fishing trawler that was also boarded by the pirates. Thailand complained later that the innocent crew were also killed. Since then, there is a reluctance among the navies in anti-piracy drills to shoot at sight.

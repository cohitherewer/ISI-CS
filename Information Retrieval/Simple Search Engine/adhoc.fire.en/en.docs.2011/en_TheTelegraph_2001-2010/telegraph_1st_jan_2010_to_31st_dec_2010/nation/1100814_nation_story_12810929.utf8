          G.S. MUDUR                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: Hospitals in India are underestimating drug resistance patterns, according to an infection specialist who had warned earlier this year that the newly discovered multi-drug resistant bacteria portend deep trouble.         
	India has a bad drug resistance problem  we have to accept reality, find solutions, and tackle the problem, said Abdul Ghafur, a consultant in infectious diseases at the Apollo Hospital, Chennai.         
	The new resistance described by Indian and international doctors has sparked a controversy with the health ministry rejecting suggestions that it might have originated in India. A paper in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases this week had suggested that foreign patients who visit India for treatment may carry back the resistance with them.         
	The paper reported the new resistance named New Delhi metallo beta lactamase-1 in Chennai, Haryana, Guwahati, Mumbai and Varanasi, besides Dhaka and eight cities in Pakistan and the UK  where most patients had a travel history to India.         
	Ghafur said he agreed with the papers scientific content, but disagreed with its interpretation that this resistance may spread through medical tourism. The paper goes beyond scientific results to make this interpretation, he told The Telegraph.         
	But Ghafur himself had pointed out earlier this year in the Journal of the Association of Physicians of India that the widespread abuse of antibiotics inside and outside hospitals has turned the country into a breeding ground for resistance.         
	Ghafur now finds himself walking a tightrope  aware that what he had articulated in the journal, an attempt to arouse fellow-doctors, perhaps kindle action by health authorities to regulate antibiotics will be particularly unpalatable in the current controversy.         
	But he isnt alone. A six-member team of doctors from the Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai, which had detected 22 of the new resistant bacteria with NDM1 in just three months had described it a worrisome development.         
	The Hinduja doctors had sounded the first alert about possible implications of this resistance on Indias medical tourism sector. The NMD1 bacteria may endanger patients undergoing major treatment at centres in India, and this may have adverse implications for medical tourism, Payal Deshpande and her colleagues had written in the same issue of the JAPI .         
	Ghafur had said the detection of 22 NDM1 bacterial isolated in three months from a single hospital in Mumbai was an eye-opener on how deep a trouble we are in. He said most hospitals are underestimating the levels of resistance.         
	The Hinduja team and Ghafur had both argued for stewardship of antibiotics  regulation of the use of antibiotics to ensure that only the right antibiotics in the appropriate doses are given to patients.         
	Ghafur, who has spent five years in the UK as an infection control specialist, said the majority of Indian hospitals lacked institutional mechanisms that ensured only the correct antibiotics were used on patients. In the UK, doctors have to consult an infection control specialist before prescribing any high-end antibiotic, Ghafur said.        
	I have come across many hospital administrators in India claiming zero infection in their hospitals. many of these hospitals do not have the necessary microbiology laboratory support, Ghafur had written.

	New Delhi, May 30: The monsoon is expected to hit Kerala on May 31 and advance over coastal Karnataka and southern Tamil Nadu a day later, the national weather agency has said in an updated forecast.        
	A monsoon onset vortex is expected to develop off the Kerala coast tomorrow and move north-northwest, strengthening the winds that could bring monsoon rain to the state, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.         
	The monsoon is expected to advance over the mainland during the week from June 4 to June 10, delivering rain over Goa, the southern Konkan coast and over parts of the northeastern states, the IMD said.         
	The normal onset date of the monsoon over Calcutta lies between June 8 and June 10.        
	Kerala and the Northeast are experiencing pre-monsoon thundershowers, the agency said. The monsoon had covered the Andaman and Nicobar Islands on May 17.        
	The IMD said occasional thunderstorms were likely to ease the heat-wave conditions prevailing over northwestern and central India. The average temperatures in the two regions in March and April were the highest in the past 100 years.        
	Earlier this month, the IMD had said that monsoon rainfall was likely to hit Kerala sometime between May 26 and June 3.        
	The IMD had predicted earlier this year that India would receive a near normal 98 per cent monsoon rainfall this year.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Teen dies in Puja job brawl in Ballygunge
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 13: A teenager was allegedly slashed to death and another grievously injured in Ballygunge in a scuffle between two groups of candidates who had applied for a temporary job during the Pujas with a diaper brand.        
	While 19-year-old Subrata Das died on the spot, Abhishek Barua is in hospital with deep cuts in his stomach. Dass house is on Hazra Road.        
	Police said both had been slashed with a sharp weapon. Das had also suffered injuries in his stomach.        
	The diaper brand had asked candidates for a job to anchor promotional events at pandals and shopping venues to assemble at South City Mall on Prince Anwar Shah Road for screening this morning.         
	However, the police said the number of candidates, put at 150, exceeded the estimates of the organisers.         
	When the organisers saw the crowd of applicants was becoming unmanageable, they asked the candidates to go to the brands office near Queens Park in Ballygunge, a senior police officer said.        
	The police said tension was brewing among the candidates since morning. The situation got worse during the course of the daylong interview at the office near Birla Mandir as the chances of many candidates dimmed, they added.         
	Around 5.30pm, when the results were announced, those who had failed to get the job began abusing those selected and a clash broke out in front of the office.        
	During the scuffle, two candidates suffered deep cuts in their stomach. A police patrol van arrived at the spot and dispersed the clashing groups. They took the two to a nursing home nearby, a police officer said.        
	While Das was declared dead on arrival, Baruas condition is critical, he added.        
	However, another officer said that after the results were declared, those selected made fun of those who did not make it. This led to the clash, he added.

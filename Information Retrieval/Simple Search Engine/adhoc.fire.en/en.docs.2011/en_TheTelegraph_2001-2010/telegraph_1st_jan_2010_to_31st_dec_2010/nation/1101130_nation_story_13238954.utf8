          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                          Speaker Meira Kumar receives a memento sent by US President Barack Obama for Parliament on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 29: The Congress today fortified its position by getting all UPA allies to reject a joint parliamentary committee on the 2Gscam and began digging up the BJPs scandals to weaken its posturing on corruption.        
	In a move to isolate the BJP from secular Opposition parties, the Congress claimed it was proceeding under instructions from the RSS and that the Left and other parties had fallen prey to their designs.        
	They have the direction of the RSS. Their demand for JPC is politically motivated, parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal said.        
	Another minister said other rival parties could be demanding a JPC, but they did not seem to be with the BJP in disrupting Parliament.        
	The Left is also seeking a JPC but it is not joining BJP in disrupting the House. BSP members also do not join them when they go into the well. Its only BJP which is not agreeing to any suggestion other than JPC, he said.        
	As the Centres assessment that the Parliament deadlock would resolve after the Bihar polls proved wrong, the Congress decided to take the BJP head on to expose its double standards on corruption. Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari dragged in Chhattisgarhs Raman Singh regime and the B.S. Yeddyurappa government into the row.        
	Pushp Steel was set up on June 2, 2004 in Delhi and applied for prospective lease of iron-ore mines in Kanked in Chhattisgarh the same day. This company had no mining experience but was awarded licence, Tiwari claimed.        
	Delhi High Court declared that process illegal on July 20, 2010. The fake steel firm is backed by top BJP leaders. I dare chief minister Raman Singh to reveal the names behind it.        
	Tiwari also alleged that a firm owned by Yeddyurappas son-in-law had got Rs 2.5 crore from a person allotted a 123-hectare iron-ore mine by the government, a clear case of quid pro quo. This was in addition to illegal land deals involving the chief ministers family, he said.        
	The Congress also sought the BJPs response to Arun Shouries claim that Venkaiah Naidu was fielded ahead of him in a Rajya Sabha debate under pressure from corporate lobbyist Niira Radia.        
	In Tehelka, we saw deal-fixing. Now the BJPs contribution to national discourse is debate-fixing, he said.        
	Congress leaders said they would expose the BJP on telecom if a debate took place in Parliament. They claimed the BJP wanted a JPC to avoid a debate before the nation.        
	Speaker Meira Kumar has convened an all-party meet tomorrow to discuss the deadlock, but the Congress leaderships aggressive posturing indicates there is little chance of a breakthrough.        
	The sole design of the BJP and its unholy alliance with the Left is to destabilise the government and not to stem corruption in the polity. The Centre is committed to do so, Bansal said.        
	After Parliament remained deadlocked for the 12th working day, the Congress held a lunch meeting with UPA allies. All the allies, including Trinamul, DMK and the Nationalist Congress Party, backed the governments no JPC position.        
	Trinamul, which had earlier said it was not opposed to a JPC if it was required to break the deadlock, today said the BJP and CPM were in an unholy nexus to destabilise the government.

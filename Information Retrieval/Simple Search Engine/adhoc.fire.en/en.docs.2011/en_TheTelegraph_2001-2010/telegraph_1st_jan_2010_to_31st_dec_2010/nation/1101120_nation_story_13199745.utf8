          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: The government today authorised the attorney-general to defend the Prime Minister in the 2G spectrum case in the Supreme Court in an undeclared acknowledgement that the flanks were not adequately fortified till now.        
	The government said G.E. Vahanvati, instead of solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium, would represent the Prime Minister at all future hearings of the case.        
	However, law minister Veerappa Moily insisted that this was no reflection on the way Subramanium had managed things in court. He is a brilliant lawyer, he told reporters.        
	The solicitor-general had represented the Prime Minister on previous occasions as he was present in court defending the department of telecom, Moily said.         
	Subramanium also told reporters that he would continue to represent the telecom department and the Union government in the case. Theres no replacement, only an addition (to the legal team) for better co-ordination, he said.        
	Trying to play down the move to authorise Vahanvati, Moily said that at earlier hearings, the court had not sought a formal reply from the Prime Minister to Subramanian Swamys complaint.        
	Now that the court has sought a formal reply on behalf of the Prime Minister, the government will present a pucca case, Moily said.        
	However, legal experts said the move was prompted by the poor show by the government in the case.         
	Sources pointed out several loopholes in the governments strategy. First, an application should have been moved to delete the Prime Ministers name  Dr Manmohan Singh  from the case.         
	Usually, when courts scrutinise government policy, they prefer to deal with an institution. In this case, it should have been the Prime Ministers Office (PMO), not the individual himself.         
	But failure in drawing the courts attention to the fact that the Prime Minister should not personally be made a party to the case left the government vulnerable. The adverse remarks in the case were then seen to be made against the Prime Minister himself.         
	The government should also have challenged the maintainability of filing a petition against the Prime Minister himself.         
	If this had been done, the court would have thought twice before seeking an explanation from the Prime Minister, the experts pointed out. The explanation, if any, would have been then given by the PMO.         
	An affidavit will now have to be filed on the Prime Ministers behalf by tomorrow, responding to Swamys assertions that there was delay and inaction in dealing with his complaint.         
	Swamy has been insisting that the Prime Minister was bound to give an equivocal yes or no to his plea for sanction within a maximum period of four months as mandated by the Supreme Court in the 1997 Vineet Narain judgment.

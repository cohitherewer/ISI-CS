The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Veto on Vedanta varsity land
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Veto on Vedanta varsity land
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK AND ASHUTOSH MISHRA                                            
	Cuttack, Nov. 16: Orissa High Court today quashed the land acquisition for a proposed university of the Vedanta group near Puri and directed that the acquired land be restored to their original owners.        
	The verdict came months after the Union environment ministry refused the group clearance for a bauxite mining project in Niyamgiri.        
	Of the 6,270 acres promised by the state government for the Rs 15,000-crore varsity project, 3,500 acres had already been acquired.        
	A two-judge bench of Chief Justice V. Gopal Gowda and Justice B.P. Das invalidated the entire process adopted for acquiring land along the Puri-Konark Marine Drive by the state government for the Anil Agarwal Foundation, named after the groups chairman, to set up the university.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the government was yet to receive a copy of the judgment after which it would decide its next course of action. We havent received a copy of the judgment yet. After that we will see what needs to be done, he said.        
	Reacting to the verdict, a spokesperson for the Vedanta group said: We will respond only after we go through the judgment.        
	Former Union minister and senior Opposition leader Braja Kishore Tripathy who was actively involved in the movement against the university, demanded the resignation of the chief minister. He should step down on moral grounds, Tripathy said.         
	Senior BJP leader Biswabhushan Harichandan echoed him, saying it would be morally inappropriate for Naveen to cling to his chair.        
	The Vedanta group was so keen on the project that the Anil Agarwal Foundation had already announced an endowment of $1 billion for the university. The state government had committed itself to providing 6,270 acres for the project in an MoU signed with the foundation.         
	Todays verdict came in the wake of criticism by the Union environment ministry and the Lok Pal. While the ministry put on hold its conditional Coastal Regulation Zone and environmental clearance for the project following allegations of irregularities, the Lok Pal had recommended the appointment of a competent authority to find out the public servants responsible for furthering the cause of the Anil Agarwal Foundation.

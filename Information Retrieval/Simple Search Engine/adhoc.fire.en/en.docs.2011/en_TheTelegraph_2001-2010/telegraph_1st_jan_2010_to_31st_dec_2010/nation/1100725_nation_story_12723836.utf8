          CITHARA PAUL                                            
	New Delhi, July 24: Delhis Commonwealth Games mood has been doubly spoiled. Close on the heels of Usain Bolts announcement of his non-availability comes a bolt from the blue skies.        
	Media reports say Britain, to whom the Games owe their origin, may hike the air passenger duty (APD) levied on them flying out of the UK before the October sports event in New Delhi.        
	The Indian government fears that the increase in airfares resulting from the APD increase will hurt Games-related tourism, and plans to ask Britain to defer the hike till November, officials said.        
	Britain is the second-largest source of tourist inflow into India after the US. According to Foreign Tourist Arrival figures for 2009 released by the Indian tourism ministry, the country received 748,765 visitors from the UK and 803,021 from the US. The APD hike will raise airfares from Britain to New Delhi by 25 (Rs 1,800) to 50 (Rs 3,600).        
	If the UK government sticks to its decision, Commonwealth tourism will see at least a 20 per cent dip, since British nationals normally make up the largest chunk of Commonwealth tourists, a tourism ministry official said.        
	We are concerned at the development. We are planning to request the UK government to stall the decision at least till the Commonwealth Games get over, if not for ever.        
	The official said the Prime Ministers Office had promised to take the matter up with the UK authorities.        
	Tour operators are upset too. Britain has put a spoke in our plans by raising the APD just as the publicity surrounding the Commonwealth Games was building up. Its implications could be disastrous. We hope the Indian government takes the matter up with Britain, said Sadu Parashar of India Travels.        
	He said airlines, airports and tour operators in the UK had been campaigning against the decision to raise the APD, arguing it would hurt the British economy by curbing tourism and business travel.        
	Britain had announced last year that it would raise the APD, a green tax, but not set a date. Recent media reports have said the hike may be implemented soon.        
	The volume of the APD will be based on the distance between London and the destination countrys capital. The tax has been classified into four bands, with India falling in band C (4,001 to 6,000 miles). For this band, the APD will increase from 50 in the economy class to 75 per passenger, and from 100 in the business class to 150.

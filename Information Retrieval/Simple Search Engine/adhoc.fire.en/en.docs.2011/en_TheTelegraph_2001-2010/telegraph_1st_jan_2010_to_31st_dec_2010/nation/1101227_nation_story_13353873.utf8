          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 26: The campaign for a Telangana state has intensified as the scheduled date for the release of the Srikrishna Committee report draws near.        
	The Telangana Political Joint Action Committee and Congress leaders from the region today held separate meetings in Hyderabad to chalk out their plans for December 31, when the report is to be released.        
	Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) president K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who leads the action committee, even offered to merge his party into the Congress if the Centre granted statehood, but the Congress rejected it.        
	Both meetings demanded that the state government withdraw the cases against all the Osmania University students and pull out the paramilitary from Telangana. The Congress leaders threatened resignations and a fast while the action committee promised to intensify its agitation.         
	The action committee meeting demanded that the state government announce the statehood process by the year-end. The TRS-BJP combine has already begun motivating cadres to fight tooth and nail if the government keeps the statehood question hanging.        
	Congress Working Committee member and MP K. Keshava Rao said todays Congress meeting had urged the party high command to place the Telangana bill in Parliament during the budget session. The TRS made a similar demand and said it would intensify its agitation immediately to put pressure on the Centre.         
	The nine MPs, seven ministers, 15 MLAs and four members of the legislative council present at the Congress meeting declared they would resign their posts if the Centre failed to announce the creation of Telangana.        
	Keshava Rao said he was confident that the Srikrishna report would favour statehood. If not, we will not blink twice and resign en masse, he said.        
	The Congress leaders plan to launch a hunger strike from Monday, December 27, at the gun park in front of the Assembly if the state government fails to withdraw all the cases against the students involved in the Telangana agitation. The government has withdrawn only 565 of the 1,667 cases, giving relief to 2,436 of the 8,047 accused.        
	Sarve Satyanarayana, Congress MP from Siddipet, said: We will stage a fast till death if the government does not withdraw the cases by this evening.        
	Deployment of paramilitary forces against a democratic agitation is unprecedented and unheard of, Keshava Rao said.         
	The Congress leaders demanded that the Centre launch the process for the formation of a Telangana state.        
	We wont have the face to visit our constituencies if the Centre fails to do so, Keshava Rao said.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rao beside Didi, after phone call

	Calcutta, July 21: K. Keshava Rao, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs, today attended Mamata Banerjees rally but two senior ministers could not make it because of preoccupations in Delhi.        
	Mamata had invited finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, law minister M. Veerappa Moily and Rao to the rally. But the top leaders decided to skip the meeting, leaving it to middle-ranking Rao to represent the Congress high command.         
	Today it was Mamatas show, a senior Congress leader said from Delhi.         
	So we saw no reason why senior leaders like Mukherjee or Moily should attend the meeting. Even Rao would not have showed up had Mamata not dialled Mukherjee around midnight and persuaded him to send a representative from Delhi.        
	When Pranabda told Didi he could not make it because he had to chair a meeting of finance ministers in Delhi, she requested him to ensure some senior leader from Delhi was by her side at the meeting, said a Trinamul leader.        
	Rao had earlier decided to skip the rally because of a party meeting in Hyderabad. But he changed his plan on orders from the high command.        
	The AICC leader said he had attended the rally to send a message to Mamata that the UPA was with her when the CPM was mounting an attack on her for the July 19 train tragedy in Birbhums Sainthia. She wants us by her side at this juncture, he said.        
	Rao reached the rally along with PCC president Manas Bhuniya around 1.15pm, a little before Mamata arrived.        
	The Congress-Trinamul alliance will remain intact till next years Assembly polls. Nobody will be able to break it, come what may, Rao said.        
	Bhuniya said the alliance would form the next government in Bengal. Mamatadi is our leader and the alliance will take over Writers Buildings under her leadership.

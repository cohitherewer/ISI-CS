The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Export ban in onion tear fight
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Export ban in onion tear fight
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: Skyrocketing onion prices, which have skinned governments alive, have prompted the Centre to suspend exports of the bulb crop till January 15.        
	Onion prices have doubled to Rs 60-70 a kg in retail markets in Delhi because of crop destruction by unseasonal rain and suspected hoarding. In Calcutta, onion prices have risen to Rs 45 a kg from Rs 30 a week ago.         
	A ban on export is expected to increase the domestic supply, though the outflow has not yet crossed last years level. The country has shipped 10.10 lakh tonnes of onions till mid-November, against 12.99 lakh tonnes a year ago.        
	The ban order came on a day Pakistan did its bit to wipe Indias tears. Thirteen trucks carrying the commodity reached India through the Wagah border. The landed cost: Rs 18 to Rs 20 a kg.        
	Rain has destroyed some quantity of the crop in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan. In Bengal, delay in rain is being blamed.        
	But officials said such factors could not fully explain the leap in prices. We suspect speculative elements as there has not been a major drop in production, an official said.         
	The government expects summer-sown onion output to rise to 5 million tonnes in 2010-11, compared to 4.87 million tonnes a year earlier. The new crop is likely to hit the market by the middle of next month.        
	A committee that fixes the minimum export price today asked the regulator, Nafed, to stop giving fresh clearance to exporters. The minimum export price below which no shipment can take place  has been more than doubled to $1,200 a tonne, making deals unviable for those already in possession of no-objection certificates (NOCs).        
	We have decided to voluntarily suspend issuing NOC to onion exporters till January 15 and have also raised the minimum export price to $1,200 per tonne for those NOCs which is yet to be executed, an official said.         
	The hike has made Indian onion costly in the international market, where the crop from China are available at $450 a tonne, Iran at $375 a tonne, Egypt at $325 a tonne, Saudi Arabia $300 a tonne and Pakistan at $500 a tonne.        
	The government is not taking any chances because the spike in onion prices coincides with a rise in petrol prices and a diesel rate review is proposed later this week.        
	A surge in onion price is considered one of the key reasons that voted out the BJP government in Delhi in 1998.        
	Indira Gandhi had also stressed on rising onion prices when she returned to power in January 1980.         
	In the 2009-10 financial year, the countrys onion export rose marginally to 18.14 lakh tonnes from 17.83 lakh tonnes in the previous year. India exports onion to Bangladesh, West Asia, Singapore and Malaysia.

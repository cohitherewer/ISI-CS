The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Live-in protest in Orissa
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Live-in protest in Orissa
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 10: Women activists in Orissa have raised their objection to the Supreme Courts verdict in favour of south Indian actress Khushboo and have decided to fight it out with at least 1 lakh signatures.        
	Protesting the apex courts stand on live-in relationships and pre-marital sex, women under the banner of Sanjeevani-Maa Ghara (a voluntary body working for the cause of women and girls in distress) have decided to launch a signature campaign.        
	We will send it to the President. Being a woman herself, we believe she will take necessary steps to correct the judgment, said activist Rutuporna Mohanty.        
	Live-in relationships would pave way for commercialisation of sex, argue the activists.        
	Orissa might be an unimportant state for many. But we have every right to raise our voice and make our opinions heard. We have every right to speak out our minds on the verdict and the adverse impact it has on our culture, said Mohanty.        
	Times are changing and developing countries are promoting family structure. Institution of marriage and family needs to get its due recognition and its foolish to let it dissolve here where everywhere else they are trying to inculcate these elements in the society, said eminent activist Bhabanprakash.        
	We should not destroy our culture just mindlessly aping the West, said Pratibha Das, another activist.        
	Live-in relationships will only create a number of single and unwed mothers. Orissa has nearly 40,000 unwed and single mothers and live-in relationship will only give birth to more illegitimate child, Mohanty said.        
	Citing a recent case where a nurse was thrown by her boyfriend after three years of living together, she said: Everyday, we come across cases where frustrated women knock the door of the police station to get justice and a legal approval to their relationship after men ditch them.        
	Such a verdict will give rise to pre-marital and extra-marital and multi-partner sexual behaviour both among men and women consequently spreading HIV/AIDS. Children, born out of living together relationships, will not be properly brought up, Mohanty rued.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Scan order on Yemen cargo
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Scan order on Yemen cargo
          PTI AND OUR BUREAU                              
	Nov. 3: The Centre has directed all airports, seaports and the postal department to thoroughly check freight arriving from Yemen and Somalia.        
	The instruction, which took effect from Tuesday midnight, comes after two parcel bombs from Yemen were found last week on cargo planes headed to the US.        
	Since India has witnessed many terror attacks in the past, we dont want to take any chances, a home ministry official said today, three days ahead of US President Barack Obamas visit.        
	However, the order has yet to reach authorities in Calcutta. Calcutta airport director R. Srinivasan said: No such alert has come till Wednesday evening.        
	Calcutta does not have direct flights from either Yemen or Somalia. Parcels from those countries can reach the city only via Delhi or Mumbai.        
	Police, too, said they had not received any alert from the Centre. Jawed Shamim, joint commissioner, headquarters, said: There is no specific threat but we are ready with all precautionary measures.         
	Calcutta postmaster general Gautam Bhattacharya said much the same thing. All overseas parcels are scanned anyway during customs clearance at the airport, he said.        
	But a security drill was in place, he added. We had used that during the anthrax scare some years ago. If it is specifically a bomb alert, we will seek help from the police.        
	He said all outgoing parcels were scanned as part of procedure. If the parcel is on the heavier side and its contents cannot be verified, there is a cooling-off period during which it is not handled, he said.        
	Several countries, including the US, Canada and Germany, have banned freight services from Yemen after parcel bombs addressed to Jewish institutions in Chicago and containing the lethal explosive, PETN, hidden in ink toner cartridges were found on Thursday on cargo planes to the US.

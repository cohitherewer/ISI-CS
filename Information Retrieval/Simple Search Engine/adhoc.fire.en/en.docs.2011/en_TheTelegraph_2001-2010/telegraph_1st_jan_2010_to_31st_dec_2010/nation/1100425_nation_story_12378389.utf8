          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 24: The health ministry has asked a panel of experts to investigate allegations of ethical violations in a study in which 24,000 girls in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat received a vaccine against a virus that can cause cervical cancer.        
	Several womens organisations have alleged that the study, conducted jointly by the state governments and a US-based NGO, breached research ethics. They have claimed that health staff provided misleading information to the parents of some of the girls or took short cuts through the procedures for informed consent required for such a study.        
	Health and family welfare minister Ghulam Nabi Azad told Parliament on Thursday that the three-member panel had been asked to examine these concerns and submit its report within two months.         
	The study was intended to demonstrate the suitability of administering vaccines against the human papilloma virus (HPV) to girls aged 10 to 14, Azad said.         
	The vaccines, produced by two multinational manufacturers, are designed to protect girls from the sexually transmitted HPV, which accounts for more than 70 per cent of cervical cancer cases.         
	Both vaccines, certified by drug regulators as safe and effective in generating an immune response against the HPV, are available in the Indian market.        
	Azad said four deaths had been reported among the 14,091 vaccinated girls in Andhra Pradesh, and two among the 10,686 vaccinated in Gujarat.         
	Although there does not appear to be a connection between the deaths and the vaccination, Azad said, for our satisfaction and to allay apprehensions... the states have been advised not to carry out any further vaccination until further orders.

          OUR BUREAU                               
	New Delhi, July 30: Police will have to record reasons for not arresting an accused even if the offence carries a jail term of less than seven years, according to a planned amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) is passed.        
	Under a 2008 amendment, the accused neednt be held for offences punishable with terms less than seven years. If the change becomes law, it will reduce the discretionary powers the existing provision gives police officers. Lawyers and rights activists claim such special powers are often abused.        
	A parliamentary panel today cleared the changes, to be made through the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2010, giving in to the demands to prevent the police from misusing the discretionary powers.        
	The police required so far to only record reasons for arrest  face another check on their special powers to spare someone the cuffs.         
	They will have to arrest an accused if he ignores police notices. Such notices, issued under the 2008 amendment, are sent to persons who should be arrested but have been spared using the special powers.        
	Both amendments were cleared by the House committee but with the observation that the government should not bring amendments in bits and pieces.         
	The House committee has also asked the home ministry to act on the draft national policy on criminal justice based a report by noted legal expert N.R. Madhava Menon.        
	The Menon panel asked the home ministry to circulate the policy among members of the committee and start a debate on the subject inside and outside Parliament to help finalise the policy before bringing it to the House.        
	Earlier, a secretary in the ministry had told the Menon committee that most objections to the discretionary powers had come from lawyer associations. The main objection was that the police had been given total discretion to arrest or not to arrest.        
	Following the objections, the ministry wrote to the chairman of the Law Commission in June 2009 to arrive at some sort of consensus. Todays clearance was a culmination of the process of consultations.

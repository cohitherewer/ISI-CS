The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Smaller partners fear for Left unity
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Smaller partners fear for Left unity
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 18: Jyoti Basus death has left the CPMs allies worried about the future of Left Front unity.        
	It will be difficult to maintain Left unity in Jyotibabus absence. He was a guardian not only for the CPM but for all of us even when he was ill the past two years. Whose advice shall we seek now in a crisis? Forward Bloc veteran Asoke Ghosh said.        
	Is there anybody left in the CPM who will share our concerns, sort out policy differences amicably and take non-partisan decisions? he asked, the question mirroring the trust deficit and tensions in the CPMs relations with its allies since Singur and Nandigram.        
	Ghosh is now the senior-most leader in the alliance and the last surviving member of the first Left Front that took shape in 1977.        
	We used to seek his (Basus) instructions on tricky issues, mainly for two reasons. We knew he would give us a patient hearing and take a reasonable position even if that hurt his partys immediate interests. Second, we felt his party would listen to him if we could convince him, Ghosh said.        
	It was Basu who had saved the front after the Bloc, RSP and the CPI had virtually formed an alliance within the alliance and criticised the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments land acquisition drive for industry.         
	The smaller partners had nearly threatened to walk out of the government after the police firing in Nandigram on March 14, 2007.        
	Jyotibabu attended a stormy Left Front meeting and told his party leaders and us to sort out our differences and save Left unity. Later, he shared our misgivings on policy issues when we reviewed the reasons behind the erosion of our support base since the 2008 panchayat polls, Ghosh said.        
	PWD minister and RSP leader Kshiti Goswami cited Basus role in bringing Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee to the talks table to end the Nandigram stalemate.        
	Jyotibabu endorsed my suggestion in the Left Front that Asokeda (Ghosh) should initiate a dialogue with Mamata. The CPM leaders had to accept it despite their reservations since they couldnt overrule Basus opinion, Goswami said.        
	He cited how an order from Basu had led him to climb down after he had stopped attending office and threatened to resign from the government after the CPMs armed recapture of Nandigram in November 2007.        
	Jyotibabu summoned me to his Salt Lake home and asked me to resume my work as minister. He said he did not approve of many things that had happened, but he reminded me that both the CPM and its allies would lose everything if the front caved in, Goswami said.        
	As I was leaving him, he asked me to come closer. From his half-reclining position, he held my hands and said, aamar kotha shuno, mone rekho (please heed my words and remember them).        
	Goswami, who has repeatedly crossed swords with the CPM in recent times, added: His anxiety and concern moved me. After all, we hardly ever questioned his moral authority.        
	Ghosh remembered his long association with Basu, which began in the late 40s. He said Basu and the late CPM state secretary, Promode Dasgupta, had been the architects of the Left Front after the short-lived United Front experiments of the late 60s.        
	The decision by Basu and Dasgupta to concede major portfolios such as commerce and industry, agriculture, higher education and public works to the Bloc and the RSP in the first two Left Front governments had earned them the allies gratitude.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 22: The Centre will not remain passive in the administration of cricket, sports minister M.S. Gill told Parliament today, the assurance coming against the backdrop of the IPL mess.        
	Gill was replying in the Rajya Sabha to an assertion by the Congresss Jayanthi Natarajan, who had described the IPL as the worst possible example of corporate governance and crony capitalism. Members across party lines echoed her.        
	Gills statement suggested that the government seemed to be making up its mind on taking away the rights of the BCCI and start taking decisions on cricket administration. The right is reserved by the board till now, some say, to earn windfall profits for a select few.         
	Gill, a former chief election commissioner, took on the board, saying there was a clear question of conflict of interest that must be resolved. Gill said the IPL was the creation of the BCCI and it was because of the passivity of the sports ministry that the board became big and rich, an allusion to his predecessors in the post.        
	On the conflict of interest, Gill pointed out that prominent persons on the board were owners of IPL franchises, and said the BCCI could not be a regulator, controller and owner at the same time.         
	The minister agreed with Akali Dal member Naresh Gujrals suggestion that the BCCIs surplus should be diverted to the government.         
	He also said there was a need to regulate sports federation chiefs who had turned the bodies into their fiefs. He mentioned no names, but the likes of Indian Olympic Association president, the Congresss Suresh Kalmadi, and the BJPs Vijay Kumar Malhotra, the archery association chief, would have got the message.

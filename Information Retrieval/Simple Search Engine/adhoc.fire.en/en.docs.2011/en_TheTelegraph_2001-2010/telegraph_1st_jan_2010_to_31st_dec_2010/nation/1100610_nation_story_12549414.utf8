The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish to BJP: Open mouth only to dine
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitish to BJP: Open mouth only to dine
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 9: Nitish Kumar will host Narendra Modi and other notables to dinner at his residence on June 12. But that is just how far the Bihar chief minister will go to humour his ally BJP in the run-up to this autumns state elections.        
	Kumar has let it be known, through signals and hints from his close associates, to the BJP that it should ensure Modi and Varun Gandhi  faces of hard-line Hindutva  should lie low and not address the public meeting the BJP would hold when its national executive meets in Patna on June 12 and 13.        
	Today, Shahnawaz Hussain, a BJP spokesperson and Bhagalpur MP, indicated the BJP will probably oblige Kumar. Asked if Modi and Varun will speak, he said: There will be central and state leaders (speaking at the June 13 rally) but a list has not yet been drawn.        
	Nitin Gadkari is likely to keep the deliberations at the two-day meeting safe and sanitised. The executive is unlikely to touch any contentious issue.        
	Hussain said three resolutions would be adopted on the Maoist threat, UPA-IIs failure on every front, notably price control, and the Centres step-motherly treatment of BJP-governed states. The last appears a bid to mollify Modi.         
	The focus, though, will be on Gadkari. If the first executive meeting he presided over in February in Indore was about projecting himself as a no-nonsense leader who made no distinction between running his private enterprise in Nagpur and Indias main Opposition party, the Patna gathering, said sources, might force him to keep a lower profile.        
	In Indore, Gadkari started his innings on a clean slate. His entrepreneurial background was seen as an asset in pulling the BJP out of the morass of excessive politicking and factionalism.         
	In Patna, Gadkari will face his colleagues against a backdrop of controversies. The Jharkhand fiasco, where the BJP lost its government and an ally in the JMM, was blamed on Gadkaris lack of political understanding and judgement.         
	His choice of individuals to head the state units has also raised eyebrows: most of them were from the upper castes (Brahmins, Bhumihars and Vaish) and, willy-nilly, reinforced the perception that the RSSs predominantly Brahminical leadership had determined the appointments. The caste fault lines were also exposed when the BJPs upper caste and backward caste leaders spoke in different voices on the caste census.        
	Another weak link appears womens primacy in the party. Gadkari promised to nominate 33 per cent women in the party structure but did not pick a single woman for the impending biennial elections to the Rajya Sabha. Even prominent women leaders in the party such as Hema Malini and Najma Heptulla were left out.

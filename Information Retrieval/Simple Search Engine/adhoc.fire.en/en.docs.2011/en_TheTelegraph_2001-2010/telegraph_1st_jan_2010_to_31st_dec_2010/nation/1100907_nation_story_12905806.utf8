The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Anthrax scare from Bangla
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Anthrax scare from Bangla
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	Dhaka, Sept. 6: India could be staring at a possible anthrax outbreak, with Bangladesh sounding a red alert that the contagious disease has infected over 325 people in that country since mid-August.        
	The disease, transmitted from infected cattle to humans through handling of the animals or consumption of meat, has spread in four Bangladesh districts. Some 38 people were first found infected in Sirajgunj, about 150km from Dhaka, on August 19, but the disease has now spread to Badna, Tangail and Kushtia.        
	Sources said the scare for India came from the porous borders it shares with Bangladesh. So, chances that the cattle corridor  used to smuggle cattle from Punjab and Haryana into Bangladesh  might be used to push infected animals back into India are not remote, they said.        
	The risk was all the more because of Id-ul-Fitr, expected to be on Friday or Saturday. Cattle traders, who would have stocked up for the Id slaughter, will be desperate to get rid of the diseased animals, most of which are likely to end up in Manipur and Mizoram, the sources said.        
	BSF officials denied knowledge of the anthrax alert in Bangladesh, saying they had yet to get instructions to block movement of infected cattle.

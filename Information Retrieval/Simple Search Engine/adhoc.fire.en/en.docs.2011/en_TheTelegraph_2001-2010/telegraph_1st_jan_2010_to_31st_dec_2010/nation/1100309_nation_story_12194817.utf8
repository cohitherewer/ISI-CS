The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Muslim groups eye great chance
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Muslim groups eye great chance
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, March 8: Muslim groups might be publicly opposing the womens reservation bill as it is, but they dont want their women to lose out either.        
	The groups, such as the Jamaat Islami-i-Hind, Muslim League, All India Association of Imams and the Muslim Munnetra Kazhakam, dont want Muslim women to miss out on this great chance.        
	Ideally, we would have wanted a quota within the quota for women belonging to backward castes and Muslims. Such a bill would have been really empowering. But at the same time we dont want to deny our women an equal chance with women from other communities, said Siddiq Hassan of the Jamaat Islami.        
	The Jamaat is planning a national campaign with the slogan women power for social revolution and says its goal is to encourage more women to take part in politics. This stand is a milestone in the history of the Jamaat, which had until the Emergency exhorted members to abstain from electoral politics.        
	Let them begin with local body elections, where 50 per cent of the seats would be reserved for women. It will open a new world for women and we dont want to shut it, said Hassan.        
	The Jamaat, which recently announced plans to have its own political party, is also thinking of following the reservation pattern in allotting seats to women.        
	Imam association general secretary Umer Ahmed Illyasi said the bill offered an historic opportunity to Muslim groups to shed their reputation of being anti-women. This is a great bill as it opens the door for women to come up, he said.        
	Asked about the demand for a quota within the quota for Muslim women, he said that would have made the bill more inclusive. But more women entering politics will naturally make the whole system more sensitive and women-friendly. And it would eventually help all category of women.         
	The Muslim League, the only national Muslim political party, said: We all would have liked to see a quota for Muslim women. But it (the bill) is a welcome move as it will encourage women to play a larger role in politics, said League leader Mohammed Basheer.

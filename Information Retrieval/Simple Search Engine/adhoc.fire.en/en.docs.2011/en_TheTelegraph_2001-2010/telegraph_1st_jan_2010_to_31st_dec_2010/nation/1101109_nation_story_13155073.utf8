          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: Congress president Sonia Gandhi is seriously considering reviving the partys parliamentary board, a top forum that was dismantled by P.V. Narasimha Rao.         
	The board is expected to regulate and co-ordinate the activities of the Congress legislature parties at the Centre and in the states and to frame rules for the purpose but its real importance lies in the fact that its members also become part of the central election committee that selects candidates for any election.         
	Sonia would like to revive the board to have a decisive say in parliamentary affairs. The board will have the Congress president as chairperson.

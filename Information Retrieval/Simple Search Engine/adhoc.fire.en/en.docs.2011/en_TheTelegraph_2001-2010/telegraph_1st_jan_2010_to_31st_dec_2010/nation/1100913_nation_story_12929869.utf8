The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Id FIR against Mirwaiz 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Id FIR against Mirwaiz 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Sept. 12: The state government today cracked the whip on the moderate Hurriyat leadership by formally accusing Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and some others of inciting yesterdays violence that reduced government offices to rubble.        
	The police registered three FIRs against the Mirwaiz under various sections of the penal code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, one of which can even bring a life term.        
	This is the first time he has been named in an FIR, the Mirwaiz said. But such things cannot deter me from pursuing the just cause. It (burning of public property) is a conspiracy as they (the authorities) want to give the movement a bad name, he said.        
	The crime branch headquarters and the office of the chief engineer of the power development department were set on fire yesterday, allegedly by pro-independence protesters in Srinagars city centre.        
	The police said the FIRs against the Mirwaiz and his associates had been registered at three Srinagar police stations: Safa Kadal, Kothibagh and Shergari. The moderate Hurriyat chief had led several thousand marchers from Idgah to Lal Chowk, passing through areas under these police stations.        
	The Mirwaiz, Yaqoob Vakil, Nissar Rather and others instigated people to proceed towards Lal Chowk. His Id speech was highly inflammatory and anti-national, a government spokesperson said, referring to the Mirwaizs speech at Idgah before a crowd of more than one lakh.        
	But the strongest charge is the Mirwaizs alleged role in instigating people to resort to arson and damage public property, made under sections relating to mischief by fire or explosives. It is non-bailable and can lead to a life term.        
	Arresting the Mirwaiz would be difficult for the government because that could worsen the violence.        
	Other separatist leaders, including Mushtaq-ul-Islam, were also booked. Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Mohammad Yasin Malik, too, addressed yesterdays gathering but was not named in the FIR.        
	The Mirwaiz appeared to blame government agencies for the arson. It is a conspiracy to malign our movement. According to eyewitnesses, the fire started from the top of the building mysteriously and no mob was seen around it. How can a building that is fenced by a 20ft-high brick wall and razor wire start burning from the top? This needs to be impartially investigated, he said.        
	The Mirwaiz said no permission was sought from the government before the Idgah speech. The programme was spontaneous and not announced beforehand in view of past experiences when the government imposed strict curfew and placed the leadership under house arrest, he said.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rhetoric cant alter price reality: 
  Govt   Dip claim by Pawar infuriates Opposition
          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: The UPA government today side-stepped responsibility for the price rise, blaming market forces and state governments for the spiral and prompting an irate BJP to storm out of the Lok Sabha.        
	Rejecting multiple Opposition allegations of scams and central mismanagement over rising prices, the government told the Lok Sabha that it had done all it could to insulate the poor from inflation.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, in his intervention, blamed the rise in prices on the shortage of certain food items.         
	No amount of rhetoric and accusations can alter the demand-supply equation, which is the prime reason for the price rise, Mukherjee said, naming the economic slowdown and enhanced minimum support price as other factors responsible.        
	However, Mukherjee conceded, these factors cannot shroud the countrys failure to invest amounts required for agriculture.        
	Agriculture minister Sharad Pawars claim that prices of rice and wheat had started coming down angered Sushma Swaraj, the leader of the Opposition, into leading a BJP walkout.        
	If the agriculture minister does not even accept price rise as a reality, there is no point in this discussion, Swaraj said as her party walked out of the House in the middle of Pawars response to a debate on the spiral.        
	The discussion, spread over eight hours today, witnessed speakers from across Opposition parties slamming the government over rising prices.        
	Swaraj, who started the discussion, and Mulayam Singh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party, tried to drive a wedge between Pawar and the Congress in their speeches  attempts that the veteran sought to fend off with a smile.        
	I must warn you, Pawarji. The Congress has spread the message down to the districts that Sharad Pawar is responsible for the rising prices. It will blame you alone to escape criticism, Yadav said.        
	Swaraj alleged that the government had exported sugar in the past year even when the country faced a shortfall. We had a strange situation where we were importing and exporting sugar at the same time. At one port, there were actually two ships docked alongside. One which had just brought imported sugar, the other taking away exported sugar, she alleged.        
	Swaraj cited an explosion in profits over the past year of 33 listed sugar mills to allege a scam and demanded a probe by a joint parliamentary committee.        
	Mocking the UPAs plans to ensure food security through a law, Swaraj questioned how the government proposed to go about it without a clear idea of the number of poor in the country.        
	She cited four different government reports that have indicated as many figures for people below the poverty line.         
	When a husband tells his wife his friends are coming home for dinner, she asks him how many friends. It is common sense that you need to know the number of people you have to feed before you cook for them, Swaraj said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Go-it-alone Cong tests waters for 2011 polls

          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                              
	Calcutta, May 6: For the Congress high command, which had on all earlier occasions meekly surrendered to Mamata Banerjee, it was a hard decision to stand its ground and break the alliance with the Trinamul Congress.         
	But before it finally decided to allow the Bengal Congress to go it alone in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation polls, the party high command had weighed two factors.        
	One, the cost of breaking the alliance with Trinamul. Two, using the Calcutta corporation elections as a survival test for the party ahead of the ultimate test in the 2011 Assembly polls.        
	Central Congress leader Ahmed Patel, Union finance minister and state PCC president Pranab Mukherjee and Congress working committee member in charge of the Bengal unit, K. Keshava Rao, have decided that given the seat-sharing conflict with Trinamul, this was the Congresss last chance of going through such a test before next years Assembly elections, party sources said.        
	The idea floated during such discussions among the central Congress leaders was that if the party failed in this test, it could always go back to the alliance with Trinamul in the Assembly elections no matter how humiliating the terms would be as the party would lose its bargaining power for getting more seats, the sources added.        
	According to a Congress leader, the high command was undecided until the last moment which option to take. One option was to continue the alliance by asking for a few more seats in addition to the 25 offered by Mamata.        
	A section of Congress leaders, including some in the party high command, were prepared to accept it (the Trinamul offer). Their opinion was that fighting it alone would be a difficult proposition for the Congress in Calcutta as Trinamul is a major force in the city, the leader said.        
	But it was Mukherjee who asked the state Congress leaders to prepare a second list of its candidates and have it ready in case the talks with the Trinamul leadership fell through.        
	According to sources, two quick developments made the Congresss move to change tack inevitable.        
	One, Congress president Sonia Gandhi is said to have told Patel, her close confidant, that she will not overrule Mukherjees decision on the matter. The other is Mamatas decision not to give even one more Calcutta Municipal Corporation seat to the state Congress.        
	At the same time, a hunger strike by the four district Congress leaders of Calcutta more or less sealed the fate of the alliance, forcing Mukherjee and Rao to decide on the party going it alone.        
	Sonia was kept informed by Patel about the last-minute developments in the party and Trinamuls stand that it would not budge an inch even if that broke the alliance.        
	Asked about the developments, former MLA and south Calcutta district Congress president Nirbed Roy said: We talked to Pranab Mukherjee and insisted that the Bengal Congress should get its due after sacrificing the Bowbazar and Sealdah Assembly seats last year and accepting the 28-14 seat-sharing formula in the Lok Sabha elections. So, our central leaders asked us to prepare a second list if the alliance failed and that had the high commands approval.         
	Pranabda and Keshava Rao want the state Congress to face the test in order to judge our strength. If we succeed, our bargaining power for the 2011 Assembly elections will increase, Roy added.        
	Now that the Congress has accepted Mamatas challenge, the scenario that the party is hoping for is Trinamul falling short of the majority in the Calcutta civic polls and then asking for its help in forming the board.        
	State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharyya said: If Trinamul gets an outright majority in the CMC elections, they will not depend on us. In that case, we will not be able to go in for a hard bargain with Trinamul in the Assembly polls. Thats for sure. So, the Calcutta election is a big challenge for us.

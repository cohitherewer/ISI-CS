The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cuttack caught in cheer girls row
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cuttack caught in cheer girls row
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Will Barabati host them?                                  
	Cuttack, Feb. 22: The selection of Barabati Stadium as a home venue of IPL franchisee Deccan Chargers for two of their matches has triggered a new controversy far from the battle of the willow.        
	Its all about cheerleaders who are now caught in a moral conflict in Orissa.        
	A fringe political outfit, Kalinga Sena, is taking a tough stand on the issue, saying the role of cheerleaders is immoral. It has sought a ban on cheerleaders during the IPL matches in Cuttack.        
	In response, the Sports and Games Lovers of Orissa has said there was nothing immoral with cheerleaders performance. It only adds glamour to the event, it said.         
	The Sports and Games Lovers of Orissa is an outfit comprising members of sports associations affiliated to the Orissa Olympic Association, the apex state sports body.        
	Kalinga Sena has announced its vow to disrupt the IPL matches if cheerleaders are allowed in Cuttack. If cheer girls dance is not dropped, we will not allow the matches to be held, Kalinga Sena president Hemanta Rath has warned.        
	However, Sports and Games Lovers of Orissa convener Pratap Satpathy said: Cheerleaders have become an integral part of the IPL format for all venues. So there can be no exception in the case of Cuttack. More so, there is no rational behind Kalinga Senas opposition, as there is nothing immoral in it. It smacks of a cheap publicity stunt.        
	Orissa Cricket Association secretary Asirbad Behera has also downplayed the threat, saying: Our basic objective is to make Barabati Stadium a permanent venue for IPL matches.

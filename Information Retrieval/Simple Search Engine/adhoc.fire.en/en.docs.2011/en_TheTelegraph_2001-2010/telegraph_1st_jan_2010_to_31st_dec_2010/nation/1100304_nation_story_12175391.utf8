          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 3: A depressed St Stephens professor close to retirement and an AIIMS student unhappy with a test failure allegedly committed suicide today in a bizarre coincidence binding generations at two of the countrys finest institutions.        
	Mahesh Chandra Jain, who had been teaching chemistry at St Stephens College for 41 years, was said to have jumped from his second-floor flat in south Delhi. The 63-year-old was found dead by wife Sudha in the compound of the building.        
	A note attributed to Jain said no one should be blamed for his death and that he was ending his life because of depression. The professor had been on leave since this January and was due to retire in October this year.        
	The family has told us the professor was depressed for the last 18 years and was under medication, a police officer said.        
	Police said Jain was last seen by his wife and daughter at 10 last night. Sudha, who was watching TV and woke up late this morning, found her husband lying in a pool of blood in the compound of their building. He was rushed to AIIMS but declared dead on arrival.        
	Jain has three sons and a daughter who is married. One of his sons is based in the US while the others are settled in Bangalore.        
	Close friends and colleagues were stunned by the suicide. This is extremely unfortunate. He was deeply loved at the college, said S.V. Eswaran, Jains colleague and head of the chemistry department at St Stephens.        
	At AIIMS, final-year MBBS student Bal Mukund Bharti was found hanging in his hostel room around 6 this evening, a police officer said. Earlier, he had tried to commit suicide on February 18 by taking an overdose of medicines, the officer said.        
	The youth hailed from Sagar in Madhya Pradesh. His friends have told us that he was under depression after failing in a recent examination, the officer said.

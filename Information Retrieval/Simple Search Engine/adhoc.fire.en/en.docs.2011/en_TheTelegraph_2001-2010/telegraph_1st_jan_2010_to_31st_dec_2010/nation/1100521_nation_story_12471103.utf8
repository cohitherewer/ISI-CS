          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 20: The Bengal cabinet today approved a law department proposal to have photographs of couples embossed on their marriage-registration certificates besides the customary address and names.        
	After the cabinet meeting at Writers Buildings, state law minister Rabilal Moitra said: We took the decision because the photographs of the husband and wife would be needed to confirm their marital status in case of any future dispute. This is also to keep a record of the identity of the married persons.        
	According to the new system, those willing to get their marriage registered would have to furnish eight copies each of their photographs and voter identity /PAN cards.        
	The law minister said the government would depute officials to inspect the residence of a person and check with neighbours if the information submitted by him or her raised doubts.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Nationalist Congress Party has inducted the daughters of chief Sharad Pawar and co-founder Purno Sangma into its apex decision-making body.        
	Pawars daughter Supriya Sule and Sangmas daughter Agatha have been made members of the NCP working committee, party general secretary Devi Prasad Tripathi said here today.        
	Pawar has over the past year indicated both within the party and in public that he wished to retire from active politics and wanted younger leaders to take charge of the party.        
	The NCP chief had apparently decided against fighting the Lok Sabha polls and only agreed to contest under pressure from party workers. While campaigning ahead of the 2009 Maharashtra polls, Pawar had again hinted that he wanted to quit day-to-day politics.        
	The Union agriculture minister is known to be keen on introducing Sule as his heir. His nephew Ajit Pawar used to be viewed as the heir till Sule became a Rajya Sabha member last year. Sule and Agatha Sangma are both now Lok Sabha MPs.        
	Ajit, a minister in the Maharashtra government, has not been included in the working committee despite having significantly greater political experience than either Sule or Agatha.        
	Agathas induction comes at a time the party has been grappling with the fear that Purno Sangma might quit to either rejoin the Congress or float his own organisation. Sangma is critical to the NCPs prospects in the Northeast.

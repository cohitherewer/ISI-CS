	New Delhi, Sept. 5: The Centre is quietly pushing Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on more personnel and administrative changes before it places any fresh political proposals on the shaken table.         
	These are likely to include some elements of the Assemblys autonomy document and revocation of the locally scorned Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) from the central districts of the Valley, a move that the armed forces remain averse to.         
	In the Centres view, the necessity of the AFSPA in trouble-prone areas such as Kashmir cannot be over-emphasised but it also recognises that it has become a flaming spur to anti-India sentiment. There will come a juncture, political sources argue, when security risks of lifting AFSPA from certain areas will have to be measured against the political advantages accruing from such a decision.         
	The debate in the government over providing relief from the AFSPA is tilting in favour of abrogating it from specified areas rather than tinkering with its provisions. Politically and emotionally, the thinking goes, revocation will have a much greater impact than amending the minutiae of the act.         
	 But those decisions are still some way down the road.                   Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Farooq at a rally in Srinagar on Sunday. (AFP)       
	Maintaining that the immediate priority was the return of the state to a semblance of normality, sources told The Telegraph that New Delhi would like Omar to bring afore more fresh faces in his team and be more creative in ending the 10-week street upsurge which has claimed 65 lives. No precipitate action and no dramatic concessions either, is how a source summed up the Centres evolving approach to the crisis.         
	The chief reason: New Delhi is averse to letting the Kashmiri street and the Hurriyat set either the pace or the agenda of what requires to be done. To that end, it is also unlikely that New Delhi will accord substantive priority to talks with separatist leaders. It will continue articulating a willingness to talk to anyone within the framework of the Constitution, but it isnt investing much time or worth in opening channels to separatists with known and calcified positions.        
	Pushed hard all summer, the Centre appears to have convinced itself that creeping recovery of lost ground by working through the state government is the best strategy it can employ. We must ensure cessation of violence before anything can move, and the state government is the only agency for achieving that, the sources said, not only putting the onus squarely on Omar but also implying that he had thus far failed to get a grip on the situation.        
	The Centre and the Congress have backed Omar through the crisis, but it is clear they are less than impressed with the young Abdullahs handling of it.         
	It is increasingly apparent that should another eruption prompt Omar to quit in exasperation, the Centre will not persuade him to change his mind another time. But that will not mean imposition of Presidents rule in Jammu and Kashmir; rather it may usher the return of Farooq Abdullah in the saddle.         
	Drivers of Kashmir policy in New Delhi are convinced an elected government is the best instrument of governing the state and they want the current National Conference-Congress alliance to last its term. Omar choosing to quit may, in fact, be a blessing in disguise for the Centre has come round to the view that he lacks in experience and Farooq may have been a better choice to begin with.         
	Farooq, currently minister for renewable energy, had in fact announced himself chief minister shortly after results of the 2008 elections were declared, but the Congress leadership prevailed upon him to make way for his son on the plea that Kashmir needed a fresh leader. That decision, many in the Congress concede in retrospect, was erroneous.        
	For the moment, though, Omar remains the nodal agency for implementing policy initiatives that appear to be constantly evolving. Beyond inducting new faces in key political and administrative jobs, the Centre has also advised Omar to fast-track economic welfare and employment initiatives in a way that they bring visible and concrete benefits.        
	There is a sense, for instance, that the delivery mechanism of the Prime Ministers economic package to the state was such that it remained an administrative exercise, it did not directly touch the public and fetched the government no political returns. The high-level jobs panel created by the Prime Minister recently and the widening of the beneficiary base of unemployment dole by the state government are efforts aimed at correction.

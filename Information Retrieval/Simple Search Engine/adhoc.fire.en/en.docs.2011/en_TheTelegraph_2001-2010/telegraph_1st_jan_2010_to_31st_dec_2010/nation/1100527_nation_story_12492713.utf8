          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 26: The Union cabinet today decided to set up a group of ministers to work out effective ways of including a caste count in the ongoing census after some senior ministers raised feasibility questions.        
	The GoM, to be constituted soon, will try to arrive at a decision before the second phase of the census begins.        
	The strongest advocates of the caste census, such as the Janata Dal (United) and the Samajwadi Party, suspected the matter was being shelved and accused the government of going back on its promise to Parliament to have a caste count.        
	The government had assured Parliament that the cabinet would discuss the demand for a caste-based census, but Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had clarified at his recent news conference that no decision had yet been taken.        
	Sources said the governments move can anyway not be seen as a reversal of the promise to Parliament, since the Centre wanted a second look only at the modalities and not at the idea itself.        
	They, however, conceded that some senior ministers were in principle against a caste census and that today they had merely expressed their opposition in a different form, focusing on the practical difficulties. The subtle shift in their stance was apparently prompted by the top Congress leaderships obvious inclination to respect parliamentary consensus on the subject.        
	There was no opposition in principle but there were serious doubts about the modalities. The GoM will now work out the modalities after getting a briefing from the census commissioner on the practical difficulties and the limitations of the enumerators, one minister told The Telegraph.        
	Sources said law minister Veerappa Moily today forcefully contested home minister P. Chidambarams view that a caste count cannot be clubbed with the ongoing census and that it should be done through a different mechanism.        
	Ministers such as Anand Sharma, Kapil Sibal and M.S. Gill wanted to know if it was feasible to alter the census process to include caste at this stage.        
	They asked how the untrained enumerators, mostly teachers, would be able to verify peoples claims about their castes and club them in distinct, recognisable categories. Although it was initially said that the census officials will just jot down the households claims and these will be verified later, many doubt the wisdom of this idea.        
	Some cited the different caste lists in different states, which for instance means the same caste can be an OBC in one state but not in another. The GoM will try to find answers to all these questions.        
	The government hopes to include caste in the second phase of the census, when the enumerators will collect biometric characteristics such as fingerprints and photographs of the face and perhaps iris.        
	If a caste count is not possible in the second phase, it will be done in the third phase beginning February 11, when the headcount will be done.        
	JD(U) president Sharad Yadav said: All parties had supported caste-based census in the Lok Sabha. The Prime Minister and other senior Congress leaders had personally promised it would be done. The government is now going back on its word.        
	Samajwadi spokesman Mohan Singh said the cabinet decision was an insult to the Lok Sabha.

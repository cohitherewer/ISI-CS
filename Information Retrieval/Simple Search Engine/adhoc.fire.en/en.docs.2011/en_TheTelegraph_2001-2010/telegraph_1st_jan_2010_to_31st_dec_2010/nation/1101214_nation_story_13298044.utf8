  - Minister links crime to Delhis outsider influx, then recants        OUR BUREAU                          Chidambaram at an event in New Delhi on Monday. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                                        
	Dec. 13: Home minister P. Chidambaram today blamed Delhis migrants for the rise in crimes like rape, triggering an uproar over his remarks that seemed to carry shades of some Maharashtra parties campaign against north Indians.        
	Within hours, though, Chidambaram was forced to eat his words, saying: I am a migrant myself.        
	Nevertheless, crime takes place because Delhi attracts a large number of migrants, he had earlier said in the morning, asked about the recent rise in crimes against women, including rapes, in Delhi.        
	There are a large number of unauthorised colonies and these migrants who settle in these colonies carry a kind of behaviour which is unacceptable in any modern city. So crimes do take place.        
	Reaction was quick from the BJP as well as parties based in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar  which send the highest number of migrants to Delhi  although Chidambaram did not name any state. The Opposition accused the home minister of making the migrants a scapegoat to hide his own failure to tackle law and order.        
	It proves that Congress leaders are taking out their frustrations over the partys drubbing in Bihar. Chidambaram is the boss of the police and should not make such statements to cover up his failures, BJP spokesman Shahnawaz Hussain said.        
	Chidambaram, in his retraction, said: I may point out that when using the word migrants, I did not refer to any state or region or language or race or religion. I am acutely conscious that everyone who comes to work in Delhi is, in a sense, a migrant. I am a migrant myself, he said.        
	He added that in the course of his detailed reply to a question this morning, I made a matter-of-fact reference to migration, unauthorised settlements and behaviour that is unacceptable.        
	The Congress steered clear of the controversy. After Chidambarams clarification, I dont think there is any need for debate on this issue, spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said.        
	Real issue        
	Ved Marwah, security expert and former governor, expressed surprise at Chidambarams morning remark.        
	What is the point in blaming migrants for rising crimes? Delhi police are more concerned about providing VVIP security and this is why security arrangements for the common people have taken a back seat, said Marwah, who was Delhi police commissioner in the 1980s.        
	He said Chidambaram should ask the police brass to focus on building local intelligence and training and motivating the force to fight crime.        
	To Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad, Chidambarams very unfortunate statement was a bid to hide his own failure, a point echoed by Samajwadi Party MP Akhilesh Yadav.        
	Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati demanded an apology and said: The people of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar will not forget Chidambaram for his comment.        
	However, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, never a man to take slights on Biharis lightly, was silent. An official in his secretariat cited Chidambarams retraction as the explanation.        
	Raw deal        
	A Delhi government official acknowledged that the estimated million-plus migrant workers in the capital played a key role in the citys development but often received a raw deal.        
	They are mostly from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. Most of them work as rickshaw-pullers, construction workers, factory workers and domestic hands, he said.        
	They bring up the bulk of the workforce in the construction of Delhis flyovers, footbridges and roads, and did so for the Commonwealth Games projects, he said.        
	But several thousand of these day labourers and their families were driven out of Delhi a few days ahead of the Games to try and hide Indias poverty from foreign visitors.        
	In the run-up to the Games, Delhis Sheila Dikshit government had angered several states  including Bihar, UP and Bengal  by asking them to take back their beggars.        
	How can one label beggars state-wise? Even beggars are facing discrimination now, Bengal social welfare minister Biswanath Chowdhury had said.        
	Earlier, in May 2007, Dikshit had blamed the migrants for Delhis filth, saying: People from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and other places come here. What can we do? We cant stop them.        
	Lalu Prasad had then reacted by asking Dikshit to build more public urinals. She surely doesnt expect Biharis working in Delhi to come to Bihar every time they want to urinate?        
	Similar attacks had forced Dikshit too to issue a clarification, saying the media had distorted her remarks.        
	In Maharashtra, migrants have repeatedly faced political violence. The Shiv Sena targeted south Indians in the 60s and 70s and recently competed with the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena in north Indian-bashing.

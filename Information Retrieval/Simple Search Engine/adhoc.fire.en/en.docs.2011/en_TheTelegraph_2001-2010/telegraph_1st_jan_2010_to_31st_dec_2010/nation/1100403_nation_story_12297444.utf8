The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fires at VIP home and slum in Delhi
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Fires at VIP home and slum in Delhi
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 2: Four fires broke out in Delhi today, one destroying two cars in Ram Vilas Paswans home, one injuring a three-year-old slum girl and another a labourer at the income-tax office in the heart of the city.        
	The garage fire at former Union minister Paswans 12 Janpath bungalow, a stones throw from Sonia Gandhis home, burnt down an Audi and a Honda Accord but injured none. The Lok Janshakti Party chief was in Patna.        
	Just yesterday, the Comptroller and Auditor Generals report had said a third of the citys high-rises lacked fire safety measures  a situation familiar to Calcuttans after the Stephen Court tragedy.         
	The CAG added that the fire brigade had only a third of the equipment and half the men it needed, and that it arrived late in 77 per cent cases.        
	Officials blamed a short circuit for the afternoon blaze in Paswans bungalow, which comes 11 months after another fire destroyed a lot of furniture in the house.        
	The income-tax office blaze trapped seven labourers on the fourth floor before they were rescued. A sari shop fire in Karol Bagh injured none. Both fires were blamed on short circuits. The slum blaze, which injured a child and her parents, was tentatively put down to a tossed bidi.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: An article in the Congress mouthpiece, Congress Sandesh, has blamed the judiciary for creating circumstances for the imposition of Emergency.        
	The article by editorial board member Sarvjit Singh says: The proclamation of Emergency came thus at a time when there was a threat of total breakdown of the social infrastructure and governance due to the acts of the leaders in opposition and an adamant, anti-reformist judiciary, disregarding the needs of a growing economy and social reforms. In fact, to save our nation and democracy.        
	In the past, there have been Congress leaders who felt the judiciary played a negative role at that time but no senior leader now speaks that language after the Emergency was rejected by the people. The Congress has apologised several times for its imposition.        
	Sarvjit is one of two editorial board members of the magazine, the other being Salman Khurshid. He is a regular contributor to the magazine, edited by Lal Bahadur Shastris son Anil, who could not be reached for comment.        
	The article seeks to establish that the judiciary was creating hurdles in Indira Gandhis endeavour to serve the poor and cites judgments such as the Golaknath case, bank nationalisation, privy purses, the Kesavanand Bharti case and Allahabad High Courts order debarring Indira from contesting elections.        
	The article comes with the usual disclaimer  the views expressed by the author are his own  but many in the party are questioning the sagacity of allowing this controversial article in Congress Sandesh.

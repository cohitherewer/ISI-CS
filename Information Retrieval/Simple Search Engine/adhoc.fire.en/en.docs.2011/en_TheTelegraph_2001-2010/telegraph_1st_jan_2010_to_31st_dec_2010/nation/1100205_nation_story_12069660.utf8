The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu attacks Rahul for lacking courtesy
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lalu attacks Rahul for lacking courtesy
          NALIN VERMA                          Lalu Prasad                                  
	Patna, Feb. 4: Former Congress ally Lalu Prasad today launched probably his first personal attack on a Nehru-Gandhi, accusing Rahul Gandhi of using a Patna campus to pursue his political ambitions and of lacking basic courtesy.        
	Some sources suggested the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief hoped that any perception of a permanent breach with a resurgent Congress might cause some upper-caste votes to shift to Rahuls party at the expense of Lalu Prasads main Bihar rival, chief minister Nitish Kumar.        
	Lalu Prasads tirade came at a time Patna University is learnt to have rapped the Patna Womens College principal for allowing Rahuls political campaign on its premises on Tuesday.        
	What is Rahul Gandhis standing and merit in politics? Lalu Prasad said. I thoroughly disapprove of the way he used the college campus. Campuses should be kept free from political activities.        
	The RJD boss himself is a product of campus politics  he had been Patna University student union president in the early 70s  although political circles do not recall him campaigning on campuses in his later avatar as a mass leader.        
	Lalu Prasads words, though, may suggest he was less angry about Rahul using the campus than about the MPs remark that it was a mistake for the Congress to have an alliance with the RJD in the past.        
	It was not on considerations of mercy that the Congress had struck an alliance with the RJD, the former chief minister said.        
	The alliance was based purely on the political realities of the time. Had the UPA not committed the so-called mistake of befriending the RJD, which had 24 MPs (in 2004), it would have fallen on its face. If at all it was a mistake, it was the RJDs mistake in having an alliance with the Congress.        
	He said Rahul lacked basic courtesy and political humility, citing how senior Congress leaders like L.P. Shahi and Baliram Bhagat were sitting on the floor while he (Rahul) was on the dais at the state Congress headquarters.        
	If the RJD chief was aiming at splitting Nitishs upper caste vote bank, the same fear appeared to prompt the chief minister to almost echo his rival and target Rahul.        
	Questioning Rahuls opposition to nepotism and dynastic rule in recruiting Youth Congress members, Lalu Prasad had said: Rahul himself is the product of dynastic rule.        
	Nitish said: Certain people become youth icons by virtue of their birth, but I dont accept them as icons. The status of icon should be accorded on the basis of karm (work) and not janm (birth).        
	Sources said Patna University vice-chancellor Shyam Lal had admonished Patna Womens College principal Doris DSouza for allowing a politician (Rahul) to carry out his political campaign on the campus.        
	According to the sources, Lal told DSouza he had no objections to a leader being invited to hand out awards or inaugurate functions, but the campus can never be used as a centre of political activities. DSouza refused comment.

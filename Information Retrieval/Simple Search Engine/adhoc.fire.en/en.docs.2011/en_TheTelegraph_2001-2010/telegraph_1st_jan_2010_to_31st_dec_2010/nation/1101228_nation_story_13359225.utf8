	Mumbai, Dec. 27: A teenaged construction worker from Bengal has been arrested for making 50 prank calls about terror strikes on the city but not before he sent police into a tizzy over the weekend.        
	We have been on tenterhooks following intelligence inputs about a daring terror attack on Mumbai. So the calls were taken seriously, a top Mumbai police official told The Telegraph.        
	Police teams were dispatched to railway stations and other public locations mentioned by the prankster and his 34-year-old accomplice before the cops realised they were on a wild goose chase.        
	Today, Sobeshwar Mrityunjay Mochi alias Kalu, 15, was produced before a magistrate and sent to judicial custody for 15 days along with his friend and accomplice, Niranjankumar Hariprasad Singh. Both worked as construction labourers in Panvel, 50km from Mumbai.         
	Police sources said the idea was Kalus brainchild and the calls were made from his personal phone, while Niranjan, who is from Bihar, helped him get the Mumbai police control room numbers.        
	Niranjan dialled the police emergency number 100 and got the main control room number. Then the two started drinking and making the calls, said sub-inspector Prakash Patil, Panvel, who arrested the two.        
	The calls to the police control room began coming in around 10pm on Saturday and continued till 2.30pm on Sunday.        
	Police sources said the duo decided to make the calls after Mumbai joint commissioner (crime) Himanshu Roy announced at a televised media conference last week that four suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives had sneaked into the city to carry out terror strikes.         
	They were threatening to blow up places and initially there was some concern  but their amateurish lines gave them away and we soon started tracking the number. We nabbed them from the construction site on Sunday evening, Patil said.        
	Today, sources in various security agencies kept claiming intelligence inputs regarding a possible terror attack on Mumbai around New Year, prompting the administration to deploy huge police and security contingents around the state secretariat, airport, railway station and other vital installations.        
	A top official of the state anti-terrorism squad claimed that one suspected Lashkar operative  a member of the gang of four the police claim have entered Mumbai  was trying to fly out of the city.        
	Senior officials in Mumbai police claimed there was a lookout notice on the suspect, Mahfooz Alam.        
	But joint commissioner Roy told reporters there was no such lookout notice as a persons passport number, nationality details and identification marks were needed for such a notice and these were not available in Alams case.        
	But he told The Telegraph later that there was extra security and checking at the airport.        
	A source in the state home department claimed that commandos of the elite NSG had been put on high alert following another input about a second gang of four.        
	This has been ordered after a four-point specific terror alert from the IB to the navy and the coast guard. This alert is different from the one announced by Himanshu Roy and seems like a second backup group. This one too is a gang of four, claimed the source.        
	According to the IBs specific input, the four militants were travelling in a boat called Al Jajerea, which was on its way from Kavaratti, Lakshwadeep. Their landing point is the Bhaucha Dhakka Ferry Wharf in the citys south-eastern fringe near the dock area, the source said, quoting from the input.        
	The coast guard did not respond to calls.

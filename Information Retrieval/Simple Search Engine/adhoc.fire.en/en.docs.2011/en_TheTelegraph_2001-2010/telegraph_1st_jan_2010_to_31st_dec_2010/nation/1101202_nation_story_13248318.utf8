The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre says PM was overruled on 2G
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Centre says PM was overruled on 2G
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: The government today conceded in court that Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs reservations on 2G spectrum allocation were not addressed and that a more transparent procedure could have been followed.         
	It also conceded that some procedures fell short of rule of law.        
	Was the government process consistent with rule of law? Justice Asok Kumar Ganguly asked during a hearing on a PIL asking the Supreme Court to monitor the CBI probe into the 2G issue.         
	Is it reasonable? Do you think that it is a reasonable way of functioning of a government or a department? A government department has to function reasonably, predictably. If its not predictable, its not fair, he said.         
	The court was commenting on how prospective licensees were given 45 minutes to fulfil conditions laid down in their letters of intent, including a Rs 300 crore bank guarantee. How can these things be done in 45 minutes?. You are giving 45 minutes and claiming it is transparency? the court asked.        
	The senior judge on the bench, Justice G.S. Singhvi, also expressed his scepticism. Unless they had prior intimation, they cant do it in 45 minutes.         
	Solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium, representing the telecom department, then admitted: It falls short of rule of law. In hindsight, it could have been more transparent, he said.         
	Not satisfied, Justice Ganguly responded: It falls miserably short of it. We do not feel it is consistent with rule of law.         
	At an earlier point, the judge questioned Subramanium about how the telecom minister had overruled the Prime Ministers objections on allotting spectrum. Even the finance ministry had some objections, he said.         
	In the first hint of the government distancing itself from former telecom minister A. Raja, Subramanium said: The Prime Minister did express reservations these reservations were not met at all.         
	The Prime Minister had written to Raja on November 2, 2007, expressing reservations about his first-come, first served policy for allotment of spectrum and also the logic of allotting them in 2008 at 2001 prices. He had suggested an auction of spectrum and a revision of the entry fee. But the suggestions seem to have been overlooked.         
	Considering the sequence of events, the reservations by the Prime Minister should have been given a lot more importance, the solicitor-general said. He is after all the highest executive authority.         
	Justice Ganguly then observed that there should have been reasons for bypassing the PMOs reservations. After all, it is a question of collective responsibility.         
	Without naming anyone, Subramanium did not rule out the possibility of individual wrongdoing and said that was being reviewed  a reference to the CBI probe.         
	He argued that allegations levelled in the case based on the comptroller and auditor generals report seem to suggest a complete breakdown of governance and that there were no checks. That is a completely wrong view. If there are extraneous influences (in allotting spectrum), the law will take its own course, he said.         
	Subramanium assured the court that the CBI would probe the case thoroughly. The government will ensure that the probe is successfully completed. There will be no attempt to thwart or impede the probe, he said.         
	Rajas counsel, T. Andhyarujina, opening his defence for the first time, said he was open to any investigation. The media had charged, tried and convicted him on the basis of the draft CAG report, he said, ignoring the fact that the report did not include the ministrys responses.         
	He insisted that Raja had gone by telecom regulator Trais brief of choosing tele-density over revenue. I came on to the scene in May 2007, he said. At least 53 licences were granted by his two predecessors, he said, referring to Arun Shourie and Dayanidhi Maran by name.         
	The CAG report covers the period from 2003 to 2008.

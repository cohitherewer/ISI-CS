The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress tiptoes on Vadra claim
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Congress tiptoes on Vadra claim
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: The Congress leadership today refused to attach much significance to the views of Robert Vadra given in an interview to a newspaper, but the comments appear to have generated curiosity and surprise in the party at different levels.        
	Although some sections thought the nave assertions  Priyanka Gandhis husband was quoted as saying he could win an election from anywhere  should not be taken seriously, several party leaders and workers expressed their disapproval.        
	Asked about Vadras claim, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said: Everybody has the freedom to express his view in this country.         
	He replayed the reply to all related questions, suggesting the party wanted to neither endorse nor contradict Vadras views.        
	Most senior leaders avoided talking about the issue but many felt that Vadras views were not mature.         
	Vadra was quoted as saying there was pressure on him to contest the Sultanpur seat in the 2009 parliamentary elections but he opted out. The Sultanpur ticket was given to Sanjay Singh of Amethis royal family.        
	Some Congress leaders felt it would have been odd to allow a third family member to contest from the neighbouring Sultanpur when Sonia Gandhi was contesting from Rae Bareli and Rahul from Amethi.        
	A topic of cautious debate among Congress leaders was if Vadras views were endorsed by Priyanka. If these were casual remarks of a person who does not understand the nuances of politics, it is fine. But everybody is required to exercise greater restraint in such a sensitive matter, a seasoned politician said.

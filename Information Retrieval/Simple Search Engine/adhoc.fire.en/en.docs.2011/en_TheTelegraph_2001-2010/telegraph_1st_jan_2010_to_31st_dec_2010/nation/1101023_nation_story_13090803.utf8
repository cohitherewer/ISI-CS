          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 22: A showcause notice for revocation of passport has been issued to Lalit Modi, with the foreign ministry today warning that appropriate action would be taken if no reply is received by October 28.        
	The former IPL commissioner is being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for alleged financial irregularities in the organisation of the money-spinning tournament.        
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao today said the ED had sent the foreign ministry a request on October 5 to revoke Modis passport in public interest in general and in the interest of a thorough investigation into the alleged irregularities.        
	Since Modi held a passport issued by the Mumbai regional passport office in July 2008, that office sent him a showcause notice on October 13, Rao said. The notice asked him to explain why action under relevant sections of the Passport Act of 1967 should not be initiated against him.        
	A second notice was sent to him at an alternate Mumbai address on October 15. Modi has responded to neither, she said.        
	Under provisions of the Passport Act, a person gets 15 days from the time he/she receives a notice to represent his/her case.

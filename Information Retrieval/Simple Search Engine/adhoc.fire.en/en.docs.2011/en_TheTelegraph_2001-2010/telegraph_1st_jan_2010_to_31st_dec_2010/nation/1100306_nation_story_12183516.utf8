          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Lucknow, March 5: Ram Milan Nishad has been numbed into silence, his face a mass of wrinkles, the blank look in his eyes disguising the pain the 54-year-old landless farmer is going through.         
	Nishad lost all his four children in yesterdays stampede at the ashram of Baba Kripaluji Maharaj in Kunda of Pratapgarh district, 189km east of Lucknow.         
	A case of criminal negligence has been registered against the ashram management, which had organised a bhandara (community feast) to mark the death anniversary of the wife of the maharaj. The 88-year-old Kripaluji, who went underground within two hours of the tragedy, remains untraceable.         
	Nishads sons were among the 37 children crushed to death when a part of the arched gate collapsed on a sea of villagers, triggering a dash for safety along a narrow corridor which leads to the sprawling ashram-cum-temple complex.         
	Also dead were 26 women, who fell trying to save the children.        
	For 24 hours, Nishad, who works as a migrant labourer in Punjab, had been frantically searching for his four sons  Balkaran, 12, Balveer, 11, Balram, 10, and Jitu, 9.         
	The children were among the 10,000 who had gathered outside the ashram, lured by the offer of free food and gifts.         
	Nishad, who belongs to a backward caste family in Kashipur village of Pratapgarh, a kilometre from the ashram, works in a private farm in Punjab and had come home for Holi. He did not go to the feast as he was expecting a relative at home.        
	His children, however, went along with some neighbours. I was told by my fellow villagers that food and gifts were being distributed free by the ashram. So I allowed the children to go and have food, police sources quoted Nishad as saying.        
	Even the hardened police officials of Uttar Pradesh, used to handling tough criminals, were moved by the sorrow of the man. He was unable to have a last look at his sons, said a police officer, his voice choking.        
	The tragedy occurred in a region where a political race is on to woo Dalits.         
	Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi family and MP from neighbouring Amethi, paid a surprise visit tonight to some of the villages whose residents died in the stampede.         
	Rahul, who has been wooing Dalits in his constituency, reached Kunda in the evening, hours after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh for the next of kin of each of those who died in the mishap.         
	The ashram where the tragedy unfolded is run by the Kripaluji Parishad, which has around 300 centres across the world.         
	Over 400 labourers had taken 14 years to construct the ashram, made of pink stones brought from Jaipur in the eighties. There are separate rooms for Indian and foreign devotees and a special enclosure, which Baba Kripaluji uses for prayers. The ashram even runs a hospital inside the complex.        
	Police sources said the maharaj had figured in several controversies in the past but had never been convicted.        
	Kripaluji was accused of rape by one of his disciples in Trinidad in May 2007. In 1997, he had been accused of rape and indecent assault of a 22-year-old. In 1991, an FIR pertaining to the abduction of two girls had been filed against him. He was arrested in 1992, but was set free as the charges were never proved.

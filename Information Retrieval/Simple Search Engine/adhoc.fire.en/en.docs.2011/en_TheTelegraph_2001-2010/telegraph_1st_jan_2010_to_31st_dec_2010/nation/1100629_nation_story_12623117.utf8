The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | G20 boost to India and US
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      G20 boost to India and US
          MANINI CHATTERJEE                                      Barack Obama      
	Toronto, June 28: The fourth G20 Summit which concluded on Sunday was a shot in the arm for both Barack Obama and Manmohan Singh.         
	The US and India were among the countries that pressed for continuation of efforts to stimulate growth in face of demands from European nations to go in for fiscal consolidation to contain a looming debt crisis.         
	The final summit declaration tilted towards the growth must remain a priority view. Echoing the sentiment expressed earlier on Sunday by Manmohan Singh, the declaration, noted that while growth is returning, the recovery is uneven and fragile, unemployment in many countries remains at unacceptable levels, and the social impact of the crisis is still widely felt. Strengthening the recovery is key.         
	The declaration pitched for strong, sustainable and balanced growth, the need to strengthen our financial systems against risks and usher in far-reaching financial sector reform.         
	Of particular interest to India and other developing countries is the summits renewed commitment to open, transparent and merit-based selection processes for the heads and senior leadership of all the international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.         
	Coupled with the earlier decision to increase the voting power of developing countries by 4.59 per cent in the World Bank and work out a similar arrangement in the IMF, it represents the slow but steadily growing clout of nations which had so far been only at the receiving end of decisions taken by the Big Guns of G8.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, May 8: The Congress leaders ticked off for publicly differing with home minister P. Chidambarams Maoist policy are still lobbying the government for a course correction.        
	The likes of Digvijay Singh, Ajit Jogi, Keshava Rao and B.K. Hariprasad, and a host of state-level functionaries, are still convinced of the futility of the crackdown-first-development-later policy, sources said.        
	They feel the excessive emphasis on police action is vitiating the nature of the discourse and have cited how the Congress had traditionally spoken a different language on the subject.        
	We are not opposing Chidambaram; it is a question of perception. We cannot say that development is not possible till the areas are cleared of Maoists. We must understand that we have to win the people over to be able to clear the areas, Keshava Rao told The Telegraph.        
	The Andhra model is before us and the central government must examine that carefully, he added, stressing a multi-pronged approach.        
	Other sources, though, said the tide had turned in Andhra only when the state launched a ruthless crackdown, forcing the Maoists to flee to neighbouring states.        
	Congress general secretary Digvijay, who had sparked controversy by writing his views in a newspaper article, has reaffirmed his position before the Prime Minister. Sources said Digvijay met Manmohan Singh a few days ago and said the socio-economic and legal aspects of the problem could not be ignored.        
	The Prime Minister is said to have assured him the Centre would definitely consider a view that has been expressed by many Congress leaders.        
	Digvijay met Chidambaram yesterday for the first time after he had criticised the home ministers intellectual arrogance in his article. Sources said Digvijay rued that the media had focused on one sentence and ignored the substance of his write-up, which was primarily critical of the BJP and the Maoists and highlighted some practical aspects of controlling the guerrilla threat.        
	Digvijay also asked Chidambaram to look into a reported RSS role in training IAS aspirants.

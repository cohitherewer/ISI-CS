          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: Schools affiliated to international boards, unregulated now for lack of rules, will not enjoy this freedom much longer with the government planning a law to monitor their activities and limit the number of foreign teachers they can recruit.        
	Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal last month held a meeting with ministry officials and suggested bringing a law to regulate schools affiliated to boards like the International Baccalaureate (IB) and Cambridge International Examination (CIE).        
	International schools, which earlier catered mainly to children of embassy staff, are becoming increasingly popular with high-income parents who want to send their children abroad for higher education.        
	Their number has consequently shot up over the past decade. Compared to two IB-affiliated schools in the country in 2000, there are 64 now. The number of schools affiliated to CIE stands at over 200.        
	The government is concerned about the trend in these schools to appoint foreign teachers on the ground that only they can teach the international curriculum. It is also worried that the absence of regulation might pave the way for the entry of dubious international boards in future.        
	Now the ministry will prepare a bill for regulating the international schools. It will be done in consultation with the state governments, the ministry of external affairs, the ministry of home affairs and the ministry of law, a senior HRD official said.        
	As the number of schools shot up in the past decade, hundreds of foreign teachers started applying for visas at Indian missions abroad.        
	Many foreign teachers who had been granted visas wanted extensions.         
	The external affairs ministry took up the matter with the HRD ministry and asked if there was a policy on the entry of foreign teachers into the country. The home ministry raised security concerns.        
	In 2008, the HRD ministry drew up a regulation stipulating a 20 per cent cap on foreign teachers in international schools. The Union cabinet referred the matter to a Committee of Secretaries because there were divergent views. The committee could not reach a consensus, with some members opposed to a cap. It then sought further clarifications from the HRD ministry.        
	Sibal, at last months meeting, suggested that a law be enacted to regulate these schools and that it should specify a limit on foreign teachers.        
	 The ministry is of the view that Indian teachers are well equipped to teach subjects such as mathematics, physics and literature. However, teachers from abroad might be required to teach subjects specially designed by the international boards.        
	The HRD ministry also believes that foreign teachers should be allowed based on a policy of reciprocity with the respective countries.        
	The international schools charge fees ranging from Rs 12 lakh to Rs 20 lakh per student annually. The proposed legislation may go into the issue of fee structure too, officials said.

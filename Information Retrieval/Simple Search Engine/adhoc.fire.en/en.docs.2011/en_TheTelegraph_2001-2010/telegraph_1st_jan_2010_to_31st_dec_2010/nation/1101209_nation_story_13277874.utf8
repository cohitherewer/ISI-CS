The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Suu Kyi prod to Delhi
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Suu Kyi prod to Delhi
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 8 (PTI): India should play a more active role in democratisation of Myanmar and to engage more with her Opposition party, Aung San Suu Kyi has said.        
	Suu Kyi, 65, said in an interview that India must live up to the reputation of being the biggest democracy in the world and not be dictated by its commercial interests in Myanmar.        
	Commenting on Indias growing economic-driven engagement with the military regime, she said she was not against Indias engagement with Than Shwes ruling military regime but wanted India to have parleys with her National League for Democracy.        
	We would like India to play a more active role in trying to help in the process of democratisation of Burma and I would like the Indian government to engage more with us, the Nobel Peace laureate said in an interview over phone from Yangon.        
	Suu Kyi said Indias foreign policy towards her country was dictated by its commercial side and urged the worlds largest democracy to live up to its reputation by engaging with her pro-democratic party.        
	Indias role in previous decades has been aided firmly by its reputation as the biggest democracy and it has taken pride in this, but perhaps, more attention has turned towards the commercial side, she said. Suu Kyi said she expected the Indian government to look beyond this commercial kind of view when it comes to Myanmar.        
	Suu Kyi, who lived in India in the 1980s, was released in Yangon on November 13 after spending more than seven consecutive years in detention.        
	India is eager to boost its investment in gas and hydro-electricity projects in Myanmar and is eyeing oil and gas fields but fears losing out to China in the race for strategic space in Asia.         
	It also counted on the military juntas help to counter ethnic separatists operating along their remote eastern common border.         
	In July this year, India welcomed Myanmars reclusive military leader General Than Shwe for a state visit and offered a grant of $60 million to build a road connecting Myanmar with Mizoram and pledged $10 million for the purchase of modern agricultural equipment.        
	US President Barack Obama during his trip to India last month criticised India for failing to condemn human rights abuses in Myanmar but India justified its policy as being governed by strategic interest and political compulsion in the region.        
	The daughter of Myanmars assassinated reformer hero General Aung San was released less than a week after the first election in 20 years, dismissed by many as a sham for cementing the military regimes grip on power.        
	General Than Shwe did not contest elections. So, he has not been elected as a leader. Elections have much to be desired in Myanmar. The most optimistic people have said that the election process was deeply flawed and there are many questions on the outcome of the elections, she said.

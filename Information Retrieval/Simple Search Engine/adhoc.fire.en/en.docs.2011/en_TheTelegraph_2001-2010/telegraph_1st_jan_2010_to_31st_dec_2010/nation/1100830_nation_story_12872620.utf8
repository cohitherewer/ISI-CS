          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                                            
	Lucknow, Aug. 29: The Congress and the BJP were agreed on the move, with the blessings of the countrys most powerful Baba whom even governments dare not annoy.        
	So, smooth sailing? Think again.        
	Last weeks scrapping of a hydel project in Uttarakhand is now threatening the Congress with a revolt by its ranks and the states BJP-led ruling alliance with a split.        
	Most unthinkably, Baba Ramdev was yesterday booed and shown shoes and black flags by some of his followers on his home turf when he claimed credit for the projects withdrawal.        
	Four years ago, no minister or MP had dared rise to the support of CPM member Brinda Karat when she questioned the yoga gurus miracle cures in Parliament.         
	Yesterday, Ramdev was told by his followers never to set foot again in Uttar Kashi, just 160km from his headquarters in Hardwar.        
	The Centres decision to abandon the 600MW Lohari Nag Pala project in Uttar Kashi, on grounds of environmental damage, almost coincided with the much-publicised denial of mining clearance to Vedanta in Orissa. This was a reversal of last years go-ahead, following which construction had begun.        
	Congress leaders and workers in Uttar Kashi, 120km from Dehra Dun, say that junking the project will cost 4,000 local people their jobs and hurt the livelihoods of thousands more. You (the Centre) are snatching the jobs of the poor and spurring more migration, thundered district Congress chief Dharmendra Nautiyal.        
	Grassroots Congress workers in several districts are up in arms against the central leadership.        
	Ramdev and local green activists had blocked highways to resist the dam, and the BJP too had lately joined in. Yesterday, the yoga guru was heckled when he boasted at the Ramleela Maidan how he had played a role, resorted to unusual means, blocked roads.        
	Hes trying to do a Bahuguna, scoffed Congress activist Kamal Singh Rana in a reference to Sunderlal Bahuguna whose Chipko movement had stopped a dam being built in the region in the 1980s. Today, ruling ally Uttarakhand Kranti Party announced a pro-dam agitation, its leader Trivendra Pawar saying he might consider snapping ties with the BJP. The dam had raised hopes of jobs for families in the hill villages who are forced to migrate because of poverty. The decision is anti-people, he said.        
	The recommendation to scrap the dam came from a committee that included finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and environment minister Jairam Ramesh. It said the project, set in a quake-prone zone, would require unacceptable levels of tree felling and would submerge villages, displacing large populations.        
	The Centre had already spent Rs 650 crore on the project and placed orders worth Rs 2,000 crore for purchase of materials. The dam was to be built on the Bhagirathi and turn the state into a powerhouse.

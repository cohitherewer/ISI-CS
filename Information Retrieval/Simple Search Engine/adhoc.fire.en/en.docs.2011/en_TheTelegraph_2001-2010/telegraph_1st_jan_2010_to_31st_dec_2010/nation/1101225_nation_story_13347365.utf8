          PULLOCK DUTTA                                     
	Lakwa (Sivasagar), Dec. 24: A huge stack of firewood to keep the kitchen fires burning for over a month, a free canteen to serve 200 persons daily and at least 400 families spread over two villages ready to play host to those expected to accompany the prodigal son.        
	Lakwa Station Chariali, a nondescript settlement about 30km from Sivasagar town in Upper Assam, has turned into a beehive of activity in anticipation of the return of Arabinda Rajkhowa, alias Rajib Rajkonwar, after over 30 years.The jailed Ulfa chairperson is expected to be released soon with court hearings nearing their end.        
	Although a large section of the people do not remember seeing Rajkhowa, and the few who do are battling a fading memory, everyone seems her eager to help with arrangements for his homecoming.        
	The families in two villages near Rajkhowas residence are ready to play host to the visitors expected to accompany him or visit him during his stay here.         
	Everyone here is busy for the arrival of Arabinda Rajkhowa. From the common villager to the shopkeeper, everyone is trying to do their bit for his homecoming, said Biswajeet Tipomia, the president of a welcoming committee monitoring the arrangements.        
	At Rajkhowas residence, located between Charangia Konwar Gaon and Dehingia Konwar Gaon, a temporary pandal and a canteen have been built for the guests expected to arrive with him.        
	We are ready to feed at least 200 persons daily and we have already stocked food items for at least a month. We have also constructed a few temporary bathrooms for the visitors, Tipomia said.        
	The Rajkhowa residence has also been given a new coat of paint. A stones throw away, a platform has been constructed in the playground of Lakwa Tantia Higher Secondary School from where Rajkhowa would be addressing a gathering. It was at this institute that Rajkhowa did his schooling. Adjacent to the higher secondary school, a huge dining hall has been constructed in the playground of Lakwa Majolia School.        
	At least 1,000 persons can dine in the hall at one go. We have made all the preparations and the cooks are ready for the feast, Dipti Rajkowari, a teacher of the school, said.        
	Nityananda Rajkhowa, an elderly villager of Dehingia Konwar Gaon, arrived at the Ulfa chairpersons house this afternoon to enquire when he would arrive.        
	I have lost my son in this struggle. I want to request Rajkhowa to go ahead with the peace process so that my sons sacrifice does not go in vain, he said. Nityanandas son, Nitul, an Ulfa militant, died in an encounter with security forces about three years ago.        
	Nityananda said he had made arrangements for at least three guests to stay at his residence.         
	Tipomia said many well-wishers would arrive with Rajkhowa and the people of the two villagers were ready to provide them accommodation. The visitors would be like strangers in the mist for the villagers, he said.        
	Rahul Gogoi, who runs a stationery shop at Lakwa Station Chariali, said: I have stocked up each and every item in my shop. Since so many people are expected, I am hoping to do brisk business, he said.        
	Welcome arches have been erected from Sivasagar town to welcome Rajkhowa. But the finishing touches have yet to be given.        
	Everything will be ready on time, Tipomia said. A large number of people from Lakwa have gone to Guwahati in the last few days to accompany Rajkhowa, he added.         
	The Tada court in Guwahati today deferred passing its final order on Rajkhowas bail plea till December 27. The court has asked the special public prosecutor to submit a fresh affidavit along with the no-objection petition on the scheduled date. Hearing on Rajkhowas bail plea started earlier this month.

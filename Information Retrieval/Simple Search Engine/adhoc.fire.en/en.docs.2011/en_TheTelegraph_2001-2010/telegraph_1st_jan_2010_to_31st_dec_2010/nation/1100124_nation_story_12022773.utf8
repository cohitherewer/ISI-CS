The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Doctors seek to shed light on sun drill benefits
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Doctors seek to shed light on sun drill benefits
  - 12 times a day for a year                              Schoolchildren perform surya namaskar in Ahmedabad. (File picture)                                  
	After an aerospace engineer in Bangalore set the trend, doctors in Pune are now investigating the centuries-old tradition of sun salutation, or surya namaskar, in independent efforts to seek scientific credence for its claimed benefits.         
	About 500 doctors in Pune have decided to perform the sun-salutation exercise, a sequence of 10 postures performed in graceful movements, 12 times a day at a school ground in a study organised by the local Indian Medical Association.         
	The doctors will have various body and health parameters recorded before they begin the exercise and at the end of a year of consistent exercise to determine any changes that might occur, said Dilip Sarda, president of the IMA, Pune.         
	Sarda said the study would try and determine the impact of the exercise on lifestyle-related health problems. Two of the doctors have undergone bypass surgery in the past.         
	The sun-salutation exercise, which combines several forward-bending movements with backward-bending ones, has long been claimed by yoga specialists as having health benefits, including the control of blood sugar and obesity.         
	An aerospace engineer at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, was among the first to compute that 120 sun salutations allow a person to burn about 350 kilocalories, the energy expenditure equivalent to walking a treadmill for about an hour.         
	Surya namaskar involves smooth, graceful movements, and it is highly aerobic, Subbaramajois Narispur Omkar, an engineer at the IISc, said.         
	With proper breathing, there is adequate oxygen supply to the muscles throughout the cycle of 10 movements, said Omkar, who has computed the likely forces on the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knees and the ankles during the sun salutation.         
	His study, published in August last year in the Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies, has shown that during a sun-salutation exercise, all these joints are exposed to forces that lie within the safe limits.         
	Omkar, who has no expertise in medicine, has predicted that the forces experienced during the joint movements during sun salutation could have a beneficial role in bone health.

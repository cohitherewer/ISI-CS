                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nirupama case twist
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Priyabhanshu                          
	Hazaribagh, May 7: A Koderma magistrate today directed police to lodge a case against Nirupama Pathaks Delhi-based boyfriend Priyabhansu Ranjan for cheating, forgery, rape and abetment of suicide, as the journalists alleged honour killing took a new turn.        
	Police sources said the order followed a complaint by Nirupamas mother Sudha, who had been arrested after giving conflicting statements to police.        
	A team has been sent to Delhi to quiz Priyabhansu, a police officer said.        
	A three-month pregnant Nirupama, 23, was found smothered to death at her Koderma residence on April 29, triggering suspicions of honour killing as her family did not approve of her relationship with Priyabhansu. Her mother had initially claimed that Nirupama was electrocuted but later changed her statement and said it was suicide.        
	Nirupamas elder brother Samendra Pathak said: My mother was so distraught on seeing the body that she lost her mental balance and gave conflicting statements to the police.

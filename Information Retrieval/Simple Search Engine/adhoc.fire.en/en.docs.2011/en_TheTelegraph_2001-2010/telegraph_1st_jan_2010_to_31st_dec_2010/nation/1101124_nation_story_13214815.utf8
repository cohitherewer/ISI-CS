	Mumbai, Nov. 23: K. Unnikrishnan, 62, cycled into Mumbai today in the last lap of his month-long rally that began at Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate and will culminate at the Gateway of India on 26/11, two years after his son Sandeep died fighting terrorists at the Taj.        
	Unnikrishnan, who has travelled through Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Maharashtra, said: The people we met belonged to different regions, religions, languages and ideologies. Yet we were together in our tribute and respect to the martyrs as Indians, across all barriers. This is the nation my son died for.        
	The retired Isro employee and wife Dhanalakshmi, who followed him by car, met families of martyrs on the way and shared their grief. Sandeep Unnikrishnan, an NSG commando who was 31 when he died, was the couples only son.        
	I remember Sandeep telling me how even without him around, I will have a thousand Sandeeps respecting me like he did. As I travel to various places, meeting absolute strangers who shower us with so much love and respect, I know what he meant, Dhanalakshmi said.        
	She said she wished Sandeep, who had taught her how to drive, had also taught her to ride a cycle so that she could have joined the rally  Naman Shahid on Ka (Tribute to Martyrs)  with her husband and Mumbai resident Hiralal Yadav.         
	Yadav had met the couple while he was on his Bharat Jodo rally from Kanyakumari to Delhi in July. He suggested the cycle rally to pay tribute to the martyrs. The loss of their only son had left them dejected. They kept talking about losing hope in life altogether. I thought such a journey would help them know that the entire nation was with them in their grief. Today their strength is serving as a message to the nation, he said.        
	In Maharashtra, the couple met families of martyrs in Jalgaon and addressed armed forces aspirants in Pune. They have also visited Ahmednagar, Aurangabad and Lonavala. In the next two days, they will visit Thane and Dahisar.         
	On November 26 and 27, they will stay at the Taj hotel where their son had lost his life. We need to tell our neighbouring countries that no matter how many people they send to terrorise us, we are ready to face death and save the lives of our fellow Indians like my son did, Unnikrishnan said.

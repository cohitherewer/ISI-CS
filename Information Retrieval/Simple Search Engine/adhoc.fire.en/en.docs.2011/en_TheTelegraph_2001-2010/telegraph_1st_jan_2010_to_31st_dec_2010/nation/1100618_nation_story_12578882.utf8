  - Punishment for speeding          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                                  
	New Delhi, June 17: Punishment for speeding: stand in the corner.        
	When tempo driver Sukhjinder Singh stood up in the dock to face charges of rash driving, judge Kamini Lau left him standing even after the guilty verdict.        
	She had already ordered Singh to pay a compensation of Rs 50,000 to the traffic constable he had injured with his reckless driving over five years ago. Now she chose a classroom punishment rather than a jail term to drive home the lesson. Keep standing till court timings are over, the additional sessions judge told Singh, 36.        
	Since other cases had to be tried too, Singh stood in a corner of the courtroom for several hours, rather like an errant schoolboy punished for bunking class.        
	When court staff giggled at him, Singh glowered at them. When passers-by stopped to ask him about his predicament, the driver told them to mind their own business.        
	Yet, he was lucky  under the charges brought against him, Singh could have been sent away for anywhere between six months and 10 years. After he had hit a constable and broken his hand on December 21, 2004, the police had booked him for rash driving, preventing a public servant from discharging his duty, and deliberately causing hurt to a public servant.        
	The case was watertight, with nine witnesses taking the stand and accusing Singh of rash driving. But the judge decided to be lenient when the defence lawyer pleaded that Singh had no prior criminal record and was the lone provider for his wife, daughter and aged parents, one of whom was paralysed.        
	Delhis lower courts have for some time been coming up with unconventional punishments for rash or drunken driving. Last December, a court asked a student to write I will not drink again 50 times.        
	In February last year, Delhi High Court had ordered a young businessman, who had injured two ice-cream vendors while driving drunk, to work with an NGO for one hour every week for the next six months.        
	In August 2007, a court had sentenced 15 young men, arrested for allegedly assaulting journalists and endangering motorists by performing dangerous stunts in Connaught Place, to community service in gurdwaras for seven hours a week.        
	The same year, a person convicted of drink-driving was sentenced to help city police manage traffic for 10 days.

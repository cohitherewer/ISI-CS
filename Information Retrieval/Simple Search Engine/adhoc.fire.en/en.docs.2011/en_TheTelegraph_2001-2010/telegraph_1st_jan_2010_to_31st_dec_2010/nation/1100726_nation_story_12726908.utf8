                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      YSR mining row
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, July 25: The Centre has forced the cancellation of an iron-ore mining lease to a consortium linked to Y.S. Rajasekhars son-in-law after allegations that the late chief minister had acted improperly to favour his relative.        
	A huge tract of 1.37 lakh acres, including tribal and forest land in Khammam district, was leased out last year to a consortium led by Rakshana Steels, whose executive director Anil Kumar is married to YSRs daughter Sharmila.        
	To get around the ban on private companies mining tribal land, sources said, the Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) declared it lacked the technical power or personnel to mine such a huge area.        
	It then signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the consortium of three steel companies, allowing it to use up all the ore against just a 16 per cent royalty, the government has told the Assembly.        
	The controversy rocked the Assembly in the current monsoon session, prompting chief minister K. Rosaiah to reveal details of the deal. Rosaiah, to whom YSRs son Jaganmohan has been a rival and a constant thorn in the flesh, nudged the Congress high command to get the MoU scrapped.        
	The central Congress leadership, irritated by the constant threat of rebellion emanating from Jaganmohan, acted summarily on Rosaiahs advice. The Centre issued an ordinance on Friday to keep the land allocation in abeyance and directed the APMDC to cancel it. The corporation did so yesterday.        
	State mines minister B. Srinivas Reddy, a relative of YSR, said he had been kept in the dark about the Centres move.        
	According to the state governments revelations in the Assembly, this is how the deal happened:         
	On February 25, 2009, weeks before polls were announced in the state, the APMDC signed a deal with the consortium in which Rakshana holds 54.5 per cent stake, apparently after a high-powered committees recommendations.        
	Rakshana and its partners, Amoda Iron and Steels Limited and Ispat Industries Limited, were to use the iron ore for an integrated steel plant at Bayyaram with a capacity of 0.2-0.3 million tonnes a year.         
	After YSR won the May elections, his government wrote to the Centre on August 27 six days before the chief ministers death in a helicopter crash  seeking environmental and forest clearances. The clearances are still pending.        
	Its clear that YSR had favoured his family during his rule, senior Congress MLA P. Shankar Rao, a Rosaiah loyalist, said.        
	YSRs family had a mining business till a few years before he became chief minister. It mined barytes in Kadapa for decades before the Telugu Desam government cancelled the lease after an inquiry alleged illegal mining.              
	The CPI legislator from Kothagudem, K. Sambasiva Rao, alleged the consortium had already started mining illegally in the Bayyaram forest, on about 240 acres that had been leased to tribals in 2005.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cent per cent successful, says Hasina
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cent per cent successful, says Hasina
  - Bangladesh PM regrets not meeting Basu, pins hope on ministers from Bengal        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Hasina at the shrine of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer on Wednesday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today left Delhi after a very successful visit but had only one regret  she could not be to Calcutta to wish Jyoti Basu speedy recovery.         
	I had planned to visit Calcutta to meet Jyotibabu. There was a limitation of time. He (Basu) is an eminent politician of not just Bengal but the entire region. I pray for his good health and wish him speedy recovery. I hope to visit Calcutta on my next visit (to India), Hasina said before flying to Ajmer to offer prayers at Khawaja Moinuddin Chishtis dargah.         
	After returning to Dhaka, Hasina called her visit to India cent per cent successful.        
	In Delhi, the Bangladesh Prime Minister also acknowledged the contribution of Bengali politicians in the Union cabinet. Hasina praised old personal friend and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee for facilitating the $1-billion (Rs 4,500 crore) credit line that New Delhi has offered to Dhaka.         
	Yesterday, Hasina visited Mukherjees ailing wife at his Delhi residence.         
	Hasina also hoped railway minister Mamata Banerjee would help revamp Bangladeshs rail network. We have big expectations from her, she said.         
	The leader also pledged to go to any extent to curb terrorism in Bangladesh, including inking an extradition treaty with India.         
	We have signed three agreements on security. These should be enough. However, if we encounter problems, we can look at an extradition treaty. Discussions are under way. Our stand is clear, we stand against terrorism. To curb terrorism, we want to co-operate and are willing to go to any extent, Hasina said.         
	However, she evaded a direct reply on the extradition of Ulfa leader Anup Chetia. I am not here to discuss individuals, Hasina said.         
	On Ulfa cadres taking shelter in Bangladesh, Hasina said: Many terrorists from our country are also living in India. It is a common thing.         
	Bangladesh foreign minister Dipu Moni later confirmed that an extradition treaty could be put in place shortly, given the friendly relations between India and Bangladesh.         
	Hasina said her visit had opened a new door for Bangladeshs ties with India but was apprehensive about the Opposition propaganda in her country. I do not know what the Opposition would say. People with anti-India sentiments will remain. I cannot change that. But common people want better lives and if results are achieved (in India-Bangladesh co-operation), these sentiments will not work.         
	She said Islam was a religion of peace but terrorists were giving it a bad name. Terrorists have no religion or borders, they live in their own world, Hasina said, recounting how her family was assassinated in 1975 and how she survived a grenade attack in 2004 that killed 22 leaders and activists of her party, the Awami League.         
	Hasina dismissed criticism on allowing India access to the Mongla and Chittagong ports. These are our resources. We cannot shut our doors. She also hoped that progress would be made to resolve the dispute over the Teestas water.         
	The Prime Minister had a word of advice for India before leaving. India is a big, (economically) strong country. It should look after neighbouring countries on an equal basis. It does not matter if a country is big or small, a sovereign independent country is an independent country (and deserves that respect), she said.

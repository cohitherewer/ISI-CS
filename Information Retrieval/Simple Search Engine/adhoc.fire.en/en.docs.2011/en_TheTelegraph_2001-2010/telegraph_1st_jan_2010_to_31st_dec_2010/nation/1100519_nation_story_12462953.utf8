          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Security personnel inspect railway tracks during the Maoist bandh in Patna on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Patna, May 18: The railways have cancelled seven trains and diverted over a dozen others passing through the Maoist-affected areas of Bihar and Jharkhand with security forces on maximum alert in the wake of the two-day rebel bandh in five states.        
	East Central Railway chief public relations officer Dilip Kumar said the Up and Down Rajendra Nagar-Barkakana Palamau Express and Garhwa Road-Singrauli Link Express were among the trains cancelled till May 19, while the routes of Howrah-Jabalpur Express had been diverted.        
	The Howrah-Jabalpur Express will now take the Gomoh-Mughalsarai-Chopan-Chunar route to reach its destination. The route of Varansi-Ajmer-Ranchi Express, too, has been diverted. The train now will follow the Mughalsari-Gomoh-Rajebera route.         
	The Barwadih-Dehri-on-Sone Passenger also stands cancelled.        
	The railways have also imposed a restriction of 75kmph speed on the Rajdhani and Shatabdi expresses passing through the rebel-hit areas and have decided to run pilot engines ahead of a group of trains passing through the region.        
	Bihar and Jharkhand have a notorious history of Maoists targeting trains, setting railway stations on fire and abducting drivers and other staff.        
	Bihar director-general of police Neelami said additional forces had been deployed on the tracks to ward off the Maoist offensive and all the police stations in the Maoist-affected areas have been kept on highest alert during the bandh.        
	The Naxalite bandh has also affected road transport, inconveniencing thousands of commuters, particularly in Bihars Gaya and Aurangabad districts, many parts of which are rebel stronghold areas.         
	The drivers of government buses in the two districts refused to ply though they were on duty. Many inter-state buses start from Gaya and Aurangabad for various places in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.         
	We are on duty but we will not ply the buses during the bandh. Plying the buses means risking the lives of everyone, said a driver in Gaya.         
	The road transport authorities also admitted the unofficial cancellation of the buses passing through the disturbed areas.

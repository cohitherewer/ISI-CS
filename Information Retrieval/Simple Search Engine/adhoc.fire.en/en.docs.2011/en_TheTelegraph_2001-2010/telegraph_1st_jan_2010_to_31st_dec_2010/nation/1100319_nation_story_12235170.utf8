          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, March 18: The swift state action to break a Trinamul Congress-backed protest barricade at Hindustan Unilever yesterday has sparked a chain of strikes in other Haldia units that supply raw materials to the company.        
	All the strikes are led by Trinamul-affiliated unions. The fresh strikes mean Unilever will continue to face production difficulty.        
	District officials said though the Trinamul union was continuing with its strike at Unilever, they had not stopped workers from entering the plant. Production was normal till about 4pm today. But afterwards, it was affected when the supply of raw materials was interrupted, Srikumar Tarafdar, additional district magistrate in charge of Haldia, said.        
	About 360 Trinamul-affiliated workers and drivers of two companies  Pioneer Logistics and Unicrystal Technochem  that supply chemicals to Unilever stopped work. They told the management that the strikes were in support of the workers at Unilever.        
	My workers do not have any grievance against me. They told me that they are on strike only to create problems for the Unilever unit, said Khokon Pradhan, manager of both Pioneer Logistics and Unicrystal Technochem.         
	About 40 truck drivers and cleaners from RDB Rasayan, which supplies plastic bags to Unilever, also halted work.         
	Only one truck carrying chemicals entered the Unilever unit this morning before the strike started.        
	Shibnath Sarkar, working president of the Trinamul union at Unilever and the three other companies, said: We will not cooperate with the management till our demand is met.         
	The Unilever workers have been on an indefinite strike since March 2 demanding reinstatement of four employees sacked for refusing to obey transfer orders.        
	The workers had blocked the main gate with barricades, but yesterday Calcutta High Court ordered police to clear the area.

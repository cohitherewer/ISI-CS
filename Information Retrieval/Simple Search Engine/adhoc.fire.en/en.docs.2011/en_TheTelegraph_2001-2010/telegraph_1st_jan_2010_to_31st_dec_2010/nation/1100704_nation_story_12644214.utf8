	Patna, July 3: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had a close shave today when his helicopter allegedly flew with one of its doors open.        
	The emergency alarm beeped soon after take-off from Giddhaur, about 240km from Patna, and the chopper made an emergency landing within two minutes.         
	Sources said the pilots decided to land after hearing an unusual sound that some on the chopper thought was that of a video recorder hitting against a duster.         
	The chief minister flew again after the two pilots, Raman and Ravi, ran the customary checks.        
	Along with Nitish on the chopper were Janata Dal (United) national general secretary Shivanand Tiwary and Bihar food and civil supplies minister Narendra Singh.        
	They had gone to Giddhaur, near the border with Jharkhand in south-east Bihar, to meet the bereaved family of Banka MP Digvijay Singh, who died recently at a London hospital.         
	Jamui district superintendent of police Vinod Kumar said the chartered helicopter took off with its door open. Sources said it had not been bolted properly and it appeared to be coming off when the chopper was in the air.        
	Nitish tried to play down the incident, describing it as a minor trouble, but an inquiry has been ordered.        
	The chief minister said: (Some) minor trouble had occurred in the chopper. It was corrected and we came back to Patna safely.         
	Special branch additional director-general of police S. Nimbran has announced a probe.         
	The chief minister had failed to turn up for the cremation of his estranged colleague Digvijay on Monday. Digvijay, a former Union minister, was a founder of the Samata Party, the earlier incarnation of the Dal (United), along with George Fernandes and Nitish.         
	In 2009, he won the Banka seat as an Independent, defying a campaign against him by the Bihar chief minister.         
	Nitish today ended his over two-month-old Vishwash Yatra and blogged about a wind of change that he saw sweeping across the state. I have been working without break ever since I took over as the state chief minister keeping in mind the philosophy aharnish seva mahe (uninterrupted work through the day and night), he said.        
	Back to Dal (U)        
	Suspended leader Arun Kumar was today taken back into the Dal (U) in the chief ministers presence.         
	The return of the man earlier accused of anti-party activities is being interpreted as part of the partys attempts to woo the Bhumihars before the Assembly polls.

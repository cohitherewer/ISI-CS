The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Whiff of Jaswant return in BJP invite

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              Gadkari, Jaswant				                                 
	New Delhi, June 10: Jaswant Singh appears set to return to the BJP less than a year after he was expelled.        
	Party president Nitin Gadkari called on Singh last night at the Darjeeling MPs residence and invited him to this weekends BJP national executive in Patna. The party had wanted to flaunt the comeback at its public meeting on June 13.        
	But sources close to Singh said he had told Gadkari that some distance still needed to be covered and until the modalities and outstanding issues were sorted out, he would not wish to return. BJP sources said leaders were fine-tuning a credible statement to explain Singhs comeback. But Gadkaris overture indicated the RSS had endorsed the move.        
	The process of bringing back Singh was started by L.K. Advani. Sources said Advani could not live with the charge that he had acquiesced to his expulsion by keeping mum at the meeting last August that decided Singh was unwanted in the BJP.        
	Advani, sources claimed, was dead opposed to the move but had gone along with the dominant mood at the Shimla chintan baithak (introspection sitting) where there was a clamour for throwing out Singh.        
	Never a favourite with hardcore BJP members of RSS origin, Singh was expelled after the rounded view he took of Mohammed Ali Jinnah in Jinnah: India-Partition-Independence. The book was released just before the chintan baithak.        
	Narendra Modi, Vinay Katiyar and Ananth Kumar were furious with not just Singhs lenient treatment of Jinnah but also with his critical references to Sardar Vallabhai Patel. Modi, who was facing local elections in Gujarat at the time, was reported to have said he would lose if Singh was allowed to go scot-free.        
	Advani, who was similarly forced to step down as party president because of his praise of Jinnah on a visit to Karachi in 2005, was said too have wondered if Singhs expulsion would hurt the liberal image he was trying to create for himself. But the veteran still did nothing. Modi went on to ban Singhs book in Gujarat.

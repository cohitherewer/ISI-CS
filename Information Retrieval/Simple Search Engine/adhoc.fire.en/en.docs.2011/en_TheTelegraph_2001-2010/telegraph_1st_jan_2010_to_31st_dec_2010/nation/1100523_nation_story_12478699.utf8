The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rules flouted, say green groups

          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, May 22: The Mangalore airport runway where the Air India Express aircraft touched down this morning before tumbling into a forested valley violated norms prescribed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), two environmental groups claimed today.         
	The Boeing 737-800 from Dubai to Mangalore landed on the 2,450-metre runway and overshot it, falling into a valley beyond the runway, which had a safety area of 90 metres, a civil aviation ministry statement said. Aviation officials said the runway complied fully with national norms.         
	But two local environmental groups which had opposed the expansion of Mangalore airport through two PILs  initially in 1997 and again in 2002  today said the Mangalore runway had not conformed to international standards of airport design.         
	Its so sad  what we had feared has come true today. If national aviation authorities had taken note of our warnings, this may not have happened today, said Arthur Pereira, a spokesperson for the Local Communities Alliance Against Airport Expansion, Bajpe.         
	The alliance and another non-government organisation named the Environmental Support Group had cited ICAO documents to argue against the construction of the runway.         
	According to the two groups, the ICAO prescribes standards for providing minimum area for a stopway and a clearway in case an aircraft undershoots or overshoots a runway.         
	The ICAO guidelines specify there should be a width of 150 metres on either side of the central line of the runway, Pereira said. But this runway is only 200 metres wide.         
	In the tabletop topography where Mangalore airport is nestled, there was no space to construct a 300-metre-wide runway, Pereira said.         
	No one bothered to follow this up  they questioned our technical competence to raise these issues, Pereira told The Telegraph in an interview today.         
	Karnataka High Court dismissed both the petitions and the Supreme Court in 2003 ruled that it saw no reason to interfere with the high court order. The Supreme Court had, however, asked the government to comply with laws while constructing the runway.         
	The environmental groups in 2004 wrote to the Airports Authority of India, cautioning it that going ahead with the new runway would jeopardise passenger safety (and) put local communities at risk but received no response.         
	The construction of the second runway began in 2004 and it was commissioned in May 2006.         
	Civil aviation secretary M. Madhavan Nambiar said that since the airstrip was made operational in 2006, there had been more than 32,000 problem-free landings.         
	We have not had a single complaint from any pilot, Nambiar said. He said the airstrip met all standards stipulated by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.         
	A senior pilot with Air India told The Telegraph that an aircraft might overshoot a runway for multiple reasons and what happened in Mangalore today was still unclear.         
	An aircraft may have too high a speed at touchdown, it may have a brake failure, or it may have a late touchdown, the pilot, who requested anonymity, said.         
	Lots of things may cause an aircraft to overshoot. We cant speculate about todays incident without more information, the pilot said.

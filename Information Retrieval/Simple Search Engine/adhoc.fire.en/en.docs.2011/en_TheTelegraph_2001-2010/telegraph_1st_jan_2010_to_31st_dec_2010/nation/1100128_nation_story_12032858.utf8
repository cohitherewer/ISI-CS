          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 27: The police commissionerate is interrogating three tribal youths and owner of a cyber caf in connection with the threat email sent to chief minister Naveen Pattnaik on the eve of Republic Day.        
	The email warned Naveen that it would be his last sunrise if he dared to attend the Republic Day celebrations at Cuttack. The mailer also threatened to bomb the Jharpada jail where Maoist cadre Shubhashree is lodged.        
	The police commissionerate managed to track the internet caf from where the threat email was sent but could not extract much information. However, the cops have continued quizzing the owner of the caf and three tribal youths who used to frequent the caf as per the information provided by the owner of the shop.        
	However, interrogations are still on to find out the original sender.         
	There has been no arrest yet. It is a scientific and technical investigation. The mail originated from a cyber caf in Bhubaneswar. We grilled the owner, but found little information about the sender, police commissioner B.K. Sharma said.        
	The mail account appeared to be a fake one, said the police.         
	It was a Rediffmail account created just a few minutes before the mail was sent. The person signed himself as Prakash Behera. Contents of the mail were both in English and Oriya. The Oriya part was written in English script, said sources.

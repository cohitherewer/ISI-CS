          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 13: Chief minister Naveen Patnaiks first meeting with those against the Posco project yielded a minor breakthrough with the agitators agreeing to allow government officials conduct their land survey.        
	They have agreed that the survey work will continue and peacefully, chief minister Naveen Patnaik told reporters here this evening.        
	The agreement was reached at a meeting between Naveen and a delegation of Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, an organisation which has been leading the agitation against the mega steel plant.        
	The breakthrough was made after the chief minister assured the delegation that he would visit the area.         
	Though the survey started a fortnight ago, government officials had not been able to enter Dhinkia gram panchayat limits because of stiff opposition from locals.        
	Posco, the worlds fourth largest steel maker, had signed an MoU with the Orissa government on June 22, 2005 to set up of a 12 MTPA greenfield steel plant involving an investment of $12 billion.        
	However, the plant, billed as Indias largest foreign direct investment project, failed to take off as protesting villagers under the PPSS banner resisted land acquisition vehemently.        
	However, for the first time in five years, the protesters sat down to talk to the chief minister today. Certain members of PPSS came to meet me. They agreed that survey work would continue. They also requested me to visit the area, Naveen said.        
	The chief minister added that he would listen to different sections of project affected people and discuss their problems with them.        
	On being asked when he would visit the Posco area, the chief minister said: We will choose an appropriate time after the survey is completed.         
	He added that the renewal of MoU with Posco would be made soon.         
	Describing the meeting with the chief minister as successful, PPSS chief Abhay Sahu said: Let the chief minister visit the area and see for himself how the proposed Posco project would affect the livelihood of locals.        
	Sahu conceded that they had agreed to the survey work continuing on the assurance that no police personnel would be present during the survey.        
	Asked whether the PPSS demanded shifting of the project site, Sahu said they would discuss the issue after the chief minister visited the site.

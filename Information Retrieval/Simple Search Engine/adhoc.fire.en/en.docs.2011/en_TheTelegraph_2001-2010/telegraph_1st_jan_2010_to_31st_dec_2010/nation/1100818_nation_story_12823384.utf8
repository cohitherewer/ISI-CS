  - Agitators stall DVC expansion        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bankura, Aug. 17: The hunger for jobs in Bengal burst again today with 1,500 villagers halting a Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) expansion project meant to supply power to the Commonwealth Games.        
	The protesters at the DVCs Mejia Thermal Power Station in Bankuras Gangajalghati stopped the laying of pipelines for the second phase of the project claiming the public-sector companys officials had not provided them with jobs as promised when their land was taken five years ago.         
	Police used batons and teargas to disperse the crowd, leaving at least five villagers, including two women, injured. Seven cops were also hurt in the clash. Bankura SP Pranab Kumar said the crowd pelted the cops with stones and damaged a police vehicle.        
	Sources said company officials had agreed in principle to offer jobs  in addition to the monetary compensation which has been paid  but not made any firm commitment nor set any deadline.        
	Around 520 villagers had been given jobs in the first phase when the original 1340MW plant  among the largest of the DVCs units was built. The demand now pertains to a 1000MW expansion which will be carried out by setting up two units of 500MW each in time for the October Games in Delhi.        
	The protests also assume significance because direct gains to Bengal from the project are at present limited to jobs. The bulk of the power generated at the existing plant goes to the northern states and the railways. A similar arrangement is likely for the expanded 1000MW portion once the Games are over.        
	Todays agitation is a setback. If there is no further trouble, we hope to complete the work in 15 days. Just 1km of the 16km pipeline from the Durgapur Barrage remains to be laid. Since the project is connected with the Games, the administration is helping us, said chief engineer D.P. Singh.        
	The protesters were mainly from three villages around Gangajalghati, around 210km from Calcutta, from where the land for the second phase was acquired. But residents of neighbouring villages have also joined the agitation, which has been organised under the banner of the Bhumihara Committee.        
	The Mejia job cry mirrors agitations elsewhere in Bengal. At the airport city project in Burdwans Andal, land losers have been demanding jobs and higher plot prices. Villagers who have given land for the expansion of the IISCO plant at Burnpur, in Asansol, have also hit the streets for jobs.        
	The Trinamul Congress has backed the Mejia agitation. Party leaders joined the protesters today. Arup Chakraborty, the working president of Trinamul in Bankura, said: The villagers are making a just demand.

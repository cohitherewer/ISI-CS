	Calcutta, July 7: CPM state secretary Biman Bose today said the Election Commission could not go by the whims of any particular person and hold early Assembly polls in Bengal.        
	Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee had on several occasions demanded that the Assembly polls in Bengal be advanced and, if possible, be held in October-November.         
	The poll panel has to act according to constitutional provisions. A decision on advancing elections in Bengal cannot be taken on the basis of the whims of any particular person. The panel knows its rights and duties and should go by them, Bose said.         
	Bose said election commissioner S.Y. Qureshi had rightly ruled out the possibility of early polls yesterday. He is aware of the Constitutions jurisdiction, he said.

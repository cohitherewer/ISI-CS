  - Former Samajwadi leader marches for Poorvanchal        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Lucknow, Dec. 27: Accused of breaking celebrity families, Amar Singh has now set his eyes on breaking up a state but is ready to sacrifice his life for it.        
	The expelled Samajwadi Party leader today completed a 450km padayatra from Allahabad to Gorakhpur, weathering the dusty roads of the heartlands east to mobilise support for carving out a Poorvanchal from Uttar Pradesh.        
	For the 54-year-old leader, now recovering from an acute kidney ailment, the past four weeks have been a break from his signature politics of manipulation and forging relations.        
	Amar says he has addressed over 80 public gatherings since he started his journey from Allahabad on December 1, stopping over at Azamgarh, Jaunpur, Varanasi, Deoria and Maharajganj before reaching Gorakhpur, where he will hold a rally on the last day of the year.        
	At some places, he was accompanied by film star-turned-politician Jaya Prada.        
	Till the districts of the Uttarakhand hills were with Uttar Pradesh, no development had taken place there, but look at the state today, Amar said.         
	Yes, he may have been blamed for creating bad blood between Sanjay and Priya Dutt, for alienating Anil Ambani from elder brother Mukesh, but carving out a separate Poorvanchal state is necessary, he says.        
	At every place he stopped, Amar focused on the regions neglect by previous rulers. His former boss, Mulayam Singh Yadav, he said, always used the electricity produced in the region to light up homes in Etawah, more specifically at Saifai, the Samajwadi chiefs village.        
	Samajwadi sources said this was a gross misinformation campaign against Mulayam, but Amars campaign has made the party sit up.        
	The party is, in principle, opposed to the creation of a new Poorvanchal state but might take a look at decentralisation of governance for the regions development, the sources said.        
	The Samajwadi Party will hold its seventh state convention at Gorakhpur on February 9-12 and the party national president, Mulayam Singh Yadav, will inaugurate it. The convention will discuss problems of the region, explain its stand on the regions economic development and also take a strong resolution against the Mayavati government, Rajendra Chaudhry, a spokesman for the party and a former minister, said in a statement today.        
	Party sources said they were being forced to take into account the response Amar had got in the region and the way he was roping in regional outfits like the Akhil Bharatiya Nishad Ekta Manch, the Peace Party and Bharatiya Samaj Party.        
	So long, Amar had faced allegations of taking sides. In an interview last month, he had responded to charges of creating bad blood between Sanjay and Priya, Anil and Mukesh, and Amitabh Bachchan and younger brother Ajitabh.        
	I take sides so I get the flak, he had told the interviewer.        
	Today, he insisted he was taking sides too, but for a cause.        
	This time it is for a region and I am ready to sacrifice my life for the region, he said.        
	Amar said the Poorvanchal region had 28 parliamentary constituencies and 147 Assembly segments. Of the regions 90 million people, 40 per cent were hungry and impoverished. The situation, he added, was worse than what Uttarakhand was before 2000 when it was carved out of Uttar Pradesh.        
	Amars associates said he was keeping options open and could even approach the Congress for help.

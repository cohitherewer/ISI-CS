          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 23: After the tourism industry was affected by the economic slowdown and Kandhamal violence last year, the state government has now drawn up a perspective plan with a target of 15 per cent growth in tourist arrival within next five years.        
	We expect a footfall of 1.2 crore by 2014, said tourism minister Debi Prasad Mishra.        
	Last year, 69.1 lakh tourists had visited the state, he added.        
	Mishra said the five-year perspective plan, approved by chief minister Naveen Patnaik today, was prepared keeping employment, infrastructure and publicity in view. It envisaged tourism projects, which would generate direct employment for 1.2 lakh people and indirect employment for another 3 lakh, he said.        
	A new tourism policy would be announced soon to encourage private investment for development of tourism infrastructure. The number of hotel rooms would be increased from 24,197 to 35,752 in the next five years, he added.

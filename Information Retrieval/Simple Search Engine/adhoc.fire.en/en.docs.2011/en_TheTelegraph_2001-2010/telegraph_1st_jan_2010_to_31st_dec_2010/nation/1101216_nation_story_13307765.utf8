The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal first in rape complaints 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bengal first in rape complaints 
          CITHARA PAUL                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: From No. 2 in the last three years, Bengal has crawled to No. 1  in the number of rape complaints in the country.        
	The state that was once regarded one of the safest for women has recorded 3,029 rape cases till October this year, displacing Madhya Pradesh that had the highest number in the past three years.        
	According to provisional data being compiled by the women and child development ministry, Bengal is followed by Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, which have recorded 3,012 and 1,889 rape cases respectively.        
	The figures are based on complaints filed by alleged rape victims that are yet to be investigated.        
	Bengal has also reported the highest number of incest cases, 112. It has logged 15,571 cases of torture, second only to Andhra that reported 16,246 cases.        
	Surajit Kar Purakayastha, the additional director- general (law and order), said it would not be fair to comment on the Bengal rape figures without verifying them.         
	However, if the figures were true, it was because more complaints were being registered now than ever before.        
	Growing awareness, especially in rural areas where most of these crimes take place, has resulted in a proportionate increase in the number of rape cases being registered in Bengal. This is a key reason. It is not that a new trend is developing, he told The Telegraph.        
	But women and child development ministry officials attributed the rise in rape cases to general unrest coupled with political turmoil in Bengal.        
	Bengal is going through a lot of turmoil, political and otherwise. Naturally, all these will have a reflection on behavioural patterns, too. What else explains the fact that the state used to have one of the lowest crime rates among women in the last decade? asked an official.        
	However, only Bengal could not be singled out because there had been a rise in rape cases across the country, he said. But the fact that the land of Kali is becoming a dangerous place for women is something that has to be looked upon seriously by the government.        
	According to the compiled data, the incidence of rape in the country has been increasing. In 2008, about 21,397 cases were reported, with Madhya Pradesh logging 2,937, followed by Bengal with 2,263 and Uttar Pradesh with 1,871.        
	But in 2009, the figure went up to 21,467, with Madhya Pradesh reporting 3,116 cases, followed by Bengal with 3,001 and Maharashtra with 1,212.        
	Although the 2009 data suggests that women from all age groups were victims, about 57.2 per cent were found to be between 18 and 30 years, proving they are the most vulnerable. In as many as 91 per cent (19,542) cases, the victims knew the offenders. Neighbours were involved in 33.1 per cent cases.        
	The women and child development ministry is working on a scheme for rehabilitation of rape victims. It is holding consultations with womens organisations and NGOs.

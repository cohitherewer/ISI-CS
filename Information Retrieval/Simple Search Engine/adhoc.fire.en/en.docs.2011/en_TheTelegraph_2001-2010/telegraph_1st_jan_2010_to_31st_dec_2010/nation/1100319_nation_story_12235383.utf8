	March 18: The CPM today confirmed it was against the party-led Kerala governments move to appoint Amitabh Bachchan as the states tourism ambassador as the actor was being used by Narendra Modis government.        
	Politburo member Sitaram Yechury publicly said he was sure something like that will never happen. The state government will take the final decision. But I am sure that the Left Democratic Front government will not use the same tourism ambassador who is being used by Narendra Modis government in Gujarat, Yechury told reporters in Delhi today.        
	The Telegraph had reported on Thursday the objections of the CPM, which fears any association with Bachchan, who had praised Modi, could provoke a backlash from Muslims in next years state polls.        
	There was no word from the government in the wake of Yechurys statement. Tourism minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, who had personally invited Bachchan to be the brand ambassador, wasnt available for comment. But front convener Vaikom Viswan said in Thiruvananthapuram: If Yechury has said so, Ive nothing further to add. There it stands.        
	The turn of events appear to have put in a flap Balakrishnan, a politburo member like Yechury. The minister had called a news conference to announce that Bachchan had agreed and claimed the star had called him to confirm his willingness.        
	But another politburo member in Delhi appeared to blame over-enthusiastic bureaucrats. Our minister (Balakrishnan) has apparently got carried away by some officials who were over-enthusiastic about Bachchan.         
	 Tourism department officials indicated, however, that they would press ahead with the move. State tourism secretary Venu V. said: The government has not taken a stand contrary to its position (of getting Bachchan on board as the brand ambassador). My office received a call from Bachchans office yesterday. I intend to proceed with the matter till the government instructs me otherwise.        
	Another department official said despite the controversy, we believe Bachchan will finally be our brand ambassador.         
	Opposition leader, Oommen Chandy of the Congress, saw in the divergent positions of the two politburo members  Yechury and Balakrishnan  a sign of the confusion in the CPM, which is fighting anti-incumbency.         
	 On the one hand, they expelled a person who merely cited the development initiatives of Modi while on the other, they exalted him (Bachchan) to (almost becoming) brand ambassador. This is the plight of the CPM. But I dont want to join the controversy, he said.        
	The CPM had suspended former MP Abdullah Kutty for praising Modis development model.

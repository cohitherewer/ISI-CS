          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, March 13: A senior Shia cleric has touched off a row in the context of the womens reservation bill by saying that women should be good mothers of leaders instead of trying to be leaders themselves.        
	The statement has prompted activists to brand Maulana Kalbe Jawwad as someone living in the medieval age.        
	Muslim women activists have demanded that Jawwad, a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, take back his words.        
	The law board, which will meet here from March 19 to 21, has distanced itself from Jawwads remarks, saying they do not reflect the boards views.        
	There has been no reaction from Jawwads uncle and vice-president of the board, Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, a scholar known for his moderate and liberal views.        
	Jawwads remarks came yesterday in Allahabad after a workshop on the womens reservation bill, which he had opposed. Muslim clerics in the heartland states have been debating the issue ever since the Rajya Sabha passed the bill.        
	Women should become good mothers for that is the role God has assigned to them. They should become mothers of good leaders rather than try to be leaders themselves, Jawwad said.        
	Women are not born to do horse-riding or fire from guns. Women are not made for shoemaking, or working at liquor outlets or delivering speeches in public rallies like men. Who will take care of their children when they are sitting in Parliament? We cant use these parameters to say women are making progress.        
	Lucknow-based scholar Naim-ur-Rahman Siddiqui countered Jawwads remarks by asking him to explain the conduct of the Prophets daughter and wife, Bibi Fatima and Bibi Ayesha, respectively, who led Muslim armies and assumed various leadership roles.         
	What about the Iranian parliament which has a fair amount of women representatives? Naim asked.        
	Muslim women demanded an apology from the cleric. This amounts to an insult to women of all faiths. Jawwad should tender an apology and withdraw his statement, said Shaista Amber, president of the Muslim Womens Personal Law Board.

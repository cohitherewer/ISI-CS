          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 29: An anti-corruption court has ordered a probe into the return of a Rs 200-crore prime plot taken over years ago, putting former chief minister K. Rosaiah under the glare.        
	The directive came on a petition against an order by the Andhra government in October, when Rosaiah was chief minister, exempting 9.14 acres from the purview of the urban land ceiling act.        
	The case goes over two decades back, when the government acquired 24 acres in Ameerpet. A multi-storeyed complex has come up there but 9.14 acres were still vacant.        
	Some of the former owners requested that the 9.14 acres be returned as their holdings did not exceed the urban land limit. Every chief minister had rejected their plea. But Rosaiah, who stepped down recently, used his discretionary powers to rule in their favour.        
	The petitioners alleged that those who benefited from the order had forged documents. What is surprising is that Rosaiah issued orders on the same file where the late Y.S.R. Reddy had put negative remarks, said a source in the current CMO.        
	The documents have been sent to a forensic lab to test if Rosaiahs signature was forged. The court has directed the anti-corruption bureau director-general to conduct a probe and report by January 28.

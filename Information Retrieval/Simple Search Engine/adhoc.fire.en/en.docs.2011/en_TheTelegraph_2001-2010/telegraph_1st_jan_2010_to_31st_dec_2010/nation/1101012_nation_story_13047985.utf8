          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Oct. 11: The Telangana agitation has rocked Andhras technology cradle, months after having hit its IT industry.        
	Over 26 per cent of the 1.8 lakh seats in the states 690-odd engineering colleges have had no takers, the drop fuelled by concerns among students and parents that bouts of unrest over the statehood demand are disrupting studies. At this time last year, only 3 per cent of the 1.5 lakh seats on offer then had gone unfilled.        
	The agitation, which has ebbed since peaking last December and in January this year, could pick up again with political parties, including statehood spearhead TRS, threatening to hit the streets if the Centre-appointed Sri Krishna Committee does not accept the demand in its report to be submitted by December.        
	Uncertainty over whether they (prospective students) will be able to complete courses, threat to academic activity and the prospects of renewed violence have kept many of them, particularly those from other states, away, said K.C. Reddy, former chairperson of the state higher education council that regulates admissions. The colleges draw a large number of students from the east, including Bengal, and the Northeast.        
	Only 95,000, or 54 per cent, of the 1.42 lakh students who cleared entrance tests took admission after the first round of counselling  pre-entry guidance to select courses and colleges  ended on Wednesday. That left 47,000 seats, or 46 per cent, vacant. Colleges fear the no-taker count will rise further after the second round of counselling.        
	Some of the vacancies also stem from the fact that there are 38 more colleges, and 30,000 extra seats, on offer than last year but the Telangana agitation remains the overriding concern among teachers and students. It does not help matters that the Telangana region, which includes Hyderabad, accounts for almost half of the states nearly 700 colleges. The rest are in coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema.        
	Even students from the Telangana area are choosing colleges in Rayalaseema and coastal Andhra, an education department official said.        
	But if the statehood spasms are a bane for Andhra, it seems to have come as a boon for its neighbours. Officials say many students have taken admission in engineering colleges in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.        
	The desperation for students  and the need to keep the coffers from going barren  has seen colleges dangling baits ranging from cheaper accommodation facilities, free transport and healthcare and special hostel feasts. Donations, a regular feature in many of the colleges with sums of Rs 5 lakh common, are being waved.        
	Also being promised are annual vacations in Bali Islands and Mauritius, though the expenses are likely to be worked into the fees. Even offers of trips to Singapore, Dubai and Bangkok are common, says Nirmala Goud, who joined an engineering college in Medak attracted by the prospect of a trip to the Bali Islands.        
	But there is also flip side to the hard-sell: agents and touts engaged by colleges to attract students are tampering with prospectuses to promise facilities and courses that the institutions do not have or cant provide.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Feuding sides at Chabad memorial
          SADAF MODAK                               
	Mumbai, Nov. 25: Remembering you, thanks to court.        
	A memorial service tomorrow on the second anniversary of the Mumbai terror attacks tomorrow will bring together the two sides locked in a legal dispute over the way the 26/11-ravaged Nariman House should be rebuilt.        
	A city court today allowed them to conduct the service for Rabbi couple Gavriel Holtzberg and Rivka, and four others killed during the attack.         
	The service will be held in the presence of a court receiver and 50 people from the defendants side, including the parents of the Rabbi couple, and 10 from the plaintiffs group, judge S.P. Deshmukh said.        
	The New York-headquartered Chabad Lubavitch, the Jewish group that runs the centre, filed a suit last month questioning the authority of Nachman Holtzberg, the father of the slain rabbi, in carrying out the renovation.        
	The group had named Holtzbergs representative Eliran Russo as the main defendant, saying the work undertaken by him was unauthorised and illegal. While the property has been placed in the court receivers custody, the municipal authorities have cut power and water supply to the building till the matter is settled.         
	Russo has filed an affidavit in the court alleging the Chabad group of misusing funds being collected for the revamp. Russo, an Israeli national, also requested the court today to add Holtzbergs name as a defendant along with his own as he is present in the country now.         
	Judge Deshmukh has barred further constructions till the matter is settled. The next hearing is on December 7.        
	Nachman, along with his wife, has come to Mumbai for the hearing of the dispute and for the service for his son and daughter-in-law.         
	The matter will be heard again on December 7.        
	Baby Moshe, the slain couples son, was saved after his nanny managed to bring him out of the house during the attack on the night of November 26, 2008. Just short of two years then, the four-year-old now lives with his grandparents in Israel.

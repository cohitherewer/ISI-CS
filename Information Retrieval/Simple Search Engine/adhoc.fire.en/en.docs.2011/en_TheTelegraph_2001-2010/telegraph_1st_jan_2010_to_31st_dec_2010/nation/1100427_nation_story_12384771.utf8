The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalit-like but Mr Clean
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lalit-like but Mr Clean
          BASANT RAWAT                          Chirayu Amin                                  
	Ahmedabad, April 26: In many ways, Chirayu Amin is a mirror image of the man he has temporarily succeeded at the helm of the Indian Premier League. Also, strikingly different.        
	Like Lalit Modi, the suspended IPL chairman, the 62-year-old Amin, a surprise pick as interim head of the cash-rich league, also belongs to an illustrious business family.         
	And like Modi, known for his BMWs, private planes and yacht and vacations in exotic locales, Amin, too, is fond of the good things in life.         
	The chairman and managing director of Alembic Pharmaceuticals loves expensive cars  Amin has a fleet of gleaming Porsches, BMWs and Mercs. He is also a licensed aviator and often flies the company aircraft.         
	But there ends the similarities.         
	Amin, sources said, jealously guards his privacy and, in spite of his success as an industrialist, is rooted to the ground.         
	The contrast is stark.         
	Modi, 46 is flashy and flamboyant, enjoys his moment under the sun clad in dapper suits and designer ties, is ever willing to pose for the flashbulbs and offer a soundbite as he emerges from the swanky BMWs he owns.         
	Amin, on the other hand, shuns the spotlight and is extremely media shy, so much so that few journalists have his cellphone number in Gujarat though he has been president of the Baroda Cricket Association for a decade and has also remained chairman of Ficci, the trade organisation.        
	Sources in Gujarat who have worked with Amin in various capacities said there cannot be a better man to steer the IPL in a time of crisis.        
	Amin is best suited for this job now, considering his experience, stature and administrative acumen, said Pochi Patel, former secretary of the Gujarat Cricket Association.        
	Amin, who is also a vice-president of the BCCI, has been elected unopposed as president of the Baroda Cricket Association several times. But, sources said, he has delegated responsibility and seldom interfered in the day-to-day running of the association and not allowed cliques to develop.         
	Amins low profile and clean reputation appear to have convinced the Indian cricket board to name him as the interim chairman of the IPL.         
	A science graduate who did his MBA from the US, Amin has expanded his business in Himachal Pradesh. His three sons  Pranav, Sounak and Udit  also look after the family business.         
	As a businessman, Amin wants to be seen as an apolitical person, though it is well known that he is close to NCP chief and Union minister Sharad Pawar.         
	Despite his proximity to Pawar, sources said, what made Amin acceptable to all was that he was uncontroversial, with a clean image and administrative experience  whether it is running a business empire or a cricket body.        
	Though he maintains a low profile, he is a dynamic and straightforward person who does not fear anything. At times he can be very blunt and assertive, said Patel.         
	Amins networking ability and contacts with the right people have worked in his favour given that Modi was quite open about his proximity to the high and mighty of the land.         
	The only thing that worries those who have known Amin is whether he will be able to devote time. Owing to his busy schedule, Amin has often been unable to attend meetings of the BCCI, though he was considered to be a member of the presidents core group.

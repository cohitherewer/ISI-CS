                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Blackmail whiff in letter to Kalmadi
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 25: The CBI today claimed to have seized an incriminating letter from Suresh Kalmadis home and said it appeared that the Commonwealth Games organising committee chief was being blackmailed.        
	The letter is written by a person who demanded Rs 4 crore from Kalmadi in exchange for a CD containing some damaging information about the chairman of the Games organising committee, a senior CBI officer said.        
	The startling revelation came a day after agency sleuths searched the Congress MPs home in Delhi.         
	We have gone through the contents of the letter carefully. It seems the person was blackmailing him, the officer added.         
	The officer said the letter had details about the CD but refused to divulge anything more.        
	CBI sources said Kalmadi, who was questioned by the agency for eight hours at his house over Commonwealth Games corruption, had failed to give a satisfactory reply when confronted with the letter.         
	He didnt say much and thats why we need to probe it further, the officer added.         
	According to the officer, the letter had been sent to Kalmadi recently and did not bear the name of the sender.         
	Kalmadi must be knowing the source of the letter but he did not reveal anything. We are also verifying the authenticity of the letter, the officer said.         
	Yesterday, the agency had raided Kalmadis house and offices in the capital, Mumbai and Pune and seized several documents.         
	The personal computer of Kalmadi, which was seized, has been sent to a forensic laboratory to retrieve documents and emails sent by him to people connected with the Games, the officer added.         
	Kalmadi is under the scanner for alleged involvement in financial irregularities in the Queens baton relay in the UK, doctored emails from the Indian high commission, buying equipment well above the market price, signing marketing contracts with huge commissions and allowing the Games budget to balloon out of proportions.         
	DIG, CBI, Vineeta Thakur, said a London-based private firm was given the contract of installing video screens for the relay purportedly on the basis of fake quotations and without following the standard procedure.

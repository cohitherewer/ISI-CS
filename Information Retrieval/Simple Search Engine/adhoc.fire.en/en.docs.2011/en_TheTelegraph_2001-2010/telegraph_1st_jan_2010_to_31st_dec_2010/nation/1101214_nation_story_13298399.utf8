The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Media rights vs individual rights   Tata privacy plea in court
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Media rights vs individual rights     -  Tata privacy plea in court
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                      Ratan Tata at a convention in New Delhi in 2008                                
	New Delhi, Dec. 13: Tata group chairperson Ratan Tata today sought to make a case in the Supreme Court for placing limits on the media to balance the individuals right to privacy in the light of the recent leaks of the Niira Radia tapes.         
	At one point, Tatas counsel Harish N. Salve placed data before the top court to draw attention to the ownership patterns of various media houses, including Outlook, which have published the Radia tapes. He also cited the example of Reliance Capital, which holds stakes in several media houses, in this context.         
	A bench of Justices G.S. Singhvi and Asok Kumar Ganguly is hearing Tatas plea to stop leaks of information that is purely personal in the Radia tapes.        
	Tata had said in his petition that the government reserved the right to tap phones and use the information yielded for investigations. However, information that is purely personal in nature should not be leaked, he had said, seeking a court directive to the government to filter out such data.        
	The government, on its part, has denied any lapses leading to the leaks. It has also pleaded helplessness in preventing the media from not releasing any tapped conversations between lobbyist Radia and others.         
	Today, when arguments resumed in the case, Salve said that he would not press the court for any interim relief. I am not going to press for any interim relief for the simple reason  lets see how responsibly the media conducts itself, he said.         
	He said that there was need for the court to balance freedom of the media with an individuals right to privacy. Salve cited the case of a telephone conversation between two individuals about a third person.         
	One of them could be saying that he has such and such information because he wants to feel more important, he said. In another case, they could be making derogatory references about a third person.         
	If such tapes were to be leaked, the reputation of the person would be harmed. What relief does he have then? He then raised the issue of ownership of media houses to obliquely refer to corporate shadow-boxing that could have led to the tapes being leaked. Large industrial houses now have huge investments in media houses, he said.         
	The world over, business houses fund media houses, he said. Theres nothing wrong in it but that would have to be factored in by the court while protecting individual right to privacy, he said.        
	However, Outlook and Open, which had published part of the Radia tapes and got court notices seeking their views on the Tata petition, contested this argument.        
	Anil B. Divan for Outlook and Rajeev Dhavan for Open objected to Salves arguments raising ownership issues to curb media freedom.         
	Divan said no relief against the media had been sought in Tatas petition. He added that Tatas petition was a private litigation against the government and could not be used against private individuals to enforce his fundamental rights.         
	The taped conversations inter alia deal with matters of public interest, matters relating to good governance, possible corruption, secret and baleful influences on the centres of power and are absolutely essential for a meaningful debate by the Indian citizen, he said.         
	He added that Tata was a public figure and had entered into a public debate by writing an open letter on this. The counsel was referring to the letter Tata wrote in reply to industrialist and Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrasekhars charges levelled in a missive.        
	Dhavan, on the other hand, wondered whether Tatas petition was maintainable at all. The petition intends to protect a private interest, he said. Under the law, fundamental rights of individuals can only lie with the state and not be enforced against another individual, he said.         
	Dhavan rebutted the ownership issue, saying that the world over, except The Guardian, which was run by a trust (which Jawaharlal Nehru tried to emulate in the case of The National Herald), business houses fund the media. He also dared Tata to file a defamation case against them.        
	Dhavan has said Open still does not know which portions of the transcripts Tata was objecting to.        
	Three other petitions were filed in the case today one on behalf of the NGO, the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, to place the entire tapes, now with the Supreme Court, in the public domain.        
	Another was filed by a former BJP MP and owner of Jain TV, J.K. Jain, and the third by the Chennai Press Club which sought to interject itself in the petition to ostensibly protect freedom of the press. All these were allowed by the top court.         
	The court then permitted Tata to file his submissions by January and asked the other parties to respond to these submissions. The case will be heard on February 2.

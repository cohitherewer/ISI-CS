          THE NEW DECADE WILL OFFER NEW CHALLENGES AND NEW WAYS OF MEETING THEM, FORCING US TO CHANGE OUR HABITS AND EXPECTATIONS. WELL ALSO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW                                
	Degree delight  
	Jan 1, 2010: Banking executive Samir Banerjee and wife Sudeshna, a math professor, discuss the education of their children: Soumyo, 13, and Shreyashi, 3.  
	I want them to have the best education but I fear we may fail, he says over breakfast, referring to their limited salaries and the growing competition for seats at top institutions.                
	Sudeshna cites how the Indian education system is opening up unprecedented opportunities, but Samir is unconvinced.        
	December 2014: Sudeshna is right. Soumyo, 18, is studying for a joint degree in engineering offered by a leading US university and IIT Kharagpur, thanks to a law that lets foreign institutions set up campuses in India.        
	The fee he pays is almost on a par with IIT fees, and less than a tenth of what he would have paid had he chosen to study in the US. He is studying on a subsidised loan under a scheme where the government pays the interest for the courses duration.        
	Shreyashi, 8, is in Class III but, unlike when Soumyo was a schoolboy, the parents do not need to make annual donations to the school. Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, schools seeking donations can be punished.        
	This is how it all happened:        
	Mid-2010: Shreyashi turns 4 and the Banerjees begin preparing for her school admission, where not only the child but the parents need to undergo a rigorous interview. But midway through 2010, the government begins implementing the RTE Act, which bans any selection process  interviews or tests  for school admission.        
	I told you, things are changing, Sudeshna tells her husband.        
	2011: Soumyo enters Class X, facing a year that used to be a tense period of studies culminating in a public test: the dreaded board exam. But Soumyo doesnt have to appear in any board exam; its been made optional in all CBSE schools.        
	2012: Samirs bank places him in charge of a project that means transfer to a rural location. Samir suggests Sudeshna stay back with the children in Delhi, but Samir had had jaundice two months ago and Sudeshna is keen to travel with him.        
	Soumyo stays back in his school  it has a hostel  because a shift in Class XI is not easy. But the couple are worried about finding a good school for Shreyashi near the rural site.        
	They neednt have worried. A model school - one of 6,000 built across the country - in the district means Shreyashi can have schooling of Kendriya Vidyalaya standards.        
	Sudeshnas university refuses to allow her long leave to accompany Samir despite the rules allowing such leave. She approaches the National Educational Tribunal, which orders the university to grant her leave. The tribunal was set up under the Education Tribunals Act to create a special forum for dispute redress in higher education.        
	2013: Soumyo enters Class XII and the Banerjees start examining higher education options for the would-be engineer. Given the multitude of mushrooming engineering colleges, the couple are concerned about standards.        
	But they find that each institution has been rated under a new, mandatory accreditation system. Each institution has had to put on its website details of all its faculty and courses. Samir knows that any erroneous disclosure, or false claim or promise, can send the institution management to jail.        
	Educating his children has turned out easier than Samir had feared.  
	CHARU SUDAN KASTURI              
	Tune-less Bollywood        
	Songs and dances, the signature mark of Bollywood extravagance to foreign audiences and a staple to domestic viewers, could slowly be on their way out of Hindi films.        
	From the 72-song Indra Sabha (1932) to the 14-song Hum Aapke Hain Kaun...! (1994), music has always been an integral part of Hindi cinema but the Noughties saw the songs slowly creeping into the background. They were there but no longer on actors lips. It didnt help that the music wasnt generating the kind of money it did earlier in the decade.        
	Now, the sign of things to come is unmistakable. Songs will be used only as promotional material. They will be shot as music videos to be used for promotion and then not used in the movie at all.        
	For instance, you will not get to see Ranbir Kapoors endearing sardarji moves in the Pocket Mein Rocket number when you catch Rocket Singh at the theatres. It was just the small-screen sales pitch for the Salesman of the Year.        
	Karan Johar too has been trying to keep his songs only on the CD. The songs of Wake Up Sid, produced by KJo, have all been turned into full-length music videos, using footage from the film, but just stray stanzas have found their way into the movie. And if that wasnt enough, audiences were stunned to discover that Akshay-Katrinas sensuous rain song was not included in De Dana Dan. It was just a bait to bring everyone in.        
	In the new decade, as Bollywood goes more and more global and the average running time of a Hindi film shortens further, songs would keep getting transferred from the movie theatres to the music channels.        
	PRATIM D. GUPTA                  
	Bold fashion  
	Indians will accept things drastically new, says Delhi-based designer Gaurav Gupta. New colours and new silhouettes... new style. So, therell be a lot of diversity in fashion.  
	Watch out for a marriage of East and West that will be far from the Indo-Western style of yesteryear. So expect more than a kurta, kurti or even a lace bra top, says Gupta.        
	Calcutta-based designer Kallol Datta believes Indian fashion will go beyond being the worldwide destination for bandhni, zardosi and rani pink fabrics. People will recognise small movements in fashion. Indian fashion will definitely be more experimental, Kallol says.        
	He doesnt see Indian fashion going the ecological and ethical route, though. Its still too soon for that. So black will be black in India, at least for a bit.        
	Industry experts foresee a host of micro-trends, and a shift to total looks. And expect to see the comeback of Goth, hippie and also a generous dose of futuristic fashion.

	The fridge knows best  
	Advances in technology are hard to predict, but here are a few technologies that may emerge in the new decade to help you through your day, though some could cost the earth:        
	Smart fridge: A sensor keeps track of the contents  whether soda bottles or eggs. When something is about to run out, it signals an embedded messaging system that sends out an email or a text message to the owner via an in-built communication device.        
	The basic technology emerged from MIT research; some finer details need to be worked out. How do you get the sensor to recognise eggs or soda bottles? How do you make sure the message goes out at the right time?        
	Social robot: In Europe, a six-nation research consortium is trying to harness artificial intelligence to produce robots that can socialise  learn and understand space and objects and to deal with humans. These robots will be able to detect and recognise humans, approach and maintain an appropriate distance from people, and obey selected commands.        
	This Cognitive Robot project may lead to robots that serve as companions at home  taking over from humans for routine household chores.        
	lIntelligent sticky: Have difficulty remembering things and like to use sticky notes? Research scholar Pranav Mistry from MIT is developing just the thing for you.        
	You create a grocery list or a to-do list on a paper sticky note. The list is automatically synchronised with the task-lists in your mobile and computer, Mistry says on a website. Your mom prefers using physical media rather than mobile phones. She leaves a message for you when leaving for the market. You receive her message on the phone.        
	He explains that physical paper sticky notes are captured and stored in a computer through commercially available digital pen hardware which captures the movement of the pen on the surface of the paper to create digital text. A software program turns the hand-written notes into digital text using commercial handwriting-recognition algorithms. The digital text is processed by an artificial intelligence system that places the notes content in context (determining whether it is a reminder, a simple message, or an alert) and sends an alert via a text message.        
	Talking washing machine: Five years ago, a student research team at the Michigan State University linked a voice-prompter to a washing machines processor that enables the appliance to announce each of its functions  handy for someone with visual handicaps or those confused by multiple pushpads. Many technology analysts believe voice-prompted machines could soon spill into the consumer market.

	Painful bye to bai              
	By the end of the new decade, it may become almost impossible to get a domestic help, especially if you arent rich.        
	Wages have risen by 50 per cent in the past five years but the number of women signing up with us has fallen by about 15-20 per cent in the last three years, says Sharmeela Chatterjee of Care, a placement centre for nurses, ayahs and maids.        
	The women have more options now. There are jobs in production, in malls and big shops. Hospitals too are hiring housekeepers.        
	Mintu Saha of Astha speaks of a 50 per cent drop in maids numbers at her agency. Theres been a lot of government and private initiative to hire these women for production jobs they can do from their homes.        
	The first telltale signs of the trend came in the frequent         
	demands for pay hikes by maids and poaching by neighbours. I pay my maid Rs 1,800 a month for cleaning, washing, doing the dishes and odd jobs like chopping the vegetables for me to cook, says Paromita Ghosh, a public relations entrepreneur.        
	Absenteeism too is up. Ghosh says maids now demand a weekly day off but are often absent on other days too. Many specify they wont do the dishes.        
	Chatterjee believes the few maids available in the future will mostly register themselves with placement centres, and so will be expensive. They will realise that with a little grooming and an identity card theyll earn much more.        
	Ghosh accepts that its fair: Its time people appreciated the importance of housework.        
	Some are already preparing themselves for a maid-less future. Salt Lake resident Anu Mukherjee, 50, does all the chores herself.        
	I had a lot of difficulty with maids two years ago. Both my parents-in-law were ill but their ayah and my maid would conspire between them and ask for a raise together or play truant the same day. It has put me off maids.        
	POULOMI BANERJEE                          Richard Geres peck on Shilpa Shettys cheek in Delhi in 2007 spawned court cases. Such acts may not shock in the new decade      
	Etiquette              
	When Cherie Blair, wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, greeted Indu Shahani with a full-on kiss on the cheek at a recent high-society do in Mumbai, the widely travelled sheriff was surprised enough to instinctively draw away. Blair looked flummoxed. But the ladies, proficient in social etiquette, quickly made up for the faux pas.        
	Social etiquette trends are changing. Physical closeness while greeting strangers even in semi-formal events will become more acceptable, whether inter-gender or intra-gender, says corporate trainer Shashank Gupta, who runs Isra, a high-end etiquette training and finishing school in Mumbai. There will be more physicality during greetings in the years to come. The risk of swine flu has to pass first, though, he jokes.        
	With more Indians stepping into the global arena, knowledge and acceptance of other cultures is a must, says Myrah Rosario, who teaches etiquette to small and middle-level businessmen.        
	So, it may be acceptable for a first-time acquaintance to embrace or air-kiss you. Dont step back in shock, either, after a kiss on the cheek or a tight hug.        
	Lifestyle coach Chhaya Momayya, however, says that despite all the physical closeness while greeting, etiquette in the next decade would in other ways be one of back to classics.        
	The new-age brashness and informality has become a tad wearying. In the West, more people are avoiding addressing new acquaintances by their first names. Ditto for colleagues at workplaces. Next time you meet someone you hardly know, address them more formally, she says.        
	It applies to clothes too. Casual dressing at work will become pass. Pick up clothes not depending on your state of mind or fancy but on what the occasion or job calls for, she says.        
	The trick is to apply the retro values of etiquette to new-age situations. The Wharton School of Business has put out a protocol that many companies have begun to adopt  and it can provide a way out of the communication overload that was the last decades bane.        
	Follow a pecking order at work when it comes to responding to different forms of communication, says Maithili Madhok, an etiquette trainer.        
	Email should be answered within 24 hours and a phone call returned even sooner. Social networking sites take the lowest priority. It makes sense because a phone call or email seeks specific information from one individual. Social networks are a wide-open forum where communication is less targeted at one individual.        
	The new decade will also see more people come out of the closet with gay rights being recognised in law. Tips from experts:        
	If a friend or relation has come out, do not say: I knew that already        
	If the issue of their alternative lifestyle is brought up casually, react casually        
	Never disclose someones sexual orientation in public unless they have already revealed it;        
	Do not shy away from gay friends for fear of being labelled gay. Dont flaunt your heterosexuality every time you are seen with your gay friend or relation        
	Introduce one half of a gay couple who are out of the closet as a partner        
	In many countries, establishments and addresses display rainbow flags, a symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) pride. This means such places are for gays or are gay-owned. Know the symbols. The six-colour version of the pride flag is the most commonly used one.         
	SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish pits food against rivals caste
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitish pits food against rivals caste
  - MAIDEN BIHAR DIVAS CELEBRATIONS IN PATNA          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chief minister Nitish Kumar (second from left) and his cabinet colleagues inaugurate Bihar Divas celebrations in Patna on Monday. Picture by Deepak Kumar                                        
	Patna, March 22: Chief minister Nitish Kumar dwelt on the unifying force of food to counter his political rivals focus on caste equations in an election year.        
	We should talk about the states food, keeping aside talk on the caste we were born in because food is a unifying factor, he said, inaugurating the maiden three-day Bihar Divas celebrations.        
	Nitish added that delicious litti-chokha and dahi-chuda (curd and beaten rice) had managed to transcend the states borders with people of other states enjoying these Bihar delicacies.         
	With his food-for-unity speech, Nitish waged a subtle war against his opponents and also sent out a message to states where Bihar students and migrant workers had been assaulted.        
	Nitish, who does not belong to a numerically dominant caste, knows well that dabbling in caste politics may not prove to be as beneficial for him as it would to Lalu Prasad, his principal opponent, who represents the single largest caste in the state.         
	You must develop a sense of Biharipan (feeling for belonging to Bihar) over your caste identity, Nitish said, making calculated efforts to generate a sense of sub-nationalism among people.        
	But he also made it clear that the sub-nationalism should not turn into the kind of chauvinism glorified by Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. Be a Bihari to become a better Hindustani. If Bihar stays backward, India will not prosper, he said.        
	Bihar came into existence on March 12, 1912. But it is for the first time that the Nitish government has begun celebrating statehood day, no doubt with an eye on the polls.

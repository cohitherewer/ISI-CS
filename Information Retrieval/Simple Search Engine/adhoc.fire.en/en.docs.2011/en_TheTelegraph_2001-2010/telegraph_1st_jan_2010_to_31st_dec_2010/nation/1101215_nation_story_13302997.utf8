	New Delhi, Dec. 14: Professor Seyed E. Hasnain is tipped to become the vice-chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University.        
	Hasnain, whose tenure as vice-chancellor of Hyderabad University ends this month, is said to be the forerunner among three candidates shortlisted for the post. The names of the other two candidates were not available.        
	A three-member selection committee, headed by former Isro chief K. Kasturirangan, had recommended the names to the human resource ministry. The others on the panel were economist Nithin Desai and Indian Institute of Science Bangalore director P. Balaram.        
	The list will now be forwarded for approval to the President. A source said many rounds of talks were held before the list was finalised.        
	Professor B.B. Bhattacharya, whose term as vice-chancellor has ended, is continuing in office till the new appointment is made.        
	Several JNU faculty members had been in the fray for the post, including Jayati Ghosh from the Centre for Economics Studies and Planning, Zoya Hassan from the political science department and Rajendra Prasad from the School of Life Sciences.        
	A renowned scientist, Hasnain was appointed as the first director of the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics in Hyderabad. He has nearly 200 publications in peer-reviewed journals and is a member of all scientific organisations in the country.

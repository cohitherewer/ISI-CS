          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: Lack of sufficient sleep may interfere with efforts to lose weight. A study by US researchers released today suggests that people trying to lose weight through diets should also get the right amount of sleep.         
	The study provides new experimental data to show that insufficient sleep can reduce the effects of diets and increase hunger. The findings appear in todays issue of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.         
	If your goal is to lose fat, skipping sleep is like poking sticks in your bicycle wheels, Plamen Penev, a researcher at the University of Chicago and study director, said in a statement released through the university.         
	The study observed 10 volunteers on a standard calorie-restricted diet and found that when people slept for about 5.5 hours instead of 8.5 hours, the fat loss was reduced by 55 per cent. Insufficient sleep was associated with an increased loss of lean muscle mass, instead of loss of fat, which is the main goal of weight-loss initiatives.         
	The findings are in line with a previous study by Penev and his colleagues two years ago which showed that cutting on sleep appears to make people consume more food through extra snacks  not regular meals.         
	The new experiments also showed a similar pattern of increased hunger, evident through differences in a hunger-stimulating hormone called ghrelin that reduces energy expenditure and increases food consumption.         
	Participants who slept for 8.5 hours had no change in their ghrelin levels, but those who slept for 5.5 hours, displayed an increase in ghrelin from 73 nanograms per litre to 84 nanograms per litre.         
	Researchers not associated with the study said it provided insights through a laboratory study into how sleep deprivation was linked to efforts to maintain healthy weight, but cautioned that the findings needed to be verified.         
	A major problem with sleep laboratory studies is their applicability in real life, where multiple other factors influence a persons ability to maintain a diet, Shahrad Taheri from the University of Birmingham in the UK and Emmanuel Mignot from the Stanford Sleep Medicine Centre in the US wrote in a commentary in the same issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.         
	Shahrad and Mignot have pointed out that there may also be other mechanisms to explain the link between insufficient sleep and energy expenditure by the body.         
	Sleep deprivation, they wrote in their commentary, may lead to increased fatigue during the daytime which may in turn make people turn away from physical activity, and thus contribute to weight gain.

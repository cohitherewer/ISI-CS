          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 17: Bengal law minister Rabilal Moitra today said the state government was pleased with the Supreme Court judgment giving courts the right to order CBI probe into an offence without the consent of a state with the rider that the power be used sparingly, cautiously and in exceptional circumstances.        
	Moitra said the judgment would restrain high courts from ordering CBI inquiry in all and sundry cases and restrict them to the deserving ones.        
	Over the years, we have seen high courts issuing directives for CBI inquiry whenever such petitions are submitted to them. Todays ruling means that the high courts would think several times before ordering a CBI probe, the minister said.         
	In a way, the ruling is good and we welcome it. At least, the ruling will restrain the high courts. Since the Supreme Court directive asks the high courts to issue such orders under exceptional circumstances or where the incident has national and international ramifications, stray incidents will not come under consideration. In that event, a small incident of firing at a particular place or an unnatural death may not prompt the high court to pass an order for a CBI probe, Moitra said at Writers Buildings today.        
	He added that the apex court ruling was a result of the case the state government had filed after Calcutta High Court had ordered a CBI inquiry into the Chhoto Angaria massacre in 2001 where 11 Trinamul Congress workers had been killed.         
	We had moved the apex court against the order of a CBI probe into the Chhoto Angaria incident. We had contended that Calcutta High Court had passed the order without taking the consent of the state government. Since a five-member Supreme Court bench has passed the ruling today, we will accept it, Moitra said.         
	After todays verdict, the CBI will resume its detailed probe into the March 14, 2007, police firing in Nandigram that killed 14 people.        
	The investigating agency had assured the Supreme Court it would not continue its probe into the Nandigram firing till the petitions moved by the Bengal government and a few other states were disposed off by the apex court.

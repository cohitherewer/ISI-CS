  - veena enters salman event          PRIYANKA ROY                          Veena Malik at the Bigg Boss 4 show                                        
	Oct. 3: Mohammed Asif better watch Bigg Boss 4. For, Veena Malik is ready to hurl bouncers at him from an Indian pitch, with Salman Khan as the match referee.        
	Within a week of the fixing-tainted Pakistani pacer marrying childhood friend Sana Hilal, ex-girlfriend Veena entered the Bigg Boss 4 house today as one of the 14 contestants on the Colors reality show.        
	Just before entering the house, the Pakistani actress told The Telegraph: Even a few days before his wedding, he (Asif) was begging me to go back to him. I was shocked by his behaviour. I cant believe the levels to which that man has fallen.        
	Veena had recently made headlines by claiming that Asif and his team-mates Salman Butt and Mohammed Aamer were involved in spot-fixing in the series against England.        
	That was her passport to the Bigg Boss house in Lonavla. Veena has recently been in the news over the match-fixing scandal and we thought she would be a perfect fit, said a Colors official.        
	I will only go to India when I get an extraordinary role, Veena had told this newspaper last month. Enter, the 96-day (if she goes the distance) Bigg Boss role.        
	How did it all happen?        
	I have been hiding ever since the controversy happened. I even changed my phone numbers after I got a death threat on email (which she claims read: Keep your mouth shut. Ill kill you, watch what I do). However, Colors found me and gave me the Bigg Boss offer on September 10. Initially, I wasnt too sure. But I spoke to my family and friends and decided to take it up because I felt that I needed some time away from Pakistan to settle my emotions and get a grip on my life again.        
	What if she, as key witness, is required to depose in the match-fixing case during these 96 days?        
	I have taken all the permissions required to be on Bigg Boss. If I am needed, Pakistani police, the FBI and Scotland Yard know where to reach me. For me, loyalty to my country and to cricket always comes first.        
	On Sunday night, Veena sizzled and shimmied on stage to the popular Chham chaam karta hai yeh nasheela badan, before walking into the Bigg Boss house. Introduced by host Salman Khan as jinhone cricket ke takhto-taaj ka paasa palat diya ( turned around the world of cricket), Veena, looking hot in pink harem pants and silver bustier, said that she was on Bigg Boss to test herself. This is the best platform to judge how patient and tolerant one can be under adverse circumstances. And yes, she even flirted with the Dabangg star (calling him handsome and dashing).         
	The actress, reportedly paid a huge sum to be on Bigg Boss, also wants to put a stop to a hate campaign allegedly started against her by Bollywood starlet Neetu Chandra. Veena had claimed that Chandra too was involved in match-fixing and was in regular touch with Asif.        
	I dont even know that woman; I dont know what she looks like. I saw her number flash on Asifs cellphone many times; thats what I told the investigators. Now she has started an anti-Veena Malik campaign in India. She is trying to malign my character and I will not tolerate it.        
	Neetu, seen in films like Traffic Signal and Garam Masala, was approached for Bigg Boss but declined.        
	Veena hasnt watched previous editions of the show but has watched clips of it on YouTube. We dont get the show in Pakistan. I am vaguely aware of the format, but will just have to find out first hand. On Bigg Boss, the people of India will know who the real Veena Malik is.

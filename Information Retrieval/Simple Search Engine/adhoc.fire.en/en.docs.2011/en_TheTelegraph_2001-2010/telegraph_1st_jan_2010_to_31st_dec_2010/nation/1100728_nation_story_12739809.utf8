The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poll panel gets new boss
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Poll panel gets new boss
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          SY Quraishi                                  
	New Delhi, July 27: Bengals Left rulers can breathe a little easier.        
	Election Commissioner S.Y. Quraishi, who has ruled out early elections in the state, will take over as the next chief of the poll panel when the incumbent, Navin Chawla, retires on Thursday.         
	However, individual opinions dont count and any decision taken by the three-member panel is a collective one.        
	The other member of the commission is V.S. Sampath. The government will have to appoint another commissioner to fill up the vacancy.        
	Quraishi, 63, the senior of the two election commissioners after the 1945-born Chawla, will have a little less than two years at the helm. He is expected to oversee a host of Assembly elections, including the Bengal elections.         
	Polls are due in Bengal in the middle of next year, but Quraishi has already indicated that the commission will come into the picture only six months before the scheduled date, virtually ruling out early elections in the state.        
	Technically, the state cabinet is expected to dissolve the House and recommend elections to the governor. But the commission takes the ultimate call in deciding the dates as it has to take into account several factors such as school exams, the monsoon and deployment of paramilitary forces.        
	This leaves the commission, especially the chief election commissioner, with a significant amount of operational discretion.         
	Among the other states that go to the polls during Quraishis tenure are Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam.         
	The law ministry today issued a formal notification on Quraishis elevation. the President is pleased to appoint Shahabuddin Yakub Quraishi as the CEC with effect from July 30, 2010, the notification said.

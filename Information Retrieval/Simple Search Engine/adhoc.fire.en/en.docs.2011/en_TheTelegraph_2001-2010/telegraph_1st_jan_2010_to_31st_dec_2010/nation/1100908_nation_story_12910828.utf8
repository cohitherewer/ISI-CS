The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | No slipper missiles, please
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      No slipper missiles, please
                                              
	What are Rahul Gandhis guards scared of?         
	Flying slippers, police would say, because they can easily become missiles and land on the Gandhi scion.         
	On Tuesday, 10 chappal-wearing students who wanted to attend the Congress MPs youth meeting in Akola, Maharashtra, were stopped at the gate of Punjabrao Krushi Vidyapeeth. Only male students wearing shoes were allowed inside. Jewellery, pens, belts, watches, notebooks, folders  perhaps all having the potential to turn into whizzing missiles  had to be left behind if the students wanted to enter the meeting venue.         
	(PTI pictures show Rahul Gandhi and a student speaking at the meeting.)         
	Later, college authorities let the 10 students enter after they came to know why they had been stopped.        
	On Independence Day, a Jammu and Kashmir policeman threw his footwear at chief minister Omar Abdullah and missed.         
	Last year, a journalist aimed his shoe at Union home minister P. Chidambaram, angry about the governments inaction against the 1984 anti-Sikh rioters.        
	The shoe-missile protest trend was started by Muntazer al-Zaidi, an Iraqi journalist, who threw his boot at George W. Bush in 2008.        
	At the meeting on Tuesday, Rahul asked the youths to join politics in bigger numbers. If you are interested in politics you can join. We need a younger generation to lead people, he said.        
	It is wrong (to say) that if you dont have faith in politicians, you will not enter politics. If you have faith in yourself, you can step forward, Rahul said. If Indians talk about a youth icon, they look at me. Youth younger than me should enter the political arena.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tables fly in Bihar House
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tables fly in Bihar House
          DIPAK MISHRA                              
	Patna, July 20: The ruckus in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly over a decade ago seemed replicated in the Bihar House today with the ruling and Opposition MLAs coming to blows and hurling chairs and tables at each other.        
	Around a dozen MLAs, both from the ruling Janata Dal (United)-BJP combine and the RJD-led Opposition, suffered minor injuries in the free-for-all. At least one minister, Giriraj Singh, was seen joining the brawl.        
	Speaker Udai Narayan Choudhary adjourned the House after his repeated pleas for order fell on deaf ears. The Assemblys current monsoon session is likely to be its last sitting ahead of the state polls later this year.        
	The trouble began when the Opposition members began chanting khazana chor gaddi chhor (coffer thief, give up power).         
	The barbs were directed at chief minister Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi over a Patna High Court order last week for a CBI probe into irregular withdrawals of over Rs 11,000 crore from the treasury between 2002-03 and 2007-08.         
	The government yesterday filed a plea for a revision of the judgment.        
	The House had to be adjourned twice during the pre-lunch session because of the commotion. But when the House proceedings resumed after lunch, the verbal duels earlier in the day turned into physical jousts.         
	Opposition members stormed the well of the House and overturned a large table. This infuriated members of the ruling combine. What followed was a tug-of-war, with the two sides having a go at each other over the table.        
	Ruling party MLAs managed to throw the table towards Opposition benches where senior RJD members were sitting. This invited an instant retaliation: chairs were flung from the other side, along with abuses.        
	Nitish and his deputy looked helpless, watching the scenes unfold from their seats. Senior Opposition leaders appealed for restraint, but could do little to control their flock. Later, the Opposition MLAs sat on a dharna.         
	Ram Chandra Purbey, the RJDs chief whip, blamed Nitish and his deputy. The violence was pre-planned and orchestrated by the chief minister. This is the first time such an incident has happened in the Bihar Assembly and we will continue to press for our demand for the resignation of the CM and deputy CM.

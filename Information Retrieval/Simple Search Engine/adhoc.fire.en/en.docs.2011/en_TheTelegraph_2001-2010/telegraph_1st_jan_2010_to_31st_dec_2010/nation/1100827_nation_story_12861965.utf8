	New Delhi, Aug. 26 (PTI): Eighteen incidents of radar failure have been reported in domestic airports in July and August, including one at the newly built airport in Delhi earlier this month, although there was no threat to air traffic, Parliament was informed today.        
	On 3rd August, 2010, one of the two radars installed at IGI airport was unserviceable for about 4 hours due to cut in the optical fibre cable link, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. However, operations were not affected since the second radar was working, he added.        
	Ahmedabad airport saw most such cases  five  in the two months, while Mumbai airport witnessed three.         
	There was no flight disruption due to failure of radar at other airports, Patel added.        
	Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram, Guwahati and Behrampur reported two such incidents each, Patel said, adding the Varanasi airport had one radar failure in July-August this year.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Antony answers Jaswant concern
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jaswant Singh (left), AK Antony                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: Defence minister A.K. Antony today said a CBI probe into the Adarsh housing scam has been ordered on the recommendation of the services after BJP leader Jaswant Singh questioned if it was proper for senior army commanders to be interrogated by a police outfit.        
	Antony rejected Jaswants concern that a CBI probe will hurt the morale of the armed forces and said a new head of the defence estates outfit has been given the task of cleaning it up after internal inquiries revealed that its officers were involved in dubious deals.        
	The army chief, General V.K. Singh, had himself recommended the investigation after having expressed his anguish on the involvement of senior commanders, one of whom is his predecessor, General (retired) Deepak Kapoor.        
	Earlier today, BJP leader Jaswant had said: Personally, I am totally and absolutely opposed to senior officers of the rank of chief of staff being investigated by the CBI.         
	He recalled his own service in the army and said he was aware of procedures within the armed forces through which such investigation can be conducted and action taken.        
	I take objection to the defence minister deciding that army officers of very high rank be investigated by the CBI. It is detrimental to the morale of the services, you are really blunting your own sword, Jaswant said.        
	Antony said the new director general of defence estates, Ashok Harnal, has been asked to clean up the organisation.        
	Earlier this year, the controller general of defence accounts had said there were major irregularities in the directorate general of defence estates that is the custodian of all defence land.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, March 10: Four Class XII students were arrested, sent to a juvenile home and made to sit for their board exams from the detention centre, all for smearing a poster of chief minister Mayavati with colours on Holi.         
	The students, from the prestigious Sainik School and in the age group of 15-16, walked free at 5pm today after an embarrassed Mayavati ordered their release following an outcry against the police, who, eager to please the chief minister, had rounded up the teenagers.        
	The students, all of whom have good track records, are taking this years Class XII board examinations which began on March 6.         
	Mayavati chided the police for the harsh action. The students may have done something on an impulse. But the police should have handled the situation with sensitivity. They should have set them free after a mild reprimand, she told reporters.        
	The students travails began on the night of February 28 when they had allegedly sprayed colour on a poster of Mayavati in the Asiana area on the outskirts of the city. A police complaint filed later accused them of tearing off a portion of that poster.        
	On March 1, officials from Asiana police station rounded up the four boys and charged them with destruction of public property.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 10: For couples locked in loveless marriages, getting a divorce might have just got easier.        
	The Union cabinet today approved a bill that provides for irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a ground on which a couple  married under the Hindu Marriage Act or the Special Marriage Act  could seek divorce.         
	The amendment takes into account a situation in which one spouse refuses to live with the other and is against any attempt at reconciliation.        
	Till now, a couple could, under either act, seek divorce on limited grounds like adultery, cruelty, desertion, conversion to another religion, unsoundness of mind, leprosy and venereal disease  grounds that fall under the traditional fault theory in a marriage.        
	Under existing laws, a couple can also seek divorce by mutual consent but have to file a joint petition for dissolution of the marriage.        
	If the petition is not withdrawn before six months and not later than 18 months, then a court can grant a decree of divorce by mutual consent. But several such cases have dragged on as one party abstained from court.        
	This causes considerable hardship to the party in dire need of a divorce, a government release said, justifying the step to introduce a bill to include the breakdown theory as a ground for divorce.         
	The release said the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2010, would protect a spouse, who wants to get out of a marriage, from harassment in court if the other party wilfully avoids court to frustrate proceedings and drag the case.        
	The amendment makes it possible for anyone to seek divorce by proving that there has been irretrievable breakdown of marriage and escape the delays and harassment caused because of one party not turning up in courts, the release added.        
	The bill  which would amend the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and the Special Marriage Act, 1954  will now be tabled in Parliament and has to be passed by both Houses to become a law.         
	The decision to introduce the amendment came at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Sources said the changes proposed in the bill recognised the worldwide shift from the traditional fault theory in a marriage to the more modern divorce by mutual consent theory.        
	Although Indian courts have recognised irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a ground on which a spouse can seek divorce, a controversy recently arose after a Supreme Court bench refused to permit a man to divorce his wife against her wishes on this ground.        
	Critics of the irretrievable breakdown theory, first introduced in New Zealand, say it allows parties to dissolve a marriage easily.         
	In India, womens groups have opposed its inclusion on the ground that it would allow men to walk out of marriages.         
	However, the Law Commission, in its 217th report, had suggested including this provision as a ground for divorce in keeping with the worldwide trend of dissolving marriages that are not working.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Sept. 21: Measures are being put in place at centres that will hold the Common Admission Test 2010 to make sure the glitches of last year are not repeated.         
	Prometric, the US-based testing service provider that is conducting the CAT, has decided to quarantine the test centres, distribute licensed software and run a thorough check of the system.         
	Our investigation reports show that virus attacks were the main reason for the glitches that happened last year. We are doing everything possible to rule out a repeat, said Soumitra Roy, managing director, Prometric India.         
	Admission to all the nine Indian Institutes of Management and several reputed B-schools is based on students performance in CAT. Last year was the first time students took the exam online. Glitches prevented around 7,000 candidates from writing the test in the scheduled 10-day period, and they had to take it later. Many more complained of slow downloading of questions, freezing of the test mid-way and other problems.         
	According to Roy, one of the reasons for the glitches was use of pirated and dated anti-virus software.         
	We dont know who was responsible for the problem but it did not come to the fore during the preparations last year. It was one of the major causes for the glitches, he said.         
	To prevent a rerun, all the 247 testing labs in 78 centres across 33 cities will be sealed off from all external interface 25 days before the test window begins on October 27 and ends on November 24. This year, the test period has been doubled from 10 to 20 days.         
	Each computer will be formatted, networks will be isolated from the rest of the test centre and licensed software will be installed at every centre, Roy said.         
	We are only selecting those sites with good physical and technical infrastructure, he said, adding that trained and certified professionals would be on duty at the centres.         
	Prometric has also introduced a real-time 15-minute practice test for the candidates that will be available on the CAT website www.catiim.in within the first week of October. The practice test will give the students a feel of the online exam.

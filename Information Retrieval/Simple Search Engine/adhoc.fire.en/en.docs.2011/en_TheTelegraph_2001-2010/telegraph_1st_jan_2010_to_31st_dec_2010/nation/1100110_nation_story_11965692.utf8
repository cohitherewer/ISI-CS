	New Delhi, Jan. 9: A new type of oral polio vaccine will be introduced in the country tomorrow as part of the campaign to eradicate polio, which has stubbornly resisted more than a decade of mass immunisation efforts based on orally administered vaccines.         
	The bivalent vaccine is intended to immunise children against two types of wild polio viruses -- P1 and P3 -- that have persisted in India. A third type of the wild polio virus P2 was eliminated from India in 1999.

	Mangalore, May 24: After searching the valley strewn with the wreck of IX 812, the investigators went uphill this morning but failed to find the flight data recorder, crucial to unravelling the mystery of the crash.        
	The probe team used climbing ropes to reach and scan the shrubby, 80ft pathway created by the Boeing 737-800 during its slide down the tabletops slope before it dropped a farther 220ft into the wooded valley.        
	For over two hours, the officials from the directorate-general of civil aviation (DGCA) and Air India looked for the bright-orange exterior of the flight data recorder (FDR) or black box amid the shrubs and trees.        
	(Finding) it was unlikely since the tail portion (where the FDR is placed) was intact during the descent and disintegrated only after the plane crashed onto the valley, a team member said.        
	After a short break, the searchers went down to the valley again. Hoping the FDR might be lying under the white tail section, they turned it over using a bulldozer and searched again.        
	The FDR is a key component in any air crash investigation. The modern ones are programmed to record 88 parameters including altitude, airspeed, landing speed, vertical acceleration, aircraft pitch, column position, rudder-pedal position, control wheel position, fuel flow and horizontal stabiliser, said Air Indias air safety officer, Bharat Kumar, a search team member.        
	If the aircraft had behaved abnormally before the crash, that could be found by analysing the FDR recordings.        
	Although the FDR has a beacon (radio transmitter) that beeps out a signal saying I am here, come and find me, this transmitter gets damaged in most crashes since it is placed on the outer, unprotected portion of the box to allow its signals maximum reach.        
	The FDRs memory stack, which records the crucial data, is the best protected, a three-layer encasement shielding it from impact, fire, water and even piercing metal.        
	Once the FDR is found, investigators take the memory stack to a lab where they can download the data from the recorders and try to recreate the accident. This can take weeks, a DGCA team member said.        
	Asked what would happen if the FDR was never found, Kumar said the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) would then have to be relied on. The CVR has been taken to the DGCA lab in Delhi, and its recordings of conversations within the cockpit and with air traffic control should be available for analysis in a few days.        
	The woody and muddy terrain and the wide spread of the debris are not helping the search, but the team hopes its luck would turn tomorrow.        
	Later in the day, a four-member team from Kenyon, an international emergency services company, probed around the muddy shambles of the valley again but with no result.

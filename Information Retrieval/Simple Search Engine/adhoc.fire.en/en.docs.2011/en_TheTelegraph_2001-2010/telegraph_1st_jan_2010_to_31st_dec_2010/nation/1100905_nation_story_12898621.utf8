          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Kapil Sibal                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 4: Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal earned a pat on his back from the Prime Minister today, days after a senior Congress leader had opposed a key education reforms bill in Parliament.        
	I compliment and pay tribute to my colleague Shri Kapil Sibal for the zeal, dedication and enthusiasm that he has brought to bear on the work of this most important ministry of the Union government, that the human resource development ministry is, Manmohan Singh said at an event on the eve of Teachers Day.        
	Sibal was unhappy after senior Congress colleague K. Keshava Rao joined Opposition leaders in opposing the Educational Tribunal Bill in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. Rao said in the House that Sibals bureaucratic machinery was struggling to keep up with his fast thinking.        
	The bill was deferred to the next session. The HRD minister later met Singh. The enactment of the bill would have expedited the passing of other reforms bills, such as the Foreign Educational Institutions (Regulation and Entry and Operations) Bill, Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical, Medical Educational Institutions and Universities Bill, and the National Accreditation Authority Bill.         
	The ministry is in the process of preparing a bill to create an overarching body for higher education and another to set up 14 innovation universities.        
	Singh said the education system was passing through a critical juncture and emphasised on maintaining a balance between tradition and continuity as well as innovation.        
	As teachers, you are the most important nation builders, you constitute our nations most precious national resource, and we look to you to guide our children in their quest for knowledge, truth and in their capacity to lead a life of dignity and self-respect, Singh said. He said his own years as a teacher have been the most satisfying and fulfilling in my life.

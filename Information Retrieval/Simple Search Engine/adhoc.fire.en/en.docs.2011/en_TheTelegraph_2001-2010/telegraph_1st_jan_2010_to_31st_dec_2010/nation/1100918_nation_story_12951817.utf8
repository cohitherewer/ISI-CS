	New Delhi, Sept. 17: Indian scientists have received a go-ahead to build Indias first prototype instrument to establish local experimental expertise to detect gravitational waves predicted by Albert Einstein, but not directly observed yet.         
	The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, has approved a plan to develop a tabletop instrument that will help physicists acquire skills to measure extremely tiny changes in lengths  a key step towards spotting gravitational waves, often described as feeble ripples in space and time.         
	Astronomers have observed the indirect effects of gravitational waves in the dance of binary neutron stars, and physicists in North America and Europe have spent the past decade building giant instruments to directly detect these waves.         
	The weak signatures of these waves have turned this search into an engineering challenge.         
	Einsteins general relativity theory of 1916 predicted that the acceleration of objects would lead to gravitational waves that would produce tiny distortions in space and time. But the waves are so weak that only the acceleration of highly massive objects such as stars will yield distortion signatures detectable with existing technology.         
	The instrument at the TIFR will help us master technologies needed to look for gravitational waves, said Bala Iyer, a theoretical physicist at the Raman Research Institute, Bangalore, and chair of the Indian Initiative for Gravitational Wave Observations, an academic consortium.         
	The instrument  an optical interferometer  will use a combination of lasers and mirrors for multiple reflections of laser beams that will allow physicists to detect tiny changes in the distances travelled by the laser beams.         
	The objective, a consortium physicist said, is to develop an instrument sensitive enough to detect changes in the length of the order of a billionth of a billionth of a metre.         
	This effort is also intended to help develop a cadre of scientists who have the expertise to work on gravitational wave experiments, said Mustansir Barma, TIFR director.         
	Whether we scale up this effort and build our own gravitational wave detector, or our scientists work with international teams, will be a future decision, Barma told The Telegraph .         
	Physicist C.S. Unnikrishnan at the TIFR is the principal investigator for the prototype instrument. But the consortium has collaborators from the Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research in Calcutta and Thiruvananthapuram, the Chennai Mathematical Institute, Delhi University, and the Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore.         
	Gravitational waves, when they are eventually detected, will open a new window to observe the universe, said Iyer. A variety of cosmological objects that are difficult to observe through electromagnetic radiation  light, radio, or X-rays  may be examined through their gravitational wave patterns, he said.

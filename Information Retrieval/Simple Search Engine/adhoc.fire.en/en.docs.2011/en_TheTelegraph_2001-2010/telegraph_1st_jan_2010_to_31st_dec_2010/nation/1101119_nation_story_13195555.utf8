          OUR BUREAU                       Pamela Anderson                          
	Mumbai, Nov. 18: Pamela Anderson will keep her date with prime time as a court has permitted the channel beaming Bigg Boss 4 to telecast the show at 9pm till Sunday.        
	Bombay High Court today stayed yesterdays information and broadcasting ministry directive to reschedule its telecast to a late-night slot.        
	If the Centre does not challenge the court order before Monday, Bigg Boss 4 can be telecast at 9pm. By then, the role played by Pamela, said to have been brought on board for three days for around Rs 2.5 crore, would be over. She is expected to be on the show till Friday night.        
	A division bench of Justices D.K. Deshmukh and N.D. Deshpande granted the injunction after Viacom 18, which owns the Colors channel, challenged the directive, apparently based on complaints from viewers objecting to its content. The channel has been asked to telecast the reality show anytime between 11pm and 5am.        
	Viacom 18 said there was nothing objectionable in the show, and the ministrys order did not specify which episode or part of the episode offends decency and good taste.        
	We received the directive late last night, and we argued that the directive is in complete violation of principles of natural justice. The court has granted us temporary relief till Monday, Amit Nayak, counsel for Colors, said.        
	The bench observed that the ministry should have issued a showcause before ordering the rescheduling.        
	Imagine TV, which telecasts Rakhi ka Insaaf, has also been asked to shift the telecast from prime time to late night following complaints of vulgarity.        
	Sujeet Jain, vice-president (business and legal affairs), Colors, as well as the producer of Imagine TVs Rakhi ka Insaaf met officials of the information and broadcasting ministry in New Delhi today.        
	 The ministry officials said Jain explained that Colors telecast the show at 9m yesterday as it did not receive the order because of the Id holiday.         
	Imagine received the order. Colors did not. Surprising, in this age of electronic communication when we had faxed and emailed the order, said an official.        
	If the court vacates the stay, the ministry can consider punitive action against Colors for non-compliance, an official said. The penalty could be an order to run an apology scroll.

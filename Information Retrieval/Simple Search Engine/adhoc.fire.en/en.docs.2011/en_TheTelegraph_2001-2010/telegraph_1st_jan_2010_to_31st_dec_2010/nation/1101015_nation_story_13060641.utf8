          OUR BUREAU                          Yeddyurappa after winning the trust vote in Bangalore on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Oct. 14: Karnatakas BJP government today won its second trial of strength in three days but its fate still hangs on the pending high court decision on the disqualification of 16 MLAs.        
	The thin victory margin of six votes  106 for the government and 100 against  was no cause for comfort, a BJP source in Delhi admitted.        
	If Karnataka High Court, which will resume hearings on Monday, finds the disqualifications illegal, chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa may have to face a third floor test.        
	But if the court upholds the disqualifications of the 11 BJP and five Independent MLAs, who had dumped the government side, Yeddyurappa will be safe for at least another six months, the minimum cooling-off period before another no-confidence motion can be moved.        
	The court had yesterday made it clear that the outcome of todays floor test will be subject to its ruling on the petitions.        
	This is only the semi-final, claimed the leader of the Opposition, Congress leader Siddaramaiah.        
	One MLA from each side abstained today ignoring their party whips, implying that the political flux was not over. The BJP had hoped the 16 disqualifications might deter others from rebelling but that didnt quite happen.        
	The BJP has already show-caused abstainer Manappa Vaijal who, reports from Bangalore said, had crossed over to the Janata Dal (Secular).        
	Sources said that the other abstainer, Dal (Secular) legislator M.C. Ashwath, might go over to the BJP. Both can come under the axe of the anti-defection law for their abstention if their parties complain to the Speaker.        
	Yeddyurappa claimed to have created history by becoming the first chief minister to win two back-to-back trust votes and hinted at an imminent cabinet shuffle.        
	In contrast to the bedlam that marred Mondays trust vote proceedings, the Assembly appeared orderly today. Siddaramaiah asked if it was fair to hold the vote before the court had ruled on the disqualifications, but Speaker K.G. Bopaiah rejected his stand.        
	Governor H.R. Bharadwaj had anyway said the chief minister must prove his majority by today. After his victory, Yeddyurappa went through the protocol of calling on Bharadwaj even as his party campaigned for the governors recall.

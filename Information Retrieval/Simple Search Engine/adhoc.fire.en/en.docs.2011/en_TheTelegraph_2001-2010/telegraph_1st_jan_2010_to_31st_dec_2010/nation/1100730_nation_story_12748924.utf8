          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 29: The government has decided to allow use of mobile phones on aircraft that have landed and are taxiing towards the parking bay.        
	The relaxation will be in place after a new rule, aimed at easing the present system, is adopted by the government.        
	Current directives say mobile phones should be switched on only when the planes doors are opened but airline officials said most passengers ignored the rule and switched on their cellphones soon after the plane lands or while its taxiing towards the parking bay.         
	The director-general of civil aviation has posted the new draft rules on its website, asking for comments and suggestions till August 20.         
	However, the pilot can ask passengers to switch off their phones when the plane is taxiing in difficult weather.         
	Mobile phones and electronic devices are requested to be switched off during flights as their electronic fields could interfere with the planes communication system.         
	Some mobile phone systems such as GSM used to cause an irritating buzz, which did disrupt communications from the pilot to ground, explained A.K. Ghosh, an airline communications expert.

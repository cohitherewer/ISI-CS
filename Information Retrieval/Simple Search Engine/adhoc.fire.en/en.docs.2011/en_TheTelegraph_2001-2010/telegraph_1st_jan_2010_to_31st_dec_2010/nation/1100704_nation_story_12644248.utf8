	New Delhi, July 3: Niranjan Hojai, a self-styled commander-in-chief of the Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel), was apprehended from Nepal last night.         
	He was handed over today to the National Investigating Agency which produced him in the Motihari sessions court in Bihar and got a four-day transit remand.         
	The outfit, which wants an independent homeland for the Dimasa tribe, had unleashed terror in North Cachar Hills district of Assam in 2007-2008, killing hundreds and attacking passenger trains. Jewel Gorlosa, its chief who has been arrested, and Hojai, his deputy, are said to have masterminded several killings.

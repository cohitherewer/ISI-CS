          SANJAY K. JHA                            Sangma (above) and Manmohan Singh				                                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 31: Once he was against Italy supplying Indias Prime Minister, now Purno Sangma has questioned if the Rajya Sabha should, either.        
	The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader today tried to stoke the old debate whether the Prime Minister must necessarily come from the Lok Sabha, but the Congress refused to bite the bait and Sangmas own party played the comments down.        
	I am a strong believer in the parliamentary system of governance but in the last several years, I have been a very disappointed man, Sangma, a former Lok Sabha Speaker, told a party convention in Panaji last evening. For years, the Lok Sabha has failed to produce a Prime Minister.        
	Manmohan Singh is a Rajya Sabha member but Congress leaders in Delhi declined to take Sangmas immature remarks seriously, saying they saw no reason to flog a dead horse.        
	Some in Delhis political circles, however, felt the NCP was deliberately mounting pressure on Singh and the Congress following speculation that its leader, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, might be stripped of the consumer affairs and civil supplies portfolios.        
	NCP spokesperson D.P. Tripathi, however, denied that his party had anything against Singh and said he wanted to discuss the matter with Sangma before responding. He added, though, that Sangma may have been making an academic point without particular reference to Singhs abilities.        
	In the 1996 elections, we had to borrow a chief minister from the state of Karnataka (H.D. Deve Gowda) for the Prime Ministers post, Sangma said in Panaji.        
	In 2004, we failed to have a Prime Minister from the Lok Sabha. In 2009 again, the Lok Sabha failed to find a Prime Minister, which forced the country to choose the Premier from the Rajya Sabha.        
	Sangma had been expelled from the Congress along with Pawar and Tariq Anwar in 1999 after they ran a campaign against Sonia Gandhi, saying her Italian birth made her unfit to lead the country. The trio then formed the NCP, which later climbed down from the foreign origin issue and became a Congress ally.        
	Congress spokesperson Shakil Ahmed initially refused to take note of Sangmas remarks, but then said: This is an immature statement. The Constitution does not bar Rajya Sabha members from becoming Prime Minister.        
	He added: Sangma should understand that in the 2009 elections, the voters of the entire country approved Manmohan Singhs policies and governance.

	New Delhi, Dec. 3: The BJP is blushing redder than a bride as its president Nitin Gadkari celebrates his sons wedding with a four-day bash in Nagpur.        
	The splurge and ostentation, sources said, look inappropriate and politically incorrect in this season of corruption scandals. BJP leaders fear that the wedding may hand the Congress further ammunition after the corruption charges against Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa.        
	Local Congress leaders have been criticising the show of extravagance, with member of legislature S.Q. Zama quoted as saying he would not go in protest against the ugly display of money.        
	Gadkaris son Nikhil married Nagpur girl Rutuja according to traditional Maharashtrian rites yesterday. Some 2,500 guests attended the wedding, held at a top-end hotel. But the power reception was scheduled this evening on the Vidarbha Cricket Association lawns, with the guest list of 2,000 including politicians, industrialists, diplomats and Bollywood stars.        
	Tomorrow, a reception has been organised at Nagpurs Reshim Baug grounds for BJP workers and others. A family source said over two lakh invites had been sent out.        
	The BJP chartered a 186-seater plane to ferry its leaders and members from Delhi to Nagpur and back tonight. Shyam Jaju, the office secretary, insisted that every passenger had paid Rs 7,200 for his or her ticket and that anyone with doubts was welcome to check the vouchers at the party headquarters.        
	Another 22 chartered flights were expected to land at Nagpur airport this evening, with BJP sources clarifying that these belonged to industrialists. Reports from Nagpur said Gadkari had three helicopters on standby.        
	The BJP chief ministers were using their state aircraft. Despite Gadkaris invite to the entire Congress brass, including Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, it seemed nobody from Delhi would be going.        
	Chief minister Prithviraj Chavan and his ministers were expected to represent the Congress. The other notable political invitees included Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Raj Thackeray and Sharad Yadav.        
	The Ambani brothers and Amitabh Bachchan were on the guest list too.        
	BJP sources said the choice of Nagpur as the venue was unfortunate. First, Vidarbha has witnessed a spate of suicides by debt-ridden farmers and second, the city is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs base. Gadkari owes his job to the Sangh, which sets great store by austerity.        
	Sangh sources said Gadkari could have avoided the mega event. They recalled his father was a Sangh pracharak and that Gadkari was brought up in the RSS culture. A source said: We dont know what message he is sending, although he might excuse himself by saying it was a private affair.

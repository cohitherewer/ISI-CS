The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Obama stares at lame-duck spectre
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Obama stares at lame-duck spectre
          K.P.NAYAR                           Barack Obama                                  
	Washington, May 19: Incumbency, the dormant and feared force which has brought down Prime Ministers and chief ministers in India, yesterday swept the American political stage, dumping several legislative veterans.        
	The upsets have reinforced the notion that an anti-incumbency wave now threatens to make Barack Obama a lame duck President if Democrats lose control of the US Senate and House of Representatives in Novembers mid-term election.        
	In a procession of setbacks which struck at the roots of political power in both parties, primary voters last night threw out Pennsylvanias 80 year-old Arlen Specter, a Senator for three decades who shaped a good deal of modern-day America, including the composition of its current Supreme Court and advances in its treasured health research.        
	Specter has been under the strobe lights since 1963 when he was staff attorney to the Warren Commission and author of the single-bullet theory, which led the commission to conclude that a lone gunman killed JFK in 1963.        
	In Arkansas, the proletariat secured one of its rare victories in the US when Blanche Lincoln, who has been derisively known for a dozen years as Americas corporate senator was denied a walk-over for another term by her Democratic Party.        
	Her two rivals in the state primary together won 55 per cent of votes, denying the incumbent senator the mandatory 50 per cent that is required under Arkansas Democratic Party rules. She will face a second round of voting in about three weeks.        
	Lincoln was targeted by labour unions for her opposition to the Employee Free Choice Act, a legislation to allow trade union at work places if a majority of workers sign a petition asking for one to represent them in collective bargaining. The act would have also imposed tough penalties on employers who engage in unfair labour practices.        
	The unions were joined in the effort against the incumbent by Democratic Party radicals, who are determined to end the political careers of Lincoln and three other senators who led the campaign on Capitol Hill against the public option that would have given Americans a choice between government-provided healthcare and the current system of private insurance.        
	Two national trade union organisations together spent $ 4.5 million on television advertisements supporting Lincolns main rival in the primary, Arkansas lieutenant governor Bill Halter, who has been in the race only for 11 weeks. The unions also sent volunteers from across America to run Halters smaller, under-financed campaign, enabling him to come from behind and stop Lincolns re-nomination.        
	The Republicans had their big upset in the Kentucky Senate primary, in which Rand Paul, a candidate of the so-called Tea Party activists resoundingly beat establishment candidate Trey Grayson.        
	The defeat of Grayson, Kentuckys secretary of state, is a slap in the face for Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, who is effectively the leader of the party nationally. McConnell had backed Grayson to the hilt and it was said during the primary that the real fight was between the Senate leader and Paul by proxy.        
	Paul is a Right-wing radical who wants to abolish education departments and the Federal Reserve  Americas reserve bank  and end all forms of subsidies by government. In his victory speech last night, Paul said Obama should have boycotted the Copenhagen climate change conference.        
	Defeated Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin is the public face of the arch conservative Tea Party moevement, which has also unseated three-term Senate veteran Bob Bennett in the party primary in Utah and forced Floridas popular governor, Charlie Crist, to leave the Republican Party and make his bid for the Senate as an Independent.        
	Outside the praimaries too, yesterday was a bad day for incumbents. Indiana Republican Mark Souder, an eight-term US Congressman who was comfortably poised to win another term, resigned over an extra-marital affair with a part-time member of his staff, the latest sex scandal to explode on Capitol Hill.        
	Souders disgrace is particularly painful for the Republicans because he had made his career on conservative family values. His resignation follows that of Democratic Congressman Eric Massa over allegations that he sexually harassed male aides and admissions of extramarital affairs.        
	Nevadas Republican Senator John Ensign is similarly under fire for an extra-marital affair and attempts to cover it up with payments that may have been illegal.        
	Senator Specter was Obamas favourite candidate in yesterdays primaries because the President had personally persuaded the long-time Republican last year to defect to the Democrats enabling the party to get the crucial 60-seat, filibuster-proof strength in the Senate.        
	Obamas ability to bring in votes will be doubted by his partymen in the run up to November because Specter is the fourth senior Democrat in seven months to lose state-wide elections despite the Presidents endorsement.

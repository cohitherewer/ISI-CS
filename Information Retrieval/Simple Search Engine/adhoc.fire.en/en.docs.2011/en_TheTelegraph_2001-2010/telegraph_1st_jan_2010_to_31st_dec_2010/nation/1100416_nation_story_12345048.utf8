	Calcutta, April 15: warne888: iamsrk Hang in there, Sport is cruel sometimes        
	Thats a sportsman advising a movie star. Despite three seasons of spectacular fusion of Indias two biggest passions  cricket and Bollywood  the twain, it seems, hasnt quite met.        
	Shah Rukh Khan may choose to hang in there  KKR is my team and I will never ever leave it  but the always suspect Bolly-cricket matrimony is becoming a bit loose at the seams.         
	Lalit Modi had successfully Bollywoodised cricket with the Indian Premier League three years back but with the commissioner himself on a sticky wicket and the starry teams languishing at the bottom of the points table two IPLs in a row, the end credits may soon roll for the glam gang.        
	Preity Zinta may be still jumping around the dugout but theres a lot more brewing under that dimple on the right cheek. After this years disappointing show on the field and a sharp drop in brand quotient post-Yuvraj Singh demotion, the Kings XI Punjab team is supposedly up for sale.         
	Preity, who had joined the bandwagon not as a cricket enthusiast but as Bombay Dyeing scion Ness Wadias girlfriend, suddenly finds herself fielding at silly point.        
	The three years Preity has invested in the red-and-grey tee has stunted her career in movies. Her last major film was Jhoom Barabar Jhoom in 2007 and now, she has hardly any movie in her kitty. As a trade analyst in Mumbai puts it: Na ghar ka na ghaat ka she is almost an outsider in the industry.        
	The IPL, at least, used to give her visibility but even that can disappear very soon.        
	Punjabs tryst with Bollywood may be far from over, though. If its alvida Preity, then its salaam namaste to Saif and Kareena. Having been denied IPL entry through their Pune bid, the Kurbaan couple along with big sister Karisma Kapoor may pump in money in Mohali as part of the consortium led by Videocon. The buzz is that buddy Shah Rukh has egged on good friends Saifeena to invest in an IPL team.         
	Its just the reverse of what had happened with Rajasthan Royals, where Shilpa Shetty is said to have bought the team as a front for people who chose to stay in the background. But unlike franchise brand ambassadors like Katrina Kaif and Deepika Padukone who have actually been making money for appearing at the cricket matches, Shilpa has only lost her nails. If sources are to be believed, she too is on her way out at the end of this IPL, throwing an uneasy question to new entrants like Saifeena whether it is wise to be associated with this annual razzmatazz.         
	Shah Rukh has his reasons for not giving up on Knight Riders. In his own language: KKR is the biggest brand in IPL and they havent even come close to winning. Imagine if my team wins, people all over the world would give up playing football and start playing cricket. So a mix of brisk business and his long-nursed dream of owning a Manchester United kind of team keeps the Boss at it.        
	But SRK must be feeling the heat of failure. For the Scorpio, whose mantra in life is being successful means reacting and then acting upon changing bad days, it must be humiliating to own a team that hasnt bettered sixth spot in an eight-team tournament in three years. The crores he has spent on KKR  invested just some priceless emotions  could have very well generated more heat out of his Red Chillies and upped his star ante.        
	If he does eventually excuse himself, where would that leave the IPL? Can a 10-team, 50-day tournament sustain viewer interest without a sprinkle of Bolly gloss?         
	Those who were there at Eden Gardens on the day Knight Riders beat Delhi Daredevils know the answer. No, it just wasnt the same without Shah Rukh Khan around.

	New Delhi, Nov. 9: Monica Bedi is a free bird now.         
	The Supreme Court today upheld the actresss conviction in a passport forgery case but reduced her jail term to the period already spent behind bars.        
	The court waved away objections that she had already been convicted for the offence in Portugal and that convicting her on the same count again would amount to double jeopardy.        
	Instead, a two-judge bench comprising Justices B. Sudarshan Reddy and S.S. Nijjar said the interests of justice would be served if the sentence was reduced to the period already undergone.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Stress on caution after   luck
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Stress on caution after   luck
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                    
	New Delhi, Jan. 1: If the luck held last year after the horror of Mumbai, caution is going to be the watchword for 2010.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram set the tone for the security architecture for the year ahead after a relatively terror-free 2009 when he said there was no room for complacency or business-as-usual.        
	The warning came yesterday, about a week after the minister had unveiled radical plans to deal with internal security at the Intelligence Bureau Centenary Endowment Lecture.        
	I met the Prime Minister and explained the new architecture. We will have a fuller discussion, I am sure, Chidambaram, who took charge of the countrys internal security after the Mumbai mayhem, told reporters.        
	The new architecture includes a National Counter Terrorism Centre by the end of 2010. The NCTC will be the umbrella organisation under which all security agencies will operate. The National Investigation Agency, a federal agency to deal with terrorism, drug and arms smuggling and anything that could pose a threat to national security, will be part of this structure.        
	The plans also include a National Intelligence Grid that will be in place within the next two years to seamlessly manage information and intelligence.         
	This is a year for cautious optimism and whatever gains have been made need to be consolidated, said former IB director Ajit Doval.        
	Its not that 2009 has been terror-free. Militants and insurgent groups have struck in the Northeast and Kashmir, and Maoists have carried on their guerrilla warfare, but after the November 2008 Mumbai siege that left some 170 people dead, it seemed almost like a safe leap to the New Year for a tense nation.        
	But Chidambaram said the lucky 2009 should not induce complacency. We are stronger today than we were a year ago and we will be stronger a year from now than we are today. (But) there is no room for complacency and there should be no tolerance for business-as-usual.        
	On the Maoist challenge, Chidambaram said it would be a long-drawn battle with Left-wing extremism.        
	Doval warned of more trouble. There is likely to be trouble after April 2010, he said, because of changes in India and in the geopolitics of South Asia as a whole.        
	As for making law-enforcement more rigorous, the home ministry has made filing of FIRs mandatory on every police complaint.        
	Under new amendments to the criminal procedure code that came into effect yesterday, trials in sexual offences, including rape, will now be completed within two months as far as possible and victims will have the right to appeal against a court order.

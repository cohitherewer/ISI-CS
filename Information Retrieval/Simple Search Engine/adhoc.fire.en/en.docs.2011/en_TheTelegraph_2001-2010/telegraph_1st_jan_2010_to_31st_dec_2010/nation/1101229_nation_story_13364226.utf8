          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: A fact-finding committee has found evidence that the vice-chancellor of a central university in Arunachal Pradesh had sent a lewd email to a senior faculty member.        
	The fact-finding exercise was conducted by a single-member committee of former bureaucrat M.P. Bezbaruah to probe allegations of misconduct against K.C. Belliappa, the vice-chancellor of Rajiv Gandhi University in Itanagar. Bezbaruah submitted his report to the human resource ministry this month.         
	The committee was set up following a directive from President Pratibha Patil, the Visitor of the university, to probe allegations by an associate professor at the university that Belliappa had sent her an email with lewd and objectionable content.         
	The associate professor had filed an FIR against Belliappa in Itanagar on April 3 this year, in which she also alleged that someone had hacked her email account and sent objectionable messages to Belliappa and 20 others. Belliappa had earlier said he had received an email from the woman professor and had replied to it. After the FIR was filed, Belliappa was arrested and later released on bail.         
	The committee has found evidence to establish that the vice-chancellor had sent an email with objectionable content, a source said, adding that the Visitor may ask Belliappa to resign.        
	Since the charge of misconduct has been established by the committee, it may not be tenable for him to continue. The Visitor may ask him to put in his papers, the source said.         
	Belliappa, who has been in Delhi since the controversy erupted, refused comment. The committee was set up following my request. I do not want to comment on the findings of the committee. The recommendations of the committee will go to the Visitor who will decide the future course of action, he said.         
	The students of the university have been demanding Belliappas resignation. The All Nyishi Students Union has also alleged misuse of official power by the vice-chancellor.         
	The Rajiv Gandhi University, located at Rono Hills, was formerly known as Arunachal University. It was set up in 1985 as a state university and converted to a central university in April 2007. Belliappa is the first VC of the institution since it was converted to a central university.

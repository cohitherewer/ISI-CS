                              Lishan Wang                                  
	Branford, Connecticut, April 27 (AP): A Chinese doctor has been charged with fatally shooting an Indian-origin physician at Yale University and firing at his pregnant wife after a history of confrontations with the victim and other colleagues that led to his dismissal from a New York hospital.        
	Branford police said 44-year-old Lishan Wang has been charged with murder, attempted murder and firearms offences in the fatal shooting Monday of Vajinder Toor outside his home. Police say Wang, who is from Beijing and last known to be living in Georgia, also fired at Toors wife, but she was not struck.         
	Wang is being held on a $2-million bond. A message was left with an attorney representing him in a civil lawsuit.        
	Toor worked at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center (KJMC) in New York before joining Yale. Police are investigating whether Toor and the gunman had a dispute on the job, using information provided by the victims wife, said Lt Geoffrey Morgan.        
	Were following a hypothesis that the victim and the assailant had some sort of negative interaction at a previous employer, Morgan said, adding that the police do not expect to make additional arrests.        
	Wang and Toor were involved in a confrontation a few years ago at Kingsbrook after Wang left his place of duty at the intensive care unit and was not reachable for a few hours, according to a hospital employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing murder investigation. The employee said Toor reprimanded him and Wang threatened Toor in front of other employees.        
	Wang filed a federal discrimination lawsuit last year against the hospital. He talked about a heated exchange with Dr Vajinder in May 2008 after Vajinder accused him of ignoring pages and calls from hospital staff.                    A medical team puts the body of doctor Vajinder Toor into a vehicle in Branford on Monday. (AP)     
	An hour after this heated discussion, Dr Vajinder then accused Dr Wang of threatening his safety by using hostile body language, although he did not summon security to assist him, Wangs lawsuit said.        
	Wang was suspended with pay on May 22, 2008, and notified by letter that the hospital had decided to propose firing him. He was told by the union that the hospital would only allow him to remain employed if he sought disability leave for mental impairment. He was fired in July.        
	On Monday, Toor was walking in the parking lot towards his car at Meadows Condominiums, miles from the Ivy League campus, shortly before 8am when he was shot several times.        
	Wang was taken into custody at a traffic stop nearby after residents provided the police with details about the suspect and his vehicle, the police said.        
	Toor was a postdoctoral fellow at the Yale School of Medicine who was working with the infectious diseases section of Yale-New Haven Hospital.        
	Yale police chief James Perrotti sent an email to the university community  which was shaken in recent months by the killing of a graduate student in her lab building  saying Branford police had told him the crime was not a random act and was unrelated to Yale.         
	Hersh Arora, a neighbour and family friend, said Toors wife Parneeta had just waved goodbye to her husband and closed the door when she heard gunshots and ran outside. She saw her husband lying on the ground, saw a man with a gun and asked what he was doing.        
	The man started firing at her, so she hid behind a car, Arora said. A neighbour tried to perform CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on Toor, Arora said.         
	The couple have a three-year-old-son, and Parneeta is five months pregnant, Arora said.        
	She cant even cry in front of the kid, Arora said. Shes trying to be brave.        
	Wangs lawsuit claimed injuries resulting from discrimination based on race, national origin and disability, and accused the hospital of retaliation against him for investigating, disclosing and opposing the discrimination.        
	Wang disputed evaluations by human resources staff at Kingsbrook that he had behavioural problems and anger issues, saying he had received favourable evaluations.        
	Additionally, during the time period when some of his supervisors and KJMC Human Resources began to falsely characterise Dr Wang as mentally impaired and suffering from anger issues, Dr Wang scored well on the interpersonal skills sections of his evaluations with no mention of emotional or anger-related problems, the lawsuit said.        
	Another doctor, Dr Gealda Xavier, claimed Wang had yelled at her during a phone call. Wang responded by accusing the hospital of racism. Dr Xavier is not Chinese and Dr Wang had previously complained to his supervisors that she had treated him in a rude and abusive manner. Nothing was done to address Dr Wangs complaint. However, the committee sided with Dr Xavier, who is not Chinese, and inappropriately attributed the perceived problems with Dr Wangs behaviour to unspecified family problems, the lawsuit said.

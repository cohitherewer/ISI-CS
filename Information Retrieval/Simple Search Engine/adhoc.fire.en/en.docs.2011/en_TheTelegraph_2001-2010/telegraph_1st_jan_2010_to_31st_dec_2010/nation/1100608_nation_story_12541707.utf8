										      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                        A survivor of the Bhopal gas tragedy holds up a poster at a demonstration outside the Bhopal court on Monday. (PTI)				                                 
	New Delhi, June 7: The Bhopal verdict is likely to strengthen the hands of the critics of the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, 2010.         
	The bill was introduced in the last Parliament session and referred to the parliamentary standing committee on science and technology, environment and forests.        
	The BJP, which had opposed the proposed legislation in its existing form, iterated its objections today, saying the bill would exempt foreign suppliers of criminal and civil responsibility.         
	The Left had spoken out against the bill earlier and is yet to give a considered response to the Union Carbide judgment.         
	Can the bill mitigate the harm caused by Bhopal-like catastrophes? Its salient features are:        
	It shifts liability stemming from a nuclear accident to the plants operator. The maximum liability has been fixed at approximately Rs 2,385 crore. But the operators liability is capped at Rs 500 crore. The government can scale down the amount to Rs 100 crore. It will have to pick up the differential between the two amounts.        
	It will allow India to accede to the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, without which, the US will not be able to sell nuclear equipment to India. The convention will allow India access to an international corpus of funds to compensate victims of nuclear disasters, for which India, too, will have to contribute.        
	There is no legal liability of the foreign suppliers of nuclear reactors.         
	Any liability for foreign reactor vendors can at best be included in private covenants between them and the Indian operators.        
	It sets a 10-year limit for seeking compensation from the date of the accident. A nuclear mishap can impact several generations to come and the effects can take more than a decade to show.         
	The government had hoped to insulate the nuclear-liability bill against the risks of close vetting by the parliamentary panel by sending it to a committee headed by a Congressman. Initially, it was supposed to refer the bill to the energy committee headed by Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh.        
	Mulayam, a critic of the bill with the Left, crossed over to the UPAs side after voting against the Opposition-sponsored cut motions on price rise.         
	The bill has to be passed to operationalise the Indo-US civil nuclear cooperation agreement.

          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, July 1: Nehru-Gandhi stalwarts names may adorn dozens of central schemes, airports and stadiums, but Mayavati has taken the name game right to the familys home turf.        
	Her government today created a new district around Rahul Gandhis Lok Sabha constituency of Amethi and named it after Dalit icon Chhatrapati Sahuji, grandson of the legendary Shivaji.        
	Congress leaders claimed the move was meant to counter Rahuls growing influence among the states Dalits, whom the young MP has been wooing for a couple of years now, often spending nights at their homes.        
	Mayavatis move does not affect the name of Rahuls parliamentary constituency, which would continue to be known as Amethi. However, the chief minister appears to have hit the Congress where it hurts.        
	Local Congress workers had long insisted that if a new district had to be carved out of Sultanpur, in which Amethi now falls, it should be known as Amethi.        
	Or, if the name had to be changed, it should have been named Rajiv Gandhi Nagar as Amethi was once represented by the late Prime Minister, said Satish Anand, a Congress worker in Amethi.        
	A government release said todays cabinet meeting, chaired by Mayavati, had decided to bifurcate Sultanpur and that the new district would be known as Chhatrapati Sahuji Maharaj Nagar after the 18th-century Maratha ruler. It added that the cabinet had also renamed Kanpur Dehat district as Ramabai Nagar after B.R. Ambedkars wife.        
	Sahuji (1682-1749) has been a Bahujan Samaj Party icon because he had elevated many talented people from disadvantaged sections to positions of power, setting off a process of change in Indian society.        
	Mayavati has shown a penchant not only for building statues of Dalit icons but also for renaming existing institutions after them. She has already renamed two universities  King George Medical University and Kanpur University  after Sahuji.        
	Her latest move wasnt unexpected. Mayavati had carved a Chhatrapati Sahuji Maharaj Nagar district out of Sultanpur in December 2002, when she was chief minister and Amethi was represented in Parliament by Sonia Gandhi.        
	The new district came into being in April 2003, but Mulayam Singh Yadav reversed the decision in November 2003, three months after becoming chief minister.        
	The 2002 bifurcation too was aimed at preventing a Nehru-Gandhi from winning over Dalits. It had come after Priyanka Vadra had accompanied a Dalit, Ram Bhajan, to a police station to register an FIR after a Thakur family had set his home on fire.        
	The BJP demanded that the new district be named after local social workers, while Samajwadi MP Ramgopal Yadav said that the day his party came to power, it would reverse the decision again.        
	The Congress said the name game would not affect the links between Amethi and the Nehru-Gandhis.

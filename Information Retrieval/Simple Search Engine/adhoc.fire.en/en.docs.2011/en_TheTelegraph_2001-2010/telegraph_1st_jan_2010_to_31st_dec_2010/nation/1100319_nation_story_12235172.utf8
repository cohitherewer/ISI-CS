	Itanagar, March 18: Arunachal Pradesh governor Lt Gen. (retd) J.J. Singh today said the government had laid utmost emphasis on social justice and security of the people of the Himalayan state.        
	Addressing the budget session of the Assembly on its opening day, he said the government had prioritised basic issues like healthcare, education and communication.         
	Singh said the Dorjee Khandu government would lay stress on tourism, agriculture and horticulture to tap their potential.        
	The governor said in his address: The government has always given the highest priority to the maintenance of law and order in the state. Fifty-one cadres of various underground organisations surrendered in Tirap district last year and it is perhaps the highest ever in any single district of the country.        
	The government is actively considering the adoption of a surrender policy to inspire even more misguided youths to shun the path of violence and join the mainstream.

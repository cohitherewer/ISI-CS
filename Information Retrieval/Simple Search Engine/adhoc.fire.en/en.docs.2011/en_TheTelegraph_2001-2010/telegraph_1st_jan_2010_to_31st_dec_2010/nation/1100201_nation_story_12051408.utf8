The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UK PhD students jailed for car fraud
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      UK PhD students jailed for car fraud
                            
	London, Jan. 31 (PTI): Two Indian PhD students in the UK have been jailed for running an elaborate car-sale scam in the East Midlands and face deportation after serving their sentences.        
	Zubair Ansari and Sharif Uddin, enrolled at Loughborough University, duped buyers out of thousands of pounds. They sold cars with milometers turned back, forged certificates, bogus service histories and false hire-purchase reports.        
	Zubair, 33, has been jailed for 18 months after being convicted by the Leicester Crown Court of conspiracy in running the fraudulent business between August 2007 and August 2008. Sharif, 33, who admitted the same charge, has been jailed for 12 months. Sharif also confessed to supplying goods under false deals and engaging in unfair commercial practices.        
	It was a carefully worked out scam, made more serious because these two men are highly educated graduates who have used their skill and intelligence to set up this fraud, Judge Simon Hammond said.         
	The youths ran their company in their own names and bought cars with high mileage at auctions. These were later sold  after turning back the odometers  for profits of 1,000 to 1,500 (Rs 75,000 to Rs 1.12 lakh) each. Officials had found a 900 electronic clocking device and fake garage stamps in Zubairs home. The two were involved in the sale of at least seven such cars, worth around 38,000 (Rs 28.5 lakh).

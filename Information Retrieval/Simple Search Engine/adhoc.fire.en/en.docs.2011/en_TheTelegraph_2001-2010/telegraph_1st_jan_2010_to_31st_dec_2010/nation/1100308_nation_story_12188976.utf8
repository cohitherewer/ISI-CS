          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 7: The commissionerate of police, which booked a 19-year-old in a theft case a week ago, is now under judicial scrutiny on charges of custodial brutality.         
	The scrutiny follows allegation of brutal excesses during the youths illegal detention at a city police station.        
	Orissa High Court has sought clarification from the commissionerate on charges made by the father of the alleged victim after treating his letter on Friday as a writ petition.        
	Mangaraj Swain of Pithapur area alleged in his petition that the police had picked up his son Niranjan on February 20 and detained him illegally at the Purighat police station for six days. He was tortured and beaten up so brutally that he needed medical attention, he said.        
	He was admitted to the SCB Medical College Hospital before being booked and sent to jail. There was telling evidence of brutal assault and torture on his body. He was gasping for breath when I last saw him in the hospital, the father alleged.        
	The court had also issued notice to the home department and deferred hearing on the case till receipt of a counter affidavit from the state counsel.        
	The police had maintained that Niranjan Swain alias Kalia was arrested on February 27 and was taken to the hospital the same day.         
	In fact, deputy commissioner of police A.N. Sinha had gone on record stating that Kalia was a drug addict and he needed medical attention for drug withdrawal symptom in police custody. He was booked in a motorcycle theft case after the vehicle was recovered from him, he had said, while refuting allegations of torture.                          
	Meanwhile, social activists who had visited the hospital and interacted with Niranjan before he was sent to the Choudwar Jail and members of his family had filed a petition before the State Human Rights Commission. Social activist Rutupurna Mohanty said: During our interaction, we found injury marks on his body. They were fresh and indicated assault. We have submitted our report along with the petition to the commission.

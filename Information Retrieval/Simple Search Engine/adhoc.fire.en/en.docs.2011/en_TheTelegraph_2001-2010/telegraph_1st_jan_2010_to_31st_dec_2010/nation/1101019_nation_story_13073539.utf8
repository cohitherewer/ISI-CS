	New Delhi, Oct. 18 (PTI): Flight pursers will not bother you from Friday if you want to make a cellphone call as soon as your plane touches down.         
	The directorate- general of civil aviation has amended aircraft rules to allow the use of mobiles before planes come to a halt and the doors open.         
	According to the amended rules, passengers will be allowed to use mobile phones after an aircraft lands and leaves the active runway, entering the taxiway  provided there are no runways or intersections for it to cross.         
	However, this procedure would not be allowed in low visibility conditions such as fog at an airport, an official spokesperson said.         
	The air hostesss announcement would go somewhat like this: Passengers are advised that the use of mobile phones after landing is now allowed. The aircraft has left the active runway and has slowed down. Passengers may use their mobile phones now.         
	The pilot in command will give clearance for such an announcement.         
	The airlines have been asked to adopt the new procedure latest by October 22.

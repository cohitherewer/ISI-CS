The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Franchise murmurs against Modi
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Franchise murmurs against Modi
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                        Mallya      
	Mumbai, April 19: From the blue-eyed boy who could do no wrong, Lalit Modi has suddenly turned into the Indian cricket establishments favourite punching bag.        
	Its not just a section of the bosses in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) who have their knives out.         
	Joining them in the oust-Modi campaign are some IPL franchise owners who are miffed at being dragged into the controversy.         
	He (Modi) should go. His indiscretions have brought a bad name not just to the IPL, but also unnecessary harassment for us all. He is so arrogant, said the chief executive of an IPL franchise, who spoke under cover of anonymity.        
	Modi could not be reached for comment but he found predictable support from a select few like Vijay Mallya. The liquor baron, who owns Royal Challengers Bangalore, credited Modi for the leagues success.        
	Unfortunately, this entire issue has snowballed into an unnecessary storm, Mallya, the head of the UB group, told Times Now channel.        
	As far as Im concerned, Im full of appreciation for what Lalit Modi has delivered through the IPL. If he has issues with the government of India, thats his private matter and he needs to deal with it, said Mallya, whose stepdaughter Laila Mallya is part of Modis core staff within the IPL.         
	Mallyas support notwithstanding, BCCI bosses, who had so far been in Modis corner, have now begun distancing themselves from the official.        
	The decision, income-tax sources said, came after the department began pursuing the financial dealings of two UPA ministers.        
	We now have documents that prove that they invested in IPL teams through close associates. There is a prima facie case against them. We will act as soon as there is a go-ahead, said the tax source.        
	Even a section of Mumbais swish set is now blaming the IPL chief for dragging them into the tax radar.         
	The investigators are looking into the role of two Bollywood starlets, a Bollywood actor of the 80s who is close to a current superstar, a fashion designer and an Indian cricketer who had once earlier come under the cloud of match-fixing.        
	The focus is on their role as regular fixtures in VIP enclosures.        
	The income tax department has sought details of the IPL post-match parties and fashion parades, where the sleuths suspect several illicit deals were cut.        
	We are investigating on the basis of solid leads whether some of these individuals played a role in betting/match-fixing in IPL matches, said a top Mumbai-based income tax source.        
	Income tax officials said that during his interrogation at his suite in Four Seasons Hotel, Modis reaction to a Delhi Daredevils vs Chennai Super Kings match was extraordinary.        
	We were in the middle of questioning when he (Modi) got a message saying that CSK had lost to Delhi Daredevils, said the income tax source.        
	Modi shot up from his chair on getting the news, said the source. He looked very nervous and covered his face with his hands and asked for a glass of water. His hand was trembling as he drank up. Then he asked for a five-minute break, said the tax official.        
	The official said Modi then reportedly called up a Delhi number and shouted at the person on the other side. This cant happen. This was not supposed to happen, the official quoted Modi as saying.        
	The officials version could not be independently verified with Modi.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      College and girls fail acid test
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 10: Authorities of a Secunderabad girls college ordered an arts section to clean up defaced classroom walls and tables with nitric acid and rags, causing about a dozen students to suffer minor burns on their hands.        
	The authorities seemed unaware how corrosive nitric acid is; nor, apparently, did the first-year arts students remember the lessons from their school science books.        
	The principal of St Francis College, run by St Marys Church, later persuaded the students parents not to lodge a police complaint or create a public controversy.        
	Acid is regularly used to clean bathroom and kitchen stains in homes  with brushes  but some of the girls remarks suggested they were unfamiliar with household cleaning. I have never cleared up even my bed at home, but the principal wanted me to clean the table and the walls, complained Anita, 18.        
	The girls, however, made one serious allegation: that they were given tincture iodine, which is highly inflammable, and were detained for four hours in their classroom to avoid a scandal. They were allowed to go home a little after normal closing hours, when all the other students had left.        
	Dr Rajeswara Shastry of Apollo Hospitals said burnt skin needs quick treatment because it can easily get infected.        
	College authorities said they had made sure that none of the burns were serious. They said two girls, who fainted after fumes began rising from the rags when they poured the acid, were sent to hospital at once and were discharged after treatment.        
	Giving the girls nitric acid was a mistake, admitted principal Laila Mary Francis, who has been a teacher for 22 years and received the Best Principal Award in 2001 from a state education body. She said the guilty would be punished.        
	But a lecturer said it was the principal who had ordered the use of acid instead of ordinary cleaning solutions as the ink-and-lipstick drawings were very thick.        
	A few bottles of the acid were brought from the college lab and an old curtain was torn up to make rags. They said anyone who refused would be marked absent for a week and face consequences in the final-quarter internals, a girl said.        
	The students alleged the acid fumes caused panic. A few girls tried to run out of the classroom, and in the commotion some acid splashed onto a few more girls hands.        
	The authorities, realising the mistake, quickly took the acid bottles away but confined the entire section of 50.        
	They (the college management) have appealed to us not to complain to the police or the college board, said Bharati Menon, mother of a student.        
	The students today did not seem to have too many complaints. One girl said her biggest grouse was that she could not watch a Harry Potter film because, after the hullabaloo, bunking classes had become impossible.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 23: The Union cabinet today cleared a bill to set up tribunals to settle education-related disputes, rejecting the recommendations of a parliamentary committee that had said more consultations were needed.        
	This paves the way for reintroduction of the Education Tribunals Bill in Parliament. The bill was first introduced in May and then sent to the parliamentary standing committee on HRD, which gave its recommendations on Friday.        
	The proposed tribunals at the Centre and in the states will have jurisdiction over all education institutions, whether private or government-run, including medical and dental colleges.        
	At present, there are 504 university-level institutes and 25,951 colleges across the country, with 1.36 crore students. The annual intake in these institutes is about 14 lakh. Any dispute arising in any of these institutes will be adjudicated by the proposed tribunals, the bill says.        
	The standing committee had found that private institutes, the Medical Council of India, the Dental Council of India and central educational institutes had not been consulted. It criticised the HRD ministry for hurriedly preparing the legislation and recommended more consultation.        
	However, the HRD ministry is of the view that the state governments were consulted and there was no adverse comment from any of them, sources said.        
	The Union cabinet rejected the standing committees recommendations on the ground that they were not substantive, sources said.        
	The government will reach out to the Opposition parties to pass the bill in Parliament, the sources added.

	Jaipur, May 11: A young man from Bengal was detained today for entering a prohibited area of Sanganer airport here, two days ahead of the second anniversary of the Jaipur blasts that killed 68 people.        
	Mohammad Yaseen, 28, is from Murshidabad but has been living in Jaipur for many years, superintendent of police Hawa Singh Ghungharia said.        
	Yaseen, caught near the cargo gate of Terminal I by CISF personnel, had probably jumped over the airports boundary wall, sources said.        
	The police said the man was being questioned and it was difficult to say whether he had any Bangladesh links. Sources said Yaseen might be mentally unfit and that the police were thinking of a medical test.

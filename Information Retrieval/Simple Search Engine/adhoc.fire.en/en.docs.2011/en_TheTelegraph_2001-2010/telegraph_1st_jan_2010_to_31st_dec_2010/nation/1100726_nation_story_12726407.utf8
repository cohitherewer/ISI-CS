          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, July 25: The recovery of a 100kg World War II bomb has put Assam police in a dilemma over what to do with the dangerous vintage object.         
	The bomb is buried safely on the Misamari police station premises in Sonitpur district. We are still undecided on what we should do with the bomb. We have contacted experts from the army but they have not come as yet, a police officer said.         
	The bomb, which was in the possession of NDFB militants, was found by the police along the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border a few days ago. Sonitpur police chief Jitmol Doley said: It was a Herculean task shifting the bomb to the police station. He said it looked harmless as it had been lying for several decades.        
	The police said the NDFB militants had tried to open the bomb to use the explosives inside but failed.

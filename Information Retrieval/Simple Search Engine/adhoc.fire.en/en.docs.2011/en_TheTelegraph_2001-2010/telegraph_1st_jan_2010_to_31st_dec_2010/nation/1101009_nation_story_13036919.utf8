          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 8: Two children were killed when a grenade lobbed during a Maoist encounter fell inside their school this morning in Maharashtra.        
	The school, run by the state tribal department in Gadchiroli district, is close to the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border, an area that has seen several Maoist encounters.         
	A woman cook of the residential school and a civilian, both unidentified, also died, according to police sources.         
	The police said the grenade exploded on the school premises when classes had broken for a recess. The blast killed 11-year-old Sunil Halami and 12-year-old Nansa Hidako on the spot. Ten children were seriously injured.         
	The school is about 250km from Nagpur, the nearest city. Sawargaon, the village where the school is located, is also close to Chhattisgarhs Rajnandgaon, a known rebel hotspot.        
	The grenade exploded soon after the Maoists had triggered a landmine blast targeting a jeep of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) around 11am. The mine blast killed three jawans of the paramilitary force on the Chhattisgarh side of the inter-state border. The rest of the jawans in the convoy then chased the armed Maoists towards Sawargaon, the sources said.        
	It is not clear who tossed the grenade that fell inside the school  the police or the Maoists.         
	The ambush happened hours after the new CRPF chief, K. Vijay Kumar, arrived in Chhattisgarh to review anti-Maoist operations.        
	Rajnandgaon superintendent of police B.N. Meena said the dead jawans were in the same vehicle.         
	This is the first casualty that the ITBP has suffered in Chhattisgarh in its operation against the Maoists. The force deployed in the insurgency-hit pockets of Rajnandgaon are involved in an area-domination operation.        
	One of the 10 injured tribal children was taken to a Nagpur hospital in a serious condition. Five others were admitted to a rural hospital and four were taken to Gadchiroli district hospital, police officers said.

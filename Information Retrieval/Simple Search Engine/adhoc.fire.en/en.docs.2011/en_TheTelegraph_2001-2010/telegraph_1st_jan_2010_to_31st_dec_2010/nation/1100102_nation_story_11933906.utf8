          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Jan. 1: The Maharashtra government has asked eight senior IPS officers to explain the disappearance of a file containing purchase details of bullet-proof vests used while combating terrorists on the night of 26/11.         
	The file disappeared a few days after November 26 when questions were raised about the quality of the jackets. Allegations had surfaced that Hemant Karkare, the anti-terrorism squad chief, died because the jackets were substandard and could not stop the bullets.        
	The file later mysteriously reappeared in the police commissioners office but without several pages.        
	The showcause notices were issued after an assurance by state home minister R.R Patil to the Assembly that responsibility for the loss of the file would be fixed and action taken. The officers have to reply to the notices within a month.         
	The officers have mostly handled administrative duties since 2002 when the purchase of the bullet-proof jackets began.         
	They have been asked to clarify how the file relating to the purchase of the jackets between 2002 and 2004 went missing. They have to reply within a month, Patil said.         
	Replies have been sought from principal secretary P.K. Jain; additional DGP Subhash Awate; joint commissioner of police Bhagwant More; deputy inspector-general Rajnish Seth; special branch additional commissioner Ashutosh Dumbre and deputy commissioners Vijay Jadhav, Sanjay Apranti and S.R. Paraskar.         
	Jain and Awate had worked as joint commissioner between 2003 and 2007, while Seth, Dumbre, Paraskar and Apranti had worked as deputy commissioners during this period. Those in these two posts are responsible for purchasing equipment required by the force.         
	The disappearance of the file came to light when an application was filed under the Right to Information law.

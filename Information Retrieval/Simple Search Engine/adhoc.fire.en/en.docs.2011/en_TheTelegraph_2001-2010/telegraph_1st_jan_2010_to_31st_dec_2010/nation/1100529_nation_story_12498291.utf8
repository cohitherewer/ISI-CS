  - Hope amp; hiccup for two mega projects in state        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The bhumi puja being performed at Kalinga Nagar on Friday. Telegraph picture                                        
	Bhubaneswar, May 28: More than four years after 14 tribals were killed during Tata Steels construction of a boundary wall in Kalinga Nagar, the ground-breaking ceremony for its proposed plant was held peacefully today.        
	Though the bhumi puja, held at Ambagadai village in Jajpur districts Kalinga Nagar, was a low-key affair, significantly the puja was performed by Chakradhar Haibru (senior), a former president of the Visthapan Virodhi Jan Manch, which has been leading the anti-steel plant agitation.        
	Haibru has agreed to give up his land and received compensation from the Jajpur district administration, marking a split in the association.        
	Haibru was flanked by Dhaneswar Soi, the president of Bisthapita Sangha, the organisation representing displaced families. However, no officials from Tata Steel attended the ceremony.        
	On the other hand, Visthapan Virodhi Jan Manch secretary Rabindra Jarika said: Our struggle against the Tata Steel plant will continue until it is scrapped. We will not allow it to be set up at the cost of our land and livelihood.        
	Ten platoons of armed police force along with six magistrates were deployed at the site  about 120km from here  to maintain law and order. However, no untoward incident was reported, said Jajpur superintendent of police D.S. Kutte.         
	Subsequent to the bhumi puja ritual, land cutting and gradation work started at the plant site today, said Tata Steel sources.        
	On February 22, the first consignment of equipment for the project comprising steel melting shops had arrived at the site. In the current fiscal, it is estimated that equipment and machinery for Tata Steels Orissa project worth Rs 500 crore will arrive and orders for the equipment and civil structures worth Rs 6,373 crore have already been placed, said company officials.        
	It has already set up incoming material section, fabrication unit and is constructing a water intake well.        
	Tata Steel had signed an MoU with the state government on November 17, 2004, for establishment of a 6MTPA steel plant at Kalinga Nagar at an estimated cost of Rs 18,700 crore.

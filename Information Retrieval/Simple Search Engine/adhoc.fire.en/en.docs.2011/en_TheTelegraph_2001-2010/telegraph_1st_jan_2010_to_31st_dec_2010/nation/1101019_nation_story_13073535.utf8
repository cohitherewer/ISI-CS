          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 18: Aspiring civil servants, mugging up textbooks will no longer help.        
	Candidates appearing for the civil services preliminary exams will, from next year, have to clear a paper that will test their general aptitude instead of their knowledge in a subject of their choice after the government today brought in changes to the exam format.        
	The modified pattern means that from 2011, there will be no optional subject-based paper from among the 18 that candidates could choose from till now.        
	However, the other paper on general studies will continue as before.        
	About 1.7 lakh candidates write the IAS preliminary exams conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) in May every year. Successful candidates then have to clear the main exam and an interview to be appointed as civil servants.        
	A government source said the changes announced by the government were aimed at testing a candidates raw intelligence as specialisation in a particular subject might not necessarily make a person a good civil servant.        
	So the paper that will test aptitude will have questions on comprehension, the number system and data interpretation. It will also test interpersonal skills, reasoning power, analytical abilities and decision-making and problem-solving skills apart from general mental ability.        
	This will be the first time that an aptitude test will be held as part of the civil service exams.        
	The change followed allegations that many students memorised subject-based text material and reproduced them in the exam. The modified pattern will provide a level-playing field to all candidates as they have to answer the same set of questions, the sources said.        
	The sources said the UPSC had set up a committee that suggested these modifications. The commission then recommended the suggestions to the government, which approved them.         
	The paper on general studies will have questions on current national and international events, Indian history, Indian and world geography, Indian polity and governance, economic and social development, environmental ecology, biodiversity and climate change and general science.        
	Each of the two papers will have objective-type questions that will carry 200 marks and the candidates will have two hours to answer them. The candidates will have to clear both papers.        
	The pattern for next years main exam will remain the same but sources said changes could be introduced later.

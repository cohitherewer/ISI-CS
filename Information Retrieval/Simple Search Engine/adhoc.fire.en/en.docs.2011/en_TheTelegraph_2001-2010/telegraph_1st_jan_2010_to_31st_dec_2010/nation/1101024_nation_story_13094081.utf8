          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 23: The CBI, one of the agencies investigating the alleged corruption in the Commonwealth Games, is getting help from unexpected quarters.         
	It has received letters and phone calls from insidersemployees of government departments such as the CPWD, PWD, Delhi Municipal Corporation and the Delhi Development Authority, which are under the scanner.        
	Staff of departments that undertook development projects as part of preparations for the Games have been sharing vital information with us. They have written to us detailing how money was plundered by a section of officials in connivance with contractors, a CBI official said.        
	The official cited how one whistleblower wrote that a contract-related document was fudged after the scam came to light in August, and even mentions the page number. He has also given the names of some officials and contractors who were involved, the official said.         
	Another whistleblower has highlighted how sub-standard material was used in the construction of the footbridge near Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium which collapsed a few days before the Games. He quoted from the office document where a department engineer had in his assessment report pointed this out, but his seniors did not pay heed, the official said.         
	We will soon share these details with the Central Vigilance Commission, which is separately probing corruption in various Games-related projects, the CBI official said.        
	CBI media officer R.K Gaur confirmed that a large number of people had written to the agency, sharing information about irregularities. We are analysing the contents of the letters. It is too early to comment on anything now as a probe is on, he said.         
	The CBI is looking into specific complaints in the award of contracts. Besides, we are also investigating the money trail of Rs 1.8 crore paid by the organising committee to the previously unknown AM Films and AM Cars for logistical support during the queens baton rally in London, an official said.         
	The income tax department, the vigilance commission, and the Comptroller amp; Auditor Generals office are holding parallel investigations into Games-related projects and the organising committees deals. The Enforcement Directorate is investigating allegations of money laundering against certain organising committee officials.         
	Like the CBI, the vigilance commission has also been getting letters from people who want to help with the probe. It has received complaints about the supply and installation of network equipment, major discrepancies in the remodelling and upgrade of the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium as well as manipulation of tenders. All these complaints are under investigation and we have asked the sports ministry to provide us relevant documents, an official said.

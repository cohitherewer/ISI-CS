	New Delhi, Aug. 24: Bad luck, public servants! You may have the luxury of having Saturdays as holidays but you no longer have the liberty to shirk court summons on weekends.        
	A Delhi court has ruled that government officials could not afford the luxury of refusing to work on Saturdays after finding that forensic officials had routinely been refusing to appear in court on weekends.        
	Additional sessions judge Girish Kathpalia issued a bailable warrant against Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) expert Madhulika Sharma for not appearing before the court on August 21 in response to summons issued on August 7.        
	FSL officials have been expressing reluctance to appear in court on Saturdays under the pretext that Saturdays are holidays. But that cannot be an excuse since, in a large number of cases, accused persons are in custody and in such a situation no public servant can afford the luxury of refusing to work on Saturdays, the court said.        
	The judge, however, desisted from taking coercive action. Sharma being an FSL expert, prosecution witness and a lady, I do not feel inclined to issue non-bailable warrant.

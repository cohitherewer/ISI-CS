The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Negative approach? Not Mamata
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Negative approach? Not Mamata
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                           By the p, for the p      
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Mamata Banerjee today used the rail budget to reach out to industry, pitching for easing government regulations to attract private investment and revealing an avatar in stark contrast with the anti-industry image Singur has earned her.         
	The railway minister blamed a typical negative approach within the government towards the business community for discouraging the corporate sector from investing, adorning a reform cap associated more with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	Please pardon me for saying so. But it is a fact that administrative and procedural delays, external and internal, do take place, discouraging prospective investors. We need to overcome this situation, said Mamata.         
	The Trinamul Congress chief, who in 2008 drove the Tatas out of Singur where they were to manufacture the Nano, clarified that farmland would be taken for railway projects only with the consent of farmers.        
	The western freight corridor, and an exclusive new corridor for passenger travel that Mamata announced, will need the government to procure land.        
	Mamata also assured railway employees that she was not privatising the utility, which she frequently described as a lifeline of the country.        
	But barring the two reassurances, Mamata peppered almost every page of her speech with references  both general and project-specific  to her plans to involve private industry in the expansion of the railways.         
	Multi-level parking complexes, bottling plants to provide passengers cheap and clean drinking water, factories to build diesel coaches, wagons, rail axles and refrigerated containers will all be started through public-private partnerships.         
	The need of the hour is to develop new business models and invite domestic investment through the PPP mode, the minister said. It will facilitate a large quantum of investment in (the) railways and provide ready business to investors. Therefore, it will be a win-win option for all, Mamata said. The minister said she would speak to the Prime Minister, the finance minister and the Planning Commission regarding early clearance of projects.                    An auto outlet in Singur     
	Mamata announced that she had decided to set up a special task force to clear proposals for investments within 100 days. Policy guidelines will be simplified and made investor-friendly, she said. In creating infrastructure with private capital, we will create wealth for all, and we will be benchmarked with the best, Mamata said. The move towards greater cooperation with the private sector is a result of a realisation that the railways core competence lies in operations and management, not in manufacturing, she hinted.

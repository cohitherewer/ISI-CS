	Bhubaneswar, May 23: The Jagatsinghpur district administration will start a field-survey for the proposed steel plant of South Korean major Posco from tomorrow.        
	We have already completed the groundwork. Six teams have been constituted for this and survey will begin at the proposed site from Tuesday, Jagatsingpur district collector Narayan Chandra Jena said.        
	According to the government order, the district administration would exclude Dhinkia village, the epicentre of the anti-Posco movement, from the survey.        
	Posco requires 4,004 acres out of which 437 acres are private, and out of this nearly 300 acres are in Dhinkia.        
	Besides the six teams, another two  led by Tehsildar of Kujanga  have been constituted exclusively to enumerate the trees, as the villagers have been demanding compensation for betel vines, drumstick and cashew nuts.        
	Jena added that they would initiate dialogue with the Posco authorities regarding the rehabilitation package. We will try to give the best rehabilitation package as far as possible. The shape of the rehabilitation package will be later decided, Jena mentioned.        
	To start the survey, the administration held a closed-door meeting with pro-Posco activists at Paradip last night. Paradip MLA and agriculture minister Damodar Rout and Ersama-Balikuda MLA Prasant Muduli attended the meet.        
	The pro-Posco activists under the banner of the Joint Co-ordination Committee presented a 29-point charter of demands to the administration and demanded a better compensation package.        
	On the other hand, the CPI-backed Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, also held a meeting last night. We demanded complete relocation of the project. We hope that the chief minister will look into our demands, said samiti president Abhay Sahu.

                          Phillips Talbot                    
	New York, Oct. 6 (PTI): Veteran diplomat and author Phillips Talbot, one of the few Americans to witness Indias Independence and the Partition, died at the age of 95 in New York.        
	His death on October 1 was announced by the Asia Society where he was president from 1970 to 1981. He was also a Padma Shri recipient.        
	Talbot was US assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations from 1961 to 1965. He was the ambassador to Greece from 1965 to 1969.        
	Talbot wrote extensively about Asia in books and journals over many decades.        
	Describing Talbot as a groundbreaking American observer of Asian affairs, the Asia Society president Vishakha N. Desai said: Phil was a statesman, a great leader and a thoughtful observer of US-Asia relations. We will miss his wisdom and commitment, Desai was quoted as saying in a media release.        
	Born on June 7, 1915, Talbot pursued a long and distinguished academic and diplomatic career.        
	In 2002, India awarded him the Padma Shri in recognition of his efforts to build Indo-US understanding.

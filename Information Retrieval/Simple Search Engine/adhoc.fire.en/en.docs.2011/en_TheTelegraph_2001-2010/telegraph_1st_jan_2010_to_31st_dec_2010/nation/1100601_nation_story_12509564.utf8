The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Guru not target: PC
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Guru not target: PC
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT PTI                              
	May 31: The Union home minister and Karnataka police today said Sri Sri Ravishankar was probably not the target of yesterdays shooting, believed to have occurred at his ashram here.        
	The Art of Living founder, who escaped unharmed, has claimed there was an attempt on his life, but P. Chidambaram said the reports he had got suggested that the guru was not around when the shot was fired. In all probability, this could be the result of a dispute between two of his disciples, the minister told PTI in Delhi.         
	It seems to be a dispute or a brawl between two of his followers. One of them (a devotee) has been injured in his thigh, PTI quoted the minister as saying. Our reports say the incident took place after Sri Sri Ravishankar left the place in his car and, therefore, it may not be correct, I underline, may not be correct to say that the firing was aimed at him, Chidambaram said.         
	Karnataka DGP Ajai Kumar Singh said it was not a targeted attack on Ravishankar. I do not call it an attack. It is an incident, Singh told PTI. He said a case had been registered under culpable homicide not amounting to murder and the arms act. The police had rejected an application to provide the guru Z-category security around a week back.        
	The police said though the incident occurred at 6.10pm, the guru disclosed it only around 8.30pm. By the time the police reached his ashram, three hours had been lost as the FIR was filed only around 9pm by his associates, a senior Bangalore officer said.        
	The officer also suggested that the bullet type and the distance may have rendered it ineffective. The .22mm bullet, fired from 700 to 800 feet away, would have been a dead bullet before it had reached its intended target as it had lost its trajectory. Such bullets can cause harm at very close range, the officer explained.        
	The 54-year-old Ravishankar, however, dismissed the rivalry theory as baseless. The police cannot absolve itself of its responsibility by taking it lightly, he said.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: If you are 30 or less, and have legal ambitions, heres the chance.        
	The law ministry headed by M. Veerappa Moily will pluck 10 young practising lawyers from the grassroots in every state and train them under an ambitious scheme named after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.         
	The plan, according to the introduction to the Rajiv Gandhi Adhivakta Prakshikshan Yojna, is to make justice available at doorsteps, and also to ensure that young lawyers dont remain briefless for lack of encouragement.        
	The candidates, however, cant be above 30.        
	The scheme, launched yesterday to mark the birth anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi, will be funded by the department of legal affairs under the law ministry. Sources said every year, a high-level committee will select the lawyers in each state.         
	The committee will comprise a judge of that states high court, the additional/assistant solicitor general of India attached with that high court, the chairman of the states bar council and the advocate general of the state.        
	After selection, the lawyers will be trained for two months, one month in National Law Schools and another under a senior advocate designated by the high courts and the Supreme Court. Board and lodging will be free during the training period.         
	Sources said the scheme was part of a plan to improve access to justice. The introduction says justice is a fundamental right and an effective justice delivery system requires that justice should be available at the doorsteps.        
	But for that, talented, dedicated and qualified legal professionals are a must.        
	The lawyers, the sources said, will be trained in the art of advocacy so that they dont remain briefless. In return, the candidates should be willing and ready to make available their services for the legal aid programme under the district legal aid authority.        
	While selecting candidates, preference will be given to those from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, backward classes, women and the physically challenged.         
	For selection, a candidate should have enrolled as an advocate and been practising in the court of a magistrate or a munsif. In addition, his or her income shouldnt be more than Rs 600 per month.         
	The candidates will be trained in the use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, plea bargaining, use of IT, art of arguing and cross-examination, cyber laws, intellectual laws, extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties in both civil and criminal matters, and on how to serve summons to people residing in foreign countries and other specific laws.         
	These include the Domestic Violence Act, 2005, the Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005, the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1963, and the Gram Nyayalaya Act, 2009, which envisages creation of courts at the panchayat level. After the training in the National Law Schools, the candidates will be placed under senior advocates working in their districts.

	Calcutta, Feb. 15: On a flight from Pune to Calcutta, a mother murmured: Whatever strength we had is gone.         
	 Its all over, said Alpana Dhar, mother of Ankik, 23, and Anindyee, 19, the siblings who were killed in the Pune bakery bombing.        
	Alpana Dhar was speaking in an almost inaudible voice as the flight made a brief stopover in Mumbai this evening.         
	Eyes swollen and ringed with dark circles and wrapped in the same red bandhni shawl that draped her frame when she left Calcutta yesterday morning, the mother bore signs of what she went through in the past 36 hours.         
	The Dhar family had left for Pune with some hope last morning after news came in that Ankik  an IIT Kharagpur alumnus who joined JP Morgan after his engineering course  and Anindyee, a first-year economics student in Fergusson College in Pune, were injured. But on their way to the hospital, they learnt that the siblings had died in the blast along with another city girl, Shilpa Goenka, Ankiks friend from school.         
	The Dhar family performed the last rites of Ankik and Anindyee in Pune yesterday evening while Shilpa was cremated in Calcutta last night.         
	We have completed all the official procedures Now, we are going back home, said Kamalendu, sitting next to his wife at the rear end of the flight that took off from Pune around 6.30pm.         
	He, along with his wife and younger son Aishik and some relatives, landed in Calcutta after 11pm and left for his Salt Lake home at BB49.        
	We dont know how we will face Kamalendu and Alpana The kids were so bright and well mannered. We will always miss them, said Kaushik Ganguly, a neighbour, as silence enveloped the building in Sector I in Salt Lake.         
	Silence enveloped the sprawling Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan school campus as the authorities and present and past students held a condolence meeting to mourn the deaths of Anindyee, Ankik and Shilpa.         
	The three of them were among the best students the school had ever produced. We condemn the act of terrorism that took the lives of such innocent kids, said Anindita Chatterjee, the school principal.        
	Over 200 present and former students, with candles in their hands, observed a minutes silence at the ground floor assembly hall. Several classmates of the trio, who had turned up at the school, could hardly hold back their tears.        
	I last met Anindyee when she accompanied me to Delhi last year She went around clicking pictures to capture the images of the Delhi streets with her camera. She was planning to film a photo documentary, said Chitrangada Chakraborty, Anindyees friend.        
	Some friends of Anindyee were sitting in a small circle along the basketball court, where she used to spend several hours practising or watching others play. Neha, another friend of Anindyee, recounted how she came back to Vidya Bhavan even after her parents admitted her to another city school.        
	Ankiks friends, at the other end of the court, recalled their happy days in school.         
	We will miss him He was such an energetic person, said Chiranjeet as his eyes turned moist remembering Ankik, who was nicknamed Tempo-da at IIT Kharagpur for his exuberant energy.        
	In a campus newspaper, his IIT friends recalled how Tempo-da used to liven up the campus.        
	Alpana wore a ghostly smile as she learnt about her sons nickname while flying back to Calcutta. Kothai likheche (where have they written?) she asked, before getting lost in the memories of her children.

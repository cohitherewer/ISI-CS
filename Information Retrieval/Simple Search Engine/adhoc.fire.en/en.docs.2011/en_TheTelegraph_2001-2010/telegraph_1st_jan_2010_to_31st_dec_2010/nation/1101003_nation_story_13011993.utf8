The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Glitches in, kisses out at Games

  - Home ministry warns of long lines and checking problems        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 2: Please bear with the glitches, if any.        
	If this has been the unofficial theme of the Delhi Commonwealth Games, the home ministry gave it another outing today as it came up with a raft of guidelines for spectators a day ahead of the opening ceremony.        
	You may have to wait in long queues, the ministry warned visitors to the various Games events, since all the electronic card-readers may not work. Security personnel may therefore need to check the tickets and accreditation cards manually.        
	In case of manual check, wait in the queue may get longer. You are advised to kindly put up with the inconvenience patiently, say the guidelines.        
	Sources said the reason the e-readers at the venue entrances may not be able to read the tickets or accreditation cards is that the data banks had not been transferred into the machines.        
	The accreditation cards are part of the elaborate security arrangements, meant to ensure that the police have the identities of all the spectators. The fans have had to pay for their tickets through their banks, and each ticket-holder has been issued an accreditation card that carries personal details.        
	But the Games organising committee has been late in issuing accreditation cards and passes to several ministry officials and police officers, prompting the police to issue temporary accreditation cards to them yesterday.        
	Union home secretary G.K. Pillai had to move around with such a temporary card at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium where he attended a rehearsal yesterday.         
	A senior home ministry official sounded exasperated as he complained that though he had received the cards for himself and his family, he was still waiting for the passes to the opening ceremony that would have their seat numbers.        
	If I am an invitee, how can I and my family members stand at the venue for two hours to watch the proceedings? a senior official asked.        
	If the organising committee has been a little tardy in issuing cards and passes, it has been generous in issuing advice. The dos and donts it has released for spectators ask them to be prepared and dress appropriately according to the weather forecast, while banning them from bringing umbrellas into the stadiums.        
	Do not question, argue or misbehave with any police officer on duty. Do not show any dissent, the committee says. Follow directions in respect of venue code of conduct and house rules.        
	The last, sources explained, is euphemism for dont kiss in public.

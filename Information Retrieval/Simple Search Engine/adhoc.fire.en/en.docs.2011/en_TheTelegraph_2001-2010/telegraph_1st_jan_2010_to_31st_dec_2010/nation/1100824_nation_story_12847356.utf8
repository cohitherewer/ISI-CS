	New Delhi, Aug. 23: An and had threatened to stall the nuclear liability bill; now an or may help salvage it if the government agrees to a BJP suggestion.        
	Government sources tonight indicated willingness to consider the concerns of the BJP, which officially maintains that the latest amendment to the bills contentious Clause 17 (b) is completely unacceptable.        
	The BJP wants to strengthen a nuclear power plant operators ability to seek damages from a supplier following an accident, but the official amendment approved by the cabinet last week appears to leave the suppliers with an escape hatch.        
	Under the amended clause, the operator must prove the supplier had an intent to cause nuclear damage  it wouldnt be enough to argue the equipment and materials supplied had patent or latent defects or sub-standard services.        
	The BJPs stand is that unless a supplier is a wilful saboteur, intent would be impossible to prove. It has proposed making intent only one of the grounds, but not the only one, for an operator to seek damages.        
	The amended clause would force an operator to prove the nuclear accident had resulted from an act of (the) supplier or his employees, done with the intent to cause nuclear damage....        
	The BJP has asked for an or to be inserted between employees and done so the operator doesnt need to prove that a supplier had deliberately wanted to trigger an incident.        
	BJP sources said the party wanted a return to the parliamentary standing committees proposals that asked the government to spell out clear-cut liability for the suppliers.         
	The standing committees draft is the best so far, said Arun Jaitley, leader of the Rajya Sabha Opposition.        
	Science and technology minister Prithviraj Chavan, tasked by the Prime Minister to create a political consensus over the bill, met Jaitley and his deputy S.S. Ahluwalia today.        
	Another idea that came up at the meeting was that the word intent should be removed from the clause and woven into the contract between the supplier and the operator.        
	Clause 17 (b) has undergone three formulations during the bills tortuous journey. One, contained in the original draft, forced an operator to prove a wilful act or gross negligence on a suppliers part and an intent to cause nuclear damage.        
	The and created a furore  because gross negligence should be easier to prove than intent  and the Centre dropped it.        
	The second formulation was suggested by the standing committee, which said wilful act should be deleted and gross negligence made an independent ground for an operator to sue a supplier.        
	The third and last formulation was the latest amendment that did away with both wilful act and gross negligence, leaving intent as the sole ground for recourse.        
	Chavan told The Telegraph the third formulation is distilled from the wisdom of the first and the second but added: We are willing to look at anything and accept any modification within the framework of the three formulations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 10 metres from blasted track, express stops
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      10 metres from blasted track, express stops
          G.C. SHEKHAR                          Protests against Mahinda Rajapaksas visit in Bangalore. File picture                                  
	Chennai, June 12: An express with 2,000 passengers stopped 10 metres from a spot where the tracks had been blasted by an alleged pro-LTTE group protesting Delhis reception to Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa earlier this week.        
	This mornings sabotage is the first such act of subversion to have occurred in Tamil Nadu in a long time. It couldnt succeed because the Tiruchy-Chennai Rockfort Express had been slowed down by the rail authorities after drivers of the previous train that passed the stretch almost an hour before had reported a jolt.         
	Three feet of tracks had been blasted at the site in Villupuram, around 160km from Chennai. The police said a crude bomb, triggered by a long, wired fuse, had been used, possibly with the culprits hiding behind a tree.        
	A hand-written note, signed by brothers of honourable Prabhakaran (the slain Tiger chief), was found near the tracks condemning the red-carpet welcome given to Rajapaksa. We condemn the support extended to him by the Indian and Tamil Nadu governments in exterminating the Tamil race. Tamils, our silence cannot be tolerated any longer, the note said.        
	The station master of Perani station had given go-slow instructions to officials at the previous station, Mundiyambakkam, after the driver of the Mangalore-Chennai Express reported the jolt while passing the section.         
	When the Rockfort Express crossed Mundiyambakkam, its driver Gopalnath Rao was alerted. Rao reduced the speed by almost half to around 40km an hour, and told his assistant to keep a close vigil on the tracks ahead. Soon, the assistant driver spotted the missing tracks ahead, prompting Rao to apply the emergency brakes. It would have been a huge disaster if the train had crossed the stretch, said railway DIG Pon Manikavel.        
	The DIG said the blast was probably triggered after the Mangalore Express had crossed the point. It was a coincidence that the Mangalore Express driver had felt some jolt, unrelated to the blast, and reported it. This proved providential, Manikavel said.        
	K. Rudrapandi, the Perani station master who put Rockfort in go-slow mode, was relieved. I followed the routine protocol of sending a cautionary signal when a driver complains of abnormality on the tracks. I am happy my approach helped save lives.        
	Rockforts Chennai-bound passengers reached their destination at 11.30am, six hours behind schedule, by the same train after the track was repaired. It gives me a shiver even now that we were just a few feet away from disaster. Hats off to the railway staff for being so alert, V. Priya of Nagapattinam said at Chennais Egmore station.         
	She said the railways had provided stranded passengers like her refreshments. Train services between Chennai and the states south were disrupted for hours but were restored late this afternoon.        
	The police have launched a hunt for the perpetrators. It is a disturbing development and may lead to a crackdown on pro-LTTE groups, especially the fringe elements, said a senior intelligence officer.         
	Till now, there had only been heated rhetoric by the pro-LTTE groups against Rajapaksas visit. This is the first time their protests have taken the form of an act of subversion endangering the lives of innocent citizens.         
	The M. Karunanidhi government has so far chosen to ignore pro-LTTE demonstrations, arguing it is better to let such groups let off their steam. But todays sabotage could prompt it to crack down on the outfits.        
	There is little public support for the LTTE after it was blamed for Rajiv Gandhis 1991 assassination. A pointer to this was the muted response to Prabhakarans killing last May. Even mainstream parties such as the MDMK and the PMK have failed to drum up support for the Tigers or their cause of creating a Tamil Eelam.

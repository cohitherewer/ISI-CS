The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Speaker   in fresh truce bid
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Speaker   in fresh truce bid
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Meira Kumar                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 27: Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar is likely to call an all-party meeting this week in an effort to break the House-crippling standoff over the demand for a JPC probe into the 2G spectrum row.        
	Sources in the Speakers office said Kumar was keen to speak to key leaders of all parties to break the logjam.        
	The move comes against the backdrop of fears that the deadlock, which almost wiped out the winter session of Parliament, could spill over to the budget session from February. Last week, the Speaker had appealed, like she had done several times in the recent past, to all parties to find a solution and allow Parliament to function. Dialogue is the only way to get a solution, Kumar had said at a programme in Calcutta.        
	Kumar had reminded MPs about their responsibility as elected representatives. Democracy doesnt always have tailor-made situations. Meeting grounds sometimes dont seem to exist. Its the duty of the MPs to find a way out.        
	Sources said Kumars latest attempt to reach a truce could take the shape of a breakfast, luncheon or dinner meeting.

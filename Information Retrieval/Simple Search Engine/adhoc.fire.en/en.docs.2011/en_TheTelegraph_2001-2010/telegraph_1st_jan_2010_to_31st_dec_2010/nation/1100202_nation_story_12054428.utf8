                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cool Rahul loses temper
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul Gandhi addresses a Dalit convention at Bodh Gaya on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Patna, Feb. 1: The young Amethi MP is known as Mr Cool in his party. But Rahul Gandhi lost his temper when a student asked him to explain assaults on students and workers from the Hindi heartland in Maharashtra, where his party leads the government.        
	By heaping praises on students from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the Nehru-Gandhi scion landed in a virtual trap. The students from Bihar and UP are virtually ruling the country, as maximum number of IAS and IPS officers come from these two. Then why arent they coming to guide politics in their own states? Rahul said at LN Mishra University in Darbhanga, inviting youths to join politics.        
	During the interaction followed by his speech, a student asked: Rahulji, please explain why the students and workers from Bihar and UP are being targeted in Maharashtra?         
	Visibly miffed, Rahul quipped: OK, leave this question and move ahead.        
	Rahul today came on a two-day visit to inspire Youth Congress members in the election year. In course of criss-crossing various districts, he interacted with the young leaders.         
	He is not scheduled to either interact with the common people or address any public meeting. He will have an interactive session with students of Patna Womens College tomorrow.        
	Rahul landed in West Champaran and headed for Bhittiharwa from where Mahatma Gandhi had launched the civil disobedience movement in 1918. He garlanded Gandhijis statue and went to Darbhanga where he briefly met the students of LN Mishra University.        
	He then went to Gaya where he interacted with the youth wing of the extremely backward class cell of the Congress before returning to Patna and interacting with Youth Congress and leaders at Sadaquat Ashram, the partys state headquarters.         
	Playing the youth card, Rahul asked Youth Congress members to popularise the Manmohan Singh governments programme in the state, scheduled to go to elections later this year.

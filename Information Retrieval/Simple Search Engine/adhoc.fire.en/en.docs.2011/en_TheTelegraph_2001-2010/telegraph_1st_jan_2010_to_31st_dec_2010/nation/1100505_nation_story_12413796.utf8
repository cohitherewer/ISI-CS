          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, May 4: An IPS officer was today arrested in connection with the alleged police killing of the only eyewitness in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case being probed by the CBI.        
	Vipul Agrawal, the SP of Gujarats Dahod district, was arrested along with a constable by sleuths of the state CID for his alleged role in bumping off the eyewitness, Sohrabuddins close associate Tulsi Prajapati, in 2006. Sohrabuddin was allegedly killed in 2005.        
	The CBI had sought the records of Prajapatis death but the CID had refused, saying it was in charge of the case. The arrest of Agrawal takes to five the total number of Gujarat IPS officers held so far in both cases.        
	Until January, when the CBI took over the Sohrabuddin case following a Supreme Court directive, police in Gujarat had denied allegations that Prajapati was killed in a fake encounter.        
	But now, state CID chief V.V. Rabari claimed the arrest of Agrawal was not sudden. We had evidence against him.         
	Rabari is among the six senior IPS officers summoned by the CBI last week in the Sohrabuddin case of 2005.

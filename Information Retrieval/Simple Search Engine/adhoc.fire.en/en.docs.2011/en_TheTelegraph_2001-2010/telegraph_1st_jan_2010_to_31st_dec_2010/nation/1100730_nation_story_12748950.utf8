                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cap on cancer quota on trains
                            
	New Delhi, July 29 (PTI): The government today said it has put a cap on the number of berths allotted to cancer patients under an emergency quota to accommodate VIPs after receiving reports that the quota was being used by the patients.        
	The limit was imposed after receiving references from zonal railways where they were unable to accommodate VIPs on self travel as the entire quota was being utilised by cancer patients, minister of state for railways K.H. Muniyappa told the Lok Sabha.        
	In a written reply, he said such instances came especially during the rush season leaving railways with no emergency quota.        
	Railways provide 100 per cent concession to cancer patients in sleeper and 3-AC classes. In 2-AC and 1-AC they enjoy 50 per cent concession. A similar concession is also extended to people accompanying them.        
	Muniyappa said instances of cancer patients utilising all quota have been reported mostly in trains bound for Mumbai.        
	On April 17 and May 6, the minister said, all the 10 emergency berths in 3-AC in the Lokmanya Tilak-Chhaptra Godaan Express were utilised by cancer patients while all the 24 emergency berths in the Howrah-bound Gitanjali express were reserved on April 9, 22, 23, 24, 28.        
	Incidents of quotas being entirely booked by cancer patients have also been reported in trains linking Mumbai to Guwahati and Hatia.        
	The minister said a separate quota for cancer patients was also available in some trains.

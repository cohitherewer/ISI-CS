          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Jaipur, Aug. 6: Money isnt everything  even for the countrys currency creator and custodian.        
	Officials at the RBIs Jaipur branch allegedly turned away cash-laden vans carrying Rs 92 crore and compromised the high-security consignments safety by letting it stay on the road for close to three hours today.         
	The reason: the policemen and bank officials escorting the fleet had arrived an hour and 15 minutes after the 5pm closing time to deposit the money.        
	The wait isnt over yet.        
	The vans are now cooling their wheels at the police lines in Shastri Nagar and could be there till Monday when the RBI office opens, said Jaipur range inspector-general B.L. Soni, who is now overseeing its security. Saturday is a holiday at the RBI, like in many central offices.        
	We reached the RBI late because of traffic jams on the highway, rain and a shortage of loaders (at one the banks from where the cash was picked up). We lost a lot of time. We requested the (RBI) officials to take the money but they refused, said Ram Rup, the police officer in charge of the convoy.        
	The cash, packed in 90 boxes, had come from three bank branches in Alwar, around 142km away, and two other places under Ram Rup. R.L. Meena, a State Bank of India deputy manager, accompanied him.        
	RBI officials could not be reached for comment, but sources said the central bank executives had refused to take in such a huge sum as the accounts for the week had already been sent to the Mumbai headquarters. Accepting the money would have meant counting the pile of cash and tallying the accounts again.

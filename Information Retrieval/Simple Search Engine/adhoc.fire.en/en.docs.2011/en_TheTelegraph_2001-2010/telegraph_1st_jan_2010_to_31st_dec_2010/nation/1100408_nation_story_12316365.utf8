          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 7: The Supreme Court today acknowledged that the income ceilings to get BPL ration cards was very low, but appeared to suggest it was for the government to raise the limit to realistic levels.        
	Nobody can dispute the fact that the problem is enormous. Given the fact that the purchasing power of money is so low, even if a familys daily income is Rs 30 or Rs 40, they should get BPL cards, the apex court said while hearing a PIL.        
	The current income ceilings, fixed by the Planning Commission, are Rs 17 per day for urban centres and Rs 11 per day for villages.         
	A government panel has recommended that the limit be hiked to Rs 100 per day.         
	The petitioners lawyer said the existing limits ensured that over 50 per cent of the poor do not get such cards.        
	The court has asked states and Union territories to send their views.        
	However, the court wondered whether it had the powers to order a hike. Isnt this more a policy matter? Revising the income limit would immediately bring in 10 or 12 crore more people into the system. That would involve a subsidy of Rs 1,000 crore or more. Someone has to assess its impact on the PDS, the bench said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat redirects glare to Alimuddin 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Karat redirects glare to Alimuddin 
          J.P. YADAV                      Prakash Karat. (File picture)                           
	New Delhi, June 2: Prakash Karat is known to be a diligent ten-to-six worker, turning up at AK Gopalan Bhawan at 10am and staying on till 6pm.        
	This morning, when votes for the Bengal civic elections were being counted, the CPM general secretary arrived a little earlier and appeared surprised to see television crew parked outside the party headquarters.        
	Why are you all here? You should be at Alimuddin Street. All the action is there, he was heard saying while stepping inside with the faint hint of a smile.        
	Otherwise a casual remark, but coming from Karat, usually not prone to idle chatter, the statement was loaded with political significance for a party struggling to reconcile the central and the Bengal lines.        
	Karats nonchalance towards the outcome of the civic elections in Bengal was read here as a spontaneous expression of his belief that the Left Fronts performance should be held responsible for the reverses in the state and not the decision of the central leadership to close the door on the Congress over the Indo-US nuclear deal when UPA I was in power.        
	Shaken by the initial flood of results in Calcutta and without taking a closer look at the picture elsewhere, some sources in the party said the civic election results had strengthened the dominant central line  toed by Karat  as the Trinamul Congress continued its victory spree despite not having an alliance with the Congress.        
	Those pursuing the Bengal line feel that a wedge between the Trinamul Congress and the Congress will help them hold onto power in Bengal. To achieve this, Bengal leaders are known to be keen on warming up to the Congress, a view known to be strongly opposed by Karat.        
	Now they (the Bengal leaders) have been proved wrong. It shows that anti-Left votes unite even if Trinamul and the Congress fight separately, claimed a CPM leader, indicating a fresh debate would start in the party and the issue could figure in the politburo meeting of the party scheduled later this week.        
	Other sources said the state CPM could point out that the full results suggested that Trinamul would not be able to capture Writers without the support of the Congress.        
	With Karat lobbing the ball to Alimuddin Street, it was left to politburo member Sitaram Yechury to defend the party in Bengal. But Yechury almost repeated what Bengal CPM secretary Biman Bose said in Calcutta.        
	We accept the verdict. Although we have failed to reverse the trend, we have been able to arrest the downslide since the last Lok Sabha polls and fared marginally better, Yechury said.        
	He refused to accept that it was a verdict on the performance of the Bengal government. It is a verdict on the municipalities, not on the West Bengal government, Yechury said, rejecting the demand for early Assembly polls.        
	Throughout the day, central CPM leaders tried to avoid giving reactions to the civic poll results. The disinterest or the desire to steer clear was evident as only a handful of central leaders such as Karat, Yechury, S.R. Ramachandran Pillai and M.K. Pandhe were present at the headquarters in Delhi.        
	Yechury, who arrived after Karat, sought to contest media reports that his meeting last night with Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee had a political agenda. It was a meeting with the finance minister. It had nothing to do with politics. There is no question of any alliance with the Congress, Yechury said, but did not clarify the financial aspect.        
	Thereafter, Yechury got busy with editorial matters of the CPMs mouthpiece. In the afternoon, international matters kept him preoccupied  he drove away to participate in a protest organised by the Left parties against the Israeli attack on a flotilla carrying aid for Gaza.        
	As reporters fretted and fumed in the hot weather, Karat stayed put in his AC office. He did not leave for home for lunch, which he usually does. In between, only trade union leader Pandhe came out, speaking on a swanky touch phone.         
	People have voted against the Left. The results are on expected lines. But Mamata Banerjee will have to wait for another year to test her strength, Pandhe said.        
	Karat stepped out of AKG Bhawan only after Yechury had spoken to reporters and most of the scribes had left. He refused to say anything on record.        
	Some other comrades who were constantly glued to television were heard saying that it was now impossible to reverse the trend in Bengal. We can only try to check the downslide, one of them said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Jan. 18: In an unprecedented incident in the history of Orissa High Court, an additional judge has been demoted to the rank of district judge.        
	Orissa High Courts full bench headed by acting Chief Justice I.M. Quddusi issued the demotion order of Justice L.K. Mishra and appointed him Kalahandi district judge.        
	The decision was taken on Saturday night after non-receipt of order from the Union law ministry confirming him as a permanent judge.        
	Sources said the Orissa High Court had earlier recommended for his removal on grounds of misconduct and misuse of official capacity in a selection test for subordinate judges. The high court, in a letter to the Chief Justice of India, had cited an inquiry by Justice Quddusi and recommended suitable action and reconsideration of the decision to appoint him a judge.                           
	The inquiry had revealed that he had wrongly increased the marks of two candidates. The error was detected when the interview board insisted on seeing the answer sheets of all the six candidates called for interview. Subsequently, the high court, in a notification, admitted the error and withdrew the notification announcing the results of the test.        
	During the inquiry, Justice Mishra had reportedly pleaded that the difference in marks may have appeared due to wrong dictation given to him, which was not cross-checked in good faith.        
	Meanwhile, Justice Patel has taken oath as a permanent judge of Orissa High Court on January 14.

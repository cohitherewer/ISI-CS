	New Delhi, March 2 (PTI): The railways are planning to launch smaller mineral water bottles at about half the price of the existing 1 litre ones, which cost Rs 12. The new 500ml bottles may cost between Rs 5 and Rs 7, railway sources said.          
	There are a large number of passengers who are interested in buying smaller bottles than the 1 litre Rail Neer bottle. Keeping their interest in mind, we plan to launch the smaller bottles, a source said, adding there was no logic in selling water at Rs 12 a litre when the Janata meal comes for Rs 10.

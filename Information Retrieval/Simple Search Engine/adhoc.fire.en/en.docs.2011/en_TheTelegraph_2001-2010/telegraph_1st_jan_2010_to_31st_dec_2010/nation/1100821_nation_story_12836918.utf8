The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mock session, with PM Lalu
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mock session, with PM Lalu
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: The Lok Sabha was today treated to the rare spectacle of a Prime Minister promising to fulfil all demands.         
	Only, the scene unfolded after the House was adjourned  in a mock session where Lalu Prasad played the Prime Minister.        
	The RJD chief has not made a secret of his desire to bag the countrys top job in the past. But today, he chose to don Santa Clauss coat for MPs unhappy with the quantum of salary hike and some other matters.        
	I was elected Prime Minister for today. We will see what is to be done tomorrow. I heard the views of the House and the peoples government decided to reject outright the bills cleared today. There was no Leader of Opposition as it was a national government, Lalu Prasad said after the special session was over.        
	Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasads fellow-traveller in many a political journey, was also there. He was declared Speaker, along with the BJPs Gopinath Munde, by the crowd of around 60 MPs.        
	Munde wasnt a let-down in the role: he promptly cut party colleague Maneka Gandhis speech short because of paucity of time.         
	Mulayam did his bit too, adjourning the session and asking the MPs to assemble tomorrow at 10am to decide the future course of action.         
	But the reasons for the mock session lay in the real session. The Yadav duo were unhappy, as were several BJP leaders, that the government had got the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill passed by voice vote because of the din created by MPs railing against the size of the pay hike.        
	Parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Kumar Bansal, who piloted the medical bill, reacted with derision to the mock session, dubbing it theatre of the absurd.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Haldia, Feb. 18: Citu workers locked up dozens of employees of a Tata company in Haldia today demanding higher dearness allowance, as labour trouble reared its head again in Bengals biggest industrial town.        
	The unrest followed a strike call by the CPMs trade union wing on February 24 at Tata Chemicals to press for higher wages for casual workers.        
	Sources said the developments were a fallout of the turf tussle in Haldia between defeated Citu strongman Lakshman Seth and sitting Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikari.        
	Sources said Citu activists locked up over 100 employees since 11 this morning in the offices of three industrial units at the port town of East Midnapore demanding Rs 1,000 as dearness allowances.         
	The three companies are TM International Logistics Ltd (TMILL), a joint venture of Tata Steel, IQ Martrade of Germany and NYK of Japan; and contractors Ripley Pvt Ltd Company and AM Enterprise.         
	About 60 employees of TMILL and Ripley were released around 8 tonight. The remaining 40, including a senior official of TMILL, were released around 9pm. TMILL managing director Dibyendu Bose later said the matter had been sorted out for today, but didnt elaborate.        
	Sources said AM Enterprise had recruited 184 casual workers about five years ago for loading and unloading cargo for TMILL, which has been operating a dry terminal at Haldia port, about 150km from Calcutta. AM Enterprise got the contract from Ripley for supplying casual workers.        
	Citu leaders said the casual workers had been demanding Rs 1,000 as dearness allowance. Denied Rs 1,000 as DA, the casual workers demonstrated today in front of the offices of the three industrial units, District Citu leader Sundarshan Manna said. But he denied that any employee had been locked up.        
	Ripley area manager Prasenjit Chatterjee said the Citu activists locked up our permanent workers without any notice. We informed the district administration.        
	However, Haldia sub-divisional officer Asita Mishra, who reached the spot with forces, had to retreat after the agitating Citu workers shouted slogans. District magistrate C.D. Lama said reinforcements were sent to the spot to bring the situation under control.        
	In another wage-related incident, about 200 permanent workers today struck work at the fertiliser unit of Tata Chemicals demanding implementation of a recent agreement on hiking salaries.        
	Haldia Petrochemicals, Mitsubishi Chemicals and Exide have all borne the brunt of the tussle between Seth and Adhikari.

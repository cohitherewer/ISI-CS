	New Delhi, Jan. 3: The Union home ministry has sought a report from Delhi police and the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) on the escape of three Pakistanis accused of abetting the terror attack on the Red Fort in 2000.        
	Abdul Razzaq, Mohammad Sadiq and Rafaqat Ali escaped from the custody of the Delhi police special cell on Friday while being taken for medical check-up before deportation to Pakistan through the Delhi FRRO.        
	A PTI report said Delhi lieutenant-governor Tejinder Khanna had ordered a magisterial probe and asked for a report within a week. The magisterial probe will examine all aspects of the incident, including the lapses on the part of the authorities, a top official said.        
	An alert has been sounded all over the capital and neighbouring states. Delhi police have announced a reward of Rs 50,000 for any information on the trio who escaped while being taken out for a meal in the crowded cycle market near Jama Masjid.        
	The police questioned the owner of a restaurant near Jama Masjid and a Delhi police sub-inspector who was escorting the Pakistanis in connection with the escape, believed to have taken place at the restaurant.

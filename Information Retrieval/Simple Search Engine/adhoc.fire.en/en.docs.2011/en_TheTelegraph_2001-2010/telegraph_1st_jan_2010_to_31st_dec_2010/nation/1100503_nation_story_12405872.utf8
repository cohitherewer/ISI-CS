          BARUN GHOSH                      Subrata Mukherjee                          
	Calcutta, May 2: The break-up in the alliance with Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress for the civic polls has left the Congress with two options: it could fetch a further humiliation for the party in the event of a washout at the hustings or its managers could use the development as an opportunity to revive the beleaguered organisation.        
	The Congresss decision to field 88 candidates after Mamata refused to offer it 51 of the 141 seats in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has not gone down well with a section of party leaders and workers.        
	While this section felt that the candidates were fielded in such a large number of seats to compete with Mamata without examining the ground reality, others feared a fresh exodus from the party.        
	We should compete not with Mamata but with the CPM. Taking this basic fact into consideration, it would have been better had we put up candidates for the 51 seats where we are confident of winning. Of the 51, we have our sitting councillors in 21, while in the remaining 31, we emerged second in 2005, a senior state Congress leader said.         
	Eyebrows are being raised in Congress circles at the way state working president Subrata Mukherjee was conspicuous by his absence from yesterdays media conference at the state Congress headquarters where another working president Pradip Bhattacharya announced the 88 candidates.        
	Mukherjee was also not found at the party office when the four district Congress presidents from Calcutta  Pradip Ghosh, Nirbed Roy, Santosh Pathak and Pranab Basu  sat on a hunger strike on Friday night to pressure the high command to allow them to release the list of party nominees.        
	I was hurt after the alliance with the Trinamul Congress broke up. It would have been politically wise for both the parties not to stick to their rigid stand, Mukherjee said tonight. He cited his preoccupations with other responsibilities for his absence from the party headquarters on the two occasions.         
	Mamata said Mukherjees sister Tanima Chatterjee, whom the Congress had already fielded as party nominee for Ward 87, had approached the Trinamul camp.        
	Subratadas sister Tanima, who has found mention on the Congresss list of candidates, has approached us to be our party nominee. We have nominated her for Ward 87, which was earlier represented by the former mayor, Mamata said.        
	Chatterjee was not available for comment, and Mukherjee said that he had nothing to say on his sisters decision. Tanima got married 25 years ago and so I have no nothing to say on her political decision, Mukherjee said.        
	A Trinamul general secretary claimed that at least six Congress workers who were enlisted as party nominees had sent feelers for switching sides.        
	Asked about the reported exodus from the Congress, working president Bhattacharya said: The exodus of party people is nothing new. We have seen such an exodus earlier also. But the Congress will remain despite the odds.        
	The Congress MP from Murshidabad, Adhir Chowdhury, justified his opposition to granting any seats to Trinamul in his district. Why should I offer any seats to her in the district where Trinamul has never had a councillor, let alone an MLA or MP? he said.        
	Another section of the Congress feels that the party should try to win at least 60 of the 88 civic seats with an eye to increasing its bargaining power ahead of the Assembly polls. These leaders are of the opinion that a 60-plus tally can be projected as a turnaround for the organisation.        
	It will not only help us revive the organisation but also bargain hard with Mamata for over 100 of the 294 Assembly seats, said a state Congress general secretary.

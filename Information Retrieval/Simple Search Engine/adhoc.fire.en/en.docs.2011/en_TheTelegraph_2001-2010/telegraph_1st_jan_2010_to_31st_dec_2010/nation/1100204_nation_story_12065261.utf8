          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Ajmal Kasab                           
	Bhopal, Feb. 3: A Madhya Pradesh IG has been removed from his post for allegedly glorifying Ajmal Kasab by urging his personnel to emulate the 26/11 suspects dedication, sense of purpose and quick-learning abilities.        
	Rajendra Kumar had repeatedly clarified that his remarks were meant only to encourage his force to improve their shooting skills by drawing attention to Kasabs abilities as a marksman, but the BJP government wasnt convinced. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan today removed Kumar as IG of the Special Armed Force (SAF), apparently after a nudge from the central BJP leadership to take action against the top cop.        
	Two days ago, during a shooting practice session, Kumar had dubbed Kasab a role model. Kasab had passion; he learned to shoot and handle modern technology within one month. One should have the same passion, he had said.        
	In his clarification aimed at dousing the controversy, the IPS officer had tried to explain the context in which his remarks were made, and pointed out that he had mentioned Sachin Tendulkars learning skills, too.        
	On the contrary, I was telling my men that only gun(s) and accurate (firing on) target can help policemen survive against terrorists and Naxalites. I had used Sachin Tendulkar as an example as well on how each time the master gets out, he watches (his dismissal) on video and then makes correction. Similarly, in target practice, policemen should see where they are going wrong each time they miss, the officer had said.        
	Before todays transfer, the chief minister had signalled that he disapproved of Kumars conduct and that his explanations were not convincing. Kumar kept saying he would love to see Kasab hanged at the earliest. There was no question of glorifying him. All I was conveying was that terrorists tend to be ruthless and accurate. Therefore our police personnel should be good at hitting the target. In most cases, there is never a second chance. My conscience is clean. I did not wish to hurt anyone, Kumar said in his clarification.        
	Sources said Chauhan decided to ignore Kumars arguments after the Delhi BJP brass conveyed to the chief minister that the officers remarks were nave and against the grain of all that the political leadership of the state stood for. State home minister Umashankar Gupta said Kumar had been attached to the police headquarters in Bhopal.

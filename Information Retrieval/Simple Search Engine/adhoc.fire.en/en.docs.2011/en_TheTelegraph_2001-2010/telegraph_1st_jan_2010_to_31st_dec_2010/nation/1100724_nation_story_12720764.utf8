The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Got a gadget gripe? Tweet it and fix it 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Got a gadget gripe? Tweet it and fix it 
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                            Shashi Tharoor and Konkona Sen Sharma				                                 
	Mumbai, July 23: Have a malfunctioning fridge or leaking washing machine?        
	Dont waste time calling up customer service again and again. Just tweet your grouse and watch the problem get fixed in a jiffy.        
	Provided, of course, you are a celebrity with tens of thousands of followers on Twitter.        
	Shashi Tharoor, used to his tweets creating rather than solving problems for him, has found this out to his surprise, as has actress Konkona Sen Sharma.        
	On Wednesday, the former junior foreign minister had posted his annoyance with Norton Security, a global anti-virus software solutions firm, on the micro-blogging site.        
	Hugely frustrated by Norton Security. Paid for amp; downloaded software, recd product key, but everytime I try to activate, am told key invalid, Tharoor wrote, tweeting an online public complaint that was open to all his 8.2 lakh followers to read.        
	Within two hours, Norton Security had contacted Tharoor and fixed the problem, earning swift praise from the MP.        
	The power of Twitter: my tweeted frustration with Norton elicited an immediate call from a wonderfully helpful support person who solved it. Many thanks to Beata Rozyczenko, a model of efficient, pleasant amp; constructive customer support (alas, shes not on Twitter herself), Tharoor tweeted.        
	Other celebrities too have realised that Twitter can be much more than an excuse to post casual comments, narrate humdrum experiences or wish ones fans good morning.        
	Konkona, who began tweeting since September 2009 and has 99,798 followers, had written on July 20 evening: Tata sky sucks! Not been working for three days and they refuse to fix it!! fail.        
	By next afternoon, Tata Sky had contacted her and fixed the problem.        
	3 days of customer care couldnt achieve what one tweet did! All Tata Skys up and running! Thanks everyone for the support and RTs, (re-tweets) the actress wrote.        
	The huge reach that Twitter offers has already redefined the rules of public relations and campaigns, helping organise political protests and expose abuse around the world. It even enabled Britains The Guardian newspaper to beat a court injunction not to publish a report, courtesy a single tweet from its editor that was circulated world-wide by an army of Twitterers.        
	Still, its new-found power to take care of personal problems has wowed many, like actress Shabana Azmi who replied to Konkonas post saying: Tweet ki duniya ZINDABAD!        
	However, it may not work, at least not so promptly, if you do not have the army of followers that the likes of Tharoor and Konkona do.        
	Bollywood director Kunal Kohli, who returned from a visit to London recently, had complained about how he was prevented from tweeting because BPLs data services were not functioning in London.        
	Having problems with BPL roaming on iphone for data services, hence the lack of tweets from london. frustrating our poor telecom services, Kohli tweeted on July 19.        
	But the director, who has only about 12,000 followers on Twitter, was still struggling with the data services when he boarded the flight back to Mumbai two days later.        
	Last heard, Kohli was wondering aloud on Twitter if the media would pick up the story against cellular data providers who charge fees for roaming but do not provide services.

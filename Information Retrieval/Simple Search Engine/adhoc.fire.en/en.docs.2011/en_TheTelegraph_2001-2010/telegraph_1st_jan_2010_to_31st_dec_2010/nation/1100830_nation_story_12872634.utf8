The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tihar cakes, a click away
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tihar cakes, a click away
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          A Tihar inmate at the iftar last week                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 29: Want to try out a Tihar Jail uniform or taste the prison food? Nows your chance.        
	You dont need to get arrested or even come to Delhi. All you have to do is log into your computer and pay a few bucks.        
	The uniforms you can buy, of course, are not prison wear but school uniforms for your children made by Tihar inmates. The food, from cakes to potato chips, will come from the prisons bakery.        
	All of it at rates cheaper than the market price, and all bearing the jails TJS (Tihar Jails) logo.        
	Brand TJS will be open for online shopping within a month from the jail website, tiharprisons.nic.in, a prison official said. The products are now available only at select outlets in Delhi.        
	The wares include wooden furniture, handicrafts, pottery, clothes and food such as bread, cakes, papad, peanut biscuits, potato chips, muffins and various kinds of namkeens.        
	Sunil Gupta, the jails law officer, told The Telegraph that the Tihar authorities decided to put the products online following a record turnover of Rs 11.5 crore in 2009-10, up from Rs 6.5 crore the previous year.        
	The sharp increase owed mainly to an order from the Delhi government for classroom desks for around 1,000 state-run schools, and a huge popular demand for the jails bakery products.        
	Going by the huge response, we have decided to go online where people can place orders for their choice of products. It will be a unique facility; nowhere else in the world are jail products sold online, Gupta said.        
	The price of each product will be mentioned on the website. People from across India and the world can place orders online. Initially, they have to make their own arrangements for receiving the consignments, Gupta said.        
	He added that plans were afoot to send the consignments to buyers homes across the country, but it would take some time.        
	The products have become a huge hit because of the quality and low price. Some foreign embassies, such as the British and Spanish embassies, too buy our products, mainly bakery items and handicrafts. Once the online shopping starts, they will help us send the consignments to buyers in their respective countries, Gupta said.        
	Of Tihars 12,000 inmates, only some 700 who have been sentenced to hard labour (rigorous imprisonment) work in the factory and the bakery. They are paid a stipend, and the revenue from the sales goes to the government. However, the jail work helps the inmates earn a living after release.        
	Some 300 prisoners got the chance to taste the bakery products last week when one of Tihars several jailhouses held the first-ever iftar on the prison premises.        
	The jail factory has three ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation) certificates for quality and environment management. The bakery has an ISO 9001 for quality, an ISO 14001 for environment-friendly operations and an ISO 18001 for health and safety.

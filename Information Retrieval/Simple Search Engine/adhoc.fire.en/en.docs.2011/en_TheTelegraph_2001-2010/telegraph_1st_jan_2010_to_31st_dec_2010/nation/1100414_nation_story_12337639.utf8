The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Three-month wait for Davy
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Three-month wait for Davy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 13: Kim Peer Davy, the alleged mastermind of the 1995 Purulia arms-drop, may be extradited to India within two to three months, a Union home ministry official said today.        
	The ministry source also claimed that Davy, if convicted by an Indian court, would serve his sentence in India.        
	A Danish justice ministry official, however, told The Telegraph from Copenhagen that India had agreed to let Davy return to Denmark to serve out his sentence if convicted by an Indian court.        
	Delhi had also assured Copenhagen that Davy would not be given the death penalty, the official added.        
	The senior home ministry official, however, claimed that Davy, if convicted, would serve his jail sentence in India. We have it on record. We have corresponded with Denmarks attorney-general on the issue.        
	The official said the legal process for the extradition would take two to three months. We expect him to be handed over to us after that.         
	Davy alias Niels Christian Nielsen alias Niels Holck has been a fugitive from Indian law ever since he and his associates dropped a cache of weapons, allegedly meant for the Ananda Marg sect, from a plane over Purulia in Bengal. He was arrested in Copenhagen on Friday, according to the Danish official.        
	The Danish official, who did not want to be identified, agreed that Davy could be extradited within a couple of months. He had appealed against the extradition in a district court. He can appeal against the district courts order in the high court or even the supreme court. The process may take a couple of months.        
	But he insisted that India had agreed to let Davy return to Denmark within three weeks of conviction.        
	The official said other conditions India had agreed to for the extradition include completing the case as fast as possible and access for Danish embassy and consulate officials in Delhi and Calcutta to the alleged arms-drop kingpin. Davy, too, can demand access to Danish diplomats whenever he wants.        
	CBI fresh trial        
	A CBI source in Calcutta said the agency would soon reopen the arms-drop case so that Davy could be tried afresh.        
	The Union government has instructed our department to make necessary arrangements so that Davys trial can start without delay, the CBI legal cell official said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          NDA supporters at the rally in New Delhi on Wednesday. Picture by Prem Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: The BJP revived its campaign against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after a hiatus and demanded he should either constitute a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to examine the UPAs scams or quit.        
	The party ratcheted up its demand for a JPC probe by rejecting the Prime Ministers offer to appear before the public accounts committee (PAC) headed by its senior leader, Murli Manohar Joshi.        
	Joshi, who was seated on the dais, did not speak, although his aides had said yesterday that he would.         
	A decision was taken that keeping the exigencies of time and peoples attention span, the number of speakers should be scaled down and that no former party president, barring L.K. Advani, would address the meeting. Joshi, Rajnath and M. Venkaiah Naidu were among those in this line-up.        
	Addressing the packed gathering at the Ram Lila grounds to flag off the NDAs nationwide agitation against 2G spectrum allocation, the Commonwealth Games, Adarsh Housing and a host of graft cases, NDA chairperson Advani sounded the war cry. The Prime Ministers post is not weak. He is endowed with a large mandate and endless rights. On behalf of the Opposition and the countrys aam admi, I appeal to him to respect their wishes, exercise his rights and set up a JPC. The governments non-acceptance of a JPC is a small part of our overall campaign. But you (the PM) have the right to break the deadlock (in Parliament), he said.        
	Justifying his renewed attack on Singh  who was his favourite target in the UPAs first tenure  Advani explained: In 2004, my charge was he did not exercise his rights as the PM. He waited for orders from 10 Janpath. After the 2009 elections, some friends said I was wrong in projecting him as a weak PM. But in such a situation (the run-up to A. Rajas appointment as telecom minister), he should have called a cabinet meeting and asked what should be done or he should have cancelled the appointment after the law and finance ministries objected to it.        
	Rajya Sabha Opposition leader Arun Jaitley said if the Prime Minister wanted to dissipate the cloud of suspicion hovering around him, he should either constitute a JPC to answer the Oppositions questions on the various scams or resign on moral grounds.         
	It is not just about 2G. Take the CWG. Only a Congress government can create a scam out of a prestigious international event. On the appointment of the CVC (central vigilance commissioner), the Prime Minister says he has nothing to hide. But can he say he had nothing to do with the appointment of a tainted person with a case against him? Why did you (the Prime Minister) look the other way when the telecom scam surfaced three years ago? he asked.        
	Jaitley justified the Oppositions hold-up of the winter session of Parliament and said: If the Opposition hadnt done it, Raja would have happily continued as a minister.        
	Sushma Swaraj, Lok Sabha Opposition leader, elaborated on the BJPs case for a JPC despite the Prime Ministers declaration he was ready to be questioned by the PAC. Joshiji is on the dais and he supported a JPC with the rest. The PACs mandate is limited. After the (Niira) Radia tapes, the ambit of the probe has been enlarged because the tapes prove that there is massive interference by the corporate sector in all the four pillars of our democracy, the legislature, executive, judiciary and the media.        
	The tapes have triggered a churning of our polity, our country. It is time for us MPs to reflect on whats gone wrong and a JPC is the best forum, said Sushma.        
	She countered the Congresss propaganda that the BJPs only reason for seeking a JPC was to grill the Prime Minister. No, that is not our intention. We want to keep the issue alive for people because each scam is dangerous, said Sushma.        
	But the rally didnt exactly connect the speakers with the people. There was scarcely any response to the rhetoric belted out except when Akali Dal representative Ratan Singh Ajnala referred to Sonia Gandhis foreign origin, saying she could not understand our problems. He was cheered wildly.

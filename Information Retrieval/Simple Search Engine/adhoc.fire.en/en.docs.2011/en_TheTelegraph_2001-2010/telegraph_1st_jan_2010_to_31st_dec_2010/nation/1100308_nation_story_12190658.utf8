	Jaipur, March 7 (PTI): Two tiger cubs were found dead today under mysterious circumstances in the Ranthambhore National Park in Rajasthan.        
	Carcasses of the two male cubs were spotted near a village in the north of the park, R.N. Mehrotra, the state chief wildlife warden said.        
	The cause of the death is not yet known but it does not seem to be like a case of poisoning, Mehrotra said.        
	Asked if it was a poaching incident, he said it was too early to draw such a conclusion. The carcasses have been sent for post-mortem.         
	According to a census conducted by the forest department in May 2009, there were 40 tigers in and around the park.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pak leaves India aid hand dangling
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    Shah Mehmood Qureshi (top) and SM Krishna                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 16: India awaits, with a creeping sense of annoyance, a Pakistani response to its $5-million aid offer for the devastation caused by flash-floods in the countrys northwest.        
	When external affairs minister S.M. Krishna had called his counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi last week to express grief and offer help, hed been told Islamabad would get back. There is an apprehension now that Pakistan may not take Indias helping hand and rely, instead, on the UN-led international aid effort.        
	Close to 1,500 people have died and hundreds of thousands have been left injured and displaced by the recent floods, considered by many the biggest natural calamity to strike Pakistan in decades. The response has been a global relief effort which, according to some estimates, will exceed $500 million.         
	Indias response to the humanitarian crisis in Pakistan was markedly delayed and critically remarked upon by some international aid agencies and the chatterati in Pakistan.        
	 However, sources here aware of its neighbourly responsibilities in Paksitans hour of crisis and the delay in making a formal aid offer was merely procedural.         
	Indeed, New Delhi appears keen to take the moral high ground on the issue suggesting that its offer is entirely humanitarian and stands in spite of Indias stated displeasure with Pakistans tardy progress on punishing those responsible for the Mumbai terror attack and dismantling the Pakistan-based terror infrastructure.        
	Indias offer has to be understood as entirely in the spirit of compassion and solidarity, a source said, adding that India was willing to upgrade its aid package should Pakistan respond positively to the offer. The floods have done colossal damage in Pakistan and as a neighbour, we genuinely want to help. $5 million is only an initial offer, we are ready to help with more.        
	Asked whether India would consider routing its aid through the UN package in case Pakistan did not respond, the source said: Let them come back to us on our offer.         
	The sources recalled that India had dispatched a huge aid package during the 2005 earthquake in Pak-occupied Kashmir.         
	Pakistan had accepted relief material  three trainloads, 45 truckloads and one air sortie  but spurned the $25-million cash package which went unavailed.        
	Pakistan has also not got back to India on whether it would accept a court deposition by the Investigating Officer in the Mumbai attack case via video-conferencing.         
	New Delhi has not been told by Pakistan yet whether video-conferencing is acceptable.        
	 Sources indicated New Delhi was averse to physically sending police or court officials to Pakistan to depose before their courts.

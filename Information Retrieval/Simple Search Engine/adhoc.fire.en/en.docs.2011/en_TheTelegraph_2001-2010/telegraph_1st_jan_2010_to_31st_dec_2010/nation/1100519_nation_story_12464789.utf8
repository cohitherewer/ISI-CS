          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, May 18: Indias historic right to education law has placed the future of the countrys Kendriya Vidyalayas and other central schools under a cloud of uncertainty, leaving the government divided on whether to retain their unique character.         
	Sections of the human resource development ministry want the current mandate of these schools to be wound up, while others argue that they must be allowed to continue, top government sources have told The Telegraph.         
	HRD minister Kapil Sibal is understood to be personally in favour of retaining the current mandate of these central schools, but a section of his ministry is against seeking exemptions for the institutions.         
	The debate on the future of these schools is a direct outcome of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, implemented from April 1 this year.         
	Section 13 of the act bars all schools from subjecting the child or his or her parents or guardian to any screening procedure. The section punishes those who infringe with a fine of Rs 25,000 for the first violation and Rs 50,000 per infringement subsequently.         
	The countrys central schools all currently violate this section  because they largely select students either through a national test or based on their parentage.         
	The over 1,000 central schools across the country represent Indias largest public school chain and were started to principally cater to the wards of central government employees in transferable postings.         
	Today, the central schools have a clear priority list  children of transferable central government employees get higher priority than state government counterparts who still rank higher than ordinary citizens.         
	The Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNV), nearly 600 across the country, were started in 1985 when P.V. Narasimha Rao was HRD minister, to provide meritorious students from rural backgrounds the best standards of schooling.         
	These are residential schools and each year conduct a national examination to select students.         
	The bar on any admission scrutiny under the act means the government will either need to seek exemption from the law for these central schools, or will have to end their current mandate.

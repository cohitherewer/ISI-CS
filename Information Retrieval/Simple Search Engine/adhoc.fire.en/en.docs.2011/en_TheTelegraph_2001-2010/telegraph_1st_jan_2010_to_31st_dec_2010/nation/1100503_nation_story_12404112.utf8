          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 2: Continuing their attack on government establishments, Maoists last night blew up a school building in Koraput district, damaging it severely.        
	Around 9.30pm, a group of 50-odd rebels, including women cadres, swarmed the Dhepaguda Girls High School in Narayanpatna block of the district, around 350km from here, and used improvised explosive devices (IED) to blow it up.         
	The Naxalites first asked local people taking shelter in the building to leave the campus with their belongings and then triggered three explosions.        
	In another development, Gajapati police today succeeded in arresting two hardcore Maoists and recover a huge cache of explosives from their possession. The duo  identified as Manas Maji and Gullu Pradhan  were arrested during a joint combing operation by SOG jawans and CRPF at Pallapadu forests in the district        
	Twenty-five detonators, a huge quantity of fuse wire, starters and single barrel rifles have been seized from their possession, said superintendent of police Sanjeev Arora, adding that both were members of the Bansadhara committee of the outlawed CPI(Maoist).         
	While Majhi was involved in a series of rebel attacks, including torching of buses and blowing up phone towers in Gajapati district, Pradhan was a Maoist informer.        
	Meanwhile, Maoist cadre Manika Kumbruka (19) surrendered before Rayagada police. Manika was a self-styled deputy commander for the Maoist chief Azads team and commander of the Jangudi Dalam of CPI(Maoist). She was also involved in several Maoist attacks, including the Nayagarh attack, the police said.        
	The rebel has also confessed to her involvement in torching two OSRTC buses in December last year, Rayagada superintendent of police Anup Krishna said.         
	Besides alleging torture in Maoist camp, Manika apparently said she was also fed up seeing Maoists killing poor innocent villagers.         
	She also did not like the Maoists wearing CRPF uniforms and harassing women, she added.

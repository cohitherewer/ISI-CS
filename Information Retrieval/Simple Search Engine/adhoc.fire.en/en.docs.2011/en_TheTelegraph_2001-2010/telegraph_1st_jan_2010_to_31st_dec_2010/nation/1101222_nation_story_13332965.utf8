                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Gujjar quota protest   hits trains
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Jaipur, Dec. 21: Gujjars in Rajasthan disrupted rail and road traffic for the second day today demanding the agreed 5 per cent reservation in government jobs and declaring they would not budge till they got it.        
	The protest hit the Delhi-Mumbai rail traffic.         
	Thousands of Gujjars are squatting on the railway tracks in Pilukapura village near Bayana in Bharatpur district, 173km from Jaipur in the bitter cold, saying this is the last fight for reservation.        
	Colonel (retd) Kirori Singh Bainsla, spearheading the movement, has appealed to his community to bring the state to a halt through chakka jam. This is our last fight for the 5 per cent quota we have been promised, he said.        
	After 68 deaths in two violent Gujjar agitations, the Vasundhara Raje government in 2008 promised Gujjars and Gadiya Luhars an additional 5 per cent reservation under a special category identifying them as the most backward among the other backward classes without disturbing the SC/ST/OBC list.         
	The quota covered government jobs and educational institutions.        
	The Raje regime, under fire for allowing the agitation to snowball, also announced a separate quota of 14 per cent for upper castes in an election year.        
	Rajasthan now has a total reservation of 68 per cent, among the highest in the country, which has come under legal scrutiny as it is way above the 50 per cent cap set by the Supreme Court.         
	In 2009, Rajasthan High Court ordered an interim stay on the 5 per cent quota for Gujjars and the 14 per cent quota for the economically backward upper castes. The case is on and a hearing is scheduled tomorrow.        
	Train delay        
	Fourteen long-distance trains on the Mumbai-Delhi route were today diverted because of the Gujjar agitation in Rajasthan and will arrive six to eight hours late at their destinations, Western Railway officials said.         
	Three other trains were rescheduled, and two were short terminated.

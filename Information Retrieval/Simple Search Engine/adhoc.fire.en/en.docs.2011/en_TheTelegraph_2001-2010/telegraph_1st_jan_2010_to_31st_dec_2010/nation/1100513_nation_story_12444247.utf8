The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gadkari flunks test

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      Gadkari                          
	New Delhi, May 12: Nitin Gadkari has flunked the first big political test he faced after taking over as BJP president.        
	Sixteen days after Gadkari and his colleagues withdrew support to the Shibu Soren-led government in a huff and then suspended the decision almost as swiftly, no resolution seems in sight.         
	Every deadline the BJP set for itself has passed without the party making any headway.        
	Now it is learnt that if the Sorens  Shibu Soren and his son Hemant  insist on sharing the chief ministers post for the remaining term, Gadkari is not averse to accepting the arrangement.        
	When the parliamentary board that sat on April 28 decided Soren must be dumped, Gadkari nodded in assent. His predecessor, Rajnath Singh was not present.         
	Rajnath, an old Jharkhand hand, was reportedly aghast when he heard about the decision and quickly prevailed on Gadkari to reverse it, especially when Hemant had dangled the top posts bait before the BJP. Gadkari went along with him.        
	The BJP might reconsider its position on having a rotational arrangement. The rethink set in after Hemant told Rajnath and Ananth Kumar that the JMM would not accept a chief minister from the BJP for the coalition governments remaining tenure.         
	The BJP would have to share the post with the JMM, he reportedly stressed.        
	A highly placed source involved in the negotiations with the JMM and its constituents said Gadkari had started sounding out L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj, Murli Manohar Joshi and other parliamentary board members on reversing the earlier decision against a time-sharing pattern for the top post. He is speaking to them individually, the source said.        
	Apparently, the JMM conveyed that its support to the BJP will not be unconditional. It will depend on whether it would accept the rotational formula. We cannot reject it outright, maybe there is merit in their demand, the source said.        
	But the vacillation has sucked Gadkari into the vortex of the BJPs internal power play.         
	While he may not be a direct catalyst, he has revived the rivalries that beset the party since 2004.         
	In appointing Gadkari  largely an unknown quantity RSS chief Mohanrao Bhagwat had hoped to stem the factionalism.         
	When the flurry of statements and counter-statements, flung by Arun Shourie, Yashwant Sinha and Jaswant Singh stopped, it looked like Bhagwat might well attain his objective.        
	No such luck, not after Jharkhand.

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: The Union home ministry has offered the Bihar government helicopters to aid in the hostage crisis though Nitish Kumar has not publicly sought the choppers or any additional troops from the Centre.        
	What role the three BSF helicopters will play is not clear. Sources said the choppers may be used to assist forces from Raipur, Chhattisgarh, if Nitish asks for them. One chopper was flown to Lakhisarai from Ranchi yesterday.        
	The Maoists are believed to be in forests of the Kharagpur range of hills covering Lakhisarai and Munger districts of Bihar.         
	Sources said officials in North Block were in touch with senior police officers in Patna to keep a watch on the situation. We have offered two more helicopters (besides the one already in Lakhisarai) and Cobra teams if the state needs assistance, but till now they have not asked for it, a home ministry source said today.        
	The sense in the central security establishment was that Nitish should have given the go-ahead to an operation at least to build some confidence among people. Otherwise, he will see the effect in the coming elections, said a source.        
	The home ministry is circumspect on making any statement on giving assistance to Nitish because of minister P. Chidambarams non-committal stand on Wednesday. He has not asked for assistance yet, Chidambaram said. You should ask Nitish Kumar, he has to take a decision. Whatever decision he takes, we will support (him).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP retains hold on business district

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 2: The Trinamul Congresss sweep across Calcutta has largely left untouched Burrabazar, the citys business district, where the BJP has retained its support base.         
	Two BJP candidates  Meenadevi Purohit and Sunita Jhawar  retained Wards 22 and 42 respectively, defeating Trinamul Congress candidates. In Ward 23, newcomer Bijoy Ojha wrested the seat from the CPM nominee. Burrabazar has seven wards. The Congress and the CPM have won two while Trinamul retained the remaining.        
	The victory of our three candidates proves that our party has not lost its relevance in Calcutta, said state BJP president Rahul Sinha.        
	Purohit and Jhawar have been winning since 1995. In 2000, Purohit became deputy mayor in the Trinamul-controlled civic board.         
	First-timer Ojha has defeated sitting CPM councillor Bharati Jha.         
	Malay Majumdar, who as BJP candidate had won Ward 96 (comprising a part of Jadavpur and Bijoygarh on the southern fringes of the city) in 2000 and 2005, this time retained the ward but as a Trinamul candidate.         
	But barring Calcutta, the BJP has not performed well in the other 80 civic bodies across Bengal, where, according to Sinha, the party has won only 10 wards.

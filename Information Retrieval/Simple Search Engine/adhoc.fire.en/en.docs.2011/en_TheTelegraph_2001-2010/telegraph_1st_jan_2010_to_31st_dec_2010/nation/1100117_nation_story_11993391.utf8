	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 16: Advisor to the Prime Minister on public information, infrastructure and innovation, Sam Pitroda today asked the state-level task force on higher education to come up with a concrete plan of action and convincing proposals.

	Stating that he was quite impressed with the efforts of the taskforce, he promised all support. Come to Delhi with concrete proposals and I will extend all support and help, he said.        
	The telecommunication expert stressed on the need for bringing broadband to the panchayat level for expansion of knowledge base and asked the taskforce and Orissa government to make efforts in this direction. We need to expedite the process of development through knowledge. Technology is vital, he said.        
	Pitroda advised the taskforce to expand the higher education sector by setting up new world-class universities.

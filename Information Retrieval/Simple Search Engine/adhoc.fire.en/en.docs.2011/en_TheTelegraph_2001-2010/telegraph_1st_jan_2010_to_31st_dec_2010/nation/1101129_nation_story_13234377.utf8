  - Gender divide on cohabit case; NGO ire at detestable term         OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                           A still from Salaam Namaste. The romantic comedy starring Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta is about a live-in couple who part after the woman refuses to have an abortion. The film, however, ends happily                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 28: Two Supreme Court judges could not agree on whether a man, who had lived with a woman for nine years and had two children with her, was guilty of tricking her into believing they were married so that she would cohabit with him.         
	Interestingly, the division was on gender lines.         
	Justice Markandey Katju felt that the conduct of Ram Chandra Bhagat, convicted of the offence under Section 493 by a trial court and Jharkhand High Court, was immoral but not illegal. Justice Gyan Sudha Mishra said an offence under Section 493 was clearly made out.         
	The case has been sent back to the Chief Justice and will now be placed before a three-judge bench.         
	Section 493 states that any person, who by deceit causes any woman not lawfully married to him to believe that she is lawfully married to him and to cohabit with him in that belief, shall be punished with 10 years in jail.         
	Bhagat had cohabited with the woman, whom he met her in 1981, for nine years and they had a son and a daughter. Thereafter, it was alleged that he turned her out of his house.         
	The woman, Sunita Kumari, claimed he had promised to marry her and even executed an agreement to this effect. Bhagat disputed the agreement.         
	Justice Katju said that when the woman herself had said Bhagat had assured her he would marry her, it was obvious she was not under any belief that she was married to him. So Section 493 would not apply, he said.         
	It is true he has not behaved like a gentleman. He lived with the complainant for nine years and had two children by her, and hence as a decent person he should have married her. However, there is a difference between law and morality, the judge said. There are many things which are regarded by society as immoral but which may not be illegal.         
	Justice Mishra did not agree. She said the couple had filled up an application for information to the special marriage officer, Lohardaga, under Section 5 of the Special Marriage Act. This notice of intended marriage was given in April 1982.         
	In addition, she said, the accused had also executed an agreement for a marriage certificate on June 4, 1982, on a stamp paper where he admitted he was living with the complainant as a married couple for a year and that she was his wife.         
	The judge said though no marriage ceremony took place, according to the social custom prevailing in Lohardaga district among members of the Oraon community, if a young man lived with a young woman in his house for a long period, she was deemed to be his wife.

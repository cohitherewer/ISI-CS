          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, June 10: Die-hard communists will love this  corporate houses are going to have one foot in the grave.        
	The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has invited non-government organisations and big companies to adopt and develop graveyards under a scheme titled Fund Your City.        
	According to the plan worked out by cash-starved local bodies, the companies will operate under a develop-maintain-operate model to protect the large number of graveyards in the city from encroachments and also overburdening.        
	A grave in Chaderghat in the Old City was found to have four layers of bodies.        
	Till now corporate houses in Andhra Pradesh have been involved in developing or maintaining parks, schools, public toilets, community halls and heritage buildings, but this is the first time their participation has been sought in adopting graveyards, now managed by local ward committees.        
	GHMC commissioner Sameer Sharma said the objective was to protect Hyderabads graveyards, some of which are 500 years old and have graves of British soldiers, African cavalrymen and Persian artists. One grave is that of a Chinese cook of the seventh Nizam, Osman Ali Pasha, who ruled from 1911 to 1948.        
	The GHMC area, spread over 175sqkm, has about 1,200 burial grounds. Some 2,300 burial grounds dot the Hyderabad Metro Development Authority spread over 600sqkm.        
	The corporation has already sent letters of intent to the corporate houses and NGOs. Under the plan, the NGOs and corporate bodies can collect user charges. But they wouldnt be able to exploit the graveyards commercially, like setting up advertisement towers and boards.        
	According to the project, the agencies and corporate houses will be allowed to take up infrastructure development in the graveyards, like construction of storage rooms for ashes, bathrooms and other amenities for relatives, and halls to perform rituals.

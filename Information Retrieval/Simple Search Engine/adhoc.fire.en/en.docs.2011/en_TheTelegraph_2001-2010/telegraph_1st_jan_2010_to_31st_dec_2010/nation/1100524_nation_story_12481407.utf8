                          H.S. Ahluwalia                    
	May 23 (PTI): H.S. Ahluwalia, the co-pilot of the Air India Express plane that crashed yesterday, would have become a commander by this month end, the airline said today.        
	Ahluwalia, with 3,750 hours of flying experience, was due for commandership this month, Arvind Jadhav, Air India chairman and managing director, said. The promotion would have enabled Ahluwalia to fly a plane on his own.        
	His death was a shock to us. He was not a raw pilot, an untrained pilot, Jadhav said.        
	Ahluwalia had 66 landings to his credit at the same airport. The 41-year-old had been serving as co-pilot for 15 years.        
	The bodies of Ahluwalia and airhostess Tejal Kamulkar were brought to Mumbai this afternoon. Ahluwalia and Kamulkars families stay in Mumbais Andheri and Thane areas.        
	Sujata Survasi, the other airhostess to die in the crash, was also from Andheri. Her body has not been brought to Mumbai yet.         
	Family members of Ahluwalia and Kamulkar were present at the airport today.         
	Kamulkar, 24, had started her career in the aviation industry with Air India only four months ago.        
	Father Anil, who was at the Mumbai airport, said: We are shattered. We are yet to come to terms with her death. Thorough investigation should be conducted to establish the cause of the crash.

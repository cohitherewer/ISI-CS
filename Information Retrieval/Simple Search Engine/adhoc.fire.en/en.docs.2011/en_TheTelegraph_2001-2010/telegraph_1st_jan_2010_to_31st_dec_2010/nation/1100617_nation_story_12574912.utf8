          OUR BUREAU                              
	Imphal/New Delhi, June 16: Gauhati High Court today directed the Centre and the Manipur government to remove the economic blockade on the Imphal-Dimapur (NH 39) and Imphal-Jiribam (NH 53) highways.        
	Sources said the Centre had asked the Nagaland government to urge its civil society groups to request Naga students in Manipur to lift the blockade on NH 39. It has also decided to permanently station two battalions of paramilitary forces along the route.         
	The sources said convoys carrying supplies of essential commodities were expected to reach Manipur on Saturday morning.         
	The All Naga Students Association of Manipur (Ansam) is yet to lift the economic blockade imposed on the highways since April 11, though the Kohima-based Naga students Federation has suspended its blockade on the plying of Manipur vehicles in Nagaland since 5pm yesterday.         
	The court passed the order to remove the blockade after the Union home ministry and the Manipur government submitted action-taken reports on reopening the highways.         
	In its report, the Centre has said that it is taking initiatives to get the blockade removed through peaceful negotiations.

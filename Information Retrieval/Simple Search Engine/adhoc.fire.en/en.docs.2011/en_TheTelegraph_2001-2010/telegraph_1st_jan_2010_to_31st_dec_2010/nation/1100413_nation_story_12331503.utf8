The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Students stir on for basic rights
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Students stir on for basic rights
  - Govt turns blind eye to School for visually challenged          PRIYA ABRAHAM                          A student outside the school                                        
	Bhubaneswar, April 12: Seven computers are available but none of them work. A Braille printer exists but it is defunct. Five teachers are struggling to meet the sanctioned strength of 12 at Bhima Bhoi School for the Blind.        
	About 12 students have been sitting under the blazing sun here for the past 10 days to voice their protest against such problems.         
	These boys have locked up classrooms to squat on campus determined to make the state take note of their fight for basic rights of good education and food.        
	Although, on the direction of the school authorities, parents of 82 other students have stopped their wards from protesting, a handful of students agitating against the poor quality of food and extremely poor teachers strength are still hopeful that their stir will prompt the administration to act.        
	When students in all other special schools get Rs 750 as monthly diet allowance, students of this blind school  which comes under the department of mass education  receive Rs 500 per head.         
	About 75 per cent of teachers posts are vacant in the school and there is no Braille textbook, said a student.        
	We are being taught with tape recorders. How can one study without textbooks? rued Sarat Maharana, another student.         
	Since Monday, when the agitation began, a number of officials have visited the school to assure students that their problems will be solved.        
	While director of secondary education Dharanidhar Nath had asked the principal to file an FIR against the students, disability commissioner Kasturi Mohapatra asked students to have patience and call off the strike as the best possible was being done for them.        
	Meanwhile, minister of school and mass education Pratap Jena said that the process was on to hike the diet allowance from Rs 500 to 1,500 per student.         
	But the students refused to budge.         
	Not this time. We will not quit our agitation till our demands are met. On many occasions, we were promised the moon, but nothing was done. This time we need a written assurance, said Biranchi Sahoo, a student.        
	We dont care what happens to us. We have decided to go on a fast. Let us see if the administration bothers to help us, he said.         
	Orissa Blind Association Secretary Sanyas Behera expressed anger.        
	The government is violating all existing norms on teachers appointment. While teachers for these schools should possess certificate of special education, untrained teachers and staff are being appointed, he rued.

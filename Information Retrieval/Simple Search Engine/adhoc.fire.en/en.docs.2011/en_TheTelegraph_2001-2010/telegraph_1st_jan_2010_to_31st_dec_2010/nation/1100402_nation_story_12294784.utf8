          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 1: National security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon today said the time had come for India and China to take the next step in resolving their boundary dispute, the remarks coming days before the foreign ministers Beijing visit.        
	Both countries can now actively consider together the next steps in the evolution of our bilateral relations, evolve a detailed framework for the resolution of the boundary issue in a manner that is politically feasible for both leaderships, Menon told a seminar to mark 60 years of relations between the two nations. Menon, a China expert and former foreign secretary, is Indias special representative on the boundary dispute.        
	External affairs minister S.M. Krishna and foreign secretary Nirupama Rao will be in China from April 5 to 8, with sources saying there was a possibility of forward movement on the dispute during the visit.        
	The two countries have found a modus vivendi to deal with the fact of the boundary issue and to manage their different approaches to issues where their peripheries overlap, Menon said. Asia and the world, he added, had enough space for both India and China to grow.         
	In 2003, after a series of confidence-building measures since 1970s, the two countries had decided to entrust the boundary issue to special representatives. In 2005, India and China established Guiding Principles and Political Parameters for a boundary settlement.         
	Menon said neither India nor China can afford misperceptions or distortions of policy caused by a lack of understanding of each others compulsions and policy processes.

          ARCHIS MOHAN                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: The UK has debarred for the time being nearly 60 of its education providers popular with students from South Asia after sniffing an immigration racket.        
	The education providers decide which student should get a visa to enter the UK under a points-based system launched last year. Till then, immigration officials used to take the decision.        
	The temporary ban came after concerns that the education providers had colluded with agents in the Indian subcontinent and were abusing UK student visa norms and enrolling poorly educated immigrants looking for jobs.         
	The education providers are being probed for abuse of assessment procedures and laxity in admitting students.         
	The UK Border Agency (UKBA), responsible for immigration and border controls, has temporarily removed the names of the education providers from its register of sponsors that lists all organisations the agency has licensed to sponsor migrant students.         
	As many as 2,000 education providers are on this list.         
	The move comes after a UKBA investigation revealed a sharp spike in the number of visa applications from north India, Nepal and Bangladesh.         
	The UKBA received 13,500 student visa applications between October and December 2009 when the number was 1,800 for the corresponding period in 2008.         
	It stopped accepting visa applications at its centres in New Delhi, Chandigarh and Jalandhar and also in Bangladesh and Nepal from yesterday. The spike in the number of applications is surprising for this has historically been a quiet time of the year for student visas, said an UKBA official.        
	Indias ministry of external affairs today confirmed the UKBAs move. ... the UK Border Agency is also investigating a number of UK education providers and has in the last week, suspended approximately 60 from the education sponsors register, said a ministry spokesperson.         
	Officials in the UKBA refused to divulge the names of the education providers under the scanner.         
	We are still investigating their role in the abuse of student visas. Their names will be permanently struck off the list if they are found guilty, said the UKBA official.

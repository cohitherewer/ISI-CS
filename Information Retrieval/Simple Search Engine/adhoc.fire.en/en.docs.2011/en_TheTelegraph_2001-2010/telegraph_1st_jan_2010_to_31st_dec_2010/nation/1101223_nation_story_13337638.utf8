                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Apology hope for Haneef
                            
	Melbourne, Dec. 22 (PTI): Australia is likely to apologise for wrongfully detaining Mohammad Haneef, who was accused of being involved in the failed Glasgow bomb plot, the Indian doctors lawyer said today.        
	Haneef had struck a deal yesterday with the government for receiving substantial compensation over the bungled case after two days of negotiation.         
	His lawyer Rod Hodgson said today that the Australian government had also agreed to issue a public apology reaffirming the doctors innocence, a report in the ABC said.         
	Im not sure precisely when its going to be publicised but you can expect that there will be a public apology to Haneef reaffirming his innocence, he said.         
	He said the financial settlement was substantial and Haneef was delighted with the deal. In return, Haneef has dropped a civil claim against the government and defamation action against former immigration minister Kevin Andrews, who had revoked the doctors visa after he got bail.         
	The amount of the compensation has been kept under wraps, and the government said the terms of the settlement could not be revealed because of a confidentiality agreement.

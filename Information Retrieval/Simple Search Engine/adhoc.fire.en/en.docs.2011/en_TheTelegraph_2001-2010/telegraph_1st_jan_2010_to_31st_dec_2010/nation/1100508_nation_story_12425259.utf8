          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, May 7: Orissa High Court has taken a serious note of media reports of 70 elderly people in southern Orissa losing vision in one or both of their eyes after undergoing cataract surgery at a free eye camp two months ago.        
	A bench comprising Chief Justice V. Gopalgowda and Justice A.S. Naidu took suo motu cognisance of the reports and decided to treat the incident as a public interest litigation (PIL). The court had issued notices to the state government yesterday asking the latter to submit a detailed report within one week on the veracity of the media reports.         
	The PIL will thereof be taken up for hearing, sources said today.        
	The alleged incident pertained to cataract operations conducted at a free eye camp organised by Trilochan Netralaya at Gunupur in Rayagada district between January 27 and February 2 in the first phase and between March 23 and 28 in the second phase.

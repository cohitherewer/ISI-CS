Four hundred armed   police personnel have   been deployed in the twin towns of Ayodhya and Faizabad a day ahead of the anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition.   Thirteen Uttar Pradesh districts including Faizabad, Lucknow, Varanasi, Aligarh, Bareilly and Gorakhpur have been identified as 
  sensitive.   Picture by Ritesh Yadav      
	Mumbai, Dec. 5: On the eve of the Ayodhya verdict in September, among the hundreds of security personnel who lined the streets of Mumbai and the religious heads who appealed for peace, another group kept its date with the event.         
	The mohalla committees, many of whose members had seen the citys violent face during the riots that followed the demolition of Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992, went from house to house in sensitive neighbourhoods to speak to families and allay any fear, panic or intolerance.         
	Created in April 1994, the objective of the mohalla committees was to maintain cordial relations between communities  mainly Hindus and Muslims  and between police and residents.         
	Though such peace committees are not new, the unique thing about the mohalla committees set up in Mumbai was that they comprised of ordinary people who wanted to live peacefully. It was also a way of maintaining a constant dialogue between the police and the people by sitting together and exchanging views in solving problems, said Satish Sahney, who was Mumbai commissioner of police in April 1994.         
	Sahney, along with former police commissioner J.F. Ribeiro, was among the initial few behind the mohalla committee efforts.         
	After the riots, there was complete lack of trust for the police among the people. But with this initiative we started anew, said Ebrahim Tai, 52, one of the facilitators of the mohalla committee in Pydhonie, an area that has neighbourhoods dominated by Hindus and Muslims on either side.         
	The mohalla committees, set up by the police in every chowki, have one meeting every month with the senior police inspectors. Here, members talk about issues concerning the area, ranging from the crime record to employment to drug abuse or pornography. Sometimes, they even solve disputes between spouses. They are especially geared into action on Ganesh Chaturthi and Moharram or other sensitive times, such as the tabling of the Srikrishna committee report on the riots or the terror attack in Malegaon.         
	However, members say the committees are no longer as active as before. The police have stopped issuing peace committee cards to members after reports of misuse.         
	But for many, the mohalla committees were the platform where they made a beginning in addressing social issues.         
	Khatoon Sheikh, 53, is president of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, a womens rights group that offers free legal advice to women and provides them with opportunities in education and jobs. She recalls her early foray into social activism through the mohalla committee.         
	People used to think the committee members were informers for the police. We were wary of being called that among our own people. Yet, we had seen violence and wanted to bring about harmony together and it was through the committee that we could meet people and understand their real issues, said Sheikh.         
	The Mohalla Committee Movement Trust, which works independently as well as in collaboration with the police on social issues, has also made the shift.         
	Maria Ishwaran, facilitator of the Andheri East committee, said: We realised we couldnt keep talking about communal harmony all the time. There was peace in the area, but families were restless.         
	So, from a cricket for peace tournament to projects addressing womens grievances, the group is back to working at the grassroots.

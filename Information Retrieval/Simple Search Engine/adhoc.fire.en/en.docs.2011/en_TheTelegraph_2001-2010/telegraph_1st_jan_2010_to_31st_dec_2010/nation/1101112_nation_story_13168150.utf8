The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PC visit before Bodo joint hunt

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                         Chidambaram    
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: Union home minister P. Chidambarams one-day visit to Guwahati tomorrow will herald joint operations against the NDFB anti-talks faction.         
	Sources said the minister would be accompanied by P.C. Haldar, the interlocutor for negotiations with the NDFB, Ajay Kumar Yadav, officer-on-special-duty, and Sambhu Singh, the joint secretary (Northeast) in the Union home ministry.        
	Sources in the ministry said the killing of 23 people this week had compelled the government to go all out against the rebels and hunt them down. We are constantly in touch with the state government on this, a source said.         
	The latest killings are an indication of the failure of the state government to act on specific inputs that the NDFB could strike. They have also shown the Union home ministry in poor light.         
	The army, along with the police of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, will conduct joint operations on the border of the two states against NDFB militants.         
	The arrest of its chairman, Ranjan Daimary, had raised hopes that the faction would be rendered toothless but the killings proved that his henchmen would continue to attack civilians and security forces.         
	Haldar is also expected to meet Daimary in jail and find ways to neutralise his associates still at large. Some of his associates are believed to be in hiding in Bangladesh from where they coordinate operations in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

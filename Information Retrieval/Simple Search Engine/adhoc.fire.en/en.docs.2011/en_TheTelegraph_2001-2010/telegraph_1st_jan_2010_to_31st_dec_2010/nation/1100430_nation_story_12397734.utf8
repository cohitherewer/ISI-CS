The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left in fix to walk out or not
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Left in fix to walk out or not
          J.P. YADAV                       Gurudas Dasgupta                          
	New Delhi, April 29: The two Left leaders rose to walk out, then they sat down.        
	After all, it wouldnt have made good political sense to be seen marching out with the BJP, especially two days after the Left had voted with the main Opposition party on cut motions.        
	So better sit down and not be counted.        
	The drama unfolded in the Lok Sabha today after finance minister Pranab Mukherjees reply to the debate on the finance bill.        
	Signalled by BJP leaders, the CPMs Basudeb Acharya and the CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta rose in unison with MPs of the main Opposition after Sushma Swaraj announced her party would walk out to protest the decision not to withdraw the duty hike on fuel and fertilisers.        
	But the two leaders held their step at the last minute, in what appeared to be a desperate attempt to salvage the Lefts secular image.        
	Acharya was seen holding back a visibly reluctant Dasgupta, and they both sat down.        
	The Left, however, walked out later after moving amendments to the finance bill.        
	Asked why he stayed put after being ready to walk out with the BJP, Dasgupta told The Telegraph: There was a decision to walk out but not to walk out together (with the BJP). I stayed back to press my amendments.        
	Earlier, even as the finance minister was replying to the debate, Dasgupta was seen writing a slip and sending it to Sushma, the leader of the Opposition in the House.        
	As Dasgupta and the BJP leader sat in different blocks, the slip had to pass through the hands of Shiv Sena MP Anant Geete and the BJPs Shahnawaz Hussain to reach Sushma.        
	Then Dasgupta and Sushma were seen exchanging glances.        
	The Left leaders efforts to get Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and RJD boss Lalu Prasad to also join them in the walkout failed. Acharya, who was seen talking to Mulayam, said the Yadav leaders were not interested.        
	He, however, boasted that the BJD, the Telugu Desam and the ADMK had marched out with them.

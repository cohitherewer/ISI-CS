The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CBI quiz looms on Raja 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CBI quiz looms on Raja 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       A Raja                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: The CBI could soon question former telecom minister A. Raja and his aide R.K. Chandolia on the 2G spectrum allocation, sources said today.         
	Sources in the CBI said investigators have completed their homework on the case, which included transcribing over 5,000 tapped telephone calls between corporate lobbyist Niira Radia and others. Some of these calls reportedly contain references to the spectrum allocation.         
	The CBI is yet to fix dates for questioning Raja and Chandolia, who had served as his personal secretary in the ministry.         
	Last week, in an oral submission to the Supreme Court, CBI counsel K.K. Venugopal had said the agency would try to complete its investigation within three months.         
	Raja, who resigned as telecom minister on November 14, has said he is ready to face CBI interrogation in the matter.         
	Chandolia, who has already been questioned by the Enforcement Directorate, was sent back from the telecom ministry to his parent department of Indian Economic Services after Kapil Sibal replaced Raja.         
	Highly placed government sources repeated today that central vigilance commissioner P.J. Thomas could quit before Mondays Supreme Court hearing, when a public interest litigation questioning his appointment is likely to be accepted.         
	Thomass resignation would save the government embarrassment but will also mean that he will lose immunity from prosecution. Investigating agencies will then not need the sanction of the department of personnel and training  pending for nearly 10 years  to prosecute him in the alleged Kerala palmolein scam.         
	Leak inevitable: PC         
	Home minister P. Chidambaram today said Niira Radias tapped phone conversations should not have been made public but that some of this is inevitable.         
	See, what was recorded was a conversation of a person suspected to have violated tax laws. Now we were not recording the other end. We were recording one end and it so happened that the other end peoples conversation were recorded, he said in his first public comments on the leak.         
	Chidambaram was the finance minister when the Central Board of Direct Taxes had sought the home ministrys permission to tap Radias phone.         
	When there is major scam or a major tax violation, if such conversations are recorded, I dont think anyone should leak it out. But, I am afraid, some of this is inevitable, he said, speaking on the sidelines of a government event.         
	Industry leader Ratan Tata has filed a petition in the Supreme Court, asking for a directive to the Centre to probe the leak, which he says breached his privacy.

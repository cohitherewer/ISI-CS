          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 31: A citizens committee led by a retired high court judge today sought the chief ministers intervention and immediate halt to the controversial common corridor project in Kalinga Nagar and stringent action for police brutality on the tribal protesters.        
	Justice Chaudhury Pratap Mishra and other members of the citizens committee said they had met the victims of police brutality and saw extensive damages caused to their house and other property during their visit to Kalinga Nagar yesterday.        
	Yesterday, there was a clash between police and the tribal protesters, who opposed construction of the common corridor project.        
	While the tribal protesters had pelted stones on the police, the latter used rubber bullets and teargas shells to disperse the mob.        
	The citizens committee, however, claimed that about 30 to 40 tribals had sustained bullet injuries in the police action. Of them, 25 people were treated by the doctor accompanied by the committee, while four critically injured persons were admitted in the hospital.         
	There has been no effort by the administration to treat the injured. People dont wish to go out for treatment for fear of torture and arrest, said Justice Mishra.        
	Deployment of 29 platoons of armed police, two platoons of NSG, 70 police officers and seven magistrates said it all about the atmosphere of police terror prevailing in the area, he said.

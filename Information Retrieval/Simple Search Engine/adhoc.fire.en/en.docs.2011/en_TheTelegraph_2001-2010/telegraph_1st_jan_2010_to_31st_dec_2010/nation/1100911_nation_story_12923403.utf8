          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: The IIT council could not agree on a new format for the joint entrance examination (JEE) that will reduce multiplicity of entrance examinations for engineering and discourage students from going to coaching classes.        
	The HRD ministry had in February set up a committee under IIT Kharagpur director Damodar Acharya to suggest changes in the existing IIT-JEE format. The committee has suggested a two-tier pattern to admit students. It said students who pass Class XII should appear in an aptitude test and later an add-on test. While 70 per cent weightage should be given to their Class XII marks, 30 per cent weightage should be given to the aptitude test in drawing up a list of eligible students. The top one lakh students can then be called for an add-on test.        
	However, the council could not agree on the add-on test. While IIT directors supported it, members like Govardhan Mehta and T. Ramasami, secretary of the department of science and technology, opposed it on the ground that the problem of multiplicity of exams would remain.        
	There were also divergent views on the weightage formula since the evaluation system varies from one state school education board to another.        
	Ramasami said his department has evolved a suitable percentile formula to select students for the INSPIRE scholarship for science. The council today set up another committee under Ramasami to suggest a suitable JEE format within three months.

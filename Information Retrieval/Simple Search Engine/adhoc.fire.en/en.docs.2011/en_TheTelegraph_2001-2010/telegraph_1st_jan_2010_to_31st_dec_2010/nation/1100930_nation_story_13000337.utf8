The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Demonised CM finds a miracle man
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Demonised CM finds a miracle man
          BASANT RAWAT                           AI Saiyed, the retired cop                                  
	Ahmedabad, Sept. 29: A retired Muslim IPS officer has turned out to be a miracle man for Narendra Modi who has been desperately trying to build bridges with the community.        
	Come next month, A.I. Saiyed will be one of the BJPs 12 Muslim faces when six civic bodies go to the polls in Gujarat.        
	Its an honour, said Saiyed, who joined the BJP just after his retirement on the eve of last years Lok Sabha elections. I had not asked for a ticket, it was offered, he added.        
	The former additional DGP (administration), the second most powerful post after the state police chief, has already delivered once. He was instrumental in winning over Muslim voters during the Kathlal bypoll earlier this month, helping the BJP wrest the Assembly seat from the Congress for the first time since Independence.        
	The going wasnt smooth at first, as Saiyed faced resistance from his community. But eventually, he managed to convince his community by focusing on development, one of the riot-tainted chief ministers main poll planks.        
	If Modi later publicly claimed that 65 per cent of Muslims voted for the BJP, he was, in fact, acknowledging the role played by Saiyed who camped there for a week and campaigned for the party.         
	Now Saiyed has been handpicked by the chief minister to contest from Sarkhej, in Ahmedabad.                  Narendra Modi      
	Sources say if Saiyed, an upper-caste Muslim from Mehsana, Modis home district, is able to pull off an encore, he could even become mayor of Ahmedabad.        
	But there are some who say Saiyed may not win from Sarkhej. The reason: Muslims in Kathlala, central Gujarat, did not suffer during the 2002 riots. But Juhapura, which is part of Sarkhej, was one of the worst hit.        
	Certainly, it is not going to be a cakewalk for Saiyed unless he is able to sell Modis development agenda to the people of Sarkhej where there are no civic amenities, said rights activist Hanif Lakdawala.        
	The riot-affected people still remember those days, said Juhapura resident Anwar Sheikh.        
	But ask Saiyed, and he says if there is one person who can change the destiny of the minority community, it is Modi.         
	The chief minister, he added, is too much demonised and maligned  contrary to what I know him.

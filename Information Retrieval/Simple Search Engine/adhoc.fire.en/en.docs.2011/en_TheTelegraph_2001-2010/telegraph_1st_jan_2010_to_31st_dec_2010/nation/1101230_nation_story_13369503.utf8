          BARNALI HANDIQUE                               
	Guwahati, Dec. 29: Three women, one of them the vice-president of the BJPs city district unit, were arrested today for assaulting a Mizo girl yesterday morning.         
	The three  Juri Das (the BJP office-bearer who also runs a Guwahati-based NGO), Monimala Das and Mini Das  were later released on bail, a senior police official said.         
	The 23-year-old girl from Mizoram, who was here to attend a wedding, was assaulted when she knocked on the door of one of the accused at Nabagiri for directions after apparently losing her way while returning to the private guesthouse where she had put up.         
	Instead of helping her, the accused, along with two other women and an unidentified man, hit the girl, accusing her of being inebriated, sources said. The women also took away her purse and mobile. Then they called up some media persons and when they arrived, beat up the girl again. Later, the women handed the girl over to police.         
	But after taking stock of the situation, the police refused to arrest her. Instead, they handed her over to the caretaker of the guesthouse. The women were arrested after the caretaker filed an FIR at Chandmari police station yesterday evening.         
	The officer in charge of Chandmari police station, R. Buragohain, said: The Mizo girl was attacked when she sought help, asking for directions. We booked the three women under Section 143/325 of the IPC.         
	BJP spokesperson Dilip Saikia today said the party suspended Juri Das following instructions from its state unit president, Ranjit Dutta.         
	Several social activists and organisations condemned the incident.         
	The girl was a guest in the city and instead of being hospitable, these women attacked her for no fault of hers. One of the accused claims to be a social worker but how can she work for the cause of women if she herself assaults another woman?, Sumitra Hazarika, a woman rights activist, said.         
	Hazarika said the girl had to be hospitalised yesterday but was released today. She was, however, too traumatised to speak to anyone, she added.         
	Juri Das while admitting that she was involved in the incident alleged that some sections of the media had instigated them to beat up the girl.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Forbidden unity plays on Yechurys lips
   Cong backs peace rally          SANJAY K. JHA                          Mamata Banerjee at the Lalgarh rally on Monday.   (Pradip Sanyal)                                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 9: The Congress today publicly supported the Lalgarh rally, suggesting it had shed its discomfort over Mamata Banerjees approach to Maoists.        
	The Congress argued that all engagements with the Maoists or their sympathisers could not be suspended if the Centre wanted peace restored.        
	The party leadership usually plays it safe when asked to comment on Mamatas approach to the rebels, saying it does not speak for other parties. Today, spokesperson Shakil Ahmed said: We could not attend the rally despite an invitation because we had our own August 9 functions. But we extended our moral support to the rally.        
	K. Keshava Rao, the Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs, had received the invite but skipped the rally to attend a Congress meeting in Tamluk. He went a step further than Ahmed.        
	What moral support? I even extended good wishes for the rally. Any move that is in quest for peace and denounces violence will receive our support, he said over the phone.        
	Asked if he endorsed Mamatas indirect criticism of the home ministry for the killing of Maoist leader Azad, he said: We have supported the rally and cannot comment on everything that was said there.        
	Ahmed too avoided commenting on the Azad issue. I cannot react without analysing Mamatas speech in its totality, he said.        
	On suggestions that the rally had the Maoists support, Ahmed said: Our information is that the rally has been organised by intellectuals, writers, poets, artistes and eminent citizens of the society.        
	Reminded that the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, which openly supported the rally, was pro-Maoist and the intellectuals involved were rebel sympathisers, he said: But the rallys purpose was to ensure peace.        
	Asked if the Congress backed Mamatas line on the Maoists, he said: We want a holistic approach. If the Naxals have a genuine grievance, it should be addressed. If they have a perceived grievance, that perception should be removed. Our efforts should be to bring the Maoists into the mainstream. If they want to discuss peace, wheres the problem in that?

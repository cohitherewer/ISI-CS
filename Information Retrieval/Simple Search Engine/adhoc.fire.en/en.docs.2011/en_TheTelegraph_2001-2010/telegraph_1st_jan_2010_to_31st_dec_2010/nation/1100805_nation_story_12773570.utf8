          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Aug. 4: Love your liquor? Want a good ambience to booze in without having to jostle for space among drunks? Hyderabad may be the right place for you.        
	The Andhra Pradesh government has issued new guidelines for setting up more bars and retail liquor outlets in the state in proportion to the population in big cities, small towns and villages.        
	This is the first time the excise department, which regulates liquor sales and distribution, has rolled out such a policy. Sources said Andhra revenue secretary Ashutosh Mishra had issued the order under pressure from the liquor industry that has set steep sales targets to recover the crores spent at licence auctions in June last year.        
	Under the new guidelines, a municipality with a population of over seven lakhs can have a bar for every 12,000 people and a liquor retail outlet for every 10,000. If the population is between three lakhs and seven lakhs, it is legal to have one bar per 20,000 people and a retail shop for every 15,000 people.        
	Likewise, a municipality with a population of three lakhs can have a bar for every 30,000 people. A gram panchayat with 50,000 people can have two bars and three liquor shops.        
	At the moment, Hyderabad has 470 bars and 350 retail outlets catering to its 2001 census count of 75 lakh people. Each of the shops has between five and 10 belt shops or mini outlets.         
	With the citys population expected to touch 95 lakhs under the latest census, Hyderabad can add that many more to get the ratio right.        
	In comparison, Calcutta has 206 bars (including those in hotels, clubs, restaurants and pubs) for a population of approximately 51,38,208. The figure roughly translates to one bar for every 24,942 people.        
	The Andhra government has been under pressure since the liquor licence auction in June 2009 to create avenues for the industry to increase sales and recover their investment. Nearly 6,500 licences were then auctioned for a whopping Rs 7,000 crore.        
	Although the state excise department last year introduced belt shops and allowed liquor retailers to set up mini outlets, the industry has been grumbling that existing infrastructure is inadequate to increase sales.        
	How can the liquor industry survive after bidding at such high licence fee rates if new bars and outlets are not set up? asked Hiralal Samaria, the excise commissioner.        
	Last year, the Andhra government had earned Rs 12,000 crore in sales tax on a liquor industry turnover of Rs 25,000 crore. The target for 2010-2011 is to mop up Rs 17,000 crore in taxes.        
	A government spokesperson said one of the reasons for permitting the setting up of bars was to reduce accidents on highways. Since dhabas often doubled as belt shops and provided highway travellers free access to booze, the number of car crashes had gone up, he said.        
	The Telugu Desam Party has demanded withdrawal of the new guidelines. Desam chief N. Chandrababu Naidu has alleged that the government is trying to make everyone an alcoholic. Left organisations are agitating against bars and liquor outlets in rural areas.

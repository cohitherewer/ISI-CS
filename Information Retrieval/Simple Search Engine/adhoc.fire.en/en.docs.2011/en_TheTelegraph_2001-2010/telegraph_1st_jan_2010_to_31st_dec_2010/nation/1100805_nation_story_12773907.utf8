          A STAFF REPORTER                          A masked Telugu Deepak after his arrest                                  
	Calcutta, Aug 4: Arrested for flexing muscles, Maoists and their sympathisers are flexing their grey cells in jail, in intellectual pursuit though.        
	While Maoist leader Telugu Deepak is learning Sanskrit and painting at Alipore Central Jail, four rebels lodged in Midnapore Central Jail are preparing for Madhyamik.         
	B.D. Sharma, the additional director-general of prisons, said at Writers Buildings today: We have appointed a Sanskrit teacher for Telugu Deepak. Four rebels who are preparing for Madhyamik will appear for it with 76 other undertrials and convicts lodged in various jails in the state.         
	Sharma said another undertrial in Calcutta, Prasun Chatterjee, was preparing for MA exams in history.         
	The police officer said the four Maoists  Sukhshanti Baskey, Lalmohan Tudu, Dhriti Ranjan Mahato and Prasanta Mahato  had been given books. Their exam fees would be given from the prisoners welfare fund, he added.        
	Sharma said that last year, only seven inmates had appeared for Madhyamik. All of them passed. Special initiative was taken this year to encourage eligible candidates to appear for the exam.         
	The welfare fund was mainly raised by organising cultural shows in which the inmates participated, Sharma said.        
	Retired teachers have been engaged to teach the inmates for free. An NGO is helping police to recruit the teachers.         
	Sharma said the jails department had made arrangements to impart vocational training to at least 60 undertrials arrested from Jungle Mahal. Sharma said vocational training included carpentry and other handicrafts.

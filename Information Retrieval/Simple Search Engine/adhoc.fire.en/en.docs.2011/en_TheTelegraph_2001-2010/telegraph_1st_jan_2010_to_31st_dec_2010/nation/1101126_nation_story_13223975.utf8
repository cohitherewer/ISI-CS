The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong waits for Sonia shake-up 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong waits for Sonia shake-up 
          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: The Bihar debacle has brought into sharp focus Sonia Gandhis reluctance to act tough on the organisational front with many leaders pointing to the delay in constitution of the working committee as one stark example.        
	The AICC meeting after the completion of the organisation polls earlier this month was called with the specific purpose of electing the working committee members.        
	But no election took place and the party authorised Sonia to constitute the 24-member highest policy-making body. Senior leaders had said the exercise would be completed before the AICC plenary in December.        
	But the apprehensions among some entrenched players that they could be adversely affected in the shuffle prompted them to delay the constitution of the CWC.        
	Although going to the plenary with the old team will be an oddity, there are enough hints that the organisational shuffle had been put off for the new year.        
	This exercise, in which ministers with the dual charge of AICC general secretaries were to be replaced with full-time office-bearers, was originally supposed to be held soon after the 2009 parliamentary elections.        
	The delay shows how some leaders managed to preserve the status quo despite Sonias intentions to set the house in order. Many general secretaries who joined the government in May 2009 entreated her to be relieved of the party work but the shuffle did not happen.        
	General secretary Mukul Wasnik, who was given the difficult task of handling Bihar, is also a minister in the Manmohan Singh government. Prithviraj Chavan, who has been sent as Maharashtra chief minister, held several portfolios, including the demanding job of minister of state in the PMO in addition to being general secretary in charge of Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana.        
	Some leaders feel persisting with such arrangements for over a year either demonstrates lack of talent in the party or the high commands apathy towards pressing issues.        
	The appointment of new state presidents, too, has been pending. Although some states got new chiefs recently, many have been waiting for the decision. For instance, Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee president Pradeep Balmuchu resigned soon after the Assembly elections last year but the ad hoc arrangement is still continuing.        
	In the AICC media department, no replacement was given for the most experienced spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi who was shunted after the Kerala lottery controversy. This impacted the partys communication system so badly that cabinet minister Kapil Sibal had to be drafted in to defend the government in the 2G spectrum controversy and Sonia herself had to step in to confront the BJP on corruption.         
	Sources said Sonia was always hesitant in taking tough decisions. An analysis of the high command structure for the last 10 years shows most organisational shuffles have just been musical chairs, with the same faces getting different responsibilities again and again.        
	Her inability to create new and younger leadership has forced the party to muddle along with jaded or incapable leaders.        
	The fate of organisational apparatus in states has been no better.        
	Now the Bihar results have come as a shock and demoralised party workers throughout the country.        
	One leader said workers from Madhya Pradesh have been complaining to Sonia about the pathetic state of the organisation. They have warned her several times that the state was another Bihar or Uttar Pradesh in the making. But the state continues to be in the hands of Suresh Pachauri, who is eager to return to Delhi politics for a year now.

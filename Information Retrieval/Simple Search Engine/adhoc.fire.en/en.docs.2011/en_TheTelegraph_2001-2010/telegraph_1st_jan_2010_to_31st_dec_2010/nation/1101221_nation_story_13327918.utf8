The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM willing, but PAC needs permission   By convention, committee cannot summon ministers
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      PM willing, but PAC needs permission

	New Delhi, Dec. 20: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today declared he was ready to appear before the Public Accounts Committee investigating spectrum allocation, but by convention the committee does not summon any minister.        
	Murli Manohar Joshi, who chairs the PAC, would have to seek the Speakers permission if he wants to question Singh, according to rules in force since the 60s.        
	The BJP leader would not say today if he would do so. I will not say a word on it. He has offered but I have to get a communication in writing before I take a call on it, he told The Telegraph.        
	The PACs hearings are held in-camera either in a designated room in Parliament or in the annexe building across the road. The Comptroller and Auditor General is always present and seated to the right of the chairman but conventionally does not ask questions.         
	The chairperson first puts the queries after which other members chip in. The CAG interprets and analyses the answers for the committee. It can meet even when Parliament is in session but usually the meetings happen between sittings.        
	In a sense, former telecom minister A. Rajas fate was sealed the day the CAG report indicted him for huge losses his policy and conduct had inflicted on the national treasury.         
	According to analysts of governance and public administration such as Krishna K. Tummela and K.K. Bharadwaj, there is no way the PAC can not endorse the CAGs conclusions.        
	The PAC and the CAG are together mandated to ensure that public money is spent as Parliament intended and that high standards of public morality are maintained. The operative phrase is that money has been spent within the scope of the demand that it has not exceeded grants nor been spent on anything not detailed in the original demand.        
	The PAC relies on the CAG for expert opinion it can use, through its reports to Parliament, to nudge the government to make amends.         
	The CAG is appointed by the President but is neither subordinate to the President nor to Parliament and holds an independent status enshrined in the Constitution.

	The PAC, on the other hand, is accountable to Parliament. Constituted every year under rule 308, it has 22 members  15 from the Lok Sabha and seven from the Rajya Sabha. A ruling party MP from the Lok Sabha used to chair the committee till 1967, when the norm was reversed to hand the post to an Opposition MP. No minister can be part of the panel.         
	In the 60s, C. Subramaniam who was then the steel and mines minister was asked to appear before the financial watchdog. The Speaker promptly tweaked the rule to read that his permission would have to be sought before a member of the cabinet was called.         
	It is not an inviolable rule because the Speaker can always change it. But the PAC cannot as a matter of right summon a minister, a former officer of the Lok Sabha secretariat said.         
	The rationale for the rule change was that ministers would not be able to add value to the PACs work because they usually end up making political statements and leave. Bureaucrats and professionals are better equipped to help out with details, the officer said.         
	The PAC can express disapproval or pass strictures against the ministry or department concerned for losses or extravagance, but it is not concerned with the larger policy issues.         
	Which is not to say, however, that the panel is ineffective. When Rajiv Gandhi was Prime Minister, he sacked railway minister A.B.A. Ghani Khan Choudhary after he was ticked off by the CAG and later the PAC.         
	However, the PAC under Joshi might not have much in store for Raja because the BJP leader has been advised to go slow by his party, which is pushing for a joint parliamentary committee probe. Should the BJP drop the JPC demand, it is possible Joshi will go full steam ahead as he did initially.        
	The PAC is tabling fewer reports now than it did in the past  compared to 62 reports between 1977 and 1979, it came out with 15 reports between 1999 and 2004.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Apex court frowns on village-shy doctors
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Apex court frowns on village-shy doctors
                            
	New Delhi, June 28 (PTI): The Supreme Court today ticked off doctors for their reluctance to work in rural areas and said they could not expect special benefits if they chose to enjoy the comforts of urban lifestyle.        
	People (doctors) are not willing to go to the rural areas. Unless there are incentives, how do you expect them to go to the rural areas? Those in the rural areas do not have any facilities, the bench of Justices R.M. Lodha and A.K. Patnaik said sarcastically. You (urban doctors) want to enjoy everything in the urban areas and do not want to serve in the rural areas.        
	The judges stayed a Karnataka High Court division bench order that said the work experience of doctors serving in the rural areas on a contract basis was not eligible for special weightage for postgraduate courses. A division bench of the high court had set aside a single judges order that had upheld the weightage for such doctors at the time of applying for postgraduate courses.         
	The weightage was meant for doctors working in the rural areas on contract who were subsequently absorbed into regular service.

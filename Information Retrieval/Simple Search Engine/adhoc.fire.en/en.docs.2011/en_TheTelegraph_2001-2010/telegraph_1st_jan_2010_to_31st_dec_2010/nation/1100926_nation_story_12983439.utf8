          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                      Friendly gesture                          
	Jaipur, Sept. 25: Two foreigners who had mistakenly forgotten their camera and a bag in a train in Jaipur got them back in less than 24 hours, thanks to the prompt action by tourist police and the honesty of a train attendant.        
	Polish tourists Dugmara and Arka Deuse had travelled from Delhi to Jaipur by a Shatabdi Express on Friday. By the time they realised that their camera and bag were still on the train, the express had chugged off towards Ajmer.        
	The Deuses informed the tourist police at the Jaipur station. Nir Singh Rathore, one of the officers, immediately informed the Ajmer tourist police.        
	The police in Ajmer found the camera and bag in the safe custody of train attendant Rajendra Pant.        
	After getting back their belongings, Dugmara said: We have been hearing about how tourists are usually duped and overcharged in India when we started on the trip. But what we have experienced is totally different. The promptness and helpfulness of the officials has been impressive.

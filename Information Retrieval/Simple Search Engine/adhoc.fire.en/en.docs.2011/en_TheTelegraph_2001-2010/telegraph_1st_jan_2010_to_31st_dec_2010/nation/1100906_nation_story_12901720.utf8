          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 5: The BJP today slammed the government for selecting a tainted official as the new head of the countrys corruption watchdog, saying it wanted to cover up its wrongdoings, especially those related to the Commonwealth Games.        
	Telecommunications secretary P.J. Thomas, an officer from the Kerala cadre, will succeed Pratyush Sinha as central vigilance commissioner.        
	It is shocking they selected a person whose name had figured in the palmolein import scam in Kerala in 1991-92, said BJP spokesperson Tarun Vijay. It hardly matters (that) his name was cleared later.

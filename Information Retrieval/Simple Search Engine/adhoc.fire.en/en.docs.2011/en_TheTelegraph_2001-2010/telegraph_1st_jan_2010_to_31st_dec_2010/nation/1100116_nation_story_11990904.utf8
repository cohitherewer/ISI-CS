The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shocked, SC cracks whip on trafficking 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shocked, SC cracks whip on trafficking 
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY AND OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 15: The Supreme Court today expressed shock that over 70 per cent of Indian sex workers were children, turning the spotlight on child trafficking, a problem endemic to areas such as north Bengal.        
	A two-judge bench urged the Centre to work out an effective rescue and rehabilitation scheme for sex workers, saying it would hear cases relating to their plight every Friday and keep issuing directives to the government.        
	You cant rescue them from brothels and leave them on the streets so they go back to their old profession, the court said. There must be proper homes for their rehabilitation.        
	The government must initiate action against those caught trafficking women and children, it added.        
	Most of the trafficked women are children. Their consent is immaterial. If you slap Section 376 (rape charges) against 10 persons they will get the lesson of their lives. Instead of punishing the traffickers, the trafficked are punished. Sometimes they even have the same lawyers, the bench observed.        
	The apex court was hearing a petition by a group of NGOs urging it to intervene against trafficking.        
	Although the court made non-binding observations today, it indicated it would issue directives to the government at some point and continue to monitor their implementation.        
	We have had enough research and documentation about the problem in the last 10 years. Now, we must act, the bench said.        
	In north Bengal, hardly a day passes without some complaint of abduction of children, or attempts to do so, with the intent of trafficking. The gangs main target are the tea gardens, mainly the closed or sick ones, in the Terai and the Dooars.        
	Most cases involve girls aged 14 to 18, said Hitkari Guria, a member of the Diocese Board of Social Services of the Church of North India who works against human trafficking in Alipurduar.        
	It is very difficult to say how many are taken away, as the touts usually tell the parents they would be employed as domestic helps. So no one complains either to us or to the police. Most of the girls are taken to Delhi and its surrounding areas, Hitkari said.        
	The Bachpan Bachao Andolan, the NGO that drew the courts attention to the problem, said the funds allotted for trafficked womens rehabilitation was a stumbling block. The government sanctions only Rs 750 a month per child/woman rescued from trafficking, it said.        
	This is nothing. As a result, most of them are underfed, naked in their rescue homes and dying of cold, the NGOs lawyer, Colin Gonsalves, said.        
	The court said the matter of housing and schooling the victims would have to be a key component of any rehabilitation scheme.        
	The stigma keeps them away from schools. Parents and relatives very frequently refuse to take them back because of the social stigma, it said.        
	The court indicated it would ask the government to set up a separate police force dedicated to tackle trafficking, which is worst in the areas bordering Bangladesh and Nepal. It also asked the government to immediately end the flourishing sex tourism in certain parts of the country.        
	At the previous hearing, the court had sarcastically asked the Centre to legitimise prostitution if it couldnt help the trafficked women .

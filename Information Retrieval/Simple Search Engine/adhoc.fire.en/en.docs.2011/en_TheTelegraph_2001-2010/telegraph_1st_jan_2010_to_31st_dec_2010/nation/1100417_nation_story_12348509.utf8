                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Vedanta verdict awaited
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 16: All eyes are now on Orissa High Court following the Lok Pals recommendation for a thorough probe into the land deal for the Rs 15,000-crore university proposed to be set up in Puri district by London-based Anil Agarwals Vedanta Resources Corporation.        
	The high court is expected to deliver its judgment on the issue of acquiring land along the Puri-Konark marine drive by the government for Vedanta Resources Corporation to set up the university.        
	A division bench comprising Chief Justice V. Gopalgowda and Justice B.P. Das heard the case for the past three days but did not conclude hearings today.        
	A batch of petitions had been filed since 2007 challenging the legal validity of acquiring 6,270 acres for a private company along the Puri-Konark marine drive, 60km from Bhubaneswar.        
	Advocate-general Ashok Mohanty, for most part of his arguments, today defended the government against the allegations that the land given for Vedanta University is close to Balukhand-Konark Black Buck Sanctuary and a river runs through it.        
	He is expected to further clarify the governments stand when the case comes up for hearing on Monday.        
	The verdict is being eagerly awaited, as Lok Pal P.K. Patra, while disposing of a petition earlier this month, had raised several questions about the land deal for the university project.         
	It appears from records that the government of Orissa had acted in haste to accede to the requests of the Anil Agarwal Foundation, he observed, while recommending a moratorium on the project until compliance with the legal provisions for conversion of the foundation from private to public was met.

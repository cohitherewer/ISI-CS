                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Orissa peeved at Mamata neglect
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          More trains in demand for Orissa                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 22: Leaders of various political parties here are unhappy about railway minister Mamata Banerjees apathy towards the backward state.        
	The railway minister even did not find time to meet an all-party delegation, headed by the Assembly Speaker, said BJD general secretary Narendra Kumar Swain.        
	The House committee on railways sought an appointment with the Prime Minister and railway minister a month ago. The committee had at least expected a meeting with Banerjee ahead of the railway budget on February 24. But she did not bother to meet the delegation, said Swain.        
	Every year, an all-party delegation meets the Prime Minister and railway minister to present the states case before the budget. But this year, it was an exception, pointed out the BJD leader. This shows the apathy of the railway minister towards Orissa, Swain added.        
	Transport minister Sanjiv Sahoo said the state government had sought an allocation of at least Rs 1,805 crore in the 2010-11 railway budget. A memorandum to this effect had been sent to the Prime Minister and Banerjee.        
	Alleging that Orissa had been continuously neglected by the railway ministry, Sahoo said though the state government had sought an allocation of Rs 1,504 crore in last years railway budget, a meagre Rs 715 crore was allocated out of which Rs 653 crore was released. Sahoo hoped that the state would get fair treatment in this years railway budget.        
	Swain said the party had planned to stage a demonstration in front of the Raj Bhavan on February 25 and launch a statewide agitation if the state did not get a fair deal. Our party MPs will also raise their voice of protest in the Parliament, he said.        
	Senior BJP leader and former minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan expressed his resentment and said the people would not tolerate injustice and discrimination meted out by the UPA government.        
	On the other hand, senior Congress leader and former minister Prasad Harichandan questioned the sincerity of the Naveen Patnaik government in articulating and putting forth realistic demands before the Centre.                           
	They could have sought appointment of the Prime Minister and railway minister much earlier and put forth the realistic demands instead of resorting to political stunts, Harichandan said.        
	Though the Congress leader admitted that Orissa had been neglected by successive governments at the Centre regarding development and expansion of railway network for years, he, however, claimed that the allocations for Orissa in railway budgets had been much higher during the UPA regime, compared to the NDA rule.        
	In a memorandum submitted to the railway minister, Congress MPs Hemananda Biswal, Amar Pradhan and Sanjay Bhoi said the Angul-Sambalpur-Jharsuguda section under Sambalpur division of East Coast Railway was a part of the link line joining two trunk routes  Howrah-Chennai and Howarh-Mumbai. While the other part of the link between Cuttack and Angul had already been electrified, Angul-Sambalpur-Jharsuguda section was yet to be electrified. They demanded the section be electrified soon.

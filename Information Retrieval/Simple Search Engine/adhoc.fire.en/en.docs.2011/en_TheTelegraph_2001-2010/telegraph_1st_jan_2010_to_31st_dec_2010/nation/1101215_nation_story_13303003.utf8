The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shrinks scarce? Over to laypersons
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shrinks scarce? Over to laypersons

	New Delhi, Dec. 14: A project in Goa has revealed that trained laypersons can help treat patients with common mental disorders in primary health centres, suggesting a model of health care to tackle Indias shortage of psychiatrists.         
	A 30-month study covering 24 clinics has shown that lay health counsellors in primary health centres could help patients recover from depression and anxiety disorders as effectively as patients under the care of private medical practitioners.         
	The study, whose findings appeared yesterday in the journal Lancet, has found that the proportion of patients who recovered within six months was higher when they had been counselled by trained laypersons working with doctors in primary health centres than when they received standard care in primary health centres  65 per cent versus 53 per cent.         
	The recovery rates of patients in primary health centres staffed by trained laypersons were close to the recovery rates observed among patients who received treatment from private practitioners  66 per cent versus 64 per cent. Each layperson had received two months of training to engage with patients suffering from common mental disorders.         
	Lay health counsellors were effective in providing treatment for depression and anxiety disorders and in preventing the disorders in people who were at high risk of developing them, said Professor Vikram Patel, a psychiatrist at the Sangath Centre, Goa, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the principal investigator of the study.         
	Such chronic disorders are typically treated with a combination of pharmacological therapy and non-medical therapy  we found lay health counsellors could bring about behaviour change through counselling and psychosocial interventions, Patel told The Telegraph.         
	The counsellors had no background in health, but each of them worked as part of a three-member medical team that included a general physician posted in the primary health centre, and a visiting psychiatrist.         
	Medications whenever necessary were prescribed only by doctors at these centres. But the counsellors made sure the patients took them regularly.         
	Patel and his colleagues from other institutions in Goa and London believe the collaborative care programme they have demonstrated could be one way to combat the acute shortage of psychiatrists in India.         
	Mental health institutions in India have about 3,000 psychiatrists against their requirement of more than 11,500 psychiatrists, according to figures released by the Union health ministry earlier this year.         
	The trial opens new possibilities for early intervention to reduce the global health and economic burden of common mental disorders, psychiatrists Charles Reynolds and Steven Albert at the University of Pittsburgh in the US said in a commentary in the same issue of the journal Lancet.         
	Patel said a single psychiatrist could be attached to trained health counsellors in up to 20 primary health centres. The findings suggest that the lay health counsellors could be used to promote personalised care in areas with a scarcity of mental health professionals.

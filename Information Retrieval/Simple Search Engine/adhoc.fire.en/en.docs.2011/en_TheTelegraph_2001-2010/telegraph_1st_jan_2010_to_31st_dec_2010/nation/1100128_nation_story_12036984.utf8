The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Supporters hail Alagiri, the CM
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Supporters hail Alagiri, the CM
          G.C. SHEKHAR                          A poster in Madurai ahead of Alagiris birthday.                                   
	Chennai, Jan. 27: Happy birthday Alagiri, the CM.        
	CM, as in chemical minister.        
	But the mega-sized C and M, and the rest in much smaller lettering leave no doubt about the ambitions of the elder of Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhis two sons who have taken up their fathers profession.        
	Surely, a little jugglery is permissible when the prize at stake is the chief ministers chair?        
	M.K. Alagiris supporters think so.        
	With the sibling rivalry hotting up, Alagiris 59th birthday celebrations on Saturday have come in handy for loyalists of the Union chemical and fertiliser minister, though DMK chief Karunanidhi has openly favoured the younger son, M.K. Stalin.        
	Madurai city, Alagiris constituency, is dotted with banners and posters describing him as CM, or chemical minister  minster, if you go by the spelling on the posters.        
	Compared with the C and the M, the rest of the letters are minuscule.        
	Other posters have a catch phrase from a Tamil film song that says this is our area, do not step in. The intended target is obviously Stalin, 56.        
	While Alagiris photographs dominate the posters, Karunanidhis picture makes a token appearance. Stalins photographs are conspicuously absent.        
	Alagiri, convener of the partys south zone committee, has been pitching for a more powerful post in the party ever since Stalin became deputy chief minister. He has been demanding either the post of treasurer, which Stalin holds, or that of general secretary, occupied for decades by party veteran K.A. Anbazhagan.        
	When Karunanidhi refused to yield, Alagiri demanded that four more districts, whose secretaries are Stalin loyalists, be placed under his control. But Stalin had the move nipped in the bud.        
	It is clear that Alagiri wants to position himself in a key position within the party from where he can rally the support of MLAs and district secretaries during a succession war after Karunanidhi. But our leader has clearly preferred the more level-headed Stalin, openly hinting at least thrice that he is ready to pass on the chief ministers mantle to him after the World Tamil Conference in June, said a senior minister.        
	After failing to push his case within the party, Alagiri tried to stoke trouble between the DMK and ally Congress, which has given virtually no functional autonomy to DMK ministers at the Centre.        
	Alagiri has been trying to convince his father to dump the Congress in the next state elections. He has conveyed to Karunanidhi that the DMK, by contesting more than 200 of the 234 seats in the Assembly, can easily win a majority because of its welfare schemes and successful electoral management. To back up his case, he cited the spate of by-election wins in Tamil Nadu.        
	Karunanidhi, however, is in no mood to ditch the Congress, knowing that it would immediately gravitate towards the rival ADMK.        
	A sulking Alagiri has kept away from Delhi, preferring to stay in Madurai. The whole of this month he was in Delhi for only two days.        
	Only he and (Trinamul Congress leader) Mamata Banerjee spend more time in their home states than at Delhi, a DMK MP said.        
	Sources said Alagiri had managed to win over his stepsister Kanimozhi, a Rajya Sabha MP, to his side by promising her his ministry once he moves full time to state politics.

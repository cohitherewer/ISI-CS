The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | State heat on Andhra governor
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      State heat on Andhra governor
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, May 5: Andhra Pradesh governor E.S.L. Narasimhan has come under attack for overstepping his brief after a critical comment on the states finances added fuel to the simmering row between Raj Bhavan and the ruling Congress.        
	The former Intelligence Bureau chief, brought in last November from Chhattisgarh to replace his sex scandal-tainted predecessor N.D. Tiwari, had earlier angered the K. Rosaiah government for apparently writing to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on state welfare schemes.        
	But the trigger for his latest run-in with the government was his comment last Sunday at an official meeting in the city where Narasimhan is said to have criticised the sorry state of affairs of some welfare programmes.        
	God only knows from where the government raises funds for these welfare schemes in the backdrop of such a huge financial crunch? he is reported to have commented while advising the Rosaiah regime to weed out bogus pensioners and holders of fake ration cards.        
	At a media conference the same evening, Congress Working Committee member K. Keshava Rao said the governor had no business to talk like that. He should leave such things to the state government and the ruling party to ponder how to raise resources, Rao said.        
	Narasimhan is also said to have written to Singh, saying welfare schemes were eating into state revenues and asking for grant from the Congress-led central government.        
	He is also reported to have suggested in the letter that the Justice B.N. Srikrishna Committee, assigned the task of assessing public opinion on creation of smaller states, should be advised not to hold sittings in Hyderabad city as that could lead to law and order problems.        
	Congress leader V. Hanumantha Rao openly slammed the governor for bypassing the chief minister. His actions and remarks have created a sense of insecurity among political leaders and also the administrative set-up in the state, the Rajya Sabha MP said.        
	Leader of Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu and the Left parties said the governor was undermining the constitutional system and demanded action against Narasimhan for his undemocratic acts and words.        
	A Raj Bhavan communiqu, however, denied that Narasimhan had written any such letter to the Prime Minister, but local newspapers reported that the PMO had confirmed receiving such a letter.        
	Earlier, Narasimhan is reported to have returned 79 files to the government regarding appointments to universities and local bodies rejecting the proposals of the Rosaiah cabinet.

	New Delhi, April 10: A blaze in a container depot today gutted 24 of its 25 warehouses, the fire being the fifth in the capital in as many days that has exposed the capital as a tinderbox.         
	No one died in the Tughlaqabad railway station depot fire but it is said to have burnt goods for export costing several crores  handicrafts worth Rs 60 crore were destroyed. The firefighters were informed 45 minutes after the blaze started  allegedly from a short circuit  at 5am.        
	Thirty fire engines were at the spot by 6am, but the damage had been done.         
	The fire spread rapidly. By the time we reached, a portion of the roof had collapsed. We battled the leaping flames for at least five hours, before we could bring it under control, said R.C. Sharma, the chief fire officer.         
	The Delhi Exporters Association said in a news release that the fire had proved to be the worst tragedy in the history of Indian exports. According to them, more than 25,000 export shipments were ruined. The loss, it said, was irreparable.        
	In a single day about 750 containers of garments, handicrafts, leather goods, engineering items and medicines are sent out from the depot, the bulk of which goes to Mumbai.        
	Just as the Stephen Court fire reminded Calcuttans about the tinderbox buildings in the city, a recently released CAG report has revealed how fire safety norms are flouted in Delhi.         
	Fire alerts were sounded in 812 highrises in the capital, the report said, adding that schools, hospitals and shopping destinations were all potential tinderboxes and the Delhi fire service is grappling with inadequate manpower and infrastructure.         
	The CAG has pointed out that the key reasons behind the blazes were non-installation of fire equipment; congested staircases, narrow entry roads and absence of trained personnel to tackle emergencies. The CAG report also said there was a severe shortage of fire-fighting equipment and fire tenders were found to be out of order for 37 months in some cases.        
	The other four occurrences of fire accidents were also because of short circuits.        
	On April 8, two people were charred to death in a slum in South Delhi. The same day, a couple and their daughter had a lucky escape from a blaze that gutted their Lajpat Nagar home in south Delhi. The blaze gutted their house when an LPG cylinder burst after a short circuit.        
	On April 7, a fire gutted a shoe factory in East Delhi before 20 fire tenders could reach the area. The same day, in the heart of the capital, five fire tenders fought a raging fire at the ITO building near one of Delhis busiest crossings.        
	We have issued notices to 718 highrise owners for violating fire safety norms, while 215 other buildings have been re-notified after inaction on earlier notices , said Sharma.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 9: In order to protect mass habitat of coastal areas from violent sea surges like a tsunami, the state government has decided to construct saline-embankment covering a distance of 156.98km out of the 480km coastline.        
	We have approached the World Bank and sought an assistance of Rs 576 crore for this. The detailed project report has already been submitted. We are expecting the release of first instalment of Rs 165 crore soon, said revenue minister Surya Narayan Patro after attending a state-level natural disaster committee meeting, chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik today.        
	Out of the proposed fund, Rs 246 crore would be spent for construction of approach roads, Rs 165 crore for building cyclone centres and Rs 165 crore for constructing saline-embankments.         
	Emphasis would be laid on creating mangrove forest to check soil erosion in coastal areas.        
	Because of the upward movement of sea towards the coast, a number of villages have been affected. The roads particularly on marine drive connecting Puri to Konark has come under sea-surge. All vulnerable points will be closed. People will also be educated how to run to safety in times of calamities, Patro said.

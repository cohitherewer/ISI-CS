The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Outsourcing on Obama talks table
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Outsourcing on Obama talks table
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Barack Obama                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 1: The government is set to discuss the IT industrys concerns over outsourcing curbs and visa fee hikes with Barack Obama during his India visit starting this week.        
	Indias $50-billion outsourcing industry has been hit by two US laws  the Mexico Border Security Bill, which more than doubled visa costs, and a ban by the Democrat-ruled Ohio on outsourcing of government IT work.        
	The finance minister and the commerce minister are expected to take up the issue of outsourcing of IT services and the recent hike in US visa fees for software professionals with Obama, said a top official of Nasscom.         
	Industry experts said Obama was likely to downplay the concerns because he would try to get more access for US companies in Indias burgeoning insurance and banking sectors, where there are tight caps on foreign direct investment (FDI). Such FDI curbs are also in place in retail and defence production.        
	Mike Froman, deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, had indicated as much last week. We see India as a potentially important market for US exports, Froman told a news conference at the White House.        
	Although Nasscom will not directly take up any of these issues during the US Presidents visit, it has been pushing against anti-offshoring proposals by lobbying the US Chamber of Commerce and Tech America, two of the prominent business chambers in that country.        
	Some of Nasscoms lobbying appears to have paid off. A bill aimed at ending tax breaks enjoyed by US multinationals moving services and manufacturing jobs to cheaper locations such as China and India was defeated in the US Senate in late September.        
	Nasscom insists the job losses in the US  the reason cited by those in favour of the curbs  are not because of outsourcing of IT services. They (the layoffs) are mostly in sectors such as construction and retail, where there is already a slump or where jobs are moving to online shops, and also because much of manufacturing is moving out of the country (US). This needs to be explained to the Obama government, said the Nasscom official.        
	Earlier, Sam Pitroda, chairman of the National Knowledge Commission, had appeared to play down the restrictions, arguing that outsourcing was not going to be killed or saved by US government actions but by business imperatives. India, he said, does not have anything to worry about as long as business fundamentals favour outsourcing.        
	The concerns come against the backdrop of double-digit growth reported by IT big names such as Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys Technologies in the quarter ended September 30. The figures are seen as an indication that business in the US, their key market, is growing. Last week, Infosys CEO S. Gopalakrishnan said the IT and BPO industries would grow 13 to 15 per cent, surpassing last years 5 per cent.        
	Khursheed chosen        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today appointed minister of state for minority and corporate affairs Salman Khursheed as the minister-in-waiting for the US President during his state visit.

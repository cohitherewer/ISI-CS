The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CM requests restraint

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 30: Chief minister Kiran Kumar Reddy called for restraint and asked his colleagues to remain committed to the partys stand on Telangana, as the cabinet went into a huddle amid fears of a turmoil over the Srikrishna report.        
	 Reddy, who chaired a meeting of the Andhra Pradesh cabinet, requested his ministers not to make any public statements till the Centre announced its decision on the contentious issue of bifurcating the state.        
	I know about your stand on the Telangana issue, but I request you all to remain committed to the party and government stand on the issue till a definite announcement is made from Delhi. Please do not make any public statements Reddy told his ministers.        
	The Congress leader, who assumed office last month, said his government would implement whatever decision Delhi takes on the report the Srikrishna committee submitted today.        
	Reddy reviewed the situation with home minister P. Sabita Indra Reddy, state police chief Aravinda Rao and other senior officials.        
	Police tightened security even as hundreds of central paramilitary troops were deployed across the state. Director-general Rao, however, told reporters the forces had been deployed only as a precautionary measure and the government had no intention to stifle any democratic protest.        
	The Telangana Rashtra Samiti, which has been spearheading the agitation for a separate state, has already announced it would hold protests in Hyderabad from January 5, whatever the decision on Telangana.        
	TRS leader K.T. Rama demanded that a Telangana bill be tabled in Parliament in the budget session.        
	The BJP, Chandrababu Naidus Telugu Desam Party and several smaller outfits voiced reservations on the report. All of us have our own reservations over the Congress partys commitment to Telangana. We have seen how the Congress went back on its word in December 2009 after announcing the commencement of the Telangana process, BJP leader and former NDA minister Vidyasagar Rao said.        
	The allusion was to Union home minister P. Chidambarams announcement that the Centre was ready to initiate the process of forming a separate state of Telangana, including the prized Hyderabad, one of the 10 Telangana districts. But a rebellion from non-Telangana legislators forced the state Congress to put off tabling the statehood resolution necessary for introducing a bill in Parliament.

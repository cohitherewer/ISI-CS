          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 15: A Karnataka man dubbed the prime Pune bakery blast suspect got bail today for lack of evidence.        
	Abdul Samad was released because the anti-terror squad (ATS) hadnt charged him in the February 13 terror attack but in an arms seizure last year. The ATS couldnt explain in court how his name suddenly cropped up in the second case.        
	The legal setback to the ATS comes just over a month after the acquittals of two Indians in the 26/11 case.        
	Samad, 22, was arrested in an operation by intelligence agencies and the ATS at the Bajpe airport in Mangalore on his arrival from Dubai on May 24. The ATS flew him in a chartered plane to Mumbai and claimed he was the bomb planter in the explosion at Punes German Bakery that killed 17 people. Home minister P. Chidambaram, too, said he was the prime suspect.        
	In its remand application for Samad, the ATS was silent on the Pune blast. It booked him under the arms act on charges of supplying illegal weapons to three of Dawood Ibrahims men arrested in Mumbai in August 2009.        
	Samads lawyer Mubin Solkar argued that his client had never been listed as a wanted accused in the remand pleas in the arms case. For nine months till May 24, Samads name had not figured in any of the remand applications, Solkar argued. He also pointed out that the three gangsters in the arms case had been granted bail.        
	Judge Pathan agreed. The ATS had failed to prove how Samads name had transpired in the (arms) caseit appears his name had been subsequently added in this (blast) case, he said.

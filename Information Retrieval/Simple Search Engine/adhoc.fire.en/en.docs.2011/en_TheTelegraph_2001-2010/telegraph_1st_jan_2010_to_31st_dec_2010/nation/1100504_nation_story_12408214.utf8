          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 3: Maoist-hit Orissa today urged the Centre to provide a dedicated helicopter to tackle various crises, including terrorist attack, and technical assistance to deal with growing cyber crimes.        
	We need a dedicated helicopter to be stationed at Bhubaneswar to deal with any emergency, said chief secretary T.K. Mishra.        
	The request was made during a video-conference between cabinet secretary K.A. Chandrasekhar and senior officials of eastern states to discuss the crisis management plan. We also lack expertise to deal with cyber crimes and sought the Centres help in this regard, said Mishra.        
	The state is witnessing growing incidents of cyber crimes, including hacking of official website and frequent e-mail threats to chief minister to blow up his residence, secretariat and other strategic installations.        
	However, the police personnel have not been able to make any major breakthrough in locating the culprits.

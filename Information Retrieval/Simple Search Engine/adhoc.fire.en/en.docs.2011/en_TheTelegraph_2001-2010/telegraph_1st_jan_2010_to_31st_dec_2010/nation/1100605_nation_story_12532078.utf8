The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hema, Shourie shaky
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hema, Shourie shaky
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 4: Najma Heptulla, Hema Malini and Arun Shourie are among the heavyweights who are almost out of the BJPs list of Rajya Sabha nominees.        
	Ram Jethmalani could be fielded as an Independent from Rajasthan with BJP backing, party sources said.        
	Among those whose names were announced for the ensuing biennial elections were Chandan Mitra, the editor of The Pioneer, and Tarun Vijay, a former editor of the RSSs Hindi mouthpiece Panchajanya and now a BJP spokesperson.         
	A section of the BJP is trying hard to get Heptulla re-elected from another seat in Rajasthan, for which the party will need at least 15 extra votes. She had been elected from Rajasthan last time. Given the fact that there is no consensus on her candidacy in the state BJP, which is no longer in power in Rajasthan and therefore not in a position to manoeuvre the surplus votes, Heptullas prospects do not appear bright.        
	Heptulla is synonymous with the upper House to which she was first elected in 1980. She has had an uninterrupted run even when she quit the Congress in 1998 and joined the BJP.        
	Sources said that apart from having to fight to get its candidates elected  except in states that the BJP rules with a majority of its own  there was a perception in the party that Heptulla was past her utility.        
	Unlike Heptulla, Hema was valued highly as a campaigner. As and when there is a vacancy in the Rajya Sabha, she is almost certain to return.        
	Sources said Shouries goose was cooked the day he compared L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh as Humpty Dumpty and Tarzan.        
	The BJP has selected Anil Dave and Mitra for the two Madhya Pradesh seats, V.P. Singh, a confidant of Vasundhara Raje, from Rajasthan, and Vijay from Uttarakhand.

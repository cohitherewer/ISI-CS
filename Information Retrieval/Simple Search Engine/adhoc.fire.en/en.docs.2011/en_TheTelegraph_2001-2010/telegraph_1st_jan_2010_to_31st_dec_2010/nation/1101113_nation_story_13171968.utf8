The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Meet Arun, who gets to shoot Obama everyday
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Meet Arun, who gets to shoot Obama everyday
          ASHLEY PARKER                              
	Washington, Nov. 12: Arun Chaudhary is the White Houses ultimate fly on the wall.        
	Perpetually clad in New Balance sneakers and suits that are just slightly askew, he dashes in and out of meetings, from East Room news conferences to the Oval Office and back again, out through the South Portico and into the White House vegetable garden  all while scrambling to blend into the background and record nearly every moment with his video camera.        
	One recent Tuesday, he trained his lens on President Barack Obama, who was admiring the paintings on the wall of the green room as he waited to speak at a community college summit meeting.        
	Aruns a very cool guy, though I have to tell him to get a haircut every once in a while, Obama quipped, nodding over at him before walking out to the stage.        
	Chaudhary, son of an Indian immigrant father and Jewish mother, is the official White House videographer and the first person to hold the job, a part documentarian, part White House-message-machine post. He travels with the President on roughly two-thirds of his trips, documenting the behind-the-scenes occasions and public theatrics.        
	Last Saturday, the day Chaudhary turned 35, he arrived in India with Obama. One journalist who travelled with the President said it was most unlikely he had any time to celebrate his birthday because Obama hit the ground running in Mumbai.        
	One of the lowest points of Hillary Clintons failed presidential bid against Obama came when another resident of Chappaqua, New York, where she lived trashed a TV ad of Clintons which was meant to deal a killer blow to Obamas campaign.        
	In 48 hours, he got those featured in Clintons ad to endorse Obama in a rebuttal of the original advertisement.        
	That resident was Chaudhary, who took leave of absence from his job as graduate film professor at New York University, moved to Obamas hometown Chicago and became the new media road director of his 2008 campaign for the White House.        
	He is married to Laura Moser, a rising novelist whose interest in alternative medicine took the couple to Rishikesh for an extended stay. Laura tried yoga and ayurveda in a vain attempt in Rishikesh to treat a problem with her painful shoulder. Chaudhary spent his time photographing sites in the holy city but his campaign schedule and subsequent role as a White House videographer have prevented the photographs from being compiled or edited.        
	It is an indication of how sensitive his job is that his White House page as a staffer is completely blank except for his name.        
	Chaudhary, who as a teenager said he would not get into politics because I have a funny name, serves as reporter and promoter.        
	He pulls his video together into West Wing Week, a signature production that comes out on the White House website every Friday and offers a pithy look at the Presidents past week.         
	The role of the White House photographer is well known  half historian and half propagandist, shooting generally flattering photographs of the President that are released into the world.         
	But Obama aides have gone a step further, creating imagery and then filming it themselves, knowing they can inject it into the media bloodstream because of video-sharing sites like YouTube and the increased appetite for new media and technology.        
	At a recent interaction with students at Cornell University, where Chaudhary got his BA degree in film theory, he explained how in modern elections, it will be necessary to bring the events to the people instead of trying to bring the people to the events by spending time capturing what was happening on film.        
	When people in 20 years see the work that I do, I hope theyll have a greater understanding of what the President is like personally and what the presidency is like as an institution, Chaudhary said. Im hoping these moments Ive saved and put out will even have a richer and more historical flavour.        
	Fellow photographers and cameramen joke that you cannot take a picture of the President without Chaudhary somewhere in the shot.        
	His obsession with his Indian name, unfamiliar to most Americans, obviously remains. On his web page on Obamas political campaign site, Organising for America, Chaudhary insists that guys with funny names have to stick together. Really.        
	Obama has himself admitted that he has a name that many Americans find odd. It will not be surprising if that issue is what glues the President to the Indian who spends more time with Obama than anyone else.        
	Whats interesting in life is the transition between two things, Chaudhary said, explaining his fascination with private moments about to become public, like the Presidents greeting foreign leaders just outside the Oval Office. Whether you are in the United Nations or a castle in Prague, anything can happen, and probably will, in the hallway.        
	He also loves what he calls awkward foreign leader moments, like when Obama tried to make small talk between the President of Chile and the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, only to discover the two had already met. But his videos also have a serious side, like his Dispatches From Iraq piece.        
	His operation is a bit ragtag  just him, his camera and his laptop.         
	Because of the Presidential Records Act, every piece of video the White House shoots is saved on huge storage servers and will become part of the official record in the presidential library.        
	For Chaudhary, it is just part of a job that he is creating and redefining anew daily. Its tough being an artist making a living in this town, he joked.

          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Calcutta, Dec. 24: Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar today said she was pained by the long standoff in Parliament over the spectrum scam but hoped matters would be sorted out soon.        
	In democracy, contradictory views exist. We have to find a middle path. Parliament is for that. Discussions are the only way out. Talks are on. Like you all, I am also concerned about the disruptions, she said while interacting with members of four business chambers in Calcutta.        
	Later, addressing a news conference, Kumar said she expected more discussions on Pranab Mukherjees proposal for a special session on the spectrum controversy. The government and the Opposition have two viewpoints. I expect them to discuss and reach common ground.        
	 Asked whether she expected the Opposition to be more responsible, she didnt give a direct answer. As Speaker, I wont comment. I expect all the members to follow rules and let Parliament run.         
	Kumar reminded MPs about their responsibility as elected representatives. Democracy doesnt always have tailor-made situations. Meeting grounds sometimes dont seem to exist. It is the duty of the MPs to find a way out, she said.         
	On the sidelines of another programme in the city, former Speaker Somnath Chatterjee described the Parliament impasse as unfortunate, saying elected representatives were answerable on why they were not allowing the House to function.        
	He refused comment on whether a joint parliamentary committee should probe the 2G spectrum scam.

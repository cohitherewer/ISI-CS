	Darjeeling, Nov. 1: Gorkha Janmukti Morcha chief Bimal Gurung today met P. Chidambaram in Delhi to clear the last hurdles before the creation of an interim authority for the Darjeeling hills, which both sides agreed should be in place by December-end.        
	The Morcha chief also indicated to Chidambaram that his party would be more flexible on the contentious issues that had been dogging the talks so far.        
	The Morcha described todays talks as positive and said all contentious issues related to the formation of the interim authority would be resolved in the next round of talks at the political level.        
	Home ministry sources also said the talks were encouraging and the Morcha leadership was showing flexibility. We hope that it will be in place by the end of the year, a home ministry official said.        
	Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri told The Telegraph: The talks today were positive and we are very hopeful. We discussed all the contentious issues which would be taken up in the next round of political tripartite talks and are likely to be solved soon.         
	Darjeeling MP Jaswant Singh accompanied the Morcha delegation.        
	The four main issues that have so far been coming in the way of the interim authority are its territorial jurisdiction, its authority to manage tea gardens, the mode of selection of its members, and its legislative powers.        
	The Morcha is keen that the interim authority should be in place before the model code of conduct comes into force ahead of the Assembly elections, a Morcha leader said.        
	To resolve the problem of territorial jurisdiction, the Morcha would suggest the setting up of a joint verification committee in the next meeting.         
	We will suggest that some mouzas of Siliguri be immediately transferred to the interim authority subject to the state governments approval, a Morcha leader said.

	Washington, Nov. 13 (PTI): Pakistan has used terror outfits as a hedge against India, US secretary of state Hillary Clinton said today and implied that things may not have changed completely.        
	Clinton acknowledged that the US policy of creating the mujahideen to oust Soviet Union from Afghanistan has boomeranged.         
	They (Pakistan) have in the past hedged against both India and an unfriendly regime in Afghanistan by supporting groups that will be their proxies in trying to prevent either India or an unfriendly Afghan government from undermining their position, she said.        
	Musharraf claim        
	Pakistans former military ruler Pervez Musharraf has said India and Pakistan almost reached peace on Kashmir during his tenure, but unfortunately it did not materialise despite his best efforts.        
	I was certainly trying for it (peace). And we were reaching success. I have always praised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his sincerity to reach peace, he said in a radio interview. And we almost reached peace on .... Kashmir, we had made some certain parameters and we were moving forward towards drafting an agreement, he said. Unfortunately, that was not to be, but I tried my best.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shillong, March 8: Not Lalu Prasad or Mulayam Singh but deputy chief minister B.M. Lanong was enemy No. 1 for women here on International Womens Day after comparing the gender with vipers.        
	Women activists, however, chose composure over venom as they protested by boycotting official celebrations on a day dedicated to them and demanded an apology from Lanong.        
	At a recent seminar, Lanong had termed some women activists vipers of Khasi society after they challenged the rosy picture he had painted about womens status in Meghalaya.        
	Today, women activists gathered near the additional secretariat amid tight security, wearing black badges and carrying placards that said Women are no vipers of society and Unite against oppression of all kinds.         
	They later carried out a signature campaign against Lanongs remarks.        
	The convener of the protesting womens bodies joint action committee, Agnes Kharshiing, said: Lanong should tender a public apology.

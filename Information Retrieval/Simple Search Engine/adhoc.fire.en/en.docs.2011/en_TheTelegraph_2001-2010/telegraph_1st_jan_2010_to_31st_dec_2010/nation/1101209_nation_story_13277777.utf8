  - Officials worried          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A Rajas aide Sadik Basha being taken away for questioning by the CBI in Chennai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: The department of telecom (DoT), once abuzz with the excitement associated with the booming sector, has now withdrawn into a static-free shell.        
	Most officials and departments linked to the 2008 radio wave allocation process are expected to be sucked into the CBIs line of fire.        
	Besides the premises of A. Raja, the CBI today searched houses and offices of former telecom secretary Siddartha Behura, Rajas personal secretary R.K. Chandolia, DoT deputy director-general A. K. Srivastava and former Telecom Commission member K. Sridhara.        
	A CBI source said Chandolia, who was at his residence in the capital when the raids took place, has been picked up for questioning. He is being questioned but has not been arrested, he said. Chandolia was personal secretary to Raja at the time of the spectrum allocation.        
	Other officials in the wireless planning cell (WPC), the department responsible for allocating spectrum; the Telecom Commission, the apex decision-making body of DoT; and the deputy director-general (access services) of the telecom ministry are also expected to be drawn into the CBI probe. Some of them are facing allegations of connivance with private companies in allocating spectrum, sources said.        
	Newly appointed telecom minister Kapil Sibal said the CBI, which is probing the 2G spectrum scam, was an independent body and maintained that the government was not involved in the investigations.         
	The CBI is before the Supreme Court. We have no problem in the Supreme Court monitoring directly what the CBI is saying so that the people know that all this is being done in a transparent fashion, and that the government is not involved at all, he added.         
	Sibal had said last week that the telecom operators  Loop Telecom, Unitech Wireless, Etisalat DB, Videocon and STel  which did not meet the eligibility criteria in 2008 would be issued showcause notices over the next few weeks.        
	Raja is accused of changing bidding rules to favour some companies which were ineligible to compete for the lucrative 2G licences.        
	The CBI has been investigating the case for more than a year. In the past, the agency had searched the offices of the DoT after registering corruption cases against unknown people and companies over the allotment of the air waves.

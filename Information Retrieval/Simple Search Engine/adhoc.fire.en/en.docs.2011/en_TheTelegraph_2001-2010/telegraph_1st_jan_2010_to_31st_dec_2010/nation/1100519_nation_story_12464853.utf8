The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | AMRI rejoinder on Saha case
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      AMRI rejoinder on Saha case
                            
	The counsel for AMRI has sent the following rejoinder to the report published by The Telegraph on Tuesday, headlined Foreign voice in medical case.        
	AMRI regretfully states that the reportage carried by The Telegraph was based on heresay. The actual order of the Supreme Court was: After arguing the case for a while, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner made a request that his client may be permitted to withdraw this special leave petition with liberty to avail opportunity of examining foreign experts through video conferencing in terms of the order passed by this court. The special leave petition is dismissed as withdrawn in terms of the prayer made.         
	The SLP having been dismissed as withdrawn a mere liberty has been reserved for Dr Kunal Saha to approach the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) for examining foreign experts through video-conferencing.         
	It will then depend on the NCDRC to allow or not to allow these 4 or any other foreign experts to so depose. AMRI has thus put the record straight that the news carried yesterday was wholly inaccurate factual depiction of what the Supreme Court ordered.        
	Our legal correspondent responds: The report was not based on hearsay. This correspondent was present in court. The Supreme Court had in its August 7, 2009, order directed that if any foreign experts are to be examined, it shall be done only through video conferencing and at the cost of respondents. Dr Kunal Saha submitted affidavits of four experts to the NCDRC, but these were not accepted after AMRI and the doctors opposed it. Dr Saha appealed against this to the SC, but withdrew it so he could avail of the opportunity of examining foreign experts through video conferencing as per the August 7 order.         
	The implications of these orders  foreign experts will be allowed through video-conferencing.

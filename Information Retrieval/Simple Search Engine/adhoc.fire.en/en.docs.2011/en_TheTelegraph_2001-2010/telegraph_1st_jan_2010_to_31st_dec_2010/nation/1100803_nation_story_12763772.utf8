          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 2: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah today said the uncontained flare-up had been discussed at length in the meeting with the Prime Minister and the members of the cabinet committee on security.        
	One of the issues he had raised in the meeting was action on certain political initiatives long in the pipeline because Kashmir needs a political package more than it needs and economic package.        
	Asked to elaborate, Omar said: I have been asking for the revocation of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) for a long time, there is the issue of security footprints in the Valley, the rehabilitation of youth who had gone across the LoC, the issue of relief for victims of violence, there is unemployment. But none of these can make any headway in the current situation. The foremost thing now is to bring an end to violence.        
	 Omar said he had been in touch with Hurriyat leaders publicly and privately but again pleaded for bringing current tempers down.         
	Asked whether he felt stretched in saddle, he said: We are stretched as far as it is possible to be stretched. We need to augment central forces in the Valley and we need more rapid action forces. I have received assurances on that count from the home minister.

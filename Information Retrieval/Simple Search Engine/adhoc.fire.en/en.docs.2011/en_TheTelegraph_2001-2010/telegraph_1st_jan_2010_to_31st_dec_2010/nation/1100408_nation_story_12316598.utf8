          SANJAY K. JHA                                             
	New Delhi, April 7: The Congress today asked the government to wipe out the terrible scourge of Maoist violence, but the seemingly unambiguous assertion masked an apparent vertical division among senior leaders on the approach towards the insurgency.        
	However, in public, the party advocated a tough line, describing the Maoist violence as the biggest threat to Indian democracy and did not soften the rhetoric with offer for talks or a greater resolve for pushing the socio-economic agenda.        
	Party spokesperson Jayanti Natrajan said: Wipe out this terrible scourge. This is the most direct challenge to the constitutional principles of our democracy. This should be fought with all strengths at our command, at every level. We are fully behind the government and the home minister in this battle.        
	Responding to questions on the original Congress position that Naxalism grew out of specific socio-economic conditions, the spokesperson said: Thats the long-term vision. But this violence must be put down at all costs.        
	Asked about an initial offer for dialogue, she said: Talks are not possible till the Maoists abjure violence. After what they did yesterday by killing so many innocent CRPF men, strong action must follow.         
	On the possibility of using the army and the air force, she said: It is for the government to decide strategy.         
	But many Congress leaders harbour reservations about the efficacy as well as the desirability of a military solution. The partys official line cannot reflect this dilemma as that will be viewed as a sign of the establishments weakness.        
	The Congress has always housed two schools of thought. The dominant view previously was that use of force to crush the menace should be the last option. But the balance has now tilted in favour of the governments strategy and a growing number of senior leaders believe the situation will slip out of hand if brute force was not used at this stage.        
	Majority of Congress leaders believe there was more to the Maoists threat than ideology and deprivation, suggesting a wider conspiracy involving other militant groups.        
	The split in the party is best manifested through the views of two AICC general secretaries. One said police action should be the last option and the focus should be on socio-economic programmes. Another forcefully disagreed, contending that a state cannot be deluded by romantic ideas of revolution. Where will this take us if we dont stop it now? Who is willing to talk? Should we wait till they take over? he asked.        
	Two views prevail even on the success in fighting the Maoists in Andhra Pradesh. While some leaders feel the success came because of the state governments tough action, others believe effective implementation of welfare schemes isolated the Maoists.         
	The party leaders are divided on home minister P. Chidamabarams strident posturing, too. A general secretary said: Shivraj Patil was battered because he wont talk tough. Now Chidambaram is being criticised for talking tough. These are superficial issues, the real issues are: will the Maoists give up violence if the government declares ceasefire? Who are supplying arms and money to the Maoists? Are they playing into the hands of our bigger enemies?         
	But another general secretary took objection to the rhetorical flourish of the home minister, saying that such an attitude would not help in creating an environment for a negotiated settlement.

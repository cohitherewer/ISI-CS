          SUBHASHISH MOHANTY                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 1: For Vedanta, troubles are pouring.        
	At least six persons, including some employees, suffered injuries, and property worth Rs 1 crore was destroyed as hundreds of contract workers went on the rampage at the Vedanta Alumina Ltd (VAL) office at Lanjigarh last night.        
	Today, the Union environment and forests minister issued showcause notices to the company on its mining project.        
	Last night, the workers smashed furniture, destroyed computer sets and photocopier machines. The police detained 110 workers after the violence.        
	Around 200 workers attacked our employees and a few policemen present. One switched off power. In the darkness, they hurled stones and smashed the computer sets, servers and (photocopier) machines. All the window panes were smashed, VAL chief operating officer Mukesh Kumar said.        
	Things are under control now, Kalahandi SP Sudha Singh told The Telegraph.        
	The incident unfolded in the wake of the Union ministry rejecting Vedantas request for second-stage clearance for its bauxite mining project in Niyamgiri. The mining project would have fed its 1-million-tonne refinery at Lanjigarh.        
	The Union ministry today issued two showcause notices to the company, asking it to explain, among other things, the plan to expand the capacity of the alumina refinery from 1 million tonnes to 6 million tonnes without obtaining environment clearance and sourcing bauxite for the plant from 11 mines which, too, did not have such an approval. The notice is returnable within a fortnight.        
	The second notice issued to VAL officer Kumar asked why the companys expansion plan, which remains on hold, should not be cancelled.

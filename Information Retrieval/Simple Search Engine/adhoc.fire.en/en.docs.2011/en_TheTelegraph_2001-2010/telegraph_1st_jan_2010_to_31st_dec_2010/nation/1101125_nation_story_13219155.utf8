The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wanted: whip-crack Sonia
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Wanted: whip-crack Sonia
          MANINI CHATTERJEE                          Sadaqat Ashram, the Congress state headquarters , wears a deserted look after poll results were announced on Wednesday. Picture by Deepak Kumar                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: Barely 18 months after its grand comeback in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections when it managed to win more than 200 seats after nearly two decades, Indias Grand Old Party seems a bruised and battered entity today  receiving its worst ever drubbing in Bihar, floundering to establish the writ of the high command in its bastion Andhra Pradesh, shaky in its other stronghold Maharashtra, and more or less comatose in state after state where the Congress Party, at least in name, is the principal Opposition.        
	The Bihar result could not have come at a less opportune time for the Congress and the government it is heading at the Centre. The ruling coalition has been reeling under allegations of corruption with one scam after another making the headlines almost on a daily basis; an hitherto directionless Opposition has suddenly found enough unity and belligerence to paralyse Parliament since the winter session began two weeks ago; and the holy trinity of Sonia-Manmohan-Rahul which gave the party its salience and moral superiority is beginning to look more like a hapless trio.        
	No one had expected Rahul Gandhis ekla chalo re mantra in Bihar to work the same magic it did in Uttar Pradesh in 2009 where the Congress managed to win more Lok Sabha seats than Mayavati and announced its intention to regain its premier status in the Hindi belt, without the help of any rag tag allies, thank you.        
	But abandoning Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan and hitching its wagon to Rahuls star would have been worth it if the party had gained even a dozen more seats in the Assembly.         
	Instead, the Congress has been reduced to just four seats in a 243-member house, making a mockery of both Rahuls go-it-alone strategy and his much vaunted charisma.        
	To blame Rahul for the Bihar debacle, though, would be grossly unfair, party insiders insist. The crisis facing the Congress runs much deeper and the Bihar result is only one  and not the most worrying at that  manifestation of it. And the biggest reason for the crisis is the chronic indecision that afflicts the leadership, party men informally concede.        
	Although Sonia enjoys unquestioned supremacy in the party and commands great respect and loyalty for turning around the fortunes of the Congress when it was in a state of near terminal decline, there is a growing feeling that her innate decency and democratic spirit  so completely in contrast to her authoritarian mother-in-law or even her late husband  is beginning to be less an asset than a liability.        
	If Manmohan Singh, despite his reputation for impeccable personal integrity, is under fire for not cracking down against corrupt ministers quickly enough, Sonias refusal to take the partys organisation by its reins has been the single biggest blot on her record as the supreme leader of the countrys oldest party.        
	Sonia, many feel, is prompt in taking action when the media and the middle class hurl charges of corruption against a Congress leader. The exit of Tharoor, Ashok Chavan and Suresh Kalmadi are all held up as examples of Sonias zero tolerance to corruption. But it is also being noticed that Sonia and Manmohan are either unable or unwilling to take suo motu action against wrong doers till the heat reaches their door. Be it the Commonwealth Games or the 2G scam or even IPL and Adarsh housing, the alleged scams were allowed to brew and bloom for a long time  which shows that either Sonia-Manmohan were unaware of what was happening under their watch or preferred to look away. Either way it has dimmed the sheen of their personal integrity.         
	Moreover, reactive gestures are no substitute for hard-nosed political decision-making that a party leader must undertake, even her supporters feel.         
	Sonia refused to step in to sort out the bitter factionalism and charges of faulty distribution of tickets in Bihar; she has remained deaf to pleas for decisive steps to stem the apathy that has gripped the Congress in states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Orissa; and maintains an enigmatic silence amid whispers that the Congresss strong chief ministers such as Sheila Dikshit, Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Ashok Gehlot are actually on very shaky ground.        
	In the afterglow of the 2009 victory, Rahul came to the forefront and took on the task of democratising the partys youth and student wings before taking on the organisational re-haul of the mother organisation itself. Sonia refused to take the cue, and the CWC remains packed with old, ineffective faces and the much awaited AICC revamp remains the stuff of speculative journalism.         
	But even Rahuls initiatives have not shown much result on the ground. The Gujarat local polls, bypolls in Uttar Pradesh, and now the latest rout in Bihar all confirm that despite the overall goodwill that the Congress and its leading trinity still enjoy, it cannot translate into votes on the ground in the absence of strong local leaders and a vibrant party organisation.        
	Ironically, the Congresss victory in 2004 and its improved performance in 2009 may be partly responsible for Sonias lack of interest in organisational matters. Sonia has concentrated far more on governance issues  using the National Advisory Council to push her inclusive, aam aadmi centred development programmes to balance out the pro-market slant of Manmohanomics.         
	But while UPA-I initiatives like the rural jobs programme and RTI may have contributed to the 2009 result, central government largesse seldom deliver votes at the state level if the ruling partys local organisation is weak. In Gujarat, Orissa and Bihar, Congress campaigners (including the trinity) have cried themselves hoarse against the development hero mantle assumed by Narendra Modi, Naveen Patnaik and Nitish Kumar. Much of the development, they insist, is a result of the central governments programmes.         
	Even if their claims are true, the lack of a robust Congress organisation in states ensures that non-Congress leaders and parties  with good reason  run away with all the credit        
	The Bihar result, Congress supporters are hoping, will serve as a wake-up call to the Congresss leading trinity. In todays era of escalating aspirations, competitive politics, and media-amplified impatience and scrutiny, it is not enough for Sonia and Manmohan to bank on their personal integrity.         
	They have to be tough and decisive  and seen to be tough and decisive  on issues relating to both governance and organisation to stem the sense of drift, apathy and uncertainty that seems to have gripped them less than two years after they rode back to power so confidently.

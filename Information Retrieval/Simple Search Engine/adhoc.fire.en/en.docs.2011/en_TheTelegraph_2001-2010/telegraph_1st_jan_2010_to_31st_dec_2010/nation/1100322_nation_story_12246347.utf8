          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Gandhinagar, March 21: Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi today stayed away from the special investigation team (SIT) that had summoned him in connection with the murder of a Congress leader during the 2002 riots.         
	You are unnecessarily standing there in the scorching heat, an official at the chief ministers office said, referring to the media vigil outside the SIT office in the old secretariat.        
	Modi spent the day at his home, apparently fasting and performing a puja. The chief minister did not have any official engagement today.        
	As the investigation team, too, did not receive any indication from the chief minister or his officer till late last night that he would turn up today, the SIT also took it easy. Till 1pm, no senior officer was present at the office. A deputy commissioner and a couple of inspectors arrived around 1pm. Neither SIT chief R.K. Raghavan nor other top officers attended office today.        
	A SIT official, however, said: In writing, he can ask for more time or give a specific date when he wants to appear.        
	Right activist and advocate Mukul Sinha pointed fingers at the SIT team.         
	The investigators sent a notice, instead of issuing summons and registering a case against Modi, he said.        
	Sources said that since the notice was returnable within seven days beginning today, the chief minister has a week to reply. He need not appear in person to reply, a SIT official said.        
	BJP sources said Modi could be buying time till April when the Supreme Court is expected to rule on an application seeking the recall of its earlier order referring the complaint of Zakia Jafri, the widow of former Congress MP Ahsan Jafri, to the SIT.         
	Jafri and 68 others were killed in the Gulbarg society massacre of February 28, 2002.        
	Gujarat High Court is hearing tomorrow a petition, filed by NGO Jan Sangharsh Manch, which wants the NanavatiMehta commission probing the riots to summon the chief minister for cross-examination.

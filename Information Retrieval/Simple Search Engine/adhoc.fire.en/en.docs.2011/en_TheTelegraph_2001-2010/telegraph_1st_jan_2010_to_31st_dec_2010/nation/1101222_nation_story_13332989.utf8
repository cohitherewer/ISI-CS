The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Party says go slow, karma yogi on track
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Party says go slow, karma yogi on track
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Murli Manohar Joshi                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: Murli Manohar Joshi seems unstoppable.        
	The septuagenarian has always been a bit of an enigma to his party. Not blessed with an embarrassment of erudition or talent, the BJP has never been able to figure how Joshi manages to pack in multiple contradictions in his persona.        
	A physics professor, he has embraced the RSSs rather exclusivist worldview with ease and become a life-long adherent. Wearing his caste in the tuft of hair on his head and the red tikka on his forehead, he has delved into contemporary science. A stickler for organisational discipline, he has displayed off and on a penchant for striking out on his own.        
	The same streak of individualism is manifest in the zeal with which Joshi has been handling his mandate as the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairperson. Senior party leaders have been openly telling journalists he has been asked to go slow on the 2G spectrum allocation probe. But Joshi has been telling them he will not.        
	On December 27, the comptroller and auditor general will brief him and other PAC members on the scam. That will be the committees fifth meeting on the subject. It held two before the CAG report was tabled in Parliament and two after that.        
	Committee members said Joshi was well on track. We have no reason to believe that the chairman is about to apply the brakes or something.        
	The members anticipate a packed January schedule. There are indications that a report might be in place before Parliaments budget session.        
	The PAC is handling another hot potato. All day today, it took the oral evidence of finance ministry and enforcement directorate officials on tax exemptions and related matters of the Indian Premier League and the Indian cricket board.        
	Yet, Joshi will attend the NDAs rally against alleged government corruption in the capital tomorrow where his speech will be keenly heard as much for what it says as for what it does not.        
	The theme is corruption, every speaker is going to make a pitch for a JPC. What will doctor sahab (the BJPs moniker for Joshi) say? wondered an insider.        
	A Joshi confidant in the RSS said he need not say much. Hes doing his job in the PAC like a karma yogi, which is what he essentially is, he claimed.        
	The RSS has not taken too kindly to the innuendoes against Joshi inspired by his BJP detractors. The Sanghs rationale is if you are serious about fighting corruption, how can you stop an individual who is part of the fight from doing his job? asked Joshis confidant.        
	If anything, those in the BJP who disapproved the no JPC, no Parliament line feel the flag-bearers might eventually get exposed for the duplicity underlying their tacit opposition to the PAC.        
	This isnt the first time Joshi has got the party red in the ears. When the NDA was in power and an Ayodhya trial court chargesheeted him, he resigned as HRD minister and suggested that others should emulate him. The reference was to Advani, who was the home minister. To his dismay, the chargesheet left Advani out.        
	Joshi faced the BJPs ire for quitting over an issue it placed on the highest moral pedestal. The party believed that far from being guilty, those accused should wear the accusation as a badge of honour. After several trying moments  Advani and his acolytes argued for accepting Joshis resignation  and waffling by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he was persuaded to stay on.        
	The episode was anchored in the Joshi-Advani conflict that is part of BJP lore. Insiders spy shades of the conflict in Joshis determination to go ahead with the PAC probe, JPC or no JPC. The JPC demand is associated with Advani and his loyalists, a source said.        
	The only difference is this time, Joshi might have little to lose. At 76, he is not aspiring to head the party or the country. His ideological mentor, the RSS, sadly never stood by him when he most needed it. His confidants say that in the last lap of an internal power struggle, Joshi would rather go down as a fighter than as a wimp.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          More security soon                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Jan 2: An elite Special Security Battalion is being set up to look after the security of the state capital and nearby areas.         
	Disclosing this at the second foundation day of the police commissionerate of Bhubaneswar-Cuttack here today, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the battalion would comprise 1,161 personnel. Eleven new police stations, including three traffic police stations, have also been sanctioned.         
	In the face of rapid expansion of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, it is desirable that we provide a system of police administration which is credible, efficient and people-friendly. The police commissionerate is ideally designed to provide such a system of administration, said Patnaik.        
	During the past two years, the state government has initiated various steps to ensure that the police commissionerate is adequately empowered to achieve its mission, he said.        
	Innovative measures for controlling crime and the capacity to handle crimes like cyber ones were being developed. Traffic management in the face of increasing number of vehicles on the roads has also shown improvement, he said.        
	Highlighting citizen-friendly measures, Patnaik said better police-public relationship had been achieved through appointment of honorary special police officers, senior citizen security cells, a new branch of Red Cross and regular meetings in different localities by senior officers.

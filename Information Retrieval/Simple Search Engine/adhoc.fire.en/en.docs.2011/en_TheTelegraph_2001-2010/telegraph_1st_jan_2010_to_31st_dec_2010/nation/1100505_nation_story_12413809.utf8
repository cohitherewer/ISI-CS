The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Koli guilty in second Nithari case
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Koli guilty in second Nithari case
                            
	Ghaziabad, May 4 (PTI): A special CBI court today held businessman Moninder Singh Pandhers domestic help Surender Koli guilty of raping and murdering a seven-year-old girl, the second of the 19 cases of Nithari killings.        
	Koli, 38, was named the sole accused by the CBI in connection with the murder of Aarti, whose body parts were found in a drain in Nithari, near Noida, in 2006.         
	Special additional district and sessions judge A.K. Singh is expected to pronounce the sentence tomorrow.        
	The CBI, however, has given a clean chit to Kohlis employer, Pandher. In all, 46 witnesses were examined during 113 hearings.         
	Aartis father Durga Prasad accused the CBI of not allowing him to complete his statements. Until now, the CBI has not allowed me to give my complete statements. If I had given it, then the court would have found Pandher guilty... Pandher and Kohli were co-conspirators, Prasad said.         
	On February 13 last year, Koli was sentenced to death in the Rimpa Haldar case along with Pandher. However, Pandher was acquitted by Allahabad High Court on September 11. This January, the Supreme Court stayed the death sentence on Koli.        
	Aarti disappeared in June 2006 and a few months later, her body was found from the vicinity of Pandhers bungalow in Nithari along with bodies of 17 other children and a young woman.         
	Koli has been charged with rape, abduction and murder in all the 19 cases while Pandher is co-accused in six cases.         
	Koli was quiet and looked serious in the court today. He had broken down last year after being convicted in the Rimpa case.        
	Koli has been found guilty under Sections 302 (murder), 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence or giving false information to screen offender) of the IPC, Kolis lawyer J.P. Singh said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Aha! Dr Bose catches a statistical straw
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Aha! Dr Bose catches a statistical straw
          DEVADEEP PUROHIT                               
	Calcutta, June 2: A decisive drubbing in Calcutta and several other civic bodies across the state has forced the Left Front to dip into an innovative statistical arsenal to claim a marginal improvement in its performance in comparison to the 2009 Lok Sabha polls.         
	Front chairman Biman Bose claimed that amid the despair of the civic poll results  the fourth successive rout since the 2008 panchayat polls  a silver lining had emerged, indicating a trend reversal.         
	Our candidates have won in 603 wards out of the 1,791 wards in which the civic polls were held and the winning percentage is 33.67. If we compare our last Lok Sabha poll performance in the same civic bodies, it shows a marginal improvement, claimed Bose, also the CPM state secretary, trying to put up a stoical face.         
	As he read out from a prepared document  put together by the partys number crunchers  Bose said that extrapolation of the last Lok Sabha poll results for the same civic bodies had revealed that the winning percentage then was 29.73  525 wards out of 1,766 wards.         
	Although he admitted that the Left Fronts performance had been inferior vis--vis that of Trinamul, he did not forget to crow about the 3.94 per cent improvement in the percentage of winning wards.         
	He was probably trying to lift the morale of party cadres with such numbers. But the writing is clear on the wall and such numbers cannot hide the fact, said a CPM insider.         
	The innovation to buttress the claim of an improvement in performance took Chennai-based psephologist Rajeeva L. Karandikar by surprise.         
	When we try to analyse the performance of a political party in civic polls, we look at the percentage of votes and the number of civic bodies won by that particular party. Improvement in the percentage of winning wards hardly reveals anything, said Karandikar, adding that such innovations would do little to hide the poor showing by the Left.         
	Boses claim of improved performance could not be independently verified as the percentage of votes cast in favour of the Left candidates was not available till late in the evening.         
	But even without looking at those numbers, his claim of marginal improvement can be contested as Trinamul and the Congress had an alliance in 2009, which they could not forge this time. So, the improvement in percentage of winning wards could be more to do with the division of anti-Left votes than a turnaround by the Left.         
	Springing such a surprise statistic to deflect the attention from the core issue is, however, not new for the ruling Left. After the 2009 Lok Sabha poll debacle, Bose had claimed that there was only a minor erosion in total votes secured by the front in comparison to its performance in 2004.         
	Data from the Election Commission website had corroborated that claim. The total votes secured by the Left had come down from 1,87,59,692 in 2004 to 1,85,03,157 in 2009  a slide of just 2,56,535 votes. But it was a half-truth as the poll arithmetic had conveniently ignored the fact that the number of voters in the state had increased by more than 50 lakh between 2004 and 2009.        
	Amid the rhetoric of only a marginal loss in the number of votes secured, another important message  over 6.5 per cent reduction in vote share  got drowned. If the CPM state secretary was trying to hide the slide in the fronts support base in 2009, he decided to ignore the message from the mandates since the 2008 panchayat polls.         
	Of the 5,24,32000 voters across the state, 85,33,000 people had voted in this election. That represents only about 17 per cent of the voters. There is no question of advancing the Assembly elections, Bose thundered.         
	While there was a definite answer that the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government was determined to cling to power till May 2011, Bose looked evasive while explaining the reason behind the rout.         
	We will have to analyse the results in detail and find out the reasons behind the poor showing, Bose said.         
	Insiders in the party referred to an entire gamut of factors  from excessive reliance on the split between the Congress and Trinamul to failure to launch the rectification drive  responsible for the debacle.         
	Bose ruled out suggestions that the strategy of going soft on the Congress  Bhattacharjees penchant for playing the Congress against Trinamul is an open secret  had harmed the Left. He also claimed that the party had launched the rectification drive in line with its strategy.         
	We started the initiative in September but then the elections came. But we will continue with our efforts to get closer to the people, Bose said.         
	Does the party have enough time to make a change before it faces the final?         
	Bose was silent but the answer was written on the wall  the clock has started ticking.

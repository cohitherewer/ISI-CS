The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Puppet snub to Pillai
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Puppet snub to Pillai
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           Omar Abdullah		      
	Srinagar, Oct. 6: Omar Abdullah today lashed out at Union home secretary G.K. Pillai for making out-of-turn statements on Kashmir and told the Centre he was nobodys puppet.         
	We are not puppets of the Centre and such statements only undermine our institutions, the Jammu and Kashmir chief minister told the Assembly in a belated response to Pillais announcement of relaxation in curfew during Ramazan.        
	Omar was referring to Pillais statement during the Muslim holy month when the home secretary announced the relaxation through the media to facilitate offer of prayers at mosques.        
	It does not befit the Union home secretary to make statements about curfew in Kashmir. Even I do not talk about curfew nor does my DGP. It is the people on the ground who take decisions after reviewing the situation. Such statements only undermine our institutions and authority, he said.         
	The point Omar was trying to make was that such announcements should come from the state government, not from Delhi.        
	We are not puppets of the Centre, he reiterated, making it clear that neither he nor his council of ministers were being remote-controlled by the Centre. We take the decisions for our people.         
	The chief minister was also critical of the Centre for taking a decision on reopening of schools while announcing its eight-point programme to restore peace in the Valley, where four months of street protests have left more than hundred people dead.         
	The Centre consulted me on seven points but not on the education clause. Had they told me about including reopening of schools in the eight-point plan, I would have said no because it is a routine matter, he said, implying education was a local issue.

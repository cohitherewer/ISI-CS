          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 15: A contentious legislation allowing and regulating the entry of foreign educational institutions in India was approved today by the cabinet. It is likely to be introduced in Parliament when the House reconvenes in April after a recess.        
	The draft cleared by the cabinet retains a clause, opposed by a committee, which allows a proposed national council to exempt some foreign universities from most clauses of the bill.        
	The Foreign Educational Institutions (Regulation of Entry and Operations) bill was approved by the cabinet after retaining key changes made to the draft legislation in the past few weeks.         
	This is a milestone which will enhance choices, increase competition and benchmark quality. A larger revolution than even the telecom sector awaits us, human resource development minister Kapil Sibal said after the cabinet meeting.         
	The bill, which has repeatedly been relegated to the backburner because of political opposition or differences within the government, retains most changes suggested by a committee of secretaries set up late last year.        
	Foreign institutions will need to set aside a corpus of Rs 50 crore  raised from Rs 10 crore under pressure from the health ministry, as was reported by The Telegraph on December 26, 2009.         
	This corpus will be used to assist students and employees of a foreign varsity that winds up its Indian campus  either on its own or because it was found violating laws.        
	The bill cleared by the cabinet also contains a clause empowering the government to reject applications from foreign varsities over concerns of national security and sovereignty. The Prime Ministers Office had opposed this clause and it had been dropped but the home ministry insisted that it be re-inserted during the committees meetings.        
	But the cabinet has rejected a key recommendation of the committee. The bill allowed the regulatory authority  the proposed National Commission for Higher Education and Research  to exempt select foreign universities from most provisions.        
	The committee had opposed this clause and had recommended that it be dropped as it could lead to institutions quibbling and alleging bias towards varsities granted the exemption.        
	But the cabinet today decided to retain this clause, which means that the NCHER will have the power to exempt Harvard, for instance, from most clauses of the bill.        
	All foreign institutions, including those on the exemption list, will, however, have to follow one golden rule.         
	They cannot repatriate any earnings to their home country and must reinvest these into education in India.        
	HRD ministry sources have said the bill would be introduced in the Lok Sabha when the House meets after recess on April 12.         
	The ministry also hopes to acquire the cabinets seal for three other key reform bills punishing cheat colleges, setting up a new accreditation regime and establishing education tribunals later this week.        
	The three bills will be introduced in Parliament with the foreign varsity legislation, the sources said.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Wanted for brother, not blast
                                          
	Abdul Samad, labelled one of the main suspects in the Pune bakery blast by the home minister, was apparently never questioned by police on the case but quizzed about the whereabouts of his brother.        
	Samad, who got bail because no proof was found against him, on Tuesday appeared in a news conference (picture on left) with his lawyer Mubin Solkar. The youth was arrested at Mangalore airport on May 25. Union home minister P. Chidambaram said in a statement days after the arrest that Samad was one of the main suspects in the German Bakery blast in February that killed 17 people.        
	Solkar, however, said that Samad was arrested in connection with an illegal arms seizure case and was not shown as a suspect in the bakery blast case. Asked if Samad would seek legal action against the government for defaming him, Solkar said: No decision has been taken so far.        
	Solkar said the anti-terror squad wanted to know the whereabouts of Samads elder brother Mohammed Ahmed. Investigating agencies suspect Mohammed Ahmed is Yasin Bhatkal, one of the founder members of the Indian Mujahideen, said to be behind the blast.        
	Solkar said neither Samad nor his family was in touch with Ahmed since 2006 because of personal issues. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Health data private, President or not
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Health data private, President or not
                              Pratibha Patil                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 22: Want to know how the President is?         
	Sorry, we cant tell you.        
	The health of Presidents is sensitive personal data and the public isnt entitled to it, the Central Information Commission (CIC) has said. The August 13 order by commissioner Wajahat Habibullah appeared to suggest that such information was private data for any individual.        
	The commission, however, said the expenses borne for their treatment could be provided under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, but only if constitutional provisions warranted the disclosure of such information in the larger public interest.        
	Appellant Ashwini Shrivastava had asked for the health details of all Presidents, past and present, under the RTI Act. He had also asked how much the government had spent on their medical treatment.        
	On March 3, 2009, central public information officer (CPIO) Faiz Ahmad Kidwai refused to reveal the information. Kidwai said the information was personal information that had no relationship to any public activity or interest.        
	Shrivastava then toned down his demand, saying he only wanted information about President Pratibha Patil.        
	In May last year, the first appellate authority dismissed Shrivastavas appeal. The appellant has stated that since the medical expenditure is paid by the government, the citizens have a right to know, the appellate authority said.        
	On going through the case I find that the stand taken by the CPIO is in order. Apart from this, collection of this data would also derail the administrative machinery disproportionately.        
	Shrivastava then moved the CIC. But the transparency watchdog too upheld the CPIOs order, saying such information cannot also be sought by Parliament.         
	Commissioner Habibullah said the physical or mental health or condition of an individual would qualify as sensitive personal data and any disclosure would hence be deemed invasion of privacy.        
	A doctors observation with regard to a patient is a doctor-patient relationship that... (is) exempt (from disclosure), he said.        
	Habibullah, however, reserved a hearing to verify the constitutional provisions relating to disclosure of medical expenses.        
	The only question which could arguably allow for disclosure, given the fact that public money is involved, could be the final question on expenditure incurred by the government on treatment of the President, he said.        
	Earlier, too, the CIC had denied information related to physical and mental health of past and present Prime Ministers and details of their medical expenses.        
	 The medical care scheme for Prime Ministers is a classified document, the CIC had said.                    WRITTEN WITH A PTI REPORT

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Valley terror strike alert
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Valley terror strike alert
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Nov. 5: Jammu and Kashmir police have received inputs suggesting a possible fidayeen (suicide) attack in Srinagar during Barrack Obamas visit to the country.        
	According to the inputs, two to three militants are trying to sneak into Srinagar, where the last such strike was foiled in January this year when two Lashkar militants tried to storm a security camp and were killed.        
	Inputs indicate two to three unidentified terrorists in Malora, Palpora, Eidgah, Soura and Anchar areas of downtown Srinagar trying to sneak towards the civil lines area to carry out the suicide attack on police camps and vital installations, particularly on the eve of the VVIP (Obama) visit, a police note said.        
	Malora, on the outskirts of Srinagar, had seen a big encounter between militants and security forces last month. Three militants were killed in the gun battle, the first such incident in the city in nearly a year.        
	Police sources said militants wanted to send a message during Obamas visit that Kashmir remained a major trouble spot which needed to be addressed. Any such attack will grab attention, an officer said.         
	A unified command meeting  comprising top officers of the state police, central paramilitary forces and the army  was held recently to review security during the time Obama is in India.        
	Signature campaign        
	Separatists led by moderate Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umer Farooq are collecting two lakh signatures to seek Barrack Obamas intervention in resolving the Kashmir issue.

	Coimbatore, April 2 (PTI): MDMK general secretary Vaiko was arrested with about 100 party workers near Coimbatore on the way to Kerala.        
	Vaiko and his supporters have been protesting the construction of a dam on the Pamba river in Kerala, which provides water for irrigation to thousands of acres in Tamil Nadu.         
	Earlier, addressing party workers, Vaiko had said the construction of the dam would affect water supply to thousands of farmers in Tirupur district.         
	He threatened to block supply of essential commodities being transported to Kerala from Tamil Nadu if the construction of the dam continued.

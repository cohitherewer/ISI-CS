The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Raths roll out for poll battle
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Raths roll out for poll battle
          NALIN VERMA                          Nitish Kumar flags off a rath in Patna recently                                  
	Patna, May 17: Raths are the preferred vehicles of political parties here in the run-up to Assembly polls later this year.        
	Though senior leaders have stayed back at their headquarters apparently to innovate and fine-tune strategies, second or third-rung leaders have fanned out in the chariots through dusty lanes and bylanes of the hinterlands where temperatures are touching upwards of 40C.         
	Nitish Kumar  riding on the wave of vikas (development) and the coalition of the extremely backward classes (EBCs), Pasmanda Muslims and Mahadalits  is believed to be ahead of his rivals, at least for now. He is ahead in the number of raths, too, with the JD(U) sending out as many as five chariots across the state to spread the word about the governments success stories in the past four-and-a-half years.        
	The Bihar chief minister will be out for the third phase of his vishwas yatra (confidence journey) in a helicopter soon. But he has already flagged off swawlamban rath, aman rath and three more.         
	Not to be left behind, the BJP  credited with flagging off the original rath of party veteran L.K. Advani around 20 years ago  has also decided to send out naman rath to salute the people for bringing the NDA to power and urging them to retain the NDA in the state.        
	The Congress has sent out parivartan rath with the charioteers requesting the people to bring about parivartan, or change, in the political arena of the state. We want change. We want to replace the Nitish government, state Congress president Anil Sharma said, ignoring the fact that the party has been reduced to a group of squabbling individuals devoid of any mass base in the state.         
	No senior leader turned up to flag off Congresss parivartan rath.        
	With almost all parties taking out raths, how can Lalu Prasad  regarded as the states biggest showman  lag behind? He was the first state leader to popularise the idea of sending out raths by building the garib rath (an air-conditioned bus decorated with party flags) and moving around in it through Bihar in the early 1990s.        
	In fact, the real charioteer happens to be Advani, who came to the state in Ram rath in 1990 on his journey from Somnath to Ayodhya. Lalu Prasad, then chief minister, stopped the rath in the state, got Advani arrested and lodged him in a makeshift jail at Massanjore, now in Jharkhand, for five weeks.        
	The idea of rath hardly found favour with the no-nonsense persona of Nitish till the 2005 Assembly polls, which catapulted him to power.        
	The Congress  regarded as the party of elites and upper castes in this part of the country  also did not pay any attention to the idea of the rath till the last elections.        
	But raths, probably for the first time in the states poll campaign history, have become equally popular with almost all mainstream parties with D-Day drawing close. Only the poll results will tell whose rath proved to be the most effective.

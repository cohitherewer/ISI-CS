The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wary BJP on watch in Jharkhand
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Wary BJP on watch in Jharkhand
          OUR BUREAU                          Soren                                  
	New Delhi, May 31: A fresh spell of Presidents rule loomed on Jharkhand as central leaders of both the Congress and the BJP appeared wary of taking a shot at forming the government, a day after chief minister Shibu Soren stepped down.        
	Sources in the BJP, which had withdrawn support to the Soren regime, said the partys parliamentary board was expected to look afresh at the situation at a meeting on Friday. Till then, it would stick to its stand of not looking at forming a government.        
	The central Congress leader in charge of Jharkhand left the decision to the governor, who has sent a report on the volatile situation in the state. We are not interested in forming the government, K. Keshava Rao told The Telegraph this evening.         
	It is now up to the governor to decide the future course of action, he added, hinting that the high command was resigned to a brief period of central rule, barely six months after Sorens ascension had ended the last spell.        
	Soren, who came to power last December, backed by the BJP, stepped down yesterday. The resignation capped 33 days of uncertainty since he voted against a cut motion moved by the BJP in the Lok Sabha on April 27.        
	A BJP source in Ranchi said the party would keenly monitor the movements of the other political actors. From aspiring to lead a government, the BJPs goalpost had shifted to saving its flock of 18 MLAs from a predatory Congress. This is our immediate priority, a Jharkhand leader said.         
	The source said party leaders in Delhi had received reports that the Congress was trying to woo the MLAs through former BJP chief minister Babulal Marandi, prompting general secretary Ramlal to contact each legislator and coax assurances of loyalty from them.         
	Sources said senior leaders L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and Murli Manohar Joshi were against any truck with the unreliable Sorens. With so many heavyweights against any kind of adventurism, it is unlikely (party chief Nitin) Gadkari would want to attempt anything again, a source said.        
	We have withdrawn support, spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said. At the moment we are not looking at forming a government in Jharkhand but we are also closely watching the Congresss movements.        
	Sources in the Congress said the central leadership felt the only feasible option was Presidents rule. The governors report also said Presidents rule would be the sole option if no party came up with majority support, the case so far.        
	But state Congress leaders still prefer a democratic government. The high command is not in the picture, a Jharkhand leader told The Telegraph from Ranchi. If we manage the numbers, we will approach them.Sources said the apparent disconnect between the high command and the state leadership was a carefully crafted strategy aimed at insulating the party from the type of embarrassment the BJP has faced in dealing with Sorens JMM.

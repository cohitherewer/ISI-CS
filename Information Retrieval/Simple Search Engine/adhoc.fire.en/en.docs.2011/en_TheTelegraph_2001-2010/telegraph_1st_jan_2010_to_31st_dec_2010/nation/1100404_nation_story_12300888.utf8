          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                    
	New Delhi, April 3: Suhas, 14, took his friends help to drag a young man into an empty water tank, strangle him and smash his face with a stone  all for the sake of family honour, police said.        
	Victim Bunty, 20, had unsuccessfully proposed to Suhass elder sister in a public place, thus apparently bringing shame to her family, which belongs to a different caste.        
	Delhi police have arrested Suhas and his friends Sunil, 17, and Arun, 22, a dentists assistant for the March 29 murder.        
	Buntys body was found on March 30, the day a Haryana court sentenced five people to death for an honour killing while a young couple were shot dead in Punjab for marrying against their families wishes.        
	Two weeks earlier, Suhas and his friends had called Bunty to a spot near the railway tracks in their central Delhi locality and slashed him with a razor, an officer said.        
	Suhas was angry that his family name was being tarnished by Bunty, who had proposed to his sister in a busy marketplace. His anger was apparent in the way they killed him, the officer said.        
	Bunty was beaten with sticks and taken to the empty water tank and pushed inside. The three accused also went down the 25ft-deep tank. They strangled Bunty with a shirt and then crushed his face, hoping he wouldnt be recognised. We have recovered blood-stained sticks and a blood-stained handkerchief from them.        
	During the investigation, the police discovered that Bunty was trying to court a local girl who didnt reciprocate his overtures, and that the girls family had threatened him after he proposed to her. When we questioned the girls family, we noticed several contradictions in their versions. Simultaneously, we received a tip-off that the murder had been committed by one of the girls minor brothers and his friends, the officer said.        
	The accused have confessed, the police claimed.

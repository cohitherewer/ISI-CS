  - former minister could influence witnesses: CBI          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Amit Shah is hugged by his mother-in-law after his release from Ahmedabad Central Jail   on Friday night. (PTI)                                      
	New Delhi, Oct. 30: The Supreme Court today told former Gujarat junior home minister Amit Shah to leave the state by tomorrow, after throwing out his lawyers plea to let him celebrate Diwali at home.        
	A two-judge bench of Justices Aftab Alam and R.M. Lodha also asked Shah, accused of masterminding the conspiracy to eliminate alleged extortionist Sohrabuddin Sheikh, to reply by November 12 why his bail shouldnt be scrapped.        
	The BJP leader, in jail for the past few months, had been granted bail yesterday by Gujarat High Court. Today, the CBI challenged the bail in the apex court, saying Shah wielded enormous clout in the state and could use the freedom to intimidate witnesses.        
	At an in-camera hearing at Justice Alams residence here, the top court issued the notice asking Shah why his bail shouldnt be cancelled but didnt reverse the high court order.         
	Shahs battery of lawyers had pleaded with the court not to cancel his bail so he could celebrate Diwali at home on November 5.         
	But the court said Diwali is also celebrated in other places, and asked Shahs lawyers whether he would agree to leave Gujarat till it decided whether to cancel the bail.         
	The lawyers conferred briefly among themselves before assuring the court that the former minister would leave Gujarat tomorrow.        
	The hearing took place at Justice Alams residence because courts close for the weekend on Fridays. Moreover, the Diwali vacation had kicked in from yesterday and courts will remain closed the next week.        
	Shah, booked on several counts such as conspiracy to murder, abduction and causing disappearance of evidence in connection with the November 2005 staged encounter death of Sohrabuddin, will reply to the court notice by November 12.        
	The CBI will then file its rejoinder before the court takes up the case on November 15.        
	Speaking to reporters outside the judges house, CBI counsel K.T.S. Tulsi said the agency had argued that Shah was an influential man and shouldnt be allowed a free run in Gujarat to ensure the protection of witnesses. The CBI petition mentioned one Azam Khan who had been forced to retract a statement against Shah.         
	The former minister, released last night, was granted bail on the condition that he deposit his passport and report to the CBI office in Mumbai once a month. He had to also execute a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh and a surety of a similar amount.

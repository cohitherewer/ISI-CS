                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      PC plays Maoist card at Telangana meet
          OUR BUREAU                          Chiranjeevi in Delhi to attend the all-party meeting on Telangana on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 5: Home minister P. Chidambaram today appealed to political parties in Andhra Pradesh to resolve the Telangana tangle and bring back peace if they didnt want Maoists to take advantage of the turmoil in the state.        
	I wish to caution all political parties that there are forces waiting in the wings who ridicule the parliamentary form of democracy and who would be happy if we collectively fail to find answers to the issues that concern us he said. we should not give any room for these forces to gain strength or credence.        
	The comments came at a meeting the minister had with eight political parties from the state.        
	The warning appeared to have had an effect. Chidambaram managed to extract a joint appeal for peace and harmony from the first such meeting on Telangana which was not expected to yield much in the face of divergent views among the participating parties.        
	An appeal issued after the four-hour meeting said: We, representatives of eight recognised political parties of Andhra Pradesh attended the meeting convened by the home minister. We have expressed our views at the meeting and they have been noted by the central government. It is our earnest appeal that peace, harmony and law and order should be maintained in the state.        
	No party suggested setting up a Second States Re-organisation Commission.        
	The meetings agenda was simply to deliberate on the mechanism and lay down a road map for the consultations (on Telangana). But couched within it were grave signals that Maoists were trying to hijack the movement and use it for their own ends.        
	Senior home ministry officials said there had been an upsurge in Maoist involvement in the Telengana movement. Over a couple of weeks there has been an increase in their involvement. Their people were seen in the Osmania University hall also, an official said, referring to the student protests for statehood.        
	The top Maoist leadership, including general secretary Ganapathy, belongs to Telangana.        
	Chidambarams subtle hints to the Andhra leaders of parties that included the Congress, TDP, TRS, CPM, CPI, BJP and the MIM came with a reference to Indias democratic system.        
	The founding fathers believed  and we believe that parliamentary democracy is the best form of representative government and has the capacity to find solutions to all issues and problems. Debate, discussion and consultation are the best means to resolve differences and find answers, he said.        
	After the meeting, he told reporters no one was against further consultations and that he would meet the Prime Minister and other senior cabinet colleagues before getting back to the Andhra leaders with the governments response. I will come up with a decision or a statement of the government, he said.        
	Sources said the government was unlikely to make any commitment in haste and there could be more meetings.        
	Chidambaram said many parties suggested further consultations to be completed within a specific time frame. A mechanism has to be evolved and the Centre would act on the sense of the meeting and take it forward.        
	On the time frame, he said: Reasonable.         
	Asked whether there would be a Telangana after all, the home minister said: We are trying to help political parties of Andhra Pradesh to find the answer to the issues of the state. We are here to help.

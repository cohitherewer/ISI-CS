The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Muslim cell soft on women bill
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Muslim cell soft on women bill
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY AND RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	March 21: The womens reservation bill passed another hurdle on Friday with the conservative but influential All India Muslim Personal Law Board taking a conciliatory stand on the legislation, dealing a blow to the opponents of the quota.         
	The board, which met at Aishbagh, on the outskirts of Lucknow, began its three-day deliberations with moderate chief Maulana Rabey Nadvi asking for a better deal for women.         
	In his presidential address, Nadvi spoke about the need to accord greater importance to women in all spheres, particularly in matters of inheritance, marriage and reforms within the Muslim society.         
	The true spirit of Islam is in giving honour and respect to women who often do not get their dues, said Nadvi, the rector of the renowned Islamic seminary Nadwatul-Ulema.        
	His remarks are in sharp contrast to that of board member and hawkish Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawwad, who had last week bitterly opposed womens representation in politics, saying they were best capable of being mothers of politicians.        
	The boards reluctance to oppose the bill is a setback to many, from Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad to Mamata Banerjee, who have described the legislation as detrimental to Muslim women.        
	Sources said the executive body had an informal discussion before the formal session where some office-bearers had highlighted the need for a quota within the quota. But Nadvi shelved it on the ground that the board should restrict itself with protection and preservation of the Islamic shariah instead of taking a political position on key issues of the day.        
	In 1986, the board had opposed a Supreme Court verdict according maintenance rights to divorced Muslim woman Shah Bano. The board, then headed by Nadvis uncle Maulana Ali Mian, had approached Rajiv Gandhi, the Prime Minister of the day, to overturn the judgement on grounds that maintenance beyond three months of divorce was against the shariah, which viewed marriage as a social contract.        
	Board secretary Abdul Raheem Qureshi too explained that it was not the proper platform to discuss a sensitive and potentially political issue like the womens reservation bill.         
	Zafaryub Jilani, a radical member of the board, said: We say no to any reference to the womens reservation bill. If any member decides to raise it, he would not be allowed to speak, he said.        
	If the UPA earned a reprieve of sorts on the quota law, it came under severe flak for pushing the Prevention of Communal Violence Bill 2010.         
	The boards general body felt that the legislation being showcased by the UPA as throwing a ring of security on minorities has failed to fix accountability for communal riots and avoided any reference on there habilitation of riot victims.

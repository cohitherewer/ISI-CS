The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Military kept out   of Maoist combat
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Military kept out   of Maoist combat
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                     
	New Delhi, June 11: The cabinet committee on security has ruled out using the armed forces against the Maoists and decided that the states should strengthen their police forces instead.        
	The committee has also decided to involve the chief ministers of the Maoist-hit states in the evolution of a new strategy to combat the guerrillas. The chief ministers will be invited to the committees next meeting, expected on June 17, sources said.         
	The Union home ministry will therefore have to act according to its limited mandate by supporting the states and putting the bulk of the responsibility on them.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram is understood to have changed tack at Thursdays meeting of the cabinet committee on security after his plans to use the army and air force met with resistance from the defence forces, particularly the army.        
	It was decided that the armed forces would not play any role beyond training the paramilitary and state police forces, sources said. The defence forces will not be used in anti-Maoist operations. That is final, a top official said.        
	Police stations will now be strengthened in Maoist-affected states, home ministry officials said. Chidambaram has already appealed to these states to double their police recruitment. The paramilitary forces will now be better funded and equipped.         
	Since the air force has few helicopters to spare, the paramilitary will outsource choppers from private companies for transport, rescue and evacuation.        
	Instead of using the armys bomb disposal squads and de-mining teams, the home ministry will hire former servicemen specialising in this field, including the sappers (army engineers).        
	Security expert Ajai Sahni said: I am very happy. Had the army been deployed even in a limited way, it would have been even more disastrous than the last year and a half.        
	The CRPF now has 48 battalions in the Maoist-hit states. The break-up: Andhra Pradesh (4), Madhya Pradesh (1), Chhattisgarh (14), Bihar (4), Bengal (5), Orissa (4), Jharkhand (11), Maharashtra (4) and Uttar Pradesh (1).

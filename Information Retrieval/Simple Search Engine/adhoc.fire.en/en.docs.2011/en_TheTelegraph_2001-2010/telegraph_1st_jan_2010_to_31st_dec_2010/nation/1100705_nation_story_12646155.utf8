The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Scribe a rebel, say Maoists
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Scribe a rebel, say Maoists
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Azads body is carried at his funeral in Adilabad on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	Hyderabad, July 4: Hemachandra Pandey, the freelance journalist killed with Maoist leader Azad in a police operation on Friday, had been a cadre for the past nine years, the rebels said today.        
	A faxed message to a journalist, purportedly from Ajay, a member of the CPI (Maoist) north committee, said Pandey had joined the party in 2001 and been inducted into the north committee in 2005.        
	Its not clear why the rebels would reveal this instead of insisting the police had killed an innocent journalist who was interviewing Azad. However, Maoist spokesman Gudsa Usendi too confirmed that the 35-year-old Pandey, from Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand, was a party member.        
	If the contents of the fax are true, it would mean Pandey became a Maoist before he became a journalist. Media professionals in Uttarakhand had said yesterday that Pandey, who did not have official accreditation, had been carrying out assignments for newspapers and news channels for seven years.        
	A senior police officer in Adilabad, where the encounter that killed Azad and Pandey took place, reacted cautiously to the faxed message. We dont know if Pandey was a Maoist. We have asked Uttarakhand police to probe the matter, he said.                    
	Uttarakhands police and journalists, however, have already confirmed that Pandey was at least a Maoist sympathiser.        
	Azad was cremated in Hyderabad this afternoon in the presence of his family, rights activists and admirers. Maoist sympathiser and poet Varavara Rao said that in his last interview to Pandey, Azad had urged the Centre to observe the Geneva Convention norms during counter-rebel operations.        
	Azad wanted the government to desist from harassing the tribals or evicting them from the forests after the so-called Operation Green Hunt, Rao said.        
	The Geneva Convention, which relates to armed conflicts, seeks to protect those who are not --- or are no longer --- taking part in hostilities, such as civilians, wounded or sick fighters, prisoners of war and medical and religious personnel.

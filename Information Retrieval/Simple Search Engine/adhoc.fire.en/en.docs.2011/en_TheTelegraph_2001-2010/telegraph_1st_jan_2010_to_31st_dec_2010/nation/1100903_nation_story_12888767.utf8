          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, Sept. 2: The state administration will recommend a CBI probe into alleged misappropriation of a police secret service fund in tune with a high court observation that asked it to act according to the Constitution.        
	Governors adviser V.S. Dubey said the state would recommend the CBI probe in a day or two. The draft letter was ready. It was delayed as the chief secretary was in Delhi to attend an official meeting. It will be sent to the premier agency, possibly tomorrow, he told The Telegraph.        
	The administration swung into action to order a CBI probe after hearing a PIL on August 28, Jharkhand High Court refused to intervene in the case, saying the state was open to take action in this regard and that it should discharge its constitutional duties.        
	In its affidavit in the high court, the home department had said that the state would have no objection if the court ordered a CBI probe into the alleged scam running into Rs 8.10 crore.        
	The court, in turn, observed that it was the constitutional duty of the state administration to set its house in order. In a report to the court, chief secretary Ashok Kumar Singh had recommended a probe by an independent agency into the alleged scam.        
	Deputy accountant general M. Roy Malakar had also pleaded for a CBI probe in his affidavit to the court. He argued that misappropriation of funds could not be ruled out, as it was a hefty sum that was withdrawn at the fag end of the financial year.        
	Meanwhile, Dubey indicated that the state would reconstitute Jharkhand State Electricity Board. A couple of days earlier, a Supreme Court order had reinstated H.B. Lal as the chairman of the power board, to the dismay of the administration.        
	Legal experts, however, said that Raj Bhavan would find it difficult to replace Lal as the apex court directive had made it amply clear that Lals continuance in the post of chairman is subject to the ultimate decision of the government. But the state will take the decision in accordance with section 5(5) of the Electricity Act, 1948 and rule 4 of Bihar Electricity Board Rules, 1960, also applicable to Jharkhand.        
	Under rule 4(3) of the Bihar Electricity Board Rules, the chairman and other members shall hold office for a period not exceeding five years, pointed out former advocate general Anil Sinha.        
	Following a Jharkhand High Court order, the then governor Syed Sibtey Razi had removed Lal on April 29 last year. Lal was appointed on September 27, 2008.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Aamir appeal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Aamir appeal
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 18: Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal has asked Aamir Khan to rejoin a Bollywood panel on proposed Copyright Act amendments a day after the actor resigned following a spat with co-member and lyricist Javed Akhtar.        
	Sibal spoke to Aamir last evening after other members of the panel, including Akhtar, wrote to the minister stating that they wanted the actor back on the committee and did not doubt his integrity.         
	Aamir assured me that he would seriously consider my appeal (on rejoining the panel), Sibal said today.         
	We would definitely like Aamir to continue on this committee, the letter says.        
	But the letter also confirms the sharp differences between the members of the panel, which was set up to present a united Bollywood view on the proposed amendments to the government.

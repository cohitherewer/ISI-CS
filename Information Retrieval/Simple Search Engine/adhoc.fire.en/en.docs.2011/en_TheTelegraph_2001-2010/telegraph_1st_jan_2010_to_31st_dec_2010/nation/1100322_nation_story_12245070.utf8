	March 21 (PTI): Maoists killed two persons in two neighbouring districts in Orissa suspecting them to be police informers.        
	The victim in Malkangiri, identified as Nityananda Nag (50), was forcibly taken away from his house by a group of ultras late last night and his body was found this morning near Kutuguda in Kalimela area, about 50km from Malkangiri district headquarters, police said.        
	Nags head had been smashed with some blunt object, said a police officer, adding that the body had been sent for post-mortem. A couple of banners and Maoist posters were found near his body opposing any special operation by the security forces against the Left-wing extremists. Patrolling has been intensified and combing operation launched in the area after the incident.         
	In Koraput, the rebels gunned down a 30-year-old man early today. The bullet-riddled body of the unidentified victim was recovered near Balipeta. The police said a group of five armed Maoists stormed into the village, about 86km from Koraput town, last night and ordered five villagers to follow them to a nearby forest for a meeting.        
	The Maoists later freed the four villagers but took away the youth and gunned him down.        
	Meanwhile, traffic between Laxmipur-Narayanpatna and Narayanpatna-Bandhugaon was hit today because of road blockades by Maoists ahead of their two-day bandh from tomorrow. The bandh is in protest against Operation Greenhunt.

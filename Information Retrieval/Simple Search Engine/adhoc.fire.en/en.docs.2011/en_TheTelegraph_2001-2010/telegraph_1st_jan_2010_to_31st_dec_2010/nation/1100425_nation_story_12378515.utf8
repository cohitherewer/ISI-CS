	KG Balakrishnan, the Chief Justice of India, lays the foundation stone for a Supreme Court annexe that will solve the problem of space crunch in the countrys apex court.         
	We were suffocating for space for the last several years. The Supreme Court staff has been working in a miserable and pitiable condition. This building would be a great asset for the Supreme Court, the CJI said.        
	The building, which will come up in three years, will stand opposite the apex court and spread over an area of around 12 acres.       -PTI

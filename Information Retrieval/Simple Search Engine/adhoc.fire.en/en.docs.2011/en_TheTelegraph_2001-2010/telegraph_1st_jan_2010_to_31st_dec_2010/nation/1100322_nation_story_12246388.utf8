	New Delhi, March 21: The National Human Rights Commission has recommended that the Maharashtra government pay Rs 5 lakh each to the families of two persons who died in anti-migrant clashes in 2008 and chided it for lack of political will to rein in divisive forces.         
	The Maharashtra government failed to take timely action for the protection of citizens in the wake of a hate campaign launched against migrants by the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena activists in the state. The commission recommends that the state government pay Rs 5 lakh each to the next of kin of Vinod Singh and Amba Das who lost their lives in mob violence in Mumbai and adjoining areas in Maharashtra, the NHRC said.         
	The commissions recommendation came in these two specific incidents of violence unleashed by MNS activists in February 2008.         
	Singh, a security guard, was killed when the workers colony in Nashik, where he stayed, was attacked by MNS activists.         
	Das died after a fatal injury caused during stone-pelting by a mob. The activists targeted the bus carrying Das and his colleagues of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited on the Mumbai-Nashik highway.         
	Both incidents happened on February 13, 2008.         
	The recommendation to the state government, which has paid Rs 1 lakh to the two families, is not binding. However, state governments generally pay so that the aggrieved parties do not drag the matter to court.         
	The commission took up the matter on its own after seeing media coverage on February 14 and 15 and issued a notice to the chief secretary of the Maharashtra government on February 18 seeking a factual report on the incidents of violence.

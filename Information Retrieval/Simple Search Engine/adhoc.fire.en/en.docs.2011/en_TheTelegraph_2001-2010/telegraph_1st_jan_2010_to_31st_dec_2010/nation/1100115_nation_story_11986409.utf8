The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong Meira row escalates

          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Jan. 14: The chief of a Dalit outfit today filed an FIR against Congress leader Jagdish Tytler and Bihar unit president Anil Sharma for referring to the Lok Sabha Speaker as a chamar, as the war over inducting Meira Kumar escalated.        
	Kumar was named as a permanent invitee to the faction-ridden state units executive committee and a list, released in Patna a few days ago, mentioned every office-bearers caste, inclu- ding that of the Speaker who was described as a chamar.        
	Her inclusion came as another fodder for the dissen-ters who want Tytler, the Congress central leader in charge of Bihar affairs, and Sharma to be immediately sacked.        
	Vidhan Chandra Rana, president of the Bihar Dalit Kranti Morcha, lodged the FIR under Section 3 of the Scheduled Caste Repression Act, 1989.        
	As a Dalit I feel hurt at Jagdish Tytler and Anil Sharma putting the name of the caste ahead of the names of senior leaders of our society, including Meira Kumar the FIR said.        
	Rana is believed to have the backing of the dissidents, who also point out that anybody holding a constitutional post ceases to be a party member.         
	But the release of the list, signed by Sharma and Tytler, has apparently embarr- assed the party high command, too.        
	Sources said party chief Sonia Gandhi had reportedly admonished the two leaders for doing things against the ethics of the party.        
	According to the sources, over 10 Congress dissidents, including three former state unit chiefs and the current legislative party leader, Ashok Kumar, have gone to Delhi to meet Sonia.

          ARCHIS MOHAN                             Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni will go to see the Taj, of course, but not with shutterbugs buzzing around them.         
	The French, Delhi has sensed, are worried that their First Couples much-talked-about chemistry may hog more media mileage than the deals the delegation will sign in India.        
	Only one photographer will accompany the French President and his model-singer-actress wife to the Taj and Fatehpur Sikri. This is a concession Delhi has extracted for the December 4-7 visit. The Sarkozys will visit the Taj on December 5.        
	Their visit to the Taj would have made the defining visuals of the visit.        
	But the worry of the French officials may not be unfounded because Sarkozy and Carla have made news for all kinds of reasons. For example, when Sarkozy decided to call his new private jet Carla One. That was July 2009.        
	In May the same year, Carla patted Sarkozys derrire while giving interviews to a room full of journalists. She also wiped sweat from his face after Sarkozy said he had been working out.        
	Last December, Sarkozy confronted a radio presenter for asking Carla: Would you love him so much if he wasnt President of France?        
	Sarkozy told journalist Marc-Olivier Fogiel: I dont appreciate the way you spoke to my wife. It was a clumsy question. I wont forget about it.        
	The couple have also been lampooned on the American TV show The Simpsons.         
	The specific reason for the French request is unclear but it seems officials there are worried the media coverage of the famed First chemistry may overshadow other possible successes of the trip.         
	While Sarkozys itinerary has been made public, his wifes is a secret. All the French would say today is that the First Lady will accompany her husband to most of his official engagements.         
	In New Delhi, Carla is expected to visit Safdarjung Hospital. She is an ambassador of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. Carla will visit the hospitals Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission Centre, which is supported by the National AIDS Control Organisation and Unicef.         
	She will later visit Naz Foundation, an NGO working in the field of HIV/AIDS and sexual health.         
	The French hope to sign several agreements during the visit, particularly in the sectors of space and nuclear technology.         
	The two sides are likely to ink an agreement under which French company Areva will supply six nuclear reactors to India for a 10,000MW plant at Jaitapur in Maharashtra. The contract for two reactors could to be signed during this visit.         
	The French are concerned about provisions in Indias nuclear liability law that makes a supplier liable to pay damages in case of a nuclear accident.         
	The fact that we are discussing with India on civil nuclear liability question is of course very important for us. It is important for us that legal security of the suppliers is ensured in accordance with international standards, a French official said.

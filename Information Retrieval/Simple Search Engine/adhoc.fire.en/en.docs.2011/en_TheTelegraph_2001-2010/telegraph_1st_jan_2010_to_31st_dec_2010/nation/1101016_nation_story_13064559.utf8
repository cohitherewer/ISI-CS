The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Attack alert on hockey day
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Attack alert on hockey day
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 15: Terror strikes on the Commonwealth Games were expected on October 12, when India won the nail-biting hockey semi-final, and October 13, government sources said.        
	On October 10, the government received a detailed report from a foreign agency, which said several teams of Lashkar-e-Toiba and al Qaida men from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan had been trained to attack specific targets in Delhi.        
	The report listed the weapons suspected to be used and number of men trained in the Af-Pak region. The gymnastics and table tennis venues were among those under threat, the sources said.        
	Terrorists were expected to enter in different groups from West Asia, Bangladesh and the porous border with Nepal and carry out attacks at Games venues and a hotel, a senior government official said.        
	Authorities in neighbouring countries and Indian embassies were immediately alerted.        
	In Delhi, security was stepped up with one more manpower layer added a kilometre from every venue. The home ministry brought in 1,200 more personnel and eight top city hotels got more security. Every food packet was checked by policemen and, in one case, as many as 80 trucks of sand were checked shovel by shovel for hidden grenades or time bombs.        
	Every little input was discussed by the International Security Liaison Group that was holding daily meetings since September 15.         
	Earlier this month, CIA chief Leon Panetta met home minister P. Chidambaram during his visit to Delhi and discussed the threat perception.        
	It could have been a shoot-out in a frontal attack and the weapons would be such that could break open into a venue, a senior official said.        
	Home ministry sources said every little detail was seen from a security prism. The Interpol had provided a database of suspected terrorists that was matched with every passenger entering India through any of the international airports in October.        
	National Security Guard teams had already taken on loan about 40 ZU anti-aircraft guns from the army, fearing attacks from paragliding terrorists. More snipers were stationed on rooftops.         
	The kitchens of seven caterers hired for the Games had a team of 12 policemen checking their burgers and chana-masala for safety before sending locked trucks to the cargo-screening depot.        
	All the while, the security establishment was busy taking care of hundreds of cyber attacks on Games software from groups suspected to be in China. A cyber control room was set up to neutralise the daily attacks.        
	The Games are over, but the police havent let their guard down.         
	They are on the hunt for a module of eight terrorists suspected to be behind the Jama Masjid attack in the Games run-up, in which a Taiwanese tourist was injured.        
	Peeping UAV        
	An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) of the air force was almost shot down after it descended so low over the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony that troops mistook it as a threat.         
	PTI quoted sources as saying the aerial vehicle had probably descended below the prescribed 6,000 feet so that its controllers could get a peep into the October 3 spectacle.

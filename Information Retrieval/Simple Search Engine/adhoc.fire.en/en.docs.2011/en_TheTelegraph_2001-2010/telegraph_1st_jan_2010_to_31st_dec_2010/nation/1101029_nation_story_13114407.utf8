          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: The Union environment ministry said today that it had not issued any coastal regulation zone clearance or a no-objection certificate to the 31-storey residential complex in south Mumbai allegedly built on navy land.         
	Activists in Mumbai have alleged that state officials had ignored coastal regulatory laws and allowed construction of Adarsh Housing Society, a 103-flat complex in which defence officers and bureaucrats own apartments.         
	The environment ministry had informed Maharashtras urban development department in March 2003 that all construction activity in the coastal regulation zone at that time was the responsibility of the Maharashtra State Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA).         
	For coastal regulation zone clearance, the project proponent needed to have submitted the proposal with details of the construction and the classification under the coastal regulation zone area to the MCZMA, the ministry said.         
	It said the letter it had sent to Maharashtras urban development department had only clarified that the ministry had delegated powers on coastal regulation zones to the state government.         
	But the ministry in April 2003 withdrew the states power to grant clearances under coastal regulation zone requirements for projects beyond Rs 5 crore because states were misusing their powers, the ministry said.         
	Defence minister A.K. Antony has asked the army and the navy to examine the allegations.

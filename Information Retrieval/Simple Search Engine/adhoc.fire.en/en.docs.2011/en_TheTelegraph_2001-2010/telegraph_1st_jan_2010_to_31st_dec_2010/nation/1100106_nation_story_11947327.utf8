          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 5: The Supreme Court will decide whether lawyers can insist that clients continue with their services even if they do not wish to.         
	A bench headed by Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan issued notices on a petition filed by the Uttar Pradesh government against a high court order asking the state to continue with the services of district public prosecutor Ashok Kumar Nigam.         
	Some other lawyers had also gone to the high court challenging a move by the state government to replace them as counsel after a change of regime. Acting on their plea, the high court stayed the states move, though it is a normal practice to replace lawyers representing a state each time a new government takes charge.         
	The Uttar Pradesh government then appealed before the apex court and got the high court stayed in Nigams case. Appearing for the state, solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium said: Lawyers should step down the moment a client even drops a hint that he should go.         
	The state said Nigam was appointed as a district public prosecutor and the term of such a prosecutor under the state rules was for a year initially.         
	Once the performance of the appointee is assessed, the term may be extended to three years. The appointment could be terminated by either side without giving a reason, the rules say.         
	The high court has failed to appreciate that engaging a counsel was purely a matter of trust and confidence, the Uttar Pradesh governments appeal said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lash after lash on loan-shark ally Vilasrao
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lash after lash on loan-shark ally Vilasrao
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          Vilasrao Deshmukh                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: The Supreme Court today condemned former Maharashtra chief minister and current Union heavy industries minister Vilasrao Deshmukh for instructing police not to lodge criminal cases against a moneylender MLA who allegedly harassed farmers for dues in the states suicide belt.         
	This court is extremely anguished to see that such an instruction could come from the CM of a state which is governed under a Constitution which resolves to constitute India into a socialist (state), a two-judge bench said.        
	The chief ministers instructions are so incongruous and anachronistic, being in defiance of all logic and reason, that our conscience is deeply disturbed. We condemn the same in no uncertain terms, the bench of Justices G.S. Singhvi and Asok Kumar Ganguly said.        
	The apex court dismissed the states appeal against a high court order quashing the then chief ministers instructions not to file cases against an MLA accused of lending money to farmers at 10 per cent interest.         
	The court has also raised to Rs 10 lakh from Rs 25,000 a fine imposed by the high court on the Maharashtra government. The fine, to be paid within six weeks, will be used to help poor farmers in the state.        
	Farmer Sarangdhar Shivdassingh Chavan had accused the MLA of charging him an interest rate of 10 per cent on the money lent. He had claimed that the state machinery was ruthless towards the farmers, but was filing no cases against the moneylenders.         
	The farmer from Vidarbha said officials were following an order passed by the collector who was acting under the chief ministers instructions.        
	The high court had then quashed the collectors order. The state appealed against this decision. Over 74 instances of harassment of farmers have been cited against Congress MLA Dilip Kumar Sananda and his family. First, the chief ministers principal secretary made enquiries with the police station about the cases registered against him.         
	Then the chief minister, without any verification, issued instructions that the complaints should be first placed before the district anti-moneylending committee. The committee was supposed to obtain the legal opinion of the district government pleader and take action.        
	The camouflage of sophistry used by Vilasrao Deshmukh in the instructions given by him and the affidavit filed in this court is clearly misleading. The message to the authorities was loud and clear i.e. they were not to take the complaints against the Sananda family seriously and not to proceed against them, Justice Singhvi said in his judgment.        
	The committee was set up under the Bombay Moneylenders Act to protect farmers against the unscrupulous and not for protecting wrong-doers, the judge noted.        
	Cases involving pervasive misuse of public office for private gains, which have come to light in the last few decades, tend to shake peoples confidence and one is constrained to think that India has freed itself from British colonialism only to come in the grip of a new class which tries to rule by the same colonial principles, Justice Singhvi said in his stinging indictment of the then chief ministers conduct.        
	The judgment recorded that Deshmukh had called the collector and asked him not to file complaints against the MLA and he had passed it on to the SP of Buldhana district.        
	Justice Ganguly said the chief ministers instructions to give special treatment to Sanandas family had no precedent in law or public administration.         
	Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh as CM of Maharashtra is expected to know that the farmers of the state, especially those in the Vidarbha region, are going through a great deal of suffering and hardship in the hands of moneylenders, he said.         
	The chief minister acted solely on political considerations to screen the MLA from the normal process of law, the court said.         
	The court added: The action of the CM is completely contrary to the constitutional promise of equality and also the preambular resolve of social and economic justice.        
	As CM of the state, Deshmukh has taken a solemn oath of allegiance to the Constitution but the directions which he gave are wholly unconstitutional and seek to subvert the constitutional norms of equality and social justice.         
	The court recorded that of the 74 cases, chargesheets were filed in only seven. The rest of the cases were either withdrawn or settled through compromise, the court said, wondering in how many cases, investigation was scuttled because of Deshmukhsinstructions.

          RASHEED KIDWAI                                              Rahul Gandhi    
	Bhopal, Jan. 21: The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh has pulled up the vice-chancellor of the state-run Devi Ahilyabai University in Indore for allowing students to interact with Rahul Gandhi without clearance on Monday.        
	Madhya Pradesh higher education department secretary Ashish Upadhya today asked vice-chancellor A.S. Sehrawat to explain why he had not taken clearance before inviting a politician.         
	The notice came hours after Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the BJP-affiliated students wing, accused the AICC general secretary of politicising academic campuses. BJP national secretary Prabhat Jha, too, had demanded a clarification from university authorities for letting Rahul unleash a political discourse.        
	Is Rahul Gandhi running special classes on political philosophy that every student will benefit from? Why should university authorities be providing him a forum to indulge in some idle and amateurish talk? Jha asked.        
	Sources said a section of the BJP and the RSS had opposed chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhans liberal stand on Rahul, which they thought allowed the Congress leader a free run. The aggrieved BJP members prevailed upon state higher education minister Laxmikant Sharma to slap a notice on Sehrawat, two days after Rahuls visit to the state.        
	Chauhan was in Delhi and was unavailable for comment.        
	Sehrawat, however, remained unfazed. Rahul Gandhi was invited in the capacity of a member of Parliament and not as a Congress general secretary. He was presented as a youth icon and the event was strictly restricted to the university staff and students. IIT and IIM students were also present. The event was for the students interest, he said.         
	State Congress chief Suresh Pachuri said the BJP was making an issue out of nothing. Is the BJP afraid of Rahuljis growing popularity that it is applying pressure on the university authorities? he asked.         
	At the Indore university, Rahul had asked teachers and students to define politics. When he failed to get a satisfactory answer even from IIM Indore director N. Ravichandran, he said: I consider politics as a process that determines the countrys direction. How can such politics be separate from development? Politics and development are two sides of the same coin.         
	On his two-day visit to the state, Rahul had interacted with students of several other universities.        
	In Bundelkhands Sagar city, Rahul called upon the youth to join politics. During one interaction at Sagar, a student told the leader that the National Student Union of India (NSUI), the student wing of the Congress, was good for nothing as it disrupted classes.         
	Rahul promised that henceforth all NSUI office bearers would be democratically elected. You will get the kind of leader you choose, he said.        
	In Gwalior, students asked Rahul how they would survive in the ugly world of politics. In every walk of life, there are good and bad persons. In politics, too, there are many good persons with integrity, Rahul replied.

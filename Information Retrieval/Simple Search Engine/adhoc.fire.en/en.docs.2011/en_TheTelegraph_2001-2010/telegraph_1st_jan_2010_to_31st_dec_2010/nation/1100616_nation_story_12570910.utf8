The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Resort jail to save RS seat
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Resort jail to save RS seat
          OUR BUREAU                          Jethmalani                                  
	June 15: All BJP MLAs in Rajasthan are almost out on a picnic at a resort near here for the next two days with only one directive: dont venture out till the Rajya Sabha elections are over.        
	The BJP has fielded lawyer Ram Jethmalani as one of its two candidates but fears that dissidence may stand in his way. Jethmalani is the handpicked candidate of Narendra Modi but many BJP leaders in Rajasthan are against the choice.        
	Modi pushed for Jethmalani because he is fighting the Gujarat chief ministers riot cases in the Supreme Court. It was his way of rewarding his lawyer, a general secretary said.         
	Modi might get his second big rebuff if Jethmalani does not win the June 17 Rajya Sabha elections. This snub might be more serious than the put-down he got from Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar last week. While Nitish is an ally, Jethmalanis victory or defeat would reflect on the state of the BJP and more important, Modis standing in the party at a time when he is looking to positioning himself in national politics.        
	BJP general secretary Ananth Kumar said there would be no problems in Jethmalanis election. Both our candidates will win, he stressed. The other candidate is V.P. Singh, a former MP seen as having the support of most MLAs.        
	The BJP has the votes of its 79 MLAs and that of a Janata Dal (United) legislator. Each candidate needs 40 votes to win.        
	However, given the perception that former chief minister Vasundhara Raje, now a general secretary, is unhappy because she wanted a local nominee, the BJP is keeping its fingers crossed. Vasundhara did not show up at the BJPs national executive in Patna over the weekend because she was supposedly keeping her flock together.        
	Yes, there is a lot of resentment at the fact that an outsider was brought in. Our MLAs are also angry because Jethmalani is seen as Modis recommendation. Some of them asked if Modi was so keen on him, why didnt he give him a seat from Gujarat? a state MP said.        
	The fear is that some of the miffed MLAs may abstain, benefiting a Congress-supported Independent candidate, Sanjay Bagrodia.        
	But a senior leader urged unity: Now that we have decided on Jethmalani, we should ensure his victory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plot to embarrass   Mamata: Suman
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Plot to embarrass   Mamata: Suman
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                                                  
	Calcutta, May 28: Trinamul MP Kabir Suman suspected a plot in the way the railways were being targeted ahead of Sundays Bengal civic polls and dubbed the Jnaneswari disaster a sabotage meant to embarrass Mamata Banerjee.        
	The Government of India has not yet fixed the responsibility for todays train accident. Only (Bengal chief minister) Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is shouting about Maoists involvement. How does he know? Conveniently, a couple of posters were found at the site. These days, anyone can design such posters at home, the Jadavpur MP, who opposes the crackdown on the rebels, said tonight.        
	Speaking at his Baishnabghata home in Calcutta, the singer-MP recalled the days of his youth when police picked up youths, took them for a joyride in vans and released them  only to shoot them in the back and leave behind fake Naxalite leaflets.        
	Suman pointed out that Maoists had denied having caused todays train crash. This is an outfit which always claims responsibility, like they did after Dantewada, apologising for the death of civilians (by blowing up a bus) when their targets were special police officers.        
	Todays incident looks too glaring to be convincing. Its a sabotage meant to embarrass Mamata Banerjee, Suman, who had almost quit as MP over differences with his party colleagues, said.        
	He saw a pattern in the happenings of the past 15-20 days. A scheduled train suddenly switches platform (leading to stampede deaths at the New Delhi Station earlier this month), someones food is contaminated, bombs are found on tracks. Today, fishplates were removed. This is how bandits used to storm trains in our youth.         
	Describing himself as a Gandhian, he distanced himself from Maoists and condemned the violence. But it is ridiculous to claim that only Maoists are violent. More than 100 people have died in South 24-Parganas in political violence since the Lok Sabha elections.        
	He decried the lack of access to the states Maoist-dominated tribal belt. Section 144 has been imposed. There is no healthcare, no toilet. The governments armed forces kick them on the backside. The Naxalites live, eat and sleep with them. Its a war going on. The only way out is negotiation.

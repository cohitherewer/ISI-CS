	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The budget has repeated its largesse to the rural and minority voters who helped hoist the UPA back to power last year.        
	The allocation for rural development may have risen only marginally from last fiscals Rs 62,670 crore, but the amount of Rs 66,100 crore is huge in absolute terms.        
	The minority ministry is to get nearly a 50 per cent hike in funds, up from Rs 1,755 crore in 2009-10 to Rs 2,600 crore. More than 90 per cent of the additional Rs 845 crore will go to the four most popular welfare schemes among the minorities  three scholarship schemes and the Multi-Sectoral Development Programme.        
	The UPAs political interests were reflected also in the additional assistance of Rs 1,200 crore that finance minister Pranab Mukherjee proposed for drought mitigation in Bundelkhand. The region is close to Rahul Gandhis heart and lies mostly in priority state Uttar Pradesh.        
	The allocation for the flagship rural job scheme has risen by just 2.5 per cent to Rs 40,100 crore, but this follows a 144 per cent hike in the last budget. A sum of Rs 100 crore has been allotted for the nascent National Rural Livelihood Mission. The Backward Region Grant Fund will receive Rs 7,300 crore, up 26 per cent.        
	Rural housing scheme Indira Awas Yojana gets Rs 10,000 crore, with the unit cost raised to Rs 45,000 in the plains and to Rs 48,500 in the hills.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      PC rejects Agnivesh plea
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                             
	New Delhi, July 9: Home minister P. Chidambaram has turned down Swami Agniveshs appeal for a judicial probe into the alleged encounter killing of Maoist leader Azad and journalist Hemachandra Pandey by Andhra Pradesh police.         
	The saffron-clad social activist, in touch with the minister for the past few months as part of efforts to mediate between the Centre and the CPI (Maoist), however, said he was undeterred, though he admitted that todays meeting was not inspiring.        
	But I am undeterred and refusal to order a judicial probe should not be made into a pre-condition (for peace talks), Agnivesh told The Telegraph.         
	Chidambaram is understood to have told Agnivesh that he should meet the home minister of Andhra Pradesh to urge him to order a probe.        
	Cherukuri Rajkumar alias Azad, a senior member of the CPI (Maoist) central committee, was gunned down by Andhra police on July 2, about a week after he had rejected an offer of talks by Chidambaram, saying the terms were unacceptable.        
	Agnivesh has appealed to the Maoists to see the killing of Azad and a decision on the peace process as two separate things. I will repeat to the Maoists that carrying forward the peace process would be a true tribute to Azad, he said.

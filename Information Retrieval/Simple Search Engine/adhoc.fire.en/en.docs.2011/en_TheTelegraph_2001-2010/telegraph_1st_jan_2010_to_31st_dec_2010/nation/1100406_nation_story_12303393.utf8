          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, April 5: Tirupati devotees can now take home the blessings of Lord Venkateshwara, the temples famed laddu prasadam, by the bagful.         
	The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam, which runs the temple, earlier rationed out only two laddus for each devotee  each sweet costing Rs 25.        
	The good news is that the sweet  made of besan (powdered gram), sugar, ghee, cardamom, raisins and cashew nuts  will cost the same. Pilgrims wanting to take home the laddus will not have to run after Devasthanam officials for extra helpings. It will be available outside the temple for all to buy.         
	I.Y.R. Krishna Rao, the executive officer of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam, said: Now anyone can purchase any quantity of laddu prasadam he wants.         
	Rao, who has championed the cause of the common devotee from the day he took charge  he once stood in line for eight hours with other pilgrims for a darshan  could not have missed the commercial aspect of derationing the laddus, which now has a patent from the Registry of Geographical Indications. At least 1.5 lakh laddus are made everyday, the number doubling on special days and holidays.

	Chandigarh, May 25: A court today increased the jail term of S.P.S. Rathore to 18 months in the 20-year-old Ruchika Girhotra molestation case, and the former Haryana police chief was arrested for the first time and taken to jail.        
	Sazaa hui hai; ab koi baat nahin (punishment has been awarded; it doesnt matter), the 68-year-old, who had worn a defiant smirk through the months of trial, whispered to an associate after the additional district and sessions court announced the verdict.        
	A CBI court had in December sentenced Rathore to just six months, causing nation-wide outrage, and granted bail till a higher co urt decided on his appeal against the conviction.        
	As he was whisked to jail by the CBI in a white Tavera straight from court, Rathore  convicted of molesting Ruchika in 1990 when she was 14  still wore a thin -smile.        
	I will keep on smiling, he said when reporters asked how he would spend his time in jail.        
	Sources at the Burail Jail said since Rathore had been a senior police officer, he might be allowed to wear civil clothes instead of the prison uniform.        
	While Rathore had challenged his conviction, Ruchikas family and the CBI had appealed to the same court to increase the jail term to two years, the maximum provided for molestation.        
	Ruchikas father S.C. Girhotra said the family would fight on till Rathore had been convicted of abetting his daughters suicide too.        
	Ruchika, a budding tennis player, had drunk poison in 1993 as Rathore, then a serving officer, and his policemen allegedly harassed the family for lodging a complaint and tortured her brother.        
	Rathore had looked nervous as he entered the court today with his wife and lawyer Abha. At earlier hearings, the couple had kept whispering in each others ear while occasionally holding hands.         
	As soon as the judge announced the verdict, there was drama of sorts as Abha made a last-ditch attempt to delay her husbands jail entry. She submitted medical documents saying Rathore suffered from giddiness, hypertension and chest pain.        
	He has an appointment at the PGIs (Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh) cardiology department at 4pm today. He had a valve surgery in 2007, she said.        
	An unmoved judge directed the jail superintendent to provide proper medical care to Rathore and left the courtroom for his chamber.        
	Rathore then insisted on being handed a copy of todays judgment before he left for jail, forcing the judge to return. My sentence has been enhanced. I have my right to get the copy of the order, Rathore said.        
	Judge Gurbir Singh told him no rule stipulated that the convict be handed a copy immediately. The judgment has been passed on your appeal. You take it from the sessions court after applying in the copy branch, Singh said.        
	He then ordered the CBI officials to take Rathore to jail at once. The retired officer was taken to the jail hospital first for a medical check-up.        
	Rathore will spend the night here, a jail official said when asked whether he would be taken to the PGI for his appointment.        
	Ruchikas father thanked the nation for helping the cause of justice in the high-profile case. She was not just my child but also the daughter of the nation, a tearful Girhotra said.        
	It is actually the common man who has won a grim battle with a powerful person. But I wonder why he has not been given the maximum sentence of two years, Aradhana, Ruchikas friend and lone eyewitness to the molestation, said from Sydney where she lives.        
	CBI counsel C.S. Sharma said the agency was satisfied with the 18-month sentence.

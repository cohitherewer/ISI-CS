The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | End of Advani era in nuclear fusion 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      End of Advani era in nuclear fusion 
  - BJP flexible signal to govt        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain and his children at an iftar in New Delhi on Wednesday.   Hussain, the partys lone Muslim Lok Sabha MP, hosted the event, dubbed the seasons first political iftar.   While the food was lip-smacking, the guest list whetted political appetites no less. The event came at a time allegations flew that the BJP and the Congress had struck a deal to get the nuclear liability bill passed.   Virtually everyone who mattered in the government and the Congress made it to the event, braving rain. The Congresss Sachin Pilot, Supriya Sule and Shashi Tharoor were there. Hussain, elected from Bhagalpur, piled Bihari signature dish litti-chokha on Tharoors plate, which the former junior foreign minister tucked into.   The event also saw cross-party bonhomie of the kind missing in Parliament. Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav  among those who cried foul over the alleged deal  showed up, as did Ram Vilas Paswan, Praful Patel, Farooq Abdullah and the Shiv Senas Sanjay Raut. The BJPs L.K. Advani, Sushil Modi, Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Ravi Shankar Prasad attended, but no leader from the partys ally, the Janata Dal (United), turned up. (PTI picture)                                                                
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: The BJP offer of support to the nuclear liability bill is the latest sign that the main Opposition party may be keen to shed some of the baggage from its confrontational days under L.K. Advani.        
	Under its new leaders in the two Houses, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley, the BJP apparently wants to be more flexible than it was when Advani and Jaswant Singh held these posts. The BJP seems to want to be seen as a responsive and responsible Opposition party.        
	So, when Pranab Mukherjee, the leader of the Lok Sabha, approached Jaitley and Sushma with a request to review their partys position on the nuclear bill, both were ready to appreciate that the finance minister had an open mind.        
	From the first meeting, Mukherjee seemed to agree with some of our views. If he was responsive, we needed to reciprocate too, a BJP leader said.        
	Mukherjee and the BJP duo enlarged the ground for a consensus during their frequent meetings. Working the back channels were the junior minister for science and technology, Prithviraj Chavan, and parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal.        
	That Sushma and Bansal were contemporaries at Chandigarhs Panjab University where they studied law  she refers to him as Pawan bhai helped.        
	Still, Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Yashwant Sinha persisted with their opposition to the nuclear bill and argued that the BJP should be on the Lefts side. At the penultimate meeting Sushma and Jaitley had with Mukherjee, it became clear that the government was willing to take most of their concerns on board.        
	The two Opposition leaders called the three veteran dissenters and convinced them it would be churlish to block a legislation when the government was willingly ceding ground.        
	A BJP source suggested that Jaitley and Sushma may have absorbed a lesson or two from the partys experience under Advani.        
	Perhaps they recalled that the decision to be seen on the same side as the Left and try to scuttle the Indo-US nuclear deal had backfired badly on the BJP. Its middle-class constituency, which has links with the Indian diaspora, was unhappy and shifted its support to the Congress. While the Left cannot afford to sound pro-US, we cant be seen as too anti-US, the BJP leader said.        
	The bonhomie between Sushma and Mukherjee, whom she calls Pranabda, was evident through the session. She shared his concern at unsolicited telemarketing calls when he was pestered with one during a breakfast meeting on the nuclear bill.        
	Once Mukherjee passed Sushma a slip asking if she would call a meeting of the finance ministers of the BJP-ruled states to debate the goods and service tax regime the government was keen to unroll. Sushma agreed and assured him she would try and work out a consensus because at least two BJP chief ministers, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Ramesh Pokhriyal, were resisting the move.        
	The show of olive branch has not been confined to Mukherjee. Sushma wanted to ask Sonia Gandhi about her mothers health after the Congress president returned from the US. Last heard, Sushma was still trying.        
	A long-serving official in the parliamentary affairs ministry recalled that Advani and his deputy in the Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra, often went back on the assurances they gave to the government at business advisory committee meetings. They would say one thing and do the opposite inside the House, he said.        
	Sushma and Jaitley have apparently kept their promises so far.

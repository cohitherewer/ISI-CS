	New Delhi, May 17: CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury today sought the Prime Ministers explanation on charges that Mamata Banerjee was neglecting her duty as railway minister to focus on the Bengal civic polls.        
	It would have been understandable had it been an Assembly election. But its just a corporation election. The Prime Minister and his cabinet should clarify why she is neglecting her duties for a mere civic election, Yechury said in Delhi, referring to yesterdays stampede at New Delhi station that left two passengers dead.        
	Although the civic polls are crucial for Bengals Left government, the CPM top brass is refraining from attaching much importance to the event. No key central leader plans to campaign for the May 30 vote.        
	Yechury pointed to the Oppositions criticism of Mamata earlier for remaining absent from Parliament on crucial occasions. She wasnt present when the recent motormens strike in Mumbai was raised in the House.        
	In Calcutta, CPM Rajya Sabha MP and state secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty accused Mamata of playing populist politics at the expense of commuters safety. She is blaming commuters instead of her own dereliction of duty, Chakraborty said at a Citu demonstration in front of the Eastern Railway headquarters.

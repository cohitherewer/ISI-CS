          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 16: A nation-wide initiative to minimise the risk of errors in medical practice and improve patient safety has expanded and reached out to over 40 medical colleges.         
	About 120 doctors and paramedical staff from medical colleges across India today joined a workshop here for lessons in methods of reducing the myriad errors that can cause harm to patients.         
	We dont have a culture of reporting (medical) errors in India. Incidents are usually swept under the carpet, said Shakti Gupta, head of hospital administration at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, and director of the workshop organised by AIIMS and the World Health Organisation (WHO).         
	Although there is scanty data on medical errors from India, one research study had detected 457 errors in paediatric practice at a single teaching hospital over a period of six months.         
	The WHO estimates that one in 10 patients in even developed countries experiences unsafe health-care practices.         
	The workshop participants will be exposed to potential sources of errors and precautions to avoid them in four core areas  surgical safety, hygiene, medicine and communications within hospital staff and with patients.               
	Over the next two years, the Nips programme expects to cover 60 medical colleges.

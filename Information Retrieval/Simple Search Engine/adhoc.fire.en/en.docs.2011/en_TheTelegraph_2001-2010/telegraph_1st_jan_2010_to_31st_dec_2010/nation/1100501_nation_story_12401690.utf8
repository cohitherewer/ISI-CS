          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                      SH Kapadia                          
	New Delhi, April 30: Justice Sarosh Homi Kapadia, the Supreme Courts senior-most judge, will be the next Chief Justice of India.        
	He will take over on May 12, when current Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan retires, a government release said.        
	The 62-year-old Kapadia enrolled as an advocate in September 1974 and was appointed additional judge of Bombay High Court in October 1991. He was elevated as a permanent judge in the high court in March 1993.        
	Under the rules governing the appointment of members of the higher judiciary, Balakrishnan had earlier this month recommended Kapadia as his successor. President Pratibha Patil has signed Kapadias warrant of appointment and sent it to the Supreme Court registry, official sources said.        
	In exercise of the powers conferred by Clause (2) of Article 124 of the Constitution of India, the President is pleased to appoint Justice Sarosh Homi Kapadia, judge of the Supreme Court, to be the Chief Justice of India with effect from the 12th May, 2010 (forenoon), the government release said.        
	Earlier today, three new Supreme Court judges were sworn in. Among them was Gyan Sudha Misra of Jharkhand High Court, the first woman judge to be appointed in four years.

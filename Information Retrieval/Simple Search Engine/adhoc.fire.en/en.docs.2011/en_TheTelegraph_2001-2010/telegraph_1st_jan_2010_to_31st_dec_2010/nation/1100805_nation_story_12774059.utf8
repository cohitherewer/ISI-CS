          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Women protesters in Srinagar. (AP)                                  
	Srinagar, Aug. 4: The embattled Omar Abdullah government has a fresh problem on hand: handling some public servants who are refusing to take up or report for sensitive postings.        
	Since violence flared in Kashmir in early June with the death of a teenager, several state government employees, barring police, have been staying away from work. It is not clear whether they have been joining separatists protests or are simply staying home.        
	Some employees, including officers, have begun refusing to take up field postings such as those of executive magistrates where they are tasked with maintaining law and order. This could be either because it makes them vulnerable to attacks or because they do not want to approve harsh measures against the protesters.        
	A government official said Mohammad Munawar Shah, a zonal education officer of Trehgam, was recently suspended for refusing to join magisterial duty assigned by the district magistrate. He has now been attached with the additional deputy commissioner.        
	Earlier, when Ghulam Hassan Bhat, the senior superintendent of police, CID, refused to take over as Baramulla police chief, he, too, was attached with the police headquarters.        
	A government spokesperson said several officials in Anantnag, including Mushtaq Ahmad Malik, Mohomad Sharif Beig and Nisar Ahmad, were placed under suspension for non-compliance of orders and dereliction of official duties.        
	The suspended officials were attached with assistant commissioner (revenue), Anantnag. The assistant commissioner has been asked to chargesheet them separately and furnish the same to the deputy commissioners office, the spokesperson said.        
	Local reports said two policemen in Bandipora district had refused to act against the people and resigned their posts. A police officer denied the report, saying they may have been special police officials (SPOs) if at all they had left the force. SPOs are irregulars. How can they resign? he asked.        
	An assistant executive engineer, posted as an executive magistrate in Srinagar, said government employees were caught between the devil and the deep sea. If we refuse to join, we will lose our job. But if we do, we have to face the people. When you have all government employees preferring to sit home, we are expected to join sensitive postings where we are supposed to give orders to shoot, he said.        
	The official said some 32 executive magistrates had been posted in Srinagar a few weeks ago. But we are mostly from an engineering background. We do join duty but prefer not to be seen moving with police.        
	The protesters have targeted the houses of several cops, triggering fear in the ranks of the police who are at the forefront of containing the continuing unrest.        
	There has been some trouble among central government employees also. Around a hundred non-local railway employees posted in Budgam have gone on leave after repeated attacks on rail services.        
	Rail link suspended        
	The unrest in Kashmir has forced the railways to suspend train movement on the Quazigund-Baramulla section for the first time after the service was introduced two years ago.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 27: The Supreme Court today said it was a crime to waste even a grain of food in a country where people are starving and urged the Centre to release surplus grain in godowns through the public distribution system.         
	If food is rotting, dont waste it. Let the poor come and get it if you cant distribute, a two-judge bench, which has been monitoring the public distribution system (PDS) since 2001, said.         
	In a country where people are starving, it is a crime to waste a single grain. Official statements indicate that there is wastage in many places, the court said, when told that godowns of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) were overflowing and grains were rotting in states such as Punjab.         
	Colin Gonsalves, counsel for the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties that filed the PIL, claimed some 48,000 tonnes of wheat was rotting in Punjab alone. The food wont be fit even for cattle in a month, he said, quoting FCI sources.         
	The court has sought the Union food secretarys views within two weeks on whether surplus grains should be distributed through the PDS to the needy. It also urged the government to construct warehouses and godowns on a priority basis to store surplus grains and also hire warehouses. The case will be heard again on August 12.         
	The court also urged the government to consider a host of recommendations made by the Justice (retd) D.P. Wadhwa, charged with the task of suggesting ways and means to improve the functioning of the PDS.         
	The apex court asked the government to consider whether the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category could be expanded by raising the income sealing and also if the Above Poverty Line (APL) category could be abolished. The BPL category does not get the full benefit of the PDS as people from APL also get the benefits. It is desirable that the APL category should not get the benefits so that the entire benefits could be extended to all those who need it, the bench said.         
	It also asked the government to consider distributing ration according to the number of people in each family. Currently each family, irrespective of its size, is entitled to 35kg of ration each month under the apex courts directive of January 10, 2008. The court said that there was no rationale on why a family of two and a family of five should get the same quantity of rations.         
	As a suggestion to plug leaks in food distribution, the bench said state-owned corporations could be asked to run PDS stores.        
	Currently, intermediary operators lift the food from the godowns and distribute it to PDS dealers. After perusing reports from 11 states, the court said: There seems to be huge corruption and pilferage all over.         
	The Wadhwa panel had pointed out that MLAs appointed PDS shop dealers in most places and also manned the vigilance cells that oversaw their functioning. It blamed this set-up for the corruption in the system.        
	The court said for the time being, the government should lift foodgrains from the godowns and deliver it to the PDS dealers, it said.

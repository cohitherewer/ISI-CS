  - Disqualification last   resort, says CM aide        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          BS Yeddyurappa                                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: Operation Kamala did the trick for B.S. Yeddyurappa in the first flush of victory but since then the BJPs lotus seems to have wilted.        
	Kamala was the password for the Karnataka chief ministers machinations to win over MLAs from the Opposition and cushion the wafer-thin majority he had after the 2008 elections.         
	Two years on, the legislators who had willingly left the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) for position and perks have turned against the BJP allegedly after not getting enough.        
	As Yeddyurappa has just four days left to prove his majority after 19 MLAs  14 of the BJP and five Independents  withdrew support and reduced his government to a minority, his only hope, a confidant said, lies in bringing them back.         
	However, his efforts, executed through the Reddy brothers of Bellary, have borne little fruit so far. Only three MLAs returned after they reportedly extracted a promise that they would be made ministers.         
	Sources said Yeddyurappa might recommend the disqualification of the rebels if they did not come back to him by October 10. He is expected to prove his majority in the Assembly on October 11.        
	The legislators who withdrew support must not forget they can lose their membership, warned party spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain.        
	Their letter for withdrawal of support would be cited as a reason for disqualification on the ground that it amounts to voluntarily surrendering the membership of the BJP. The idea is that if they are knocked off before the confidence test, the overall strength of the Assembly, and therefore the halfway mark to attain a majority, would be reduced.        
	But a Yeddyurappa aide said the chief minister would exercise this option as a last resort, apparently fearing that governor H.R. Bharadwaj might not ratify the decision. He might construe it as a breakdown of the constitutional machinery and recommend central rule, the aide said.        
	The BJP, in order to shore up its case, is citing the Goa precedent where the Speaker had, in similar circumstances, recommended the disqualification of the rebel MLAs of the Congress government and the governor had upheld the decision.        
	Sensing that such a plan is afoot, the Congress and the Dal (S) moved a no-confidence motion against the Speaker yesterday. But the motion might be rejected because according to the rules, they should have moved it 14 days in advance. Now the confidence vote is four days away.        
	The attempts by the Bellary Reddys to persuade the rebels to return didnt go too far. BJP sources said the rebels, mostly Reddy loyalists, may have felt betrayed by them.        
	There is a view that the Reddy brothers have used them in the past to extract their pound of flesh from the CM with the threat of breaking up the BJP. Once their demands were met, they backed off. The Reddys didnt utter a word when some Independents were dropped in the recent cabinet shuffle. These people feel let down, an MP said.

	Nov. 21: The father of the engineering student who attempted suicide following an assault by seniors at their Bankura college last week was today given Rs 56,000 for his treatment by the institution.        
	Ujjwal Kumar Anand, who jumped from the roof of his hostel at the Mallabhum Institute of Technology near Bishnupur on Thursday, is in coma at a hospital in Durgapur.         
	His father Bimal Kumar Anand said principal S.K. Sanyal had given him the money and assured him that the college would stand by the family.        
	Bimal has not yet filed a complaint against the institution or the three seniors involved in beating up Ujjwal. The first-year computer science student was thrashed following an altercation with a classmate close to the trio.

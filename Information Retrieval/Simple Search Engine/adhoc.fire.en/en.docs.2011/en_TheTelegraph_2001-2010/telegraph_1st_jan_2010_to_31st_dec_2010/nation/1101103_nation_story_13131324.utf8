          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Nov. 2: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati today announced a hike of Rs 40 per quintal in the state advised price of sugarcane just ahead of the crushing season and before the Centres price declaration.         
	Last years state price was Rs 165 per quintal, so this year, cane farmers should get Rs 205 per quintal from sugar mill owners.        
	Mayavatis dive into cane price politics has several reasons. There are 3 million cane farmers in Uttar Pradesh  in the western districts of Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Meerut, Lakhimpur Kheri and Saharanpur. Almost all are upper-caste Jats and their huge number makes them a crucial votebank. In the last Assembly elections, the BJP won the highest number of seats in western Uttar Pradesh. Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party did not fare well.         
	There is another reason. Last year, the Centre declared what it called a fair remunerative price of Rs 107.76 per quintal, much lower than the state price. The Centre said any money in excess of its price would have to be paid by the state government.         
	Thousands of angry cane farmers gathered in Delhi last November and agitated, egged on by a united Opposition. Two days later, the UPA government withdrew the fair remunerative price. The Centre said the state advised price would be restored and the difference between the fair and remunerative price and the state price would be paid by the mills, not the state.         
	Uttar Pradesh has 24 large sugar mills.        
	This year, the Centre was planning to raise the fair remunerative price by Rs 37 per quintal  which will get the farmer Rs 144.76 for a quintal. This price has to get the Union cabinets seal.         
	Mayavati said today that her government cared for farmers. But Mahendra Singh Tikait, the septuagenarian Bharatiya Kisan Union leader demanded that the state price should be at least Rs 280 per quintal, keeping in mind expenses incurred by farmers. Sugarcane growers are not beggars that they will wait every year for Mayavatis mercy, he said.         
	Mayavati attacked the UPA government, saying the Centre must change its mindset and start framing policies on sugar, keeping in mind the larger interests of the farmers.         
	Last year, when the dispute arose over the Centre and state prices, the mill owners spoke to the farmers informally and agreed to pay them Rs 175-180 per quintal, depending on the quality of the produce.        
	We are not happy but we will take a decision at an appropriate time, said a spokesperson for Uttar Pradesh Sugar Mill Owners Association today.

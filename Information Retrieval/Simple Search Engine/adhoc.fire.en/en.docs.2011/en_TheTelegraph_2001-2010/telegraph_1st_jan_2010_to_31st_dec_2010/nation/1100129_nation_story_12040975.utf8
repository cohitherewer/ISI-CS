          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: The UPAs plans to use public-private partnerships to fund Indias demand for schools have run into a barrage of criticism that has left the government walking a tightrope between embarrassment and allegations of selling out.         
	The governments concept note on PPP in schooling has been attacked both by proponents and critics of private participation in education, in comments received by the human resource development ministry, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The comments  received in response to the concept note placed for the public on the ministry website  have forced the government to tighten its PPP blueprint to try and tackle the criticism.         
	HRD minister Kapil Sibal and his school education secretary Anshu Vaish have independently requested proponents and critics of the PPP concept to settle for a truce.         
	Vaish, at a recent meeting with representatives from state governments, potential private sector partners and other stakeholders articulated the governments concern over the criticism.         
	Specifically mentioning five major points of criticism that the ministry had received, Vaish pleaded stakeholders with opposite viewpoints to compromise in order for the PPP plans to succeed.         
	She said both sides of the criticism were coming from people unwilling to shift out of their comfort zones. She nudged both sides towards a compromise, said a representative of Infrastructure Leasing and Finance Services Ltd, one of the major likely private sector partners in the PPP initiative, who was present at the meeting.         
	Sibal, at meetings of an expert panel set up to help finetune the PPP blueprint, has repeatedly had to play umpire between proponents and critics of the idea of encouraging PPP investments in schooling.         
	Some panel members like National Council for Educational Research and Training director Krishna Kumar and National University for Educational Planning and Administration acting vice-chancellor R. Govinda have questioned key premises behind the PPP strategy.         
	Sibal, at these meetings, has told Kumar, Govinda and others supporting them in the panel that pursuing the PPP strategy to fund school education was non-negotiable.         
	The Prime Minister has announced that PPP investments will be used to fund 2,500 model schools and reneging on that assurance would be embarrassing for Manmohan Singh and his government.         
	But the criticism of the PPP strategy has also forced Sibal to tell the Planning Commission and others keen to meet demands of private partners in the PPP blueprint that the governments generosity has bounds.         
	The PPP model finally selected must prove cheaper for the government than if it were to invest in proposed schools all by itself, Sibal has said, voicing one of the five major concerns Vaish has also articulated.         
	Proponents of using PPP investments in schooling have argued that the government needs a legal framework to support plans to team up with the private sector.         
	The private sector will look for profits or other benefits whereas the government has to ensure that education remains a non-profit enterprise. Without legal backing, teaming up with private partners could expose the government to litigation, a source said, explaining the second major criticism of the governments current plans.         
	Two other arguments faced by the ministry involve the premise that private-run public schools perform better than government schools.         
	Since Kendriya Vidyalayas perform better than private schools  in terms of results  almost every year, some critics have argued that the premise that private schools are better is incorrect.         
	Other critics have accepted that most government schools are not as good as the Kendriya Vidyalayas, but have cited the success of the central schools to argue that poor management was to blame for non-performing government schools.         
	By focusing on better management rather than teaming up with private partners, the government could improve standards of its own school systems rather than depending on industry, these critics have argued.         
	Some critics have questioned why the government needs to incentivise private players to enter schooling when enough among them are already running schools without incentives.

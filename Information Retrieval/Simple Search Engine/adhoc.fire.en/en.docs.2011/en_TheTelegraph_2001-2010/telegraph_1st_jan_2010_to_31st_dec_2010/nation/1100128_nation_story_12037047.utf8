The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kasab fighter at helm
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Kasab fighter at helm
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                      Kasab                          
	Mumbai, Jan. 27: A police officer who took splinters in his body and eye as he fought Ajmal Kasab and another militant despite being short of ammunition, is set to head the elite anti-terror force of Mumbai police.        
	A senior official today said additional commissioner Sadanand Date would take over as chief of Force One from deputy inspector-general S. Jagannathan, who is scheduled to leave for Paris for a prestigious posting with Interpol.        
	Date will be appointed, but formal orders of his appointment are yet to be issued, the official told The Telegraph.        
	Date was among a handful of IPS officers who took on Kasab and Ismail Khan that November night. The officer, now in charge of the central region, led a group of seven policemen to the sixth floor of Cama Hospital where the Pakistani gunmen held some employees hostage on the terrace.        
	From 11.15 to 11.50, Date and his men battled the two Lashkar-trained militants who were armed with AK-47s and hand grenades. Despite being short of ammunition, the IPS officer and his group kept the two gunmen pinned to the terrace.        
	The terrorists lobbed grenades, injuring Date and his team, before escaping. No reinforcements reached the spot till 45 minutes after midnight, when the officer was evacuated and hospitalised.        
	Date suffered shrapnel injuries in his chest, knee and ankle. A tiny piece of shrapnel has still not been removed from his right eye as doctors say surgery could cause permanent injury.        
	A qualified cost and management accountant, Date joined the IPS in 1991 and is known as an honest officer. He held several key posts before joining the CBI as deputy inspector-general.        
	He was selected for the Humphrey fellowship programme of the University of Minnesota in 2005-06 where he studied white-collar and organised crime in the US.         
	After his return, he worked as additional commissioner of the Economic Offences Wing of the crime branch and, in 2007, was awarded the Presidents medal.        
	The Ram Pradhan committee, which probed the lapses in tackling the 26/11 attacks, had praised Date and three other IPS officers.         
	Plea rejected        
	Kasab today sought to summon Congress minister Narayan Rane as a defence witness, but the special court trying the 26/11 case rejected the plea as irrelevant.

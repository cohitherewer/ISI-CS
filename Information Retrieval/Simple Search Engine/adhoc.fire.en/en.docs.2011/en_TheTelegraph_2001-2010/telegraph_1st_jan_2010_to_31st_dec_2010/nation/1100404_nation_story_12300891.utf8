                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Caught on TV: Shoaib at Sania home     Bride tweets on wedding tension
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                          STAR News footage of Sania Mirza and Shoaib Malik (right) at the tennis stars home in Hyderabad on Saturday                                        
	Hyderabad, April 3: Curfew-hit Hyderabad was treated to a spot of drama in its living rooms this morning when Shoaib Malik was caught on TV cameras on the balcony of fiancee Sania Mirzas home.        
	The news of the Pakistani cricketers surprise presence in town provoked the family of Ayesha Siddiqui to file a complaint of cheating against him with Jubilee Hills police station.        
	Shoaib apparently arrived last night braving threats of legal action from the Siddiquis, who claim he had married Ayesha over the phone but dumped her without a divorce because she had put on weight.        
	The TV footage showed the cricketer speaking on a mobile phone from the balcony of the Jubilee Hills bungalow while Sania seemed immersed in an animated discussion with her mother Naseema that at times appeared tense and heated.        
	Everybody in the family is very tense, especially with the media attention; even Chhoti (Sanias younger sister) is tense, a relative said.        
	Sania publicly backed her fiance on the Ayesha controversy today. Me and my family know what the truth is, weve known it all along and we have confidence in gods justice, she wrote on Twitter.        
	Hyderabadi and Pakistani scholars and clerics, however, have questioned the validity of the purported nikaahnama Ayesha had displayed yesterday.        
	Friends of the Mirzas said Shoaibs family, who received their Indian visas today, would arrive on April 6. The wedding rituals are to begin the next day, the engagement is to take place on April 11, and the wedding on April 15.        
	The sources pooh-poohed Pakistani media reports that the wedding would be shifted to Dubai because of the threat from the Siddiquis and Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray, who has lambasted the tennis player for choosing to marry a Pakistani.        
	Sania wrote on Twitter that she had never imagined she would have to deal with so many things apart from the regular pre-wedding jitters.        
	Too much going on, never in my life thought that Id had to worry bout anything of this sort, rather than my mehendi! she wrote. Leaves me with no choice but to laugh. I am pretty sure these are not the pre-wedding jitters or butterflies in the stomach my married cousins were talking about!        
	Sanias family has apparently asked former Andhra cricket secretary Chamundeshwarinath to mediate with the Siddiquis. They are believed to have sought tennis ace Mahesh Bhupathis help too but he was not available.        
	Hope came from clerics, though. A Hyderabadi cleric said a nikaahnama had to be supported with a wakf board certificate but the Siddiquis had not produced one.        
	A Pakistani mufti, Muhammad Naeem, cited that the Siddiquis nikaahnama appeared to have no witness signatures. A nikaah over the phone without proper witnesses is not recognised in Shariat, he said.        
	Ayesha claims Shoaib had sent her the nikaahnama for her signature after the alleged phone wedding. She said Pakistani cricketer Mohammed Yusuf knew everything.        
	She told Pakistans Geo News channel she had two witnesses to prove that she and Shoaib had twice shared a room at a Hyderabad hotel. The witnesses, she said, were staff members of Hyderabads Taj Residency hotel, earlier known as Holiday Inn, and had agreed to testify in court.        
	If you are asking if we lived together  yes, we did stay together (and) we have witnesses, Ayesha said.

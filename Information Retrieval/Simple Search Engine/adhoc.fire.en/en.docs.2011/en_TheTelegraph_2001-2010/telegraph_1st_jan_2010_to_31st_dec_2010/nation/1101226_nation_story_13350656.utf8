                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Andhra leaders in tarmac tiff
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kiran Reddy                                  
	Hyderabad, Dec. 25: A bizarre scene played out at Begumpet airport ahead of the Presidents arrival for her winter break as Andhra ministers and MPs were blocked from going to the tarmac to receive her.        
	The senior Congress leaders, both furious and red-faced, were seen arguing with police and protocol officials after they were asked to wait in the lounge yesterday to greet Pratibha Patil.        
	The leaders included Andhra legislative council chairperson A. Chakrapani, health minister Danam Nagender, textile minister P. Shankar Rao and Secunderabad Congress MP Anjan Kumar Yadav.        
	A livid Chakrapani this morning summoned K. Aravinda Rao, the Andhra DGP, and R.M. Gonela, the principal secretary, general administration department, to explain what had happened yesterday.        
	Protocol officials said that according to rules only certain persons had the right to go up to the tarmac: the governor, chief minister, mayor and the three defence chiefs.        
	This is nothing new. I dont know why the ministers, MP and council chairperson are making an issue of it, a protocol official said.        
	The President flew into Hyderabad on Friday for her annual break. She is staying at Rashtrapati Nilayam in Secunderabads Bolarum area and is due to open the international Kuchipudi festival put up by Silicon Andhra, a US-based NRI group, before her December 31 departure.        
	Airport security personnel were seen laughing while the politicians were arguing and trying to throw their weight around.        
	Nagender and Chakrapani claimed they were very close to the President and wanted to wish her first. Yadav said Begumpet fell under his Lok Sabha constituency, while Shankar Rao pointed out that Rashtrapati Nilayam fell under his Assembly constituency. But nothing worked  they had to wait till the President walked in to the airport lobby.        
	Chief minister Kiran Kumar Reddy was seen trying to appease his teammates but to little avail. He gave up after the President apparently signalled that he should leave them alone, sources said.        
	This is not the first time Reddy has been embarrassed by party legislators in public. The first instance was when four-five cabinet colleagues threatened to resign over portfolios but relented after the high command intervened.        
	Next, a large number of Congress legislators defied his diktat not to associate with Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, some even ignoring his phone calls.        
	Third, only three of seven legislators from Reddys native Chittoor greeted him during his visit to the district.

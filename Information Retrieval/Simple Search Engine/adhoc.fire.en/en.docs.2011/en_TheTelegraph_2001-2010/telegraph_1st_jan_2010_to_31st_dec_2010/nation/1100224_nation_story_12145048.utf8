The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Film festival letter war turns murky
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Film festival letter war turns murky
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: India International Women Film Festival (IIWFF) director Shyamali Banerjee has said allegations of harassment against her husband by the Oscar-winning screenplay writer Jane Campion stemmed from a fictitious conspiracy by Union minister Saugata Roy.        
	Roy, the minister of state for urban development, denied the allegation and said he was being dragged into the controversy because he denied Banerjee permission to use Vigyan Bhavan, which falls under his ministry.        
	Banerjee has made the allegations against Roy in a letter to foreign minister S.M. Krishna. She wrote to the foreign minister presumably because another woman who had levelled allegations against her husband hails from Pakistan. She has dubbed Ayesha Arif Khan an ISI agent.        
	It looked strange and ridiculous to me and my other members of the IIWFF committee that after two months of the of the festival why such allegations have been cropped up by Saugata Roy which is going to be a scar not only on the IIWFF but it had cast an evil shadow on Indian creative world and community.         
	Also such a damaging, intentional, fictitious conspiracy hatched by Shri Roy and ISI agent Ayesha Arif Khan had affected deeply my family.., Banerjee has said in her letter sent to Krishna today.        
	The allegations against Banerjees husband were made in two letters by Campion, who also directed The Piano, and Khan. The letters, dated mid-December, were sent to Roys ministry, which forwarded them to Delhi police.        
	A month ago, the IIWFF had filed a complaint against Roys ministry in Delhi High Court, alleging that the minister was uncooperative, and blamed him for messing up the festival held in December, sources said.         
	The IIWFF had written another letter to the Presidents office levelling against Roy more or less the same charges mentioned in the missive to Krishna.        
	Due to the non-cooperative and irresponsible attitude of Shri Saugata Roy all our programme has been messed up. Taking in view of the fact that IIWFF is a part of the women empowerment project and that it does not deal with commercial activity  we had appealed for a concessional rate to be given for the festival to be held at Vigyan Bhavan.         
	The officials kept on telling us that the matter is under process and they will get back to us as soon as things get endorsed by the said ministry On the day of the inauguration on 15 December 2009, we werent allowed to use the auditorium, the letter said.         
	Roy said that although he had taken approval from his senior minister at the urban development ministry to use Vigyan Bhavan as the venue for the festival, he had to cancel the booking as the organisers failed to deposit the required money.        
	I met Banerjee twice and went to their office once. I dont know her. I cancelled her booking because instead of a draft of Rs 10 lakh that is to be paid as deposit, they came with a cheque. I didnt want to take any risk because the cheque could have bounced.         
	Some people did ring me up about the event but I cannot break rules. I know that they have written to the President about this but it is beneath my dignity to comment on this. They are dragging me into this because I refused them the use of Vigyan Bhavan. I also received two complaints, one of which regarding the Pakistani woman was a serious one. Since I have no means to investigate them, I asked my people to forward them, Roy said.

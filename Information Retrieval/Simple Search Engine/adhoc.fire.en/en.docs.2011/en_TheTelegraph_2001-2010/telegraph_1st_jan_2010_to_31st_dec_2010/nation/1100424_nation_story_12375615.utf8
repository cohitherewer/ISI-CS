The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Match-fix cloud on league 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Match-fix cloud on league 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai/New Delhi, April 23: Allegations of match fixing, so far unproven, are the latest to visit the widening scandal around the Indian Premier League.        
	Income-tax authorities probing the IPL money trail have submitted a report to the finance ministry in which these allegations figure, relating to IPL Season II that South Africa had hosted.        
	Other than IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, several players  Indian and foreign  as well as some team owners are being investigated by the department of revenue intelligence. It must be emphasised, however, that these are, as of now, mere allegations which cannot be backed up by hard evidence.        
	The investigators are analysing phone records of some of the IPL franchises and several other persons who had access to VIP enclosures during the matches in South Africa.         
	The IPL had refused to employ the services of the International Cricket Councils Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU). Lalit felt it was too expensive at $1.2 million. Though it looked a bit strange when the IPL authorities and even some team owners paid much more than that in South Africas local schools as donations, said a cricket board source.        
	The BCCI, however, agreed to draft in the ACSU to monitor the ongoing IPL Season III and last Octobers Champions League. The decision was announced by us at the ICC boards annual conference in London last June, after rumours of match-fixing, said the board source.         
	In the inaugural season, the IPL had deployed its own anti-corruption unit under the ACSUs guidance. During that tournament a controversy had arisen after an anti-corruption unit official prohibited Shah Rukh Khan from visiting the Kolkata Knight Riders dressing room in Mohali because he saw the star as an outsider.         
	A person familiar on the celebrity circuit who had been seen in several IPL matches with VIP access is under investigation for being a conduit in the alleged match-fixing. The IT report says that the persons phone records will reveal his constant interface with known bookies.         
	A BCCI source said the IPL governing council would take up the issue at the April 26 meeting where Modis fate would be decided. We plan to investigate the matter with the help of the ICC anti-corruption body, the source said.         
	The tax authorities have come to two conclusions  one that there were unexplained money flows to and from many of the key persons connected with the league and its teams and that known bookies had connections with these trails. This led to a probe into possible betting.        
	Several listed bookies in the UK have announced that they had managed millions of pounds of IPL betting during that season.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 21: The CPMs peasant wing, the Krishak Sabha, has suffered a drop in its membership after electoral setbacks tied to Nandigram and Singur.        
	The Sabhas membership has dropped from 1.59 crore to 1.36 crore this year, its state president and CPM state secretariat member Madan Ghosh said today.        
	Ghosh blamed the Trinamul Congress and Maoist violence in districts in the wake of the Lok Sabha polls for the drop in membership.        
	He, however, claimed that the situation was gradually improving and the Sabha hoped to win back the farmers who had deserted the wing.        
	The Sabha has decided to run an orientation course for new-generation leaders to highlight farmers plight and familiarise them with the Centres anti-farmer policies.        
	After a two-day long state committee meeting, the Sabha leadership has also decided to launch a campaign against the anti-peasant central government policies like the withdrawal of fertiliser subsidy.        
	The Sabha has formed a sub-committee headed by CPM central committee member Benoy Konar. Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra is also a member of the sub-committee.

	New Delhi, Aug. 11 (PTI): Marriage between minors is valid and can be annulled only if one of the partners pleads, Delhi High Court ruled today.        
	A marriage in contravention of Clause (III) of Section 5 (which fixes the minimum age of 22 years for the groom and 18 for the bride) does not fall in the category of void marriages nor does it fall in the category of voidable marriages. By the process of elimination, it would be a valid marriage, the court said.        
	The bench said even under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, marriages involving minors were not invalid. The act says the marriage can be annulled on a plea by a minor partner.         
	The bench added that the legislature, while drafting the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, had consciously left out such marriages from the category of void marriages.        
	The order came on a petition filed by a minor boy who married a minor girl after fleeing home. He approached court after a criminal case was filed against him by the girls family. The court said she should be allowed to live with her husband.

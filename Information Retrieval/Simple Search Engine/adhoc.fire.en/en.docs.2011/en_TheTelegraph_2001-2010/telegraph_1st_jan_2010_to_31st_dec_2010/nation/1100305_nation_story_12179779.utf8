          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 4: The Union home ministry today unveiled plans to maintain a national population register (NPR), a move that would reduce the Nandan Nilekani-headed Unique Identification Authority of Indias power to collect data on its own.         
	The NPR will be based on the 2011 census data and will for the first time record biometric characteristics of usual residents. Identity cards with unique ID numbers will be distributed to over a billion people in the country.        
	The NPR exercise will start from Bengal on April 1. It will cost nearly Rs 6,000 crore. It will involve 25 lakh personnel and use over 11,000 metric tonnes of paper.         
	The home ministry has planned to collect biometric characteristics of all Indians above 15 years. Biometrics will include collecting fingerprints and facial characteristics. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) will have to weed out duplicate identities from the database.         
	The home ministrys decision to collect biometric characteristics of residents by itself has rendered redundant the UIDAIs plan to carry out a similar exercise.

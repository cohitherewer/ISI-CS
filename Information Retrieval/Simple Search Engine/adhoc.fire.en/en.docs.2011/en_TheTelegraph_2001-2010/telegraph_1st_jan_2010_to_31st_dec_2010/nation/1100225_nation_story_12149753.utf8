                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tudu shot from close range: Doctors
          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Kantapahari, Feb. 24: Doctors who have examined Lalmohan Tudus body in the morgue have said the five bullets that hit the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities president had been fired from close range, drilling holes in the polices version that he had been killed in an encounter.         
	Three bullets slammed into Tudus chest and one into his lower abdomen before going out through the other side of his body. Another bullet was stuck in his left rib cage.         
	A doctor who examined Tudus body at the morgue of Jhargram sub-divisional hospital said: The wounds suggest that Tudu had been shot from close range. That is why the four bullets that hit him came out from the other side.         
	The doctor also said if Tudu had been shot during a gun battle, he would have collapsed after getting the first bullet in his chest or abdomen.        
	If a person gets a bullet in his chest or abdomen, he is bound to collapse on the ground and there is no question of getting hit again in the chest. The bullets would have then hit his sides, shoulder, hands or legs but not his chest or abdomen, another doctor said.        
	The doctors also said there were burn marks around the bullet holes. These burn marks occur when one is shot from close range, a doctor said.        
	The district police had said yesterday that Tudu had been killed during a gun battle with Maoists who had attacked a police camp in Kantapahari on Monday night.         
	Tudu was among those firing at the police camp, West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma had said yesterday.        
	No one claimed Tudus body today as his family members have left their home for an undisclosed location.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Toll forces Maoists on back foot 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Toll forces Maoists on back foot 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jhargram, May 28: The enormity of todays rail tragedy and its all-round condemnation of the act of terror forced Maoist leaders and members of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, a frontal organisation of the rebels, on the back foot.         
	Instead of crowing about their involvement in the Howrah-Kurla Jnaneswari Express tragedy, the leaders came up with different sets of explanations  often contradicting each other  as they slipped into defensive mode.        
	We had no knowledge about the attack on the train. Our people did not do it. It was the handiwork of CPM goons. It was a conspiracy hatched by the CPM, said Asit Mahato, spokesperson for the PCPA, hours after the train derailed in West Midnapore and a goods train from the opposite direction smashed five of its bogies.        
	The denial came as a surprise to police because the accident took place in the Kharagpur-Gidhni stretch, regarded as a Maoist stronghold. Members of the village defence squad  who have been accused of triggering explosions on rail tracks earlier  are active in the region. A senior district police officer said PCPA posters had been found at the disaster site.         
	Joutho bahini ebong harmad bahinir aposaroner dabitey ei karmasuchi (This programme is for demanding the withdrawal of the joint forces, and action against CPM goons)  read the PCPA posters.        
	The rebel-backed committee started observing kala saptaho (black week) from today in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore demanding withdrawal of the joint forces from the Jungle Mahal area.         
	In the past, the committee members had allegedly unleashed several attacks on trains  and even on civilians  during such protests, which turned into full-fledged bandhs in the Maoist-dominated areas.         
	But front ranking PCPA leaders  who had held up the Bhubaneswar-Delhi Rajdhani Express at Banstala in West Midnapore for several hours last October  switched off their mobile phones today as the day progressed and the Jnaneswari death toll rose.        
	Although The Telegraph contacted a middle-rung leader of the Maoists Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa regional committee this afternoon, he was evasive in his answers.        
	Attacks on railway properties had always been part of our movement. But causing such large-scale civilian casualty was not our plan, said the leader, adding that goods trains were the rebels main targets.         
	According to him, the plan might have been to cause minor damage to a goods train by removing the Pandrol clips, which hold the railway tracks to the sleepers.         
	We had expected Mamata to pressure the Centre in withdrawing the joint forces from the Jungle Mahal area. But she did nothing She took our help in Nandigram, but she didnt help us and so we wanted to cause minor damage to the railways by targeting a goods train, said the Maoist leader.         
	The police drilled holes into his claims, though. Senior officers said Pandrol clips were missing in both the Up and Down lines at the crashspot between Khemasuli and Sardiha.         
	Asked about it, the Maoist leader said: There may have been some mistake. The answer was seen as an attempt by the rebels to suggest that the act was not wilful.        
	Mahatos version of the tragedy resurfaced in the evening when a man  introducing himself as an aide to Kanchan, state secretary, CPI (Maoist)  called up media houses and blamed CPM cadres and the state police for the tragedy.         
	Our party line doesnt support killing of innocent people. CPM cadres and policemen hatched this conspiracy to malign us, the man said over the phone.

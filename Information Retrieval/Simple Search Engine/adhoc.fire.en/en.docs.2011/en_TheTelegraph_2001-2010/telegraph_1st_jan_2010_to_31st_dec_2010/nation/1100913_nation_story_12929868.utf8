The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP cry to stop army law dilution
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP cry to stop army law dilution
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 12: Ahead of the Cabinet Committee on Security meeting scheduled for tomorrow, the BJP today demanded that the Centre should not dilute the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in Kashmir.        
	The party also said it was time that chief minister Omar Abdullah, who suffers a complete alienation from his people, be replaced by a more acceptable person.        
	The CCS meet, which has been postponed at least twice since Friday, is likely to announce revocation of the contentious law from the central districts of Kashmir.        
	But the violence in the Valley on Id appears to have strengthened the argument of those who believe the armed forces act should not be tinkered with in Kashmir.         
	The BJP said the developments of the last two days have convinced the people that the security environment in the Valley must be strengthened and not diluted. However, it is only the government of India which has failed to realise the enormity of the problem and its seriousness. It wants to tell the people that Srinagar and adjacent areas are not disturbed areas and therefore Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act should not apply to these areas.        
	The BJP accused the Centre of being completely devoid of any vision on how to deal with the situation. The statement was issued after an urgent meeting of L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, S.S. Ahluwalia and Ravi Shankar Prasad.        
	BJP spokesperson Prasad said any dilution of the law would demoralise the armed forces in the Valley and was unacceptable.

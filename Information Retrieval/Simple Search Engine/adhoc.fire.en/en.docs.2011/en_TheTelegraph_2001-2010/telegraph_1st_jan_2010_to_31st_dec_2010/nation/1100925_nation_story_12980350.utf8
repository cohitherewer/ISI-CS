The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Road cave-in adds to woes
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Road cave-in adds to woes
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       A boy looks at the crack in the road near the Yamuna bank metro station in Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                           
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: A part of the road to be used by athletes to commute from the Commonwealth Games Village to the archery venue caved in today even as foreign players continued to stay in hotels instead of the complex.        
	The portion that gave way is on busy Vikas Marg that leads to Yamuna Sports Complex in east Delhi where the archery contests are to be held.        
	PWD officials blamed the incessant rain of the past few weeks for the cave-in. Delhi had its first full sunny day today after over a month of showers that slowed down Games-related construction.        
	The day was marked by a flurry of foreign teams visits to the village, about which there had been complaints days back that it was unliveable.         
	The Games organising committee breathed easier after Australia and New Zealand confirmed their participation. New Zealand had, in particular, had complained about the filthy conditions in the complex.        
	England, whose first batch arrived today and was among those to have checked into star hotels, warned that more and swift action is required at the Village before their next group lands on Sunday.        
	Our next wave of athletes arrives on Sunday and a lot needs to happen before then, Englands chef de mission Craig Hunter said.         
	But this mornings road collapse continued to stoke worries, coming as it did after the collapse of an under-construction footbridge near Jawaharlal Nehru stadium, the main venue, and a part of a ceiling at one of the venues earlier this week.        
	The PWD, which was in charge of the road that caved in, was also tasked with having the showpiece bridge built through a private company. Late tonight, unconfirmed reports on some TV channels said the army would be asked to finish the work on the bridge.        
	But as the authorities raced ahead with construction, co-ordination gaps in security cropped up.         
	Around 200 members of the dedicated medical team set up for the Games were denied entry to the village. The group, which included doctors, nurses and paramedics, later staged a protest outside the gates.         
	The team members said they had not been issued such passes despite the completion of their security clearance over a month back. The staff claimed they had been asked to reach the complex despite the lack of documents.

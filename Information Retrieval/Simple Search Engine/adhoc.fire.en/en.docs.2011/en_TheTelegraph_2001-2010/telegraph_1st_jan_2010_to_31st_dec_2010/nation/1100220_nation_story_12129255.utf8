          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            (Top) Shamim in hospital on Friday; the gun he used during the stand-off                                 
	Lucknow, Feb. 19: A mathematics topper suffering from bouts of depression locked himself in a room of his house with a gun for over 40 hours and fired at anyone he could see, the stand-off ending this evening when he was tranquillised with chloroform.        
	Police said Mohammad Shamim alias Raju, 27, suffered from delusional paranoia, a condition where he conjured up imaginary enemies and battled them.         
	Shamim, who stood first in Lucknow Universitys mathematics MSc exam in 2007, had sunk into depression as he was unemployed.         
	Shamim, his father Dr Shabbir Ahmad said, wanted to join the civil service but could not clear the exams. He was currently pursuing a course in education to become a schoolteacher.         
	The stand-off began around 1am on Wednesday when Shamim, who had his room on the second floor of the three-storeyed house at Bakshi-ka-Talab, complained to his father that he was unable to sleep.         
	His parents stayed on the first floor while Ahmad had his chamber on the ground floor.        
	Shamims father calmed him down by asking him to return to his room while he got some medicines. The youth went back to his room, but when Ahmad came up with the pills, he was greeted with gunfire.         
	Unknown to the doctor, his son had got hold of his licensed double-barrelled gun along with the cartridges.         
	Through the night, Ahmad tried to cajole his son into opening his door, but Shamim did not respond. Fearing that he might do something extreme, Ahmad decided it was best to leave his son alone and wait for morning. Early yesterday, he approached the police.        
	The police sent a heavy contingent to the plush home on the outskirts of Lucknow, but the youth held them off. The moment he spotted anyone coming anywhere close to the house, a police official said, he opened fire screaming: Let me talk to a government official.         
	Initially, the police tried emotional dialogue and sprayed anaesthetic chemicals to put him to sleep. Shamim got wind of it and immediately opened the windows to clear the fumes.        
	Two policemen, including Arun Dwivedi, a station house officer, were injured in the firing by the youth when they tried to lob teargas shells inside the room. Shamim fired more than 20 rounds.        
	The police also tried to flood his room by pumping in water, but Shamim refused to relent.        
	The police then attached a spy camera to a lamp and tried to lower it into the room through the ventilator to keep watch on his activities. Shamim immediately smashed the bulb.        
	He was constantly under the fear that he would be shot dead like a criminal, a police official said.        
	With the stand-off showing no sign of ending, the police again decided to plant a CCTV camera in his room to work on strategies on how to tame him. This time, they succeeded.         
	Around 2pm today, the police dug a hole in the roof and lowered the camera through it. They found Shamim sitting quietly in a corner of the room, the gun kept some distance away.        
	The police then sprayed chloroform into the room which made Shamim semiconscious.         
	The police team then watched him for another two hours. Around 5.30pm, we spotted no movement in the room. The gun being used by Shamim was lying far from him, a police official said.        
	Two teams of police commandos then broke open the door and barged into the room. While one team overpowered Shamim, who was lying down, another got hold of the gun he was using, said additional superintendent of police (rural) Ashok Prasad.        
	Shamim has been admitted to the trauma centre at King George Medical College and Hospital.

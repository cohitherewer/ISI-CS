The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Health wins study war with HRD
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Health wins study war with HRD
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 3: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has declared that the health ministry will soon introduce a draft bill for a health education regulator, signalling an end to a tug of war between the health and human resource development ministries.         
	In a convocation address at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here on Friday, Singh said the health ministry after extensive consultations had prepared a draft bill for a national council for human resources in health, which would soon be introduced in Parliament.         
	The bill will seek to create an enabling environment that will address issues of quality, quantity and equitable distribution of medical education resources, Singh said.         
	The health ministry had proposed a new overarching agency to regulate human resources in health, while the HRD ministry had been pursuing a national unified commission for all higher education fields, a concept pitched by two independent expert panels.         
	The moves towards a new body emerged amid criticism of existing bodies, such as the Medical Council of India, for poor functioning and concerns that they had been unable to address acute shortages and uneven distribution of human resources in health education.         
	However, the HRD ministry led by minister Kapil Sibal had been seeking a unified commission for higher education that would, through several subcommittees, cover all disciplines, including engineering and health education.         
	The idea of a national commission for higher education and research had emerged two years ago as a recommendation of a panel led by the former UGC chairman, Professor Yash Pal.         
	The Yash Pal committee had pointed out that India had 13 educational councils governing various areas  from teacher education to medicine, dentistry and nursing to law. The proposed commission was intended to function with greater academic freedom and institutional autonomy.         
	The health ministry and sections of the medical community had opposed the concept of giving up an oversight on health education.        
	The commission for higher education would compress a large number of diverse and unrelated, but specialised, areas under a single body, said a doctor who had advised the health ministry against the proposal. Health education cannot be taken away from the main stakeholders  also, this is a concurrent subject, and there were also concerns that states would not agree to such a commission.         
	The proposed national council for human resources in health is expected to have smaller panels of experts that will regulate different health sectors  medicine, dentistry, nursing and physiotherapy.         
	In his address, Singh also said AIIMS and other similar institutions should prepare learning resources that could be easily accessed across India. Many of our medical colleges are deficient in the resources needed to train specialists. High quality faculty is in short supply, he said calling for development of distance learning programmes.

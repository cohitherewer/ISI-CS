          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Agrave; masked Kashmiri demonstrator at Bilal Ahmad rsquo;s funeral   on Monday. (AP)                          
	Srinagar, Aug. 23: A mother and daughter died last night when militants stormed the house of a man they suspected was a police informer.        
	Police said four terrorists entered Mohammed Hussain Gorsis house in the Nanmarg area in Kulgam district. They fired indiscriminately at his family, killing Gorsis 40-year-old wife Shakeela and 19-year-old daughter Zareena. No militant group has yet claimed its hand in the killings.        
	The police said hundreds of residents took part in the funeral procession amid tight security today.         
	In adjoining Pulwama district, Ghulam Nabi Wani was shot dead today in what the police claimed was another militant attack. Wani was an employee of the Jammu and Kashmir social welfare department. In this case too, no terrorist group has accepted responsibility.        
	At the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences in Srinagar, a youth wounded in police firing seven days ago succumbed to his injuries. Baramulla resident Bilal Ahmad Sheikhs death has taken the protesters casualty toll in the Valley to 63 in the past 10 weeks of unrest.         
	The police said Bilal was injured on August 14 during a protest when mobs threw stones at the security forces.         
	Today, though curfew remained in force across Kashmir, incidents of stone-pelting were reported from Pulwama district. The police said 28 personnel, among them the Pulwama superintendent of police, as well as three CRPF officers were injured. One protester was injured in the baton-charge by the forces.        
	PDP president Mehbooba Mufti today said: The Centre should start immediate and serious negotiations for a final and dignified resolution of the Kashmir problem in all its dimensions.         
	She added: (The Centre should) order the dismantling of the present repressive arrangement in Kashmir and set free the youth and political leaders besides stop using brute force against civilians.         
	On the outskirts of Srinagar on Saturday, residents of a posh locality refused to join stone-throwing protesters. A police officer said some youths asked people in Peerbagh to take part in protests. The Peerbagh residents declined after which the youths threw stones at some houses, he said.        
	An FIR has been lodged against one of the youths.

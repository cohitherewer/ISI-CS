          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Naveen Patnaik reviews construction of flood and cyclone shelters on Thursday. (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 29: Orissa, which has faced natural calamities 125 times in the past 107 years, will soon be ready with another 164 multi-purpose cyclone shelters and 50 flood shelters in the vulnerable coastal belt.         
	Reviewing the progress, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today directed the officials to complete construction of all flood shelters by March 2011. He also asked departments to expedite construction of cyclone shelters, official sources here said.        
	Orissa has been identified as prone to natural disasters including tsunami, cyclone and floods.         
	The economy of this coastal state has been badly hit, according to the state disaster management department. The state suffered a loss of Rs 17,385 crore during 1994-2007 due to devastation by natural calamities, according to figures available with the department.         
	In the past 107 years, floods devastated the state on 56 occasions, cyclone hit 23 times and drought occurred 39 times.        
	Compared to neighbouring states, the frequency of cyclones in coastal Orissa is more. The state deals with a cyclone every 1.3 years, while the corresponding frequency of cyclones visiting Andhra Pradesh is 1.8 and Bengal and Tamil Nadu are 2.4 years.        
	In 1999, the state was ravaged by a super-cyclone that claimed more than 1,000 lives.        
	After the 1999 super cyclone, more than 200 multi-purpose cyclone shelters had been constructed in the vulnerable pockets with assistance from the World Bank, Red Cross, Centre and various state governments.        
	The construction of another 164 cyclone shelters had been taken up under the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project and Integrated Coastal Zone Management Programme.         
	Fifty cyclone shelters are being constructed in flood-prone coastal Balasore, Bhadrak, Jajpur, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack, Puri, Khurda and Ganjam districts at a cost of Rs 28.99 crore from the chief ministers relief fund.

	 New Delhi, Oct. 7: A cyclone in the west-central Bay of Bengal is expected to strike the Orissa coast tonight, the national weather agency said, advising fishermen along the eastern coast not to venture into the sea.           
	The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said squally winds with speeds touching 55kmph should be expected along and off the coasts of northern Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Bengal over the next 48 hours. The IMD said the depression over the Bay of Bengal was centred about 700-km southwest of Digha in Bengal and 220-km southwest of Gopalpur in Orissa. Weather forecasts indicate the system will intensify further and cross the Orissa coast between Gopalpur and Paradip tonight. The sea condition is expected to be very rough along and off these coasts in the hours before and after the cyclone crosses the coast.

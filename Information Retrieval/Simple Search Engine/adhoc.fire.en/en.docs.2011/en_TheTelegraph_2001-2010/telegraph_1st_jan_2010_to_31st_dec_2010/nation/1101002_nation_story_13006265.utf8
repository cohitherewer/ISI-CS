          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: The Indian Air Force is developing an advanced landing ground near the China border in Ladakh that it revived last year into a full-fledged base for fighter aircraft.         
	At 13,300ft, Nyoma, 130km south-east of Ladakh and 40km from the Line of Actual Control with China, is set to be the highest airbase.        
	Air Marshal N.A.K. Browne, the chief of the Western Air Command, said today the IAF proposed to upgrade Nyoma to a level where it could base its Sukhoi 30Mki multi-role combat jets.        
	Nyoma was revived after 40 years last September when an AN32 transport plane landed on the compacted runway.         
	The landing base will now be given a harder surface  the runway is about 12,000ft and long enough for fighter aircraft  and permanent quarters for the IAF will be built.        
	There are other advanced landing bases that are higher than Nyoma but they are not all-weather and are too close to the border for the IAF to base fighter aircraft.        
	The expansion of Nyoma is one of a series of airfield modernisation projects taken up since the government revised its policy and began upgrading infrastructure along the border.         
	Indias military has watched rapid development of roads, airfields, bridges and railways in Tibet warily.        
	Despite the military competition, India and China are continuing with confidence building measures.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Valley BSF officer seeks bail
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Valley BSF officer seeks bail
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, March 2: The BSF commandant suspended for allegedly ordering the shooting of a teenager last month has sought anticipatory bail.        
	R.K. Birdi filed the plea before the district and session judge yesterday, fearing arrest after the constable arrested for shooting dead 16-year-old Zahid Farooq told the police that the officer had told him to open fire on February 5. Birdi was apparently enraged after Zahid and a group of boys jeered at his squad.        
	Birdis plea came up for hearing today, but was adjourned as neither he nor his lawyer appeared in the court. The matter will be heard tomorrow.         
	G.N. Shaheen, appearing on behalf of the victim, and the Kashmir High Court Bar Association, which has taken up Zahids case, said they would oppose the bail plea. He (Birdi) should not get bail because he has committed a heinous crime under Section 302 (dealing with murder).         
	Shaheen said an accused booked under the section could be punished with a life term or even death.        
	Zahids death had sparked widespread protests, and has become a test case for the Omar Abdullah government to act against men in uniform, who otherwise enjoy immunity under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and other tough laws.         
	Today, Omar told the Assembly it was the first time in 20 years that a BSF trooper had been handed over to the state police. Can the PDP (Peoples Democratic Party) cite any such example during their tenure? the chief minister said, alluding to the partys protests over the death.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ire spills on blind school campus 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Biranchi Sahoo                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 5: A senior education officer, who came to Bhima Bhoi School for Blind to find a solution to students agitation, left in a huff, after directing the principal to file an FIR against protesting students.         
	The mass protest began this morning with visually challenged students squatting on the school premises shouting slogans. They locked up class rooms and demanded filling up of all teaching and non-teaching posts, enhancement of their monthly diet allowance, dismissal of all irregular posting of teachers and availability of free text books.         
	Director of secondary education Dharanidhar Nath reached the campus along with circle inspector of schools Priti Pratibha Bhol in the afternoon.         
	Who gave them the authority to lock the classrooms? File an FIR against them, Nath ordered the principal, enraging students even more.         
	They say we have stolen important documents and allege that we assaulted them. Its all false. Our demands are genuine and we will fight for justice, said Biranchi Sahoo, a student, whose attempted suicide due to harassment by some teachers had prompted the protest. Is this a way to address the problems of these disabled students? rued Sanyas Behera, the secretary of the Orissa Blind Association.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          Narayanan. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Calcutta, May 6: Indias neighbours arent doing enough for regional co-operation, Bengal governor M.K. Narayanan said here today, relishing the opportunity to hold forth on a subject close to his heart as a former security strategist.        
	Most of the countries in the region (sub continent) are beset by internal crises. The biggest impediment has been the lack of trust, Narayanan said on the sidelines of an event to launch think tank Aspen Institute Indias Calcutta chapter.        
	A little earlier, he had spoken on Indias Engagement with the World, a topic that seemed to transport him back to his previous assignment as national security adviser (NSA). The improvement of bilateral relations is an important component of any foreign policy, and India has succeeded in establishing a network of mutually beneficial relations with all countries of the world, Narayanan said in his 30-minute keynote address to the audience of over a hundred at a city hotel.        
	His words on the sidelines of the event were more pointed. Narayanan said India had been a generous neighbour, dismantling trade barriers in South Asia. He pointed out that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had been eager to move ahead with the Saarc but there had often been little reciprocation. The remarks came against the backdrop of last weeks Saarc summit in Bhutan.        
	After his speech, the governor interacted with members of the audience. The Indian government has taken initiatives to further strengthen ties with our neighbours, he said.         
	N-bill in House today        
	The controversial nuclear liability bill, key to operationalising the civilian nuclear deal with the US, will be introduced in the Lok Sabha tomorrow, the final day of the budget session, reports PTI.        
	The bill was included in the Houses revised list of business tonight after Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and RJD leader Lalu Prasad reportedly promised to back the government on the issue. The BJP and the Left oppose the legislation, called the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill.

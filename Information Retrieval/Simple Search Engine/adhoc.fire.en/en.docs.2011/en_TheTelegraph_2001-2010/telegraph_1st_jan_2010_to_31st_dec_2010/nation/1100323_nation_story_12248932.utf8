The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trinamul protest over airport land
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Trinamul protest over airport land
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, March 22: Activists of the Trinamul Congress-led Save Farmland Committee stormed a government office today and foiled a meeting with villagers on land acquisition in Burdwans Andal for the aerotropolis project.        
	Four officials, led by district land acquisition officer Anwarul Haque, decided to stop work and leave after the protesters, nearly 400 of them, allegedly pushed them around and tried to snatch their files. The villagers were in a violent mood and we were scared, one of the four officials said.        
	This is the third phase of land acquisition for the aerotropolis project  which will include an airport, industrial and logistics hub and IT parks  in which Singapores Changi Airport is a strategic partner.         
	The villagers are demanding Rs 20 lakh per acre  to be paid to landowners  and 50 per cent of land value to registered bargadars (sharecroppers). The protesters insisted they had already set their terms and, therefore, such meetings were unnecessary.         
	We have already said we will not give land unless our demands are met. So there is no need for any hearing, said Manoj Roy, a Trinamul worker and president of the committee, who owns five acres.        
	The administration has offered Rs 7.5 lakh to Rs 11.24 lakh per acre, depending on fertility and location, and 25 per cent of the land value to sharecroppers.        
	Despite the trouble today, Abhijeet Mukhopadhyay, additional district magistrate, land acquisition, said: We will continue our hearing tomorrow.

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, April 25: The home ministry is reworking the project report on the ambitious National Intelligence Grid after running into hurdles within the government over questions of privacy and safeguards.        
	Top sources told The Telegraph the report would be ready by August and would then be sent to the cabinet committee on security (CCS).        
	The grid is expected to be a network of 21 databases that can be viewed in real time by 11 select agencies including the Intelligence Bureau, Research and Analysis Wing, Director General of Military Intelligence and components of the Enforcement Directorate.        
	When a CCS meeting in February discussed the Natgrid proposal, objections were raised mainly over safeguards and privacy. Now, with the report being reworked, the phone-tapping scandal should also be on the minds of the architects of the project, which aims to create a channel for seamless flow of intelligence from a variety of sources.        
	While phone-tapping has been practised for decades as an eavesdropping tool, Natgrid  conceived after the 26/11 attacks exposed poor co-ordination among various agencies  is expected to keep track of other aspects of citizens daily lives. Further, a link-up with a foreign agency database would help the home ministry keep tabs on foreign visitors as well.        
	A security source said Natgrid, a project headed by Raghu Raman, an information security expert, could be compared to the railway reservation system where tickets can be booked from any station or over the Internet. Intelligence agencies will no longer have an excuse to say that they did not know about something, the source said.         
	Sources said even bank and insurance company data would be available in real time to the government through Natgrid. Today, instances of money-laundering come to the governments notice only after a tedious process.        
	Lakhs of transactions are received every day by the finance ministry. Every bank and insurance company sends these transactions on CDs which the finance ministry can analyse, a top home ministry official said.        
	But the process of sifting the information needs to be computerised with safeguards for privacy to prevent leaks, sources said.        
	Even telecom and Internet service providers will be linked with Natgrid, the sources said, which could help intelligence agencies trace credit card and debit card transactions or property transfers.        
	What is anyones guess, however, is whether the agencies will actually enter data and share details with the entire establishment. Home ministry sources, though, said it would be ensured that all who have intelligence do share it.

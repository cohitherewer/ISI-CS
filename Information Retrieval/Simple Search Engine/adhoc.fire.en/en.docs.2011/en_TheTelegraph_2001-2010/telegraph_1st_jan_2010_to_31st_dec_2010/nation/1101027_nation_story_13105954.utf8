          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Oct. 26: Writer Arundhati Roy today said Kashmiris live under one of the most brutal military occupations in the world.        
	Her assertion came in the middle of demands for her arrest on the charge of sedition.        
	Roy supported Kashmirs azaadi struggle at a seminar in Delhi last week, following it up with a claim on Sunday at another seminar here where she said Kashmir was never an integral part of India.         
	I said what millions of people here (in Kashmir) say everyday. I spoke about justice for the people of Kashmir who live under one of the most brutal military occupations in the world, Roy said today.

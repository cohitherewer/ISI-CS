          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 6: The Narendra Modi government today requested the Supreme Court to hear its objections to the special investigating team probing key Gujarat riot cases, the demand made over a week after the panel quizzed the chief minister.        
	The change of stand by the government, which had given its consent to the setting up of the SIT by the court in 2008, came as the judges ordered that two senior Gujarat IPS officers on the panel not be associated with the probe for now.         
	Geeta Johri and Shivanand Jha face allegations from riot victims of being biased, with some NGOs and activists representing them claiming that the two officers arent co-operating with the public prosecutors in the trials.        
	Now questions are being raised about the SITs role. The court will now have to hear us (on whether these cases could be probed by the SIT), the states counsel, Mukul Rohtagi, said. He also opposed the demand from the victims for a stay on the trials in the cases being probed by the SIT till the team is reconstituted. The government, which wants the trials wrapped up, has argued that a stay will violate the CrPC.        
	The court will hear on April 19 the plea for staying the trials. It will take up the objections against the SIT on April 28.        
	The SIT had quizzed Modi on March 27 in the case related to the murder of Congress leader Ehsan Jafri during the 2002 riots.

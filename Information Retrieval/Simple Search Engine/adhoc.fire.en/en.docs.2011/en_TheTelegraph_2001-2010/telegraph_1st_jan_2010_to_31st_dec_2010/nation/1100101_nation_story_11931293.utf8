	 Calcutta, Dec. 31: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee refrained from attacking Mamata Banerjee at todays thinly attended rally of the CPM labour arm, leaving all the criticism of the railway minister to state Citu chief Shyamal Chakraborty.          
	It wasnt clear if his silence on Mamata was his way of reciprocating yesterdays gesture by the Trinamul Congress chief, who had rolled back a party programme to prevent a clash with the Citu meeting at the Metro channel.                  
	New Delhi: The office of the Delhi lieutenant-governor on Thursday gave the CBI the go-ahead to prosecute Congress leader Sajjan Kumar. He is accused of encouraging mob violence against Sikhs during the 1984 riots.

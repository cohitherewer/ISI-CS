The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hindu blast cloud widens

	Jaipur, May 2 (PTI): Three arrests in the Ajmer Dargah blast of 2007 have prompted investigators to probe if Hindu fundamentalist outfits are behind explosions in some shrines in the country.        
	Two of the suspects  Chandrashekhar and Vishnu Patidar  were picked up yesterday from Madhya Pradesh by Rajasthans anti-terrorism squad (ATS). Chandrashekhar is suspected to have links with Hindu outfits and was allegedly a key member of the terror module involved in the explosion near the Ajmer shrine, which killed three persons, sources said.        
	The two arrests came after Devendra Gupta, suspected to be linked to a radical Hindu group called the Abhinav Bharat Sangathan, was held last Wednesday. Officials are also probing Guptas alleged ties with sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, a key accused in the 2008 Malegaon blasts.        
	The breakthroughs by the ATS have prompted the CBI to join the Ajmer probe to find out if those arrested had a role in the blast at Hyderabads Mecca Masjid in May 2007, sources said.        
	A joint team of the ATS, CBI and central agencies is questioning Gupta and Chandrashekar on their possible involvement in the Hyderabad blast, the sources said. The probe at Ajmer had suggested the low-intensity tin-box bomb, packed with splinters, was similar to the contraption used in the Mecca Masjid blast.         
	The Ajmer investigators zeroed in on Gupta after tracking the Abhinav Bharat, alleged to have plotted the Malegaon blasts. A Rajasthan ATS team recently visited Mumbai to collect the findings of the narco-analysis and brain-mapping tests done on Lt Col S.P. Purohit and other accused in the Malegaon blast cases, the sources said.        
	Purohit, an alleged mastermind of the Abhinav Bharat group, had told investigators during the tests that another member, Dayanand Pandey, among the Malegaon attack accused, had also planned the Ajmer strike, the sources claimed. The Rajasthan team collected call details of Purohit, his interrogation report and other documents related to the Malegaon probe, after which they mounted surveillance on Gupta, the sources said.        
	Chandrashekhar was today produced before an Ajmer court, which remanded him in police custody for 11 days. Patidar has also been brought to Ajmer for further investigations.

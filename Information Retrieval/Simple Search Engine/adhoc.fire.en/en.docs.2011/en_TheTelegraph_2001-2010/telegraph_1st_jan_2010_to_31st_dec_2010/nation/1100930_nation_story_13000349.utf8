The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Peace key to nervous Congress, BJP smug
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Peace key to nervous Congress, BJP smug
          SANJAY K. JHA AND J.P. YADAV                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: A slightly nervous Congress leadership feels that the immediate priority should be to ensure that the verdict is not followed by untoward incidents.        
	The Congress is confident that it can minimise the political impact of the verdict if communal harmony in the country is not disturbed significantly.        
	An eruption of violence will discredit the party much in the same manner as the P.V. Narasimha Rao governments record in the early nineties.        
	The Congress leadership is convinced that many political parties are seeing this as an opportunity to revive their fortunes. If the next few days pass off peacefully and the matter goes to the Supreme Court, we can overcome the threat without significant losses. We are keeping our fingers crossed, a cabinet minister said.        
	The partys deep sense of unease was reflected in Sonia Gandhis decision to issue an appeal for peace, although Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, home minister P. Chidambaram, the cabinet and the party had issued similar pleas in the past few days.        
	Sonia said in a statement today: It is my humble request to all of you to accept the verdict in the same liberal spirit and great tradition that this country is known for. Have faith in the judiciary and maintain peace and communal amity at all costs. Indias biggest strength is the emotional unity of its people.        
	Sonia also recalled Indias pluralistic and secular ethos, the collective rationale of the society and the capacity to honour judicial pronouncements.        
	Although the Congress had often stated the Ram temple was no more a big political issue, party general secretary Digvijay Singh justified the flurry of appeals: On both sides, there are fringe elements who thrive in a communally charged environment. They would like to polarise the body politic.        
	The Congress has learnt lessons from the mistakes of the Rao regime and asked the government to deal with the situation with an iron hand.        
	But the party said it was not very confident of the attitude of BJP-led governments. Digvijay, who expressed satisfaction with the Mayavati governments preparations, said: The BJPs conduct does not inspire confidence.        
	Digvijay, who was blasted by the BJP today for his acerbic remarks, said: If the BJP and the Sangh parivar maintain peace and harmony after tomorrows verdict, I will reconsider my views. But their conduct and character so far have been suspect.        
	He added: The communal forces will not be allowed to create trouble this time. But there are some elements in the Sangh parivar who would like to incite trouble.        
	The BJP leadership has been trying to change but the Congress wants to ensure that the blame falls on the Sangh parivar in case violence breaks out.        
	The BJP today fielded its Muslim face, Shahnawaz Hussain, and accused the Congress of stoking communal tension through irresponsible statements.        
	Unlike the tense Congress, BJP leaders today appeared relaxed, calculating that whichever way the verdict goes, it did not have much to lose.        
	Hussain said: The BJP is a responsible political party. It has already appealed for peace. Digvijay Singh should not cross the limits of propriety and give nonsensical statements that could breach peace.        
	BJP sources said the party had deliberately adopted the strategy of not jumping the gun before the verdict. Party insiders said all leaders had been told to refrain from issuing sensitive statements. A meeting of the partys core committee has been scheduled after the verdict to devise the partys line.         
	The BJP feels it can afford to wait and watch as it will be the Congress that may find itself in a tight corner if polarisation sets in after the verdict.        
	The only worry, BJP leaders admit, is the upcoming poll in Bihar, where Nitish Kumar is nervous over the issue. The party, however, is discounting the possibility of Nitish severing ties with the BJP as it is too late now.

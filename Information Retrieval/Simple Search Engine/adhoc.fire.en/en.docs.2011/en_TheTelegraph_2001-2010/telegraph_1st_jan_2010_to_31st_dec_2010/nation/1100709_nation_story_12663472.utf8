  - Delhi claims evidence of payments from Lashkar channel abroad to Valley mobs engaged in street battles        NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                     
	New Delhi, July 8: The Union home ministry has claimed it has evidence that stone throwers in the Kashmir Valley are being paid from abroad by Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives through a money-transfer agency.        
	The agency  one of the well-known ones in the business of channelling funds across countries  has been used by the Lashkar operatives in Pakistan to route money to Dubai and then transfer it to Srinagar and other towns in Kashmir.         
	The remittances for throwing stones  sometimes as less as Rs 300 daily  have been tracked by intelligence agencies, ministry sources said.        
	Last year, the agencies were perplexed why such small amounts of money were being transferred from places in Europe to Kashmir. The riddle has apparently been solved now.         
	In the past three months, 716 incidents of violence have been reported in the Valley and more than 200 paramilitary personnel injured, the sources said.         
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram appeared to acknowledge such cross-border financial links to the current unrest in the Valley when he threw his lot behind embattled chief minister Omar Abdullah.         
	In a move seen as his support to Omar, Chidambaram again appealed to the people of Kashmir to respect the curfew. He also urged parents to discourage their children from participating in the mob violence.        
	The Centre appears keen to retain Omar despite the spiralling trouble.         
	The CRPF has been told to desist from saying that only two of the 15 deaths in recent firing incidents were caused by the central forces bullets. Most of the deaths were, apparently, from firing by Omars police.        
	Eight more companies of the BSF and the CRPF have been sent to assist the police.        
	At the same time, the Centre wants Omar to engage more politically and take other political parties into confidence in quelling the flare-up.

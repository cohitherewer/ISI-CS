          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 27: The Scientific Advisory Council to the Prime Minister today asked states to produce vision documents on science and technology in a fresh move aimed at increasing state involvement in science planning and research.         
	The vision documents would allow states to outline their goals, requirements and constraints in science and technology, members of the council said after a meeting with representatives of state science and technology councils.         
	We need to see greater investments in science and technology from the states... for science and technology to gain an upper hand in the development of the states, a source who attended the meeting said.         
	Current science and technology investments from states are meagre and even states that invest more than others are not able to use all grants, the source said. The state councils have been asked to use local institutions to generate the vision document.              
	 as a first step towards articulating the potential of enhancing the role of science and technology in each state.         
	Bengal, for instance, could make use of expertise at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics or the Indian Association of Cultivation of Science in Calcutta to prepare the document, the source said.         
	Each state, the source said, has also been asked to provide within the next 10 days two or three points as inputs for a National Development Council (NDC) meeting focused exclusively on science and technology planned for later this year.         
	In a meeting in January this year, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had accepted a recommendation of the SAC-PM to convene a meeting of the NDC to discuss science and technology in the states.         
	The SAC-PM  an advisory body of scientists and policy makers  had played a key role in establishing the new Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, and creating a new mechanism for science and engineering research funding.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Passport delay onus on home
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Passport delay onus on home
                            
	Coimbatore, March 25 (PTI): The home ministry is not willing to simplify the police verification process for issuing passports because of security concerns despite several requests, junior external affairs minister Shashi Tharoor said today.        
	Due to security concerns, the ministry is unwilling to relax or simplify the present norms, Tharoor told reporters here, adding his department was talking to the home ministry to simplify the verification procedure.        
	Tharoors statement came in response to a question on the massive backlog of passport applications, much of it caused by delays in police verification.        
	The minister pointed out that two Pakistanis had been issued Indian passports despite police verification, saying it was a cause for worry and appearing to suggest the background checks were not foolproof.        
	Asked if postal ID would be accepted as proof in passport applications, Tharoor said there were no immediate plans to add any more documents to the existing ones, such as PAN, ration cards and bank statements. However, once the Unique Identification Number, a project now under way, is allotted, it will be easier for applicants, he said.        
	To a question on whether the delay and backlog was caused by the large number of vacancies in passport offices, Tharoor said he would study the problem and take necessary steps to provide more staff.

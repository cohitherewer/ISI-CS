                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Emissary for Ulfa talks
          OUR BUREAU                              
	June 16: The Centre today decided to start talks with Ulfa without waiting for the outfits commander-in-chief Paresh Barua and formally endorsed the name of former Intelligence Bureau director P.C. Haldar as the interlocutor.         
	The decision was taken after Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday and Union home minister P. Chidambaram today.        
	Gogoi had called on the home minister to apprise him of the developments since the Assam cabinet agreed in principle to start talks with the outfit last month. During the half-an-hour meeting, Chidambaram informed Gogoi of Haldars new responsibilities.        
	Gogoi told the home minister that the proposed peace initiative with Ulfa was moving in the right direction, a statement issued here said. The two leaders also discussed the modalities for the start of the talks process.        
	The majority of Ulfa leaders favour talks and the government has appointed P.C. Haldar as interlocutor, Gogoi had said after the talks with Chidambaram.         
	We cant wait for Paresh Barua for an indefinite period. We have appealed to him to come but the response hasnt been positive, Gogoi added.        
	Barua, the Centre maintains, is somewhere in Myanmar or China but his exact whereabouts are not known. There have been unconfirmed reports, however, that the Ulfa leader may be in the custody of Bangladeshi authorities. Home ministry officials have not denied reports that a close Barua aide was recently arrested in Bangladesh.        
	Sources in Gogois office said Haldars appointment was expected as he was already the interlocutor for talks with other insurgent outfits in the Northeast.

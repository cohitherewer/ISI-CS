The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Yeddy gets long rope before rural polls 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Yeddy gets long rope before rural polls 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 20: Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappas job seems to be safe for the moment, sources in the BJP said.        
	Yeddyurappa returned to Bangalore this morning after meeting L.K. Advani, party president Nitin Gadkari and other central leaders last night with his senior colleagues from the government and the party.        
	The RSS view that he should be retained till the December zilla panchayat polls has prevailed over the BJP leadership, sources said. The sub-text is that if Yeddyurappa can keep up his winning streak and deliver another victory, he has a good chance of continuing in office. If he fails, his time is up.        
	The government is expected to announce the election schedule early next week.        
	A political source close to Gadkari and the RSS said: The thinking is, give him a longer rope. I cannot say what the length of the rope is I will not be able to specify the time for which he will stay. But hes also been given a list of dos and donts.        
	No central leader applauded Yeddyurappas decision to seek a judicial probe into the land deals he and his family have been implicated in or to return the plots they were allegedly allotted out of turn.         
	Party spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad routinely mentioned these when answering a question on Karnataka.        
	The chief minister has been told to tone up governance, work with team spirit and keep the party in the loop, sources said. State party chief K.S. Ishwarappa had complained to the RSS and the BJPs central leadership that he often learnt of major policies through the media because he was not even informed, let alone consulted.        
	However, the RSS and the BJP also realise that as long as Yeddyurappa has detractors in Karnataka and Delhi, he would face the threat of destabilisation. One misstep and hes in trouble. Our other chief ministers have survived worse crises because they dont face internal dissidence. Yeddyurappa has to contend with the Reddys (of Bellary) and their backers in Delhi, a source said.        
	The source said Gadkari and those leaders who take an objective view of the chief minister would now monitor Karnataka more closely and see if they can help curtail the nuisance value of Bellarys mining millionaires.        
	Yesterday, shortly before meeting Gadkari, a defiant Yeddyurappa told journalists in Delhi that Janata Dal (Secular) leaders H.D. Deve Gowda and H.D. Kumaraswamy were out to malign him and topple his government and warned he would expose them. Who are they to force me to resign? he asked.        
	The Opposition was frustrated with his development work and feared that it would enable him to stay in power for 10 or 15 years, the chief minister said. But the claim did not cut ice in Delhi.

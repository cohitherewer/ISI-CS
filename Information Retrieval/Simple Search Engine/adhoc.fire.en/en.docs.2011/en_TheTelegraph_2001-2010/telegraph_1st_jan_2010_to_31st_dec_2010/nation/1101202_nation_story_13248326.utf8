	Madrid, Dec. 1 (AFP): Six Pakistanis and a Nigerian suspected of providing forged passports to those linked to the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai have been arrested by Spanish police.        
	The seven are said to be associated with the Lashkar-e-Toiba and al Qaida.        
	Three others  two Pakistanis and a Thai national were held in Thailand as part of the same Operation Kampai, the Spanish interior ministry said in a statement.        
	Officers detained the suspects in raids in and around the northeastern city of Barcelona late on Tuesday.         
	The gang stole documents, including passports, which were sent to Thailand to be forged and then delivered to al-Qaida-linked terrorist groups, in particular the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba that has been accused of plotting the Mumbai attacks, it said.        
	The gang also supplied such forged documents to the defeated Sri Lankan separatist group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the statement said.        
	In total, seven people have been arrested in Barcelona (six Pakistanis and a Nigerian), all belonging to a cell providing documentation for terrorist organisations linked to al Qaida, it said.        
	The international structure was led by a Pakistani citizen living in Thailand. He has been detained. He directed the cells based in Europe, decided the features of the passports to obtain and, which once they were received in Bangkok, supplied them to different terrorist groups, the statement added.        
	During the investigation, which began a year and a half ago, the police have detected a number of stolen passports taken from Spain to Thailand, which were stolen almost entirely in the province of Barcelona from tourists who met the requirements stipulated by the World Islamic Front in order to be used by members of different terrorist cells linked to al Qaida, the statement said.        
	It added that the operation had neutralised a vast cell involved in providing passports for al Qaida.         
	In the raids, the police seized stolen passports, a computer and hard drives and mobile phones, the ministry said.         
	The operation, which was carried out in conjunction with the police forces of Thailand and European countries, is continuing, the ministry said.        
	Last August, Spanish police had arrested a Moroccan man suspected of recruiting Islamic extremists through the Internet and raising funds for terror groups.        
	In September, the police in Barcelona also detained an Algerian-born US citizen suspected of raising funds for al Qaidas north African branch.

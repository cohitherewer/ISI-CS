	Ranchi, Jan. 2: The state government has ordered a high-level probe into alleged custodial deaths in Palamau district.         
	Sources at the police headquarters said one Rajendra Yadav (20) was detained by Palamau police on December 30 for interrogation in a murder case. He was a native of Telari village under Chhatarpur PS in Palamau district.        
	On December 31, his father Dashrath Prasad Yadav contacted the local police station to inquire about his son. He was reportedly told that his son had been sent to Daltonganj for further interrogation.         
	However, on January 1 when the boy was not released, the father met the police superintendent. Thereafter, he was directed to go to the police station. There Dashrath found his son lying on the ground, unconscious. Finally the police took the accused to Sadar hospital, where he was declared dead.

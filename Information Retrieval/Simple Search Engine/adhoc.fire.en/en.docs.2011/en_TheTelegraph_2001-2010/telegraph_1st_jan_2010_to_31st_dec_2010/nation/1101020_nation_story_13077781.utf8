                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rao hears hope in applause
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                         Nirupama Rao     
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao today said she saw hope for a better India-Pakistan relationship, citing the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony where spectators reserved their loudest cheers for the Pakistani contingent.         
	Rao, who was addressing students and faculty at Delhis Jamia Millia Islamia University, acknowledged that a host of issues continues to bedevil India-Pakistan relations.        
	 And yet, how does one explain the warm and spontaneous applause of thousands of spectators at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium when the Pakistani contingent entered the stadium or the statements of support from the Pakistani sports authorities in the run-up to the Games. What explains this? asked Rao.         
	Her comments come within days of Pakistan voting for India to be elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.

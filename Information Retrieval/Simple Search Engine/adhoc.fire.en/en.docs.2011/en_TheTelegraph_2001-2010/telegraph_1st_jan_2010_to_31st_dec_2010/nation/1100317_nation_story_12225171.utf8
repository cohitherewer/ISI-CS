          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 16: The state Assembly today witnessed pandemonium over a TV programme that poked fun at politicians with both ruling BJD and Opposition MLAs storming the well, forcing five adjournments.        
	Moving a privilege motion against OTV, a private television channel that telecasts a programme called Great Orissa Political Circus, senior BJD member Pradeep Maharathy alleged that character assassinations of politicians, including chief minister Naveen Patnaik, was being carried out on the show. The manner in which the ministers and legislators were being portrayed amounted to denigration of their image, he added. Such programmes cause mental turmoil to ministers and MLAs. If it is not stopped, I will turn mad, said Maharathy.        
	Supporting Maharathy, his party colleagues  Nrusingha Charan Sahu, Ananta Das, Arabinda Dhali, Jivan Pradip Das, Maheswar Mohanty, Pravat Tripathy, Kalpataru Das and Ashok Chandra Panda  Congress members Anup Sai and Nabakishore Das and NCP member Prasant Nanda also joined the protest.        
	Dubbing the programme highly objectionable, the agitated members said it amounted to breach of privilege of the House and demanded a ban on the programme and action against the editor for defamatory remarks against politicians. The editor should be summoned to the House and asked to tender apology, the members demanded.        
	 After an hour-long debate on the issue, Speaker Pradip Kumar Amat said he would examine the matter and would pass a ruling later. Dissatisfied with the Speakers stand, Maharathy and Dhali rushed to the well while their party colleagues stood supporting them. They demanded specific instruction to the channel immediately as the short session of the Assembly was likely to end tomorrow.        
	Politicians too have dignity, Dhali of BJD said, adding the programme was not worth viewing with family.         
	As the din continued, the Speaker had to adjourn the proceedings five times in quick succession till 3pm.        
	 After the House reassembled in the afternoon, the Speaker said if the allegations of the MLAs were true, then the programme was objectionable. However, he would give a ruling as to whether the issue would be referred to the privilege committee or a special committee tomorrow.        
	Normalcy was restored after the announcement.                     (WITH INPUT FROM PTI)

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CID fails to track owner of sunken ship
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 21: Investigations into the sunken ship, MV Black Rose, seems to have gone off track with the CID failing to trace the owner of the ship even though several months have passed.        
	The CID had identified the Mongolian flagged cargo vessel as a rogue ship nearly three months back but reportedly could not make further headway after the preliminary findings.        
	While the investigation agency had earlier linked shipment of illegally extracted iron ore from the state through Paradip port by unauthorised operators with the rogue ship, it, however, has failed to crack the whip on the port officials to identify the persons involved and trace the origin of the owner.        
	The investigation process, according to sources, was also hit as Paradip Port Trust (PPT) officials during interrogation had maintained that all communications with the owner had been through e-mail.        
	A senior CID official, however, said: Assistance of the cyber cells of Orissa, Calcutta and New Delhi police have been sought to track the owner of the ship. Efforts are also on to trace the origin of the e-mails.        
	According to available records, the cargo vessel had gained access into the Paradip port harbour on September 4, 2009, and had left the harbour on September 9, 2009, but capsized on way towards anchorage area at a distance of 3.3 nautical miles from the southern breakwater of the port.

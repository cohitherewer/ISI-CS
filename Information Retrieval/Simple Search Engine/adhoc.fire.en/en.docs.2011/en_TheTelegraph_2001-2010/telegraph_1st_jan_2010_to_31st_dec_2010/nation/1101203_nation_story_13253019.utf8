          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 2: The Left Fronts original foot soldiers today gave the poll-scarred monolith some reason to cheer amid the winds of change blowing across the state.        
	Left-backed teachers have won the elections to the district primary school councils, bagging 180 of the 193 seats. The Lefts tally was two more than what it had got in the last polls five years ago.         
	The Left could not avert a niggle, though. The Trinamul Congress, which does not have a teachers organisation, opened its account, winning 12 seats.         
	In north Bengal, the Left retained all 45 seats.        
	In East Midnapore, the Left won seven of the 12 seats while the remaining went to Trinamul. In South 24-Parganas, the front won 13 of the 15 seats with Trinamul pocketing the rest. In both districts, Trinamul has snatched the zilla parishads from the Left in 2008 besides winning the Lok Sabha elections last year.         
	In Bankura and Purulia, where the Left had made a clean sweep in the last council elections, the Congress and Trinamul made inroads this time. The Left won 33 of the 39 seats. Trinamul bagged five while the Congress pouched one.         
	However, the buzz in political circles was whether the Lefts convincing victory in the council elections would have any effect on the Assembly polls next year.         
	A CPM leader said the Lefts organisation in the primary council has always been good. However, he conceded the Assembly elections were a different ball game.         
	A leader of the CPM-backed All-Bengal Primary Teachers Association (ABPTA) said that before the elections, the party had highlighted the killing of 24 primary teachers by Maoists in the recent past.         
	The campaign among teachers paid rich dividends, he said.         
	The leader said the teaching community was appalled by the killing of so many of their colleagues and decided to show solidarity with the Left.        
	He said the state governments announcement that it would recruit 50,000 primary teachers and the recent salary hike went down well with the voters (the teachers).        
	Samar Chakraborty, the ABPTA general secretary, said the teaching community had rejected Trinamuls slogan of change.        
	Trinamul leaders, however, said the partys performance despite not having a teachers association was an achievement in itself.        
	Manik Bhattacharyya, the chairman of Trinamuls education cell, said: We are not in the government like the CPM, which has the advantage of offering benefits to teachers. Our men fought in their individual capacities against the CPMs organisational might.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tech glitch stalls Delhi flights
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tech glitch stalls Delhi flights
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 17 (PTI): Several flights were delayed today at Delhi airport after the computer system used for passenger check-in collapsed for an hour at the new terminal 3.        
	An airport source said: The computerised checking-in system at terminal 3 of the IGI airport collapsed around 4.30pm and it could only be restored after an hour.         
	The glitch meant the staff of various airlines had to start manually checking in the passengers, causing delays for over a dozen flights.         
	An airport spokesperson said the system crashed at 4.25pm and was rectified at around 5.30pm.        
	Because of the IT network problem at 4.25pm, the system which displays flight information was down for an hour and five minutes.         
	Sources said the problem arose because of a collapse of the airlines common user terminal equipment, a software that streamlines reservations at the airport and helps individual carriers to check in passengers on the same computer system.

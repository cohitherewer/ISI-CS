The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tobacco firms get more time
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tobacco firms get more time
                          Wait another year                      
	New Delhi, Dec. 7 (PTI): The Union cabinet has decided to retain existing pictorial warnings on cigarette and bidi packages for one more year, putting a rotation policy on hold and accepting the demand of the tobacco industry for more time.        
	The decision came a week after tobacco companies like ITC and Godfrey Phillips India said they had stopped production because of uncertainty.        
	The cabinet decision will be reviewed in December 2011, sources said.        
	The existing pictorial warnings  a scorpion on bidi packs and a cancer-affected lung on cigarette packs  were to be replaced by a cancer-affected mouth from December 1 after a notification by the health ministry in May this year. Such warnings are to be rotated every year.        
	Reacting to the governments decision, Tobacco Institute of India director Udayan Lall said: We will abide by the decision the government has taken.        
	Neeta Kapur, Godfrey Phillips India marketing vice-president, said the company would start production of cigarettes at its two units in India within a couple of days. An ITC spokesperson reserved comment till seeing the notification.        
	Tobacco companies, which were under an impression that the timeline for mouth-cancer warning would get pushed back, had made representations to the health ministry for increasing the duration of each set of warnings to two-three years from the current one year.        
	They reasoned that cigarette stocks lying with retailers could not be withdrawn and re-manufactured before the one-year deadline.        
	The manufacturers requested that they be first allowed to sell the previous stocks. If the new warning must come into effect, its duration should be increased to two or three years so that companies do not need to print new packets every year, they added.        
	Big tobacco companies had said they had stopped production of cigarettes from December 1 because of the uncertainty over which pictorial warnings needed to be carried on their products.        
	The companies had claimed that there was no clarity on types of warnings to be carried on the packages.

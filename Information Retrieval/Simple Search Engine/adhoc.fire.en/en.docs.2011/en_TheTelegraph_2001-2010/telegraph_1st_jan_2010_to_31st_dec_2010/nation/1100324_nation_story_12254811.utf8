          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 23: The fate of viva-voce test of the Orissa Civil Service Examination, which was undertaken by the Orissa Public Service Commission (OPSC) last month, hangs in balance as Orissa High Court has kept its judgment reserved on the validity of a State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) stay order on it, for over a week now.        
	The test has been locked in a dispute for nearly a month on whether the committee formed for conducting it is unconstitutional because the OPSC had just two members and no permanent chairman.        
	SAT bench of chairman Justice (retd) Nityananda Prusty and member secretary Amarananda Patnaik issued a stay order on it on February 26 after the dispute was raised before it by several other candidates.        
	OPSC had moved the High Court to break the impasse.         
	The division bench of Justices B.P. Das and B.K. Nayak had on March 16 closed the hearing and reserved judgment without specifying any date for pronouncement of verdict.        
	The controversy has apparently surrounded functioning of OPSC without full members.

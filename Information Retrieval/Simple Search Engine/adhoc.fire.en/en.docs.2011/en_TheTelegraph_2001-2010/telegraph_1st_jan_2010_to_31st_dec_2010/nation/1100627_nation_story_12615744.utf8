          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Viveka Babaji                                  
	Mumbai, June 26: The birthday patch-up she had been planning with her boyfriend didnt work out. Then she was dead.        
	Police today confirmed that Viveka Babaji, the 37-year-old ex-Miss Mauritius who broke into the Indian modelling scene in the late nineties with her daring Kamasutra ad, killed herself in her apartment yesterday.        
	The post-mortem report has confirmed that she committed suicide by hanging herself. She was depressed and heavily dependent on sleeping pills. Traces of cocaine have also been found in her blood, though that was not the cause of her death, additional police commissioner (west) Amitabh Gupta said. We are still investigating the motives which could have led her to take the extreme step.        
	The police found several notes marked to her friends and family in her Mumbai apartment where her body was found hanging from a ceiling fan. Sources said one, addressed to Gautam Vohra, her boyfriend for the past two months, was being considered as her suicide note.         
	It was his birthday on Saturday and Viveka was planning to patch up with him by throwing a party. Gautam refused to attend the party as he was keen on a complete break-up. She had a huge fight with him on the phone on June 24. Her notes from her diary reveal she was keen to make this relationship work, said a police source.        
	Gautam, 30, son of a top Mumbai stockbroker who died last year, was questioned before being let off this morning.        
	Police sources said Viveka, according to statements given by her friends, had tried committing suicide twice before. The police have seized a laptop and a mobile phone along with a polythene bag containing medicines including sleeping pills. We also found a diary with the words I kill on the last page, Gupta said.        
	Vivekas friends in Mumbais Page 3 circuit say the model, who part-owned an event management company and choreographed fashion shows, had been low since breaking up with her earlier boyfriend, director Rohit Jugraj. We had broken off mutually in December. I am shocked, Rohit said.         
	Her last social appearance was at a People magazine party on June 17, where she was reportedly her usual self, according to choreographer and friend Damandeep.        
	Yesterday, neighbours called the fire station after smelling a gas leak from her flat. When Viveka didnt open the door after repeated knocks, firemen it broke open to find her hanging. She seems to have left the gas open to cover the smell that might emit from her body, Gupta said.        
	Friend Anita Shahane said Viveka was always chirpy but hid a lot under her breezy countenance. She had been upset since splitting with Rohit. The break-up with Gautam was the last straw for her, I guess. She said Viveka had 2,000 friends on Facebook but was lonely. Her June 11 Facebook post said: We come from dust and we go to dust. Was that an indication?

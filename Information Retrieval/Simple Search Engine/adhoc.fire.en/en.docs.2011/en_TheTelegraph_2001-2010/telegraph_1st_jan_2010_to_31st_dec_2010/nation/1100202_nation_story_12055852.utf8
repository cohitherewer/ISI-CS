          OUR BUREAU                               
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Feb. 1: BJP chief Nitin Gadkari today backed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs support for Hindi-speaking migrants in Maharashtra as the party made its priority clear ahead of elections in Bihar.        
	Gadkari, a Maharashtrian himself, said people had the right to settle in any part of India in the interest of national unity and integration.        
	The comment came a day after RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav said the Sangh had told its volunteers to contain the spread of anti-Hindi feeling in Maharashtra and protect everyones source of livelihood.        
	In Mumbai, BJP ally Shiv Sena, which along with breakaway outfit MNS has been targeting north Indian migrants for taking away the livelihood of the Marathi-speaking population, said his party didnt need to take lessons in national unity from people like Ram Madhav.        
	During the 1992-93 riots, the protectors of Hindi-speakers were Shiv sainiks, Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray said.        
	Gadkari said while the BJP recognised that linguistic, regional and religious identities were a reality, it was clear that the strength of Indias unity in diversity could be achieved only when the multiple identities converged into a larger national identity of Indianness or Bharatiyata.         
	These identities have never diluted their Indianness, he said in a statement.        
	A BJP spokesperson explained that before Gadkari drafted the statement, he had discussed the implications of taking a stand contrary to that of the Sena with RSS chief Mohanrao Bhagwat, who had on Saturday said India belonged to every Indian.        
	In principle, a national party cannot sound like a regional outfit. Then, there is no immediate election in Maharashtra. The Sena has done badly and cannot afford to dump us even if its leaders are annoyed with the Sanghs stand. Gadkari has already said Bihar is his first priority. Every strategy and statement of ours will have Bihar in mind, the spokesperson said.        
	Elections in Bihar, where the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) share power, are scheduled for October. We can temporarily annoy the Sena but we need to keep the Dal (U) on our side, the spokesperson added.        
	Sanjay Raut, the executive editor of Sena mouthpiece Saamna, said his party and the BJP had different positions on certain issues. Despite these differences, our alliance has continued for 22 years. In the same way, it (this public spat) will not affect our alliance, at least from the Sena side.        
	BJP sources said the Senas problem was it had to sound more chauvinistic than Raj Thackeray, whose MNS won over a dozen seats in its debut Assembly elections last year. Its a question of survival, the spokesperson said.        
	BJP veteran Murli Manohar Joshi dismissed the idea of mollifying the Sena on the Mumbai for Maharashtrians issue. It is an unconstitutional statement. No sensible party would support such a statement, Joshi said.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram said the Sena and the MNS campaigns were pernicious theses. Mumbai belongs to all of India and all Indians are free to live and work in Mumbai.        
	In a subtle change of tack, Raj today said jobs in Maharashtra should be given only to those who were Marathi by birth. Just knowledge of reading and writing the language will not do. The MNS had so far been demanding that those domiciled in Maharashtra for 15 years should be given priority in employment.

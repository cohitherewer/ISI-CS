	New Delhi, Jan. 25: The countrys top leaders urged the Election Commission to cleanse the system of criminal elements and make sure that politics attracted the best and the brightest as the panel turned 60 today.        
	President Pratibha Patil, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and central coalition chairperson Sonia Gandhi each struck an introspective note at the diamond jubilee celebrations that drew representatives from over 30 countries.        
	Sonia minced no words as she urged the commission to check the influence of money and muscle power in elections and to ensure that people with criminal records do not contest elections.        
	Singh said there were genuine concerns that politics was not attracting the best and the brightest and that the educated and the growing middle class were shying away from the democratic process.        
	The poor voter turnout undermines the legitimacy of the parliamentary system, the Prime Minister told an audience that included Vice-President Hamid Ansari, Speaker Meira Kumar, Left leaders A.B. Bardhan and Prakash Karat, NDA convener Sharad Yadav and the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj.        
	Mamata Banerjee, Jayalalithaa, Mehbooba Mufti, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Omar Abdullah and Chiranjeevi were among the others who attended the Republic Day-eve event, exactly 60 years after the quasi-judicial constitutional body was set up on January 25, 1950.

	Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and BJP parliamentary party chairman L.K. Advani did not attend.        
	Patil, who inaugurated the celebrations, said impediments, lacunae and malpractices in the electoral process would have to be removed to make Indian democracy cleaner, healthier and stronger.        
	Vice-President Ansari said unaccounted-for political expenses formed a major part of any partys poll expenses. Freebies, liquor, cash payments, surrogate ads and paid news were a blot on the democratic process, he added.        
	BJP leader Sushma paid her tribute to the commission, saying transition of power in this country had always been through the ballot and not the bullet, though her NDA ally Sharad Yadav voiced a common grouse: the tight security during votes.        
	Sonia referred to her partys attempts to ensure larger participation of women in the electoral process. We have introduced a law. But we are still some distance away from it becoming a reality, the Congress chief said.        
	Lack of political consensus has hampered attempts to pass the law in both Houses of Parliament.        
	Law minister Veerappa Moily said the government had received several proposals from the commission to introduce electoral reforms and would soon begin several rounds of discussion and conventions to arrive at a consensus.        
	Chief election commissioner Navin Chawla, welcoming the guests, said political parties at both the national and state level had shown immense maturity in streng-thening democracy in the country.        
	The President released a five-rupee commemorative postage stamp along with a book titled Lok Sabha Election  2009 Reinforcing Indian Democracy.

	New Delhi, Oct. 12 (PTI): The government today approved a proposal to induct professionals into cultural institutions under its control, such as the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), as part of a wider upgrade plan.        
	The decision, taken at a meeting of the Union cabinet here today, will help ring in best international practices, such as digitisation of the records, in institutions like the National Library and the National Archives.        
	The expertise of professionals will help the organisations become like their more advanced international counterparts.         
	The proposal cleared today seeks to make such professionals in ASI, National and the National Library equivalent to university professors.        
	The move comes against the backdrop of the culture ministrys efforts to restructure and strengthen the organisations under its administrative control.        
	BESU upgrade        
	The cabinet approved a proposal for taking over the Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU) in Howrahs Shibpur and converting it into Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST).         
	The upgrade, which will be carried out over five years, is estimated to cost Rs 592.20 crore.

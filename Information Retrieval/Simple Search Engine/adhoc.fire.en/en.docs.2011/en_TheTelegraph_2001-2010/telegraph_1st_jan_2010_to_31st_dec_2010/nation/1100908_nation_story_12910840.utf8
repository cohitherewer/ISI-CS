The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP sups with JMM for Ranchi crown
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP sups with JMM for Ranchi crown
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA AMIT GUPTA                                             
	Ranchi, Sept. 7: The BJP has staked claim to form a government in Jharkhand after extracting the support of the JMM, whose leader Shibu Sorens flip-flop had prompted the national party to dump him and set the stage for Presidents rule three months ago.        
	BJP leader and former chief minister Arjun Munda, accompanied by MLAs and leaders from the JMM, AJSU and the Janata Dal (United), met governor M..H. Farook this afternoon and submitted a list of 45 legislators.        
	 The list included names of 18 MLAs each from the BJP and the JMM, two from the JD(U), five from the AJSU and two Independents .        
	The oft-repeated ritual of stitching together a coalition had its share of drama with BJP president Nitin Gadkari dialling state party chief Raghubar Das from Moscow and asking him to give up his other post of legislature party leader. Das, who was in Hazaribagh yesterday, rushed here and joined his party colleagues at Raj Bhavan.        
	BJP MLAs elected Munda the new legislature party leader, which makes it fairly certain that he will be the next chief minister if the current initiative pays off.        
	Munda ensured the presence of 44 MLAs at Raj Bhavan today, except JMM MLA Paulus Surin, who is lodged in Chaibasa jail. Among the heavyweights who joined the delegation were AJSU chief Sudesh Mahto, JMMs Dumka MLA and Gurujis son Hemant Soren and Das.        
	By evening, governor Farook was understood to have sent a report to the Union home ministry recommending the revocation of Presidents rule. The Union cabinet is likely to take a decision tomorrow.        
	The governor will extend an invitation to Munda only after Presidents rule is revoked, said a Raj Bhavan official.         
	Sorens insistence on retaining the chief ministers chair had led to his fall on May 24. This time, Guruji played the role of a father figure, blessing the new dispensation by choosing to stay away from the race for the top post.         
	All MLAs supporting Munda assembled at Sorens Morabadi residence at 12.30pm when he garlanded the BJP general secretary and Jamshedpur MP, Mahto, and son Hemant, asking them to run the new government smoothly.        
	JMM legislature party leader Hemant said they had offered unconditional support to the BJP for the sake of the states development.

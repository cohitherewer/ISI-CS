The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Clash brews on Jamia tag
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Clash brews on Jamia tag

	New Delhi, Sept. 11: Friction within the UPA government is set to escalate unless it resolves a debate between two ministries whether the Jamia Millia Islamia is a minority institution or not, according to government and Congress sources.        
	Minority affairs minister Salman Khursheed and human resource development minister Kapil Sibal have been locked in a standoff over the issue, fuelling fears in the Congress that the tussle will send an adverse signal to the minorities.        
	The HRD ministry feels that since the institution had not been declared a minority establishment when the related law was passed, it should not be exempt from reservation obligations. But the minority affairs ministry contends that the omission was an oversight and the ground reality should be given primacy.  
	Many in the Congress feel that the debate is not confined to academic affairs but involves larger political concerns of the party.         
	The sources in the party said any attempt to tamper with the minority character of Jamia Millia Islamia would have worrisome ramifications for the Congress across the country. Hence, they assess that the minority affairs minister will be whole-heartedly supported by the party.        
	Sibal should understand the basic political point before quibbling over this, a senior leader told The Telegraph.         
	Khursheed had earlier locked horns with home minister P. Chidambaram over the Enemy Property Bill, which deals with pre-Partition assets of the minority community.         
	In that battle, the Congresss Uttar Pradesh in-charge, Digvijay Singh, had extended active support to Khursheed as he felt that the proposed legislation would hurt the party in the state. The cabinet eventually stalled an ordinance, overruling Chidambarams views.        
	Today, Digvijay said that Sibal should focus on primary schools instead of higher education. The sources said Digvijays opinion was not linked to the Jamia controversy but it showed that Congress leaders would not hesitate to speak up if they felt that a ministers stand was hurting the party.        
	The sources added that on the Jamia controversy, too, the AICC general secretary, whose articulation of views on the anti-Naxalite strategy fuelled a debate that eventually threw up a nuanced approach, was opposed to the HRD ministrys stand.        
	Khursheed had written to the HRD ministry but Sibal rejected his contention. The sources said the minority affairs ministry then built a case and forwarded the arguments to the HRD ministry last month.        
	Sibal has not responded to that so far. Many Congress leaders fear the issue will trigger a bitter battle between the two ministers in the coming weeks.        
	Khursheed has pointed out that Muslims will lose out if Jamia is stripped of the minority status. Without such a tag, it will have to reserve 27 per cent seats for OBCs  minority institutes are exempt from the requirement.         
	The OBC quota, along with the 22 per cent meant for other weaker sections, will mean that 49 per cent will be blocked off. Since the Supreme Court has stipulated that 50 per cent seats should be kept for the general category, only 1 per cent seats can be kept aside for Muslims.        
	Khursheed feels this will send a wrong political signal to the community that treats Jamia as its own. He had written in his letter to Sibal that Jamia was born as a Muslim university but not formally declared a minority institution as there was no such concept in 1920 when it was established. It became a central university through an act in 1988 but was not recognised as a minority institution.        
	Khursheed has asked Sibal why a non-Muslim had never been appointed Jamia vice-chancellor if the government did not consider it a minority institution. He also pointed out that Urdu was always treated as the base language in the university and every single programme there starts with the recitation of Quran verses only because it is a minority institution.        
	Sibal differs with these arguments and wants more proof to establish Jamias minority status.        
	The Congress fears that if the differences are not resolved soon, the row will pose a threat to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs assertion that his government was working with greater cohesion than that of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Speaker joins Nitish poll rally
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Speaker joins Nitish poll rally

	Patna, Feb. 21: He is supposed to conduct the proceedings of the Assembly while keeping himself above the party politics. But breaking convention, Assembly Speaker Udainarayan Choudhary today conducted the proceedings of an NDA-sponsored maha-Dalit ekta rally here.        
	It was an impressive rally with the maha-Dalits (who figure low among the list of Scheduled Castes) drawn from almost all parts of the state gathering here in a huge numbers. But the Speakers action raised eyebrows in the Opposition circles. Moreover, the JD(U) leader is likely to face the music from the Opposition on this issue in the House session staring tomorrow.        
	His (Choudharys) action has lowered the dignity of the Speakers chair. He should immediately step down and play the role of an MLA if he is interested in active politics. But it is highly objectionable for a Speaker to address political rallies, said state Congress chief Premchand Mishra. The RJD and LJP, too, raised their strong objection to the Speaker conducting the proceedings on the dais.        
	Unfazed, Choudhary was seen and heard shouting Nitish Kumar jindabad.         
	By organising the assembly of various Dalit castes and uniting them, we have made the dream of Bhimrao Ambedkar come true, the Speaker said, predicting: Our government will again come to power.        
	Is he in the government and should he address a political rally? asked an embarrassing NDA leader at the rally.        
	Choudhary appeared quite at variance with former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and his successor, Meira Kumar. The Congress high command expressed its embarrassment over her inclusion in the states political committee. The Congress later deleted her name from its committee, too. Chatterjee, while functioning as the Speaker, had refused to toe the line of the CPM, his party, on the ground that the Speaker is supposed to be above party lines. His action, however, culminated in his expulsion from the party.        
	But the impressive gathering, however, must have added to the confidence of Nitish in this election year. Nitish has been playing the maha-Dalit card by constituting a maha-Dalit commission and announcing a plethora of development schemes for them.         
	Our government wants to bring the maha-Dalits in the social and political mainstream. We are trying to set up social harmony by addressing the problems of poor in all sections of the society, Nitish said.        
	Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi also addressed the rally, outlining the schemes that the NDA government had initiated for the maha-Dalits.        
	However, LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan described the rally a flop show organised at the cost of government expenditure and machinery.

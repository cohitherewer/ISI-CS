          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Sept. 2: Money isnt everything in the world but in Kashmir, Omar Abdullah hopes it will buy him peace.        
	His government has relaxed the rules in an unemployment allowance scheme so the benefits reach more youths, seen as the backbone of the current agitation which has left 65, most of them youngsters, dead since June 11.         
	The rule changes in the Voluntary Service Allowance, which now covers around 1.25 lakh unemployed youth, will benefit 32,000 more with monthly payouts of Rs 600 to Rs 1200, depending on their educational background. The government will have to spend an additional Rs 122 crore because of the widening of the scheme.        
	We have reduced the age of eligible candidates by two years. The allowance will now be available to those in the age group of 26 to 37. Also, relaxation has been given in the annual income slab (of the families). It has been raised from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh, state minister of labour and employment Abdul Gani Malik said.         
	A condition that kept families with land holdings out of the schemes ambit has also been waived.         
	The monthly payouts of Rs 600 to Rs 1,200 include an increase of Rs 100 across all categories, starting from matriculates to post-graduates and engineering and medical graduates. Earlier, the range was Rs 500 to Rs 1,100.        
	According to official figures, 5.95 lakh unemployed educated youths, students between 18 and 37, have registered themselves with district employment and counselling centres, but not all have applied for the allowance.        
	Labour minister Malik said all district magistrates across the state have been asked to step up the schemes implementation so more deserving unemployed educated youths received the benefits at the earliest.         
	Omar has already announced the creation of 50,000 jobs, with official sources saying the appointments would be made over the next few months. The state already has more than four lakh government employees.         
	The sources said Jammu and Kashmir police have also begun the process 5,000 of recruitments. They will be in addition to the 5,000 recently undergoing training now after being appointed recently, an officer said.        
	The 70,000-strong force has 35,000 special police officers  temporary staff  who get a monthly remuneration of Rs 3,000 each.         
	Other state officials said Omar had raised the issue of jobs during his meeting with Union home minister P. Chidambaram in Delhi yesterday and sought a package for the estimated six lakh unemployed youths in the state.        
	However, not everyone is convinced that doles will douse protests.         
	Sheikh Showkat, who teaches law at Kashmir University, said such measures would do little to stem the unrest. Kashmir is a political issue and only a major political initiative will bring relief.

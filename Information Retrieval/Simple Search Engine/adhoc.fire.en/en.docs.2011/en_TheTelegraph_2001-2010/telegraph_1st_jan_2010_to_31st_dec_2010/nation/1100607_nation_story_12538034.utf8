          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 6: Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit today appeared to hint that former Union home minister Shivraj Patil had got her government to sit on the mercy petition of Parliament attack accused Afzal Guru.        
	In an interview to a news channel, Dikshit stopped just short of naming Patil when she was asked about her governments delay in taking a decision on the petition.        
	Maybe what you are thinking is true, she said when asked if Patil had requested her to keep the matter pending even if the home ministry sent frequent reminders.        
	The procedure relating to mercy petitions requires the President to seek the Union home ministrys views, and the ministry to seek those of the state government in whose area the crime was committed.        
	Asked if she had faced political pressure while dealing with the petition, Dikshit ducked. Political pressure was there and wasnt there. I cannot say anything more on this.        
	Patil wasnt available for comment.         
	The state government, to which the home ministry sent Afzals petition four years ago, had responded last month after the 16th reminder from the ministry. In its reply, the Dikshit government said it supported execution but expressed fears that law and order could be disturbed if Afzal was hanged.        
	Delhi lieutenant governor Tejendra Khanna added his comments to the reply and forwarded it to the home ministry on June 4. Sources said Khanna had not opposed Afzals execution.        
	Afzal, a resident of Sopore town in Kashmir, was found guilty of plotting the December 2001 Parliament attack and was sentenced to death by the trial court in December 2002. Delhi High Court confirmed the sentence in October 2003 and the Supreme Court upheld it in 2004.         
	Afzals wife Tabassum then filed a mercy petition before the President.

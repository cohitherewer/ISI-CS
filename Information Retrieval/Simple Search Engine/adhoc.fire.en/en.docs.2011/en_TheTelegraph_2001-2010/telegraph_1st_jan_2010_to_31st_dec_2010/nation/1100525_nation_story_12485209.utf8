          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Mangalore, May 24: The body of Zlatko Glusica, the pilot of the crashed Air India Express flight, was flown this afternoon to his home in Serbias Belgrade.         
	Hours earlier, a Chennai-Hyderabad plane was diverted to Mangalore to pick up another consignment  tissue samples of 22 yet-to-be-identified victims of the IX 812 crash, including those of three cabin crew members. The samples were sent to the Central Forensic Laboratory located in the Andhra Pradesh capital.        
	Glusica could be identified because of his ID card. According to rescue workers and officials, his right hand was still gripping a part of the control column that had come apart.         
	The bodies of three of the six crew members and 19 passengers were charred beyond recognition. Two of the bodies have two claimants each.        
	The body of co-pilot H.S. Ahluwalia, a Sikh, could be identified easily, while that of steward Tejal Sharma was recognised from her wrist band.        
	The samples sent today will help identify the bodies of Sujatha Survasi, Mohammed Ali and Yoganther Rana. Their parents spent the whole of yesterday but were clueless and also emotionally drained, said Air India PRO A.B. George.        
	Air India managers have decided that DNA tests are the only way to solve the riddle. A team from the Hyderabad forensic laboratory had arrived here on Sunday to collect the samples from the 22 victims and their families. We have taken 88 samples in all, as in some cases we have taken samples of more than one living relative of the victim to be on the safe side, said Dr S. Madhusudhan, who oversaw the process.        
	Correct identification of the victim is important also to settle insurance claims. It is not just our insurers but even the victims insurers would want to be certain that theyre settling the claim for the right person, said Air India AGM A.K. Varma. He said as a special case, the DNA results would be out within a week as we do not want the trauma of the relatives to continue. The process usually takes much longer.

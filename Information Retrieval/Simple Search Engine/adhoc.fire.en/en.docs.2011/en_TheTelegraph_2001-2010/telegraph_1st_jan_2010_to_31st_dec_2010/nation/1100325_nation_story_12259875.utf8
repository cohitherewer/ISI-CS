	New Delhi, March 24 (PTI): The National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC) has exonerated an international airline charged with deficiency in service because of delay caused by inclement weather.        
	The commission said the delay was not willful.         
	Lufthansa Airlines had approached the NCDRC, challenging the Delhi State Consumer Redressal Commissions judgment that the airline was liable for its failure to operate the flight on time.        
	Two Indian National Science Academy delegates had missed the Third World Academy of Science conference at Dakar in 1999 because of the delay.         
	The German airline contended there was no deficiency in service as inclement weather had caused the cancellation or delayed departure of the Frankfurt-Paris flight.        
	Further, airline officials at Frankfurt said they tried to help as much as they could by first booking seats for the passengers on an alternative flight. However, because of inclement weather and heavy snowfall the second flight was also delayed, they said.         
	To bring home an allegation of deficiency in service, the element of willful action or inaction needs to be established. Given the unusual circumstances, we are unable to find such willful neglect on the part of the airline officials at Frankfurt on the day in question, the commission bench, comprising presiding officer R.C. Jain and member Anupam Dasgupta said while upholding the plea of airlines.

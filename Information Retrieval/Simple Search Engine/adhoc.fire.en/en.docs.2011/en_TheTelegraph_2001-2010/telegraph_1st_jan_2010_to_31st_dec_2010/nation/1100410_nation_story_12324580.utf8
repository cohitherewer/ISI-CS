The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP tells PC to stay amp; not whimper
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP tells PC to stay amp; not whimper
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 9: The BJP today backed P. Chidambaram, asking him not to resign as such a step would mean a victory for the Maoists.        
	The Union home minister had reportedly offered to quit, taking moral responsibility for the Dantewada massacre.        
	The BJP would in no way demand for or agree to the home ministers resignation nor would it heed the home ministers offer to resign as this would undoubtedly be hailed as a Maoist victory at a time the rebels are indulging in large-scale violence, party spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.        
	He implored Chidambaram not to whimper and retreat from the battlefield like an injured soldier on the backfoot. We know that the home minister has been entrusted with the nations security and the responsibility to secure the nation is his. But he cannot be seen as a man who is retreating from the battlefield, whimpering and shying away... (like) an injured soldier on the backfoot. We do not expect the home minister to act like this. We expect him to face the situation boldly, Rudy said.        
	The partys entreaties to the home minister were in sharp contrast with its reactions to terror strikes in the past when it would be the first to demand the resignation of the minister concerned.         
	The BJP had received flak for trying to gain political mileage by criticising the Congress for the Mumbai attacks during its campaigns for the Delhi and Rajasthan Assembly elections. The move failed as the Congress won both the elections and the BJP was accused of politicising a national tragedy. Sources said the party would not want to repeat the tactical error.        
	Rudy said he understood Chidambarams candid admission, but added that the home minister had became a victim of his own idiom. The home minister admitted today that the buck stops at my desk and now he has become a victim of his own idiom. The BJP is not interested in knowing where the buck stops  whether in the home ministers office or on (Bengal chief minister) Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees table in the Writers Buildings, he said.        
	Chidambaram had told Bhattacharjee during a visit to Bengal that the buck stops at the chief ministers table on maintaining law and order.        
	Rudy said the country was aware that at this critical juncture it could not afford to lose the war against the Maoists.        
	He said the BJP expected Chidambarams stand to be inspirational rather than confessional.         
	Though the party found fault with the Centres anti-Maoist strategy, it refused to blame Chidambaram.        
	Shortly after the Dantewada massacre, Arun Jaitley, the leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, had said that the challenge for Chidambaram was to upgrade the intelligence network and get the government to act in unison.        
	The partys softening of stance could be because unlike his predecessor Shivraj Patil, Chidambaram has frequently interacted with BJP MPs. He had sent his officials to Jaitley two months back to brief him on the Maoist problem.         
	Chidambaram had also spoken to Jaitley after Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren showed apparent unwillingness in acting against the Maoists. Jaitley then goaded Soren to give up his soft approach.

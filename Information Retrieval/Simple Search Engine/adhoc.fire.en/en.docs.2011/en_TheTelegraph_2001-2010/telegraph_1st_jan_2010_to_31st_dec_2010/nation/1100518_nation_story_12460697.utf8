	New Delhi, May 17: After the crush, the shuffle.        
	In less than 24 hours since it claimed the lives of a woman and a child, the platform stampede had spawned three enquiry committees. Only one  the last  has survived Mamata Banerjees damage-control remote.        
	Away in Bengal, campaigning for the coming civic polls, Mamata has shuffled teams to look into the tragedy, fuelling speculation that the railway minister and her ministry were both grappling to deal with the situation.        
	The first committee, of four members, was formed just an hour after the incident. Within a few hours, the team was dismantled.        
	A three-member, high-level committee made up of the senior divisional commissioner, operating commissioner and the senior divisional commercial manager was asked to take over and start a probe.         
	Today, the high-level committee gave way to a high-powered committee on the ministers instructions. The third panel  set up around 2.29 this afternoon, about 24 hours after the stampede at New Delhi station  has additional member (commercial) Brij Mohan, additional member (civil engineering) S.K. Malik and additional director-general (Northern Railway) P.K. Mehta as members.         
	Mamata has given strict instructions to officials at New Delhi station and the two other stations in the capital to stop issuing platform tickets. She has also instructed railway board members to visit the injured.        
	Railway board member Vivek Sahai said Mamata was monitoring the situation from Calcutta, but relatives and stampede victims recuperating in city hospitals are furious.         
	Where is Mamata Banerjee? Isnt she the railway minister? Shouldnt she be here? Would she have shown the same attitude if it was a Bengal-bound train that was involved? said Sunil Jha, a student who was going home to Bhagalpur when an apparent last-minute platform switch of the Patna-bound train triggered the stampede.        
	Jha, who left for home today, said the platform was as crowded as it was yesterday, but the difference was the presence of railway police today. Today, passengers were seen queuing up long before trains arrived.        
	But even a day after the tragedy, contradictory versions on what went wrong did the rounds.         
	Although the Northern Railway general manager said the stampede was caused by a sudden platform change, the preliminary investigation report of the three-member panel doesnt mention any such switch. The team also claimed there was no stampede-like situation.

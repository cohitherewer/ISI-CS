The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Stage set for Lavasa decision
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Stage set for Lavasa decision
          PTI AND OUR BUREAU                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 13: The environment ministry is likely to decide on Tuesday whether or not to allow construction of the Lavasa hill city now embroiled in controversy for alleged violations of environmental laws covering its site in the Sahyadri hills in western India.         
	In all likelihood, we will issue an interim order tomorrow as Bombay High Court has set a deadline for us to decide on the matter by December 16, Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh told PTI today.         
	The environment ministry had sent a showcause notice to Lavasa Corporation, asserting that the company had not sought required environmental clearances while constructing the hill city which is expected to cover 12,500 acres, across seven hills and 18 villages cupping Warasgaonlake, about 215km from Mumbai.         
	Bombay High Court had on December 7 stayed the status quo notice from the environment ministry to the Lavasa Corporation, owned by the Hindustan Construction Company, asking it to stop construction on the hill township.         
	The court had observed that the ministry had issued the notice in haste without hearing Lavasas version and asked the ministry to hear the company before the next hearing set for December 16.         
	The environment ministry had invited officials of the Lavasa Corporation to Delhi for a meeting on December 9 that had lasted a little more than two hours, and was attended by representatives of environmental groups opposing the project, a source told The Telegraph.         
	The company officials spoke at the meeting, but I got the feeling that they did not address the key issues which the environment ministry had raised in its showcause notice, said Bhagatraj Gurumukhdas Ahuja, a former government engineer who has filed a petition against the project.         
	Lavasa Corporation has claimed that it has done no wrong, and that it had obtained all necessary permissions from different authorities. It has said the project was governed by the Maharashtra governments Hill Station Regulations and had been approved by the state.         
	A source in the environment ministry said the 66-page response that the Lavasa Corporation had sent to the ministry had contained text to argue in favour of the project but had not in any substantial way responded to the legal issues the ministry had raised.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CBI summons, Raja pops up outside hospital
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CBI summons, Raja pops up outside hospital
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                      A Raja                          
	New Delhi/Chennai, Dec. 20: Just as news came in today that the CBI had called A. Raja for questioning on the spectrum scandal, the former telecom minister was spotted outside a Chennai hospital, setting off another buzz.        
	Was he trying to get admitted to avoid the agency summons, issued in the form of a notice, a reporter later asked. An agitated Raja immediately ticked him off.        
	What nonsense are you talking? Does it mean I should not go to my doctor? It was a matter of 10 minutes. I met the doctor and came back, he said.        
	Raja also faced a question on the Prime Ministers assurance today that anyone found guilty in the scandal would be punished, but he dodged it saying he wasnt competent to comment.        
	However, support has come from chief minister M. Karunanidhi who has been repeatedly huddled with Raja since Saturday when, according to the ex-minister, he received the CBI notice. The DMK chief knows that whether the CBI probe reaches his daughter Kanimozhis doorstep depends on what Raja tells his interrogators.        
	CBI officials insisted the notice was issued today and not Saturday but would not reveal the deadline Raja has been set to come to the CBI office in Delhi. They said lobbyist Niira Radia too would be served with a notice in a day or two, although PTI reported that Radia had already been sent one.        
	Raja put up a brave face before the media at the state guesthouse near the Chepauk stadium where he stays during his Chennai visits.        
	I am not in hiding or evading anyone. I told the CBI within 10 minutes of receiving the notice on Saturday, asking me to appear before them on Monday, that I would appear before them at Delhi later this week as I had personal work in Chennai over the next four days, he said.        
	Ive asked for a mutually convenient date. I will extend full co-operation.... I am not afraid of the CBI. I am a lawyer (and) will not evade the law.        
	He denied seeking anticipatory bail: There is no need.... I am not an accused.        
	CBI spokesperson R.K. Gaur said Rajas statements would be recorded under Section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which asks a person to join the investigation and share all the information he or she may have about a case.        
	The agency had questioned Raja on December 10 at his home, which it had raided on December 8, and informally recorded his statements.        
	But only a statement recorded under Section 160 of the CrPC can be produced before the Supreme Court; thats why we had to summon him officially, an agency official said.        
	Karunanidhi described the CBI notice as routine and said Raja would face party action only if he was found guilty. He claimed that nothing could break his partys alliance with the Congress.        
	DMK sources said Karunanidhi had to keep backing Raja despite opposition from sons Stalin and Alagiri since Raja alone could shield Kanimozhi.        
	The party expects him to be the last line of defence against the probe reaching our leaders family, a senior MLA said.        
	Raja has discussed with the DMK boss what stand he should take before the CBI, the sources said. Karunanidhi sent his car to bring Raja to his official residence on Saturday before the CBI notice arrived, and met him again on Sunday after it did.        
	Party workers took the cue and rallied behind Raja at his media briefing today. Only last week, Raja had confessed to a senior journalist about his sudden loneliness, pointing to the empty corridors outside his room.        
	The CBI today again questioned Pradip Baijal, former chairman of telecom regulator Trai, at its office. The agency had searched the premises of Baijal and Radia earlier this month.        
	Everybody whose home was raided will be issued a notice under Section 160 of the CrPC, a CBI official said.

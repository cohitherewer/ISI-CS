	Patna, Sept. 4: Hostage policeman Lucas Tete was killed 10 hours before his body was recovered by the police, according to the report of the post-mortem conducted on the Jharkhand jawan.         
	The body of Tete, an assistant sub-inspector with the Bihar Military Police, was recovered from the Simratalli forests of Lakhisarai district around 10am yesterday.         
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar said he had learnt of the report from Bihar police chief Neel Mani. The report, he said, questions the credibility of Maoist spokesman Avinash, who had claimed on Thursday that Abhay Yadav had been killed.         
	The so-called spokesperson has been providing very confusing and baffling statements. Once he said that they had killed ASI Abhay Kumar Yadav on September 2. The following day, the body of Lucas Tete was recovered. The post-mortem suggests that he was killed 10 hours earlier, Nitish said.         
	Unconfirmed reports from Lakhisarai said Avinash had escaped from the clutches of the security forces.        
	Additional director-general (headquarters), P.K. Thakur, confirmed that Tete was probably killed in the wee hours of September 3, somewhere between 1am and 2am, which was about eight hours ahead of the deadline set by the Maoists for the government to release eight jailed colleagues.        
	Avinash had announced on Thursday that they had killed Abhay Yadav at 4.16pm that day.         
	The post-mortem has revealed that Tete was shot three times. One bullet was fired from close range from the front and two bullets were shot from the back.         
	The rebels this morning said they would furnish proof that the remaining three jawans in their custody were alive. However, they have not followed up on the statement.         
	All this shows they are lying about a lot of facts. Why will they announce the death of Abhay Yadav when after a few hours they went ahead and killed Tete? asked a police source.        
	A PTI report quoting Avinash said his earlier statement on Yadavs death was intended to spark panic. I made the statement to create fear in the minds of those handling the hostage situation, PTI quoted Avinash as saying.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, June 11: The Central Bureau of Investigation has asked the human resource development ministry to dismiss from service a suspended ex-chairman of Indias apex technical education regulator after concluding that he was guilty of accepting bribes to approve institutions.         
	HRD minister Kapil Sibal has approved departmental action against R.A. Yadav based on the CBIs June 1 letter, top government officials have told The Telegraph.         
	The departmental action proposed by the CBI  and accepted by the HRD ministry  involves serious penalty, bureaucratic language for dismissal from service. No head of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has ever been dismissed before, though several have been suspended.         
	The CBI has also sought sanction to criminally prosecute two other senior AICTE officials, after concluding that they were guilty of pressurising an institution to pay them a bribe in exchange for approval to run courses.         
	The HRD ministry is now obtaining the sanction of state governments from where the officials  H.C. Rai, adviser at the AICTE and Hari Om Dalal, assistant director of the regulator  were deputed to the technical education regulator.         
	Apart from Rai and Dalal, the CBI has also decided to prosecute Rovinder Randhawa, the bodys deputy director.         
	The CBI had filed FIRs against Yadav, Rai, Dalal and Randhawa last July after allegations from Kedarnath Bansal, the founder of a Faridabad technical institution that he was pressurised into bribing them.         
	Yadav was then suspended by the HRD ministry, which gave its sanction for investigations against him.         
	The CBI has, over the past 11 months, registered 43 different cases against AICTE officials, including three against Yadav, the investigative agency has told the ministry.         
	The letter suggests two major reasons for dismissing Yadav. The CBI has said that its investigations against Yadav on one of the three cases have thrown up conclusive evidence that he accepted Rs 15 lakh as bribe in exchange for approving an institution.         
	The second reason why the CBI is particularly keen that Yadav be punished involves concerns that he may be using his influence as past chairman to destroy key evidence at the AICTE. As reported by The Telegraph on June 4, files on seven cases of corruption at the AICTE have disappeared from the office of the regulator.         
	The CBI has told the ministry that it is unable to proceed with investigations on these seven cases, mostly pertaining to Calcutta and Bengal institutions, because of the missing files.         
	Two cases in which the CBI has registered FIRs against Yadav also figure among the seven where files are missing. These two cases involve Yadavs grant of approval to the Kingston Educational Institute in Barasat.        
	It is requested that the ministry of HRD may also impress upon the AICTE to trace out the required documents on priority and supply the same to the concerned investigating officer for expediting the investigation, the CBI letter said.         
	The CBI had grilled current AICTE chairman S.S. Mantha on May 26 over the missing files. The agency has also set up two teams to try and hunt out the missing files.

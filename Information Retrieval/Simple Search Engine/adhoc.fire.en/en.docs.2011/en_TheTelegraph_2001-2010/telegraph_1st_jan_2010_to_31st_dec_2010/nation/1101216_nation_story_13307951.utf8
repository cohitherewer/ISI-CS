          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: Uttar Pradesh is catching in the air the whiff of a chance to regain its primacy in Delhi, more precisely its principal political players  the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party.        
	Both smelt the prospect of a political churning in the Centre with the DMK painting itself into a corner over the 2G scam and the Congress making it clear it was in no mood to bail out errant allies, regardless of the cost the government might suffer.        
	The Samajwadi has 22 and the BSP 21 Lok Sabha MPs, three and two more than the DMK, respectively, that makes them perfect candidates to fill the vacuum, should an occasion arise.        
	However, unlike in 2008 when the Samajwadi stepped into the Lefts shoes after the latter withdrew support to the UPA over the Indo-US nuclear deal, the leaders are unlikely to repeat the act.         
	We learnt our lesson. This government is neck-deep in corruption, people hate it for the hardships that inflation has imposed. Last time, when we saved the government, there were many factors. Prime among them was the deal, which we thought was good for the country, for our future energy requirement. This time, we dont find any virtue in the government, said Samajwadi general secretary and Rajya Sabha member Mohan Singh.        
	The Samajwadi spearheaded the demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe into the 2G spectrum allocation with the NDA. The Samajwadis Allahabad MP Reoti Raman Singh maintained they were in no mood to give up. If thats the case, where is the question of being lenient towards the Congress? he asked.        
	Privately, Samajwadi sources said the most important consideration for projecting the party as a Congress adversary was the price they had to pay for their yearlong backing in the 2009 elections.        
	Everywhere, our voters saw us as the Congresss B-team. The hard-core ones who grew up on an anti-Congress diet were upset with our leaders. Most of them didnt work for the party, didnt show up to vote. The rest concluded it is better to vote for the Congress than its tail, a source said.         
	The Samajwadi also felt its equation with the Congress was grossly imbalanced. We gave much more than what we got. All that talk of the government wooing us with this sop and that sop was hollow. The Congress netted the urban votes for getting the deal through with our backing, we got nothing, a source said.        
	The Samajwadi has not yet made common cause with the Left-led anti-UPA front. Sources said its sole focus was on getting its act together for the Uttar Pradesh elections in 2012 by charting an independent course whose thrust was getting back the Muslims and the non-Yadav backward castes as well as sections of the upper castes.        
	The BSP seemed less decided. If you observed our moves in Parliaments winter session, you must have noticed we were neutral on the JPC (probe). We didnt jump into the Well or shout slogans. We will keep our options open in such a situation, said a Rajya Sabha member.        
	The BSP, said the MP, was not unduly worried about the political ramifications of direct support to the government. Mayavatis imperatives are unconventional. She doesnt allow support to others affect her political base. Unlike the Samajwadi, she has perfected the skill of milking the other side dry without giving away anything, the MP said.

          OUR BUREAU                      Shibu Soren rsquo;s son Hemant at the lunch hosted by Arjun Munda in Ranchi on Wednesday. (Hardeep Singh)                          
	Ranchi/New Delhi, Sept. 8: Former Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda today hosted a lunch for ally MLAs amid signals from Raj Bhavan that he would be invited to form a government after the Centre completed the formality of revoking Presidents rule.        
	Raj Bhavan sources said the Union cabinet was scheduled to hold a meeting tomorrow at 11am at which governor M..H. Farooks report recommending revocation of central rule would be approved.        
	The only hitch, the sources added, was that since President Pratibha Patil was scheduled to go abroad tomorrow morning, the Prime Ministers Office would have to find a way to get her consent. If the Union cabinet discusses the matter after Patil leaves, her consent cannot come in before tomorrow evening.         
	Munda has staked claim to form a government with the support of 45 legislators from his party, the BJP, the JMM, Ajsu, the JD(U) and two Independents. He could be sworn in Jharkhand chief minister either on September 10 or 11.         
	In Ranchi, Munda held meetings with allies and partymen to discuss the composition of his future government, which, according to sources, is likely to have two deputy chief ministers. The BJP is likely to get four ministries, including that of the chief minister.         
	The day started with a meeting over breakfast at the Morabadi residence of former chief minister Shibu Soren where the MLAs had assembled. We had dahi chura, lemon tea and positive discussions. We are expecting an invitation from Raj Bhavan soon, Munda said.        
	Lunch was at Mundas official residence. The spread, overseen by wife Meera, included mutton curry, fish fry and paneer butter masala. The composition of a new government was discussed over lunch.

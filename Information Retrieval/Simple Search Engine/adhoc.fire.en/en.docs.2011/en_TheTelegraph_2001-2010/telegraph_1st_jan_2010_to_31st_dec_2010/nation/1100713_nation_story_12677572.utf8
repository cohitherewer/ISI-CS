The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bike bomb hits UP minister

	Lucknow, July 12: Uttar Pradesh minister Nand Gopal Gupta was severely injured when a motorcycle bomb went off as he stepped outside his home in Allahabad this morning, ripping Mayavatis image as a tough administrator.        
	Police sources said five people had been picked up for questioning from the home of Dilip Mishra, a local Samajwadi Party leader with whom Gupta has had a long-standing dispute over land.        
	Gupta, 36, minister for stamps and registrations as well as for institutional finance, is in hospital with his hands and throat riddled with splinters, but is out of danger, the police said. However, his security guard and a local journalist who were with him are critical.        
	Opposition leaders suggested Guptas shady business deals were behind the vendetta attack, and claimed that increasing corruption among BSP leaders was inviting serial attacks on them. They tore into Mayavatis vaunted commitment to law and order.        
	If her leaders and ministers are not safe, one can guess how safe the ordinary people are in the state, Digvijay Singh, Congress general secretary in charge of state affairs, said.        
	The explosives-laden motorcycle was parked among several others outside Guptas home in the Mutthiganj locality and the blast was set off through remote control, the police said. The powerful bomb damaged at least half-a-dozen vehicles and could have proved fatal had Gupta come a little closer to the motorcycle, inspector-general of police S.K. Singh said.        
	Mayavati has asked senior police officers and the principal secretary (home), Fateh Bahadur Singh, to visit Allahabad and report back to her.        
	Gupta, a businessman from the Vaishya caste, had made his electoral debut in the 2007 Assembly elections, thanks to Mayavatis strategy of wooing the upper castes.        
	Police sources said his relatives had cornered North Central Railway contracts in Allahabad and controlled the local sand-mining business, which had earned the minister many enemies. Besides, the lack of transparency in a lottery that Guptas wife had recently organised had angered hundreds of local people who had bought tickets, they added.        
	We are conducting a probe into all the ministers links, a senior officer said.         
	Many BSP leaders and ministers have recently been embroiled in controversies or come under attack.        
	Samajwadi Party state chief Akhilesh Yadav said the recurring criminal incidents involving BSP leaders had shown up the poor governance in the state.

	New Delhi, Sept. 13 (PTI): An iron rod pierced through the skull of a helmet-less motorcyclist when he was hit from behind by a vehicle.        
	Bhuvneshwar, 30, who is now recuperating in AIIMS, was first taken to an Agra hospital on September 9 and later brought to AIIMS, the rod sticking out of his neck.        
	Had he worn a helmet, it would have saved him from this state. He is recovering, an AIIMS doctor said.

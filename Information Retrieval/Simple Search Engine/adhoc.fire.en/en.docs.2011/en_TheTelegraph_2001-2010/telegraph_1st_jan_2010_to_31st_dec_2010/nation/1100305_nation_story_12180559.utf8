          MUZAFFAR RAINA                       Birdi being taken to a court in Srinagar on Thursday. (PTI)                                
	Srinagar, March 4: The BSF commandant who had allegedly ordered a subordinate to fire at a Srinagar teenager has been arrested, making him the highest-ranked officer in Jammu and Kashmir to be handed over to police for rights abuses.         
	R.K. Birdi had earlier been suspended for ordering constable Lakhvinder Singh to fire at Zahid Farooq, 16, who was killed on February 5. The Valley had been rocked by protests after Zahids death.         
	The commandant was arrested today, soon after he surrendered before the special investigation team (SIT) of Jammu and Kashmir police.        
	Chief minister Omar Abdullah had taken up the firing case with the home ministry in order to initiate tough action against the accused because central security force personnel enjoy immunity in the state under laws like the armed forces special powers act.         
	The rank of a BSF commandant is equivalent to that of a Colonel in the army.         
	Birdi, who was the commandant of the 68 Battalion of the BSF, surrendered at the Kothi Bagh police station this morning. The police presented him before a court, which remanded him in three days police custody.         
	Birdis lawyer Molvi Ajaz said today that Birdi had presented himself before the special investigation team.         
	The SIT has been assiduously and honestly investigating the matter. According to the SIT version, there are certain allegations against him (Birdi). The SIT has taken him for custodial investigation, Ajaz said.         
	The surrender came a day after the state government claimed that the officer was absconding and was not co-operating with the police, a charge denied by his counsel.         
	Ajaz said Birdi had volunteered to surrender before the investigating authorities before. We still do not know what are the allegations against my client. From day one he has been assisting in the investigation. He has not been absconding, he said.         
	The BSF had initially denied involvement in Farooqs killing but yielded later, saying Birdi had not reported the incident to his seniors. Under pressure from the Union home ministry, the force had later handed over constable Lakhvinder to the police.         
	Farooq and a group of boys had allegedly jeered at a BSF convoy that Birdi was leading, prompting him to order the firing.         
	Lakhvinder later told the police that Birdi had compelled him to fire at the teenager, an account corroborated by his colleagues and locals.         
	The SIT had questioned more than 15 BSF personnel who were part of the convoy and had come to the conclusion that the commandant had ordered the firing.         
	Sources said Birdi had been serving in Kashmir for more than a year.         
	Farooqs family today expressed gratitude to the government for taking action against the accused. We are thankful to both the central and the state governments for taking this action. We want all the accused to be brought to book so that such cases are not repeated, Farooqs uncle Asadullah said.         
	In February 2007, special superintendent of police Hansraj Parihar had been arrested for allegedly killing civilians and passing them off as foreign militants.

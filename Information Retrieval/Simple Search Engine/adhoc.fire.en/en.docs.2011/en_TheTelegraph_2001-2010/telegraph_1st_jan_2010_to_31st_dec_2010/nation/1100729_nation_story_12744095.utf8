The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CBI summons on ex-top cop 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CBI summons on ex-top cop 
                            
	Ahmedabad, July 28: The CBI will question former Gujarat police chief P.C. Pande over the Sohrabuddin fake encounter.         
	Pande is the senior-most former cop to be summoned in the case and will be questioned on August 11. CBI sources said he had virtually derailed the probe by transferring the case from an officer who had gathered evidence against ex-minister Amit Shah and came close to arresting him in 2007. Shah was arrested earlier this week.

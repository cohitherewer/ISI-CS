	The Vedanta group has shut down its 600MW power plant at Orissas Jharsuguda following protests by residents on Wednesday for allegedly causing air pollution.        
	Angry over the emission of fly ash from the independent power plant for the past few days, around 300 villagers blocked the road leading to the plant and smeared the faces of two plant officials with fly ash.        
	District collector S.N. Mishra has directed the plant officials to shut down operations for the time being and take corrective measures. The chief operating officer of the power plant, Abhijit Pati, said: The fly ash content in the stack increased because of a technical snag in the electrostatic processor.        
	Residents alleged that the plant authorities were deliberately not running the electrostatic processor, which prevents emission of fly ash.

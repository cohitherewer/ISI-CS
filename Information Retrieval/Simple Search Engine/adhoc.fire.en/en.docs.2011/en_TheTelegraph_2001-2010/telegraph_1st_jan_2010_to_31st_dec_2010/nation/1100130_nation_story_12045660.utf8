The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi fires threat of Italian mail
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Modi fires threat of Italian mail
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Modi: Italian dig                                  
	Ahmedabad, Jan. 29: The next time Narendra Modi addresses the Congress president, he could well call her Sonia sorella.        
	Of course, the Gujarat chief minister, who is well versed in his mother tongue, besides knowing Hindi and English, will first have to pick up rudimentary knowledge of Italian if he has to make good his threat.        
	Modi, known to take digs at Sonia, has said he will now write a letter on rising prices to the Congress president in Italian to get her attention.         
	The chief minister claimed he had written several letters to the Centre pointing to the spiralling prices of essentials and food commodities in the language they can understand.        
	But I think now I need to write a letter in Italian, said Modi, speaking in Gujarati, raking up the issue of Sonias foreign origin.        
	The Congress hit back at the BJP leaders personal attack on Sonia. He (Modi) has lost his mind. From an uncivilised person, you can only expect such preposterous rhetoric. I would not even want to dignify such comments by speaking from this podium, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said in New Delhi today.        
	Modi usually speaks in Gujarati when addressing rallies and meetings, but switches to Hindi if he is addressing a national audience, even if he is in a remote area of the state.         
	At other forums like the international investors meet, the chief minister reads out written speeches in English, often speaking a few sentences extempore.        
	Modi baiters said the chief minister would at least educate himself if he learns Italian for writing the letter to Sonia. Perhaps, Modi knows the Italian language. But until he said he would write in Italian, we didnt know he was conversant in the language, said Prakash Shah, a Gandhian scholar who has often criticised Modis policies and programmes.        
	The BJP leader has in the past used derogatory language when referring to Sonia, calling her Jersey cow, a term for which he later apologised, and Italy ki beti.         
	Sonia has retaliated by describing Modi as a maut ka saudagar (merchant of death) since it was under his chief ministership that thousands died in the 2002 Gujarat riots.        
	Now Modi calls her in Guajarati Sonia ben, or Sister Sonia. If he were to use the term in the threatened letter, he should address the Congress chief as Sonia sorella (sister in Italian). Sonia, who is older by four years, would have to be referred to as sorella maggiore or elder sister.        
	If he were to be formal, he would have to write Gent. (short for gentile) ma signora, Italian for Dear Madam. And, perhaps, end with cordialmente (Yours sincerely).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Salute and shopping on final day
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Salute and shopping on final day
                                        
	Power couples        
	The Obamas arrive at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in a Cadillac, escorted by mounted Presidential Bodyguards (PBGs), to a 21-gun salute. They are received by President Pratibha Patil, her husband Devisingh Shekhawat, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his wife Gursharan Kaur, and introduced to cabinet ministers, the three services chiefs, and members of the diplomatic corps. Later, Obama inspects a tri-service guard of honour.        
	IF WISHES WERE HORSES...                    Presidential Bodyguards escort the Obamas limo at Rashtrapati Bhavan        
	Obama praises the PBGs and jokes to Patil he would love to take home some of their stately horses and the Border Security Forces (BSFs) camels.        
	The US President was earlier visibly impressed by the PBGs smart turnout while being escorted to the forecourt. He was also welcomed by 30 camel-mounted BSF men, who had played bugles and trumpets at         
	Sundays 7 Race Course Road dinner. Obama had described the Camel Bands music as spectacular.        
	...or a VIP car        
	If your one big wish is to meet Obama, you obviously need to dress for the occasion and get a proper car. So, apparently, thought Dalip Kumar, a BSc student in Muzaffarnagar, western Uttar Pradesh. According to police, Kumar walked into the district magistrates residence posing as a senior police officer on Sunday night and asked for a VIP car to travel to         
	Delhi to meet Obama. He has been arrested.        
	Thank you India        
	Obama tells reporters India is not simply an emerging power but now it is a world power, and that the millions of US Indians have helped Americans appreciate the Indian way of life. He says he and Michelle thank the people of India for the wonderful hospitality and reception given to them, and conveys the warmest regards from the people of America.                    The Gandhi bust   before being   presented to Obama        
	One hero to other        
	For Rajghat, Obama has a gift: one of the stones from those used to build a memorial to Martin Luther King, who was inspired by the Mahatma. Both King and Gandhi are Obamas heroes. Obama is presented a charkha, a Gandhi bust and a scroll on the seven sins.        
	The US First Couple take their shoes off and bow their heads before the samadhi, stand in silence for a minute, place a wreath and shower petals. Simple and very beautiful, Obama says. Michelle nods: Very beautiful.        
	Obama writes in the visitors book: We will always remember the great soul who changed the world with his message of peace, tolerance, of love. More than 60 years of his passing (away), his light continues to inspire the world.                Michelle looks at a statue of Shakti at the Crafts Museum       
	Boss woman          
	Obama may be the worlds most powerful man but like every man, he knows whos the boss at home.        
	When you and the President have a fight, who makes up? the US First Lady is asked by a young schoolgirl at the National Crafts Museum, which Michelle visits while Obama heads to Hyderabad House to meet Prime Minister Singh.                Michelle has to bend as she is gifted a necklace at the crafts museum             
	I always wait for him to say sorry because I am a woman, Michelle replies. A group of schoolgirls aged 10-13 accompany her throughout her 2-hour, 20-minute tour of the museum. Woman power, Michelle utters as she appreciates a statue of Goddess Durga. Earlier she has told the girls: Every woman has to help another woman.        
	Stoop to conquer        
	For all Michelles ability to hold her own at the White House, in India  where the head is held high, as her husband said in Parliament, quoting Tagore  she has difficulty doing so. At fault are the low doors of the crafts museum (a result of the building being styled like an Indian village home). The five-foot-ten Michelle has to stoop repeatedly even as she charms everyone.  
	 buying spree  
	If Obama will return home with a bagful of deals, Michelles luggage will be stuffed with Indian culture. At the crafts museum, she buys everything from kantha-stitch bed sheets and wall hangings to wooden toys and Manipuri shawls. Michelle seems fascinated by the colourful bangles on display and buys nearly a dozen, apart from a bead necklace.            
	Talk time        
	Obama and Singh hold talks at Hyderabad House, attended by Pranab Mukherjee, S.M. Krishna, national security adviser Shivshankar Menon and foreign secretary Nirupama Rao. This is followed by delegation-level talks, where other senior ministers join in.                    Obama listens to Singh at the joint news conference      
	Not this deal, please  
	 Indo-US deals are fine in all areas  except the media, Obama jokes at the joint news conference with Singh. As Indian journalists press Obama to answer a part of a question asked by an American reporter (relating to Washingtons stand on a permanent UN Security Council seat for India), he quips: It is not surprising that the Indian media and the US media are collaborating. That is not the kind of collaboration we are looking forward to.  
	Between friends               
	Obama describes Singh as a friend at the media conference and thanks him and Gursharan Kaur for their gracious hospitality and the wonderful dinner on Sunday night. I very much commend Prime Minister Singhs sincere and relentless (efforts) to engage... for peace in the region, he says. Not to be outdone, Singh says: I welcome the President as a personal friend and a charismatic leader who has made a deep imprint on world affairs through his inclusive vision of peace, security and welfare for all peoples and nations. He adds that the Obamas have made an abiding impression on the people of India with their warmth and grace.

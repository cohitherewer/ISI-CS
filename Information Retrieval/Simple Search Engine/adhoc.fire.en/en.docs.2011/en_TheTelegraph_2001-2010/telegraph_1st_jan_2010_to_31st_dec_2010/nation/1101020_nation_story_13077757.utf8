	New Delhi, Oct. 19: The Central Vigilance Commission has received complaints that put the cumulative value of alleged corruption in projects related to the Commonwealth Games between Rs 5,000 crore and Rs 8,000 crore.        
	Sources said the complaints included payment to non-existent parties, wilful delay in execution of contracts, inflated prices and bungling in purchase of equipment through tendering.        
	The total misappropriation amount may touch a figure of Rs 5,000-8,000 crore. The commission is still awaiting reports from various departments and cannot give the exact amount involved in the bunglings, PTI quoted a senior CVC official as saying.        
	In reply to an RTI application from PTI, the anti-corruption watchdog has given details of projects executed by different government agencies where discrepancies have been detected.        
	Complaints regarding alleged embezzlement of Rs 1.5 crore in purchase of Hova courts for the badminton stadium, malpractices in the tender for kitchen equipment installation and misappropriation in video board tenders for remodelling and upgradation of Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium were received by the CVC. In all cases, reports are awaited from the sports ministry, it said.        
	The CVC is probing at least 22 more Games-related construction and procurement projects executed by different government agencies.        
	Several investigative arms of the government are now involved in the Games probe.         
	The Enforcement Directorate has registered a case under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema) to investigate allegations that the Suresh Kalmadi-headed Games organising committee had indulged in irregularities while awarding contracts for the Queens baton relay.        
	A CBI team visited the organising committee headquarters to collect documents.        
	The income tax department is investigating the award of broadcast rights by Prasar Bharati to a UK-based company and its Indian arm following charges of tax evasion.        
	Glare on Emaar         
	The Delhi Development Authority has submitted to urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy a report on problems in the construction of the Games Village. Emaar-MGF Construction had built the Village.         
	In the report, the DDA has cited various irregularities and deficiencies in the construction of 38 towers of the Village. It also accused the builder of exceeding the permissible limits of construction, sources said. If the allegations are proved, the company could face action.        
	On October 7, Reddy had written to the DDA that it has been widely reported that Emaar-MGF Construction has not executed the project of the development of the Games Village diligently and efficiently. There are serious complaints against the project developer, including complaints of construction against the provisions of the sanctioned plan, as well as not adhering to the obligations as per the project development agreement. There have also been reports of delay as well as deficiency in the execution of the project, which have not only adversely affected the image of DDA but also the Commonwealth Games as a whole.        
	In a statement, Emaar said it had complied with all laws and regulations, describing the Games Village as a world-class structure developed in record time.

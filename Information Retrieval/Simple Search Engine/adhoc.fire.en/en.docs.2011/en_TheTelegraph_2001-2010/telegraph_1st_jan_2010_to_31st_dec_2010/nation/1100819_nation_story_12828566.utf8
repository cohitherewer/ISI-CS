  - puducherry leader dons copycat fatigues          G.C. SHEKHAR                          Malladi Krishna Rao at the Independence Day event.                                         
	Chennai, Aug. 18: Those were copycat army fatigues he wore, full with garish yellow medals, a tiny India brooch and two criss-crossed Tricolours pinned on the chest. Egged on, possibly, by a surge of national pride on I-Day.        
	But what the costume and the trinkets have done is suck the Puducherry revenue and tourism minister into a little storm.        
	Hundreds of tongues concerned about the sanctity of army fatigues are wagging about Malladi Krishna Raos unusual choice of clothes at a flag-hoisting ceremony on Sunday at Yanam, a Puducherry enclave located in Andhras East Godavari district. They are wondering how he could have donned the fatigues, along with absurd white sneakers, while hoisting the Tricolour and inspecting a police guard of honour on Independence Day.        
	Under the Indian Penal Code, a person not belonging to the armed forces cannot wear any uniform or carry any token with the intention of making people believe that he/she belongs to that class of public servants.        
	According to IPC Section 171, whoever, not belonging, to a certain class of public servants, wears any garb or carries any token resembling any garb or token used by that class of public servants, with the intention that it may be believed, or with the knowledge that it is likely to be believed, that he belongs to that class of public servants, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend to two hundred rupees, or with both.        
	Sources said Raos intention, as a minister, could not have been to mislead anyone into thinking he was an army officer. He is believed to have picked up the copycat fatigues from a costumier of the Telugu film industry. Rao could not be contacted as calls to his cell phone repeatedly went into voice mail.        
	The sources said that unless it could be proved that Raos intention was to mislead people, he could not be prosecuted. Merely wearing army fatigues without such intention or out of ignorance was not an offence under IPC Section 171.        
	Although laws on military uniforms dont appear to be too stringent, they are tougher while dealing with security agencies. No security agency can provide uniforms to its employees that in any way resembles those of the army, navy, air force or police.        
	Under the Private Security Agencies (Regulation) Act of 2005, If any private security guard or supervisor wears the uniform of the Army, Air Force, Navy or any other armed forces of the Union or Police or any dress having the appearance or bearing any of the distinctive marks of that uniform, he and the proprietor of the private security agency shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine which may extend to five thousand rupees, or with both.        
	The Puducherry Assembly has put up Raos picture in army fatigues in its corridor.        
	Rao was elected as an Independent from Yanam in 2006. He subsequently joined the Congress and was made a minister. Puducherry is the only Union territory that has enclaves in three states  Karaikal in Tamil Nadu, Mahe in Kerala and Yanam in Andhra. Each enclave, though geographically separate, elects an MLA and is governed by Puducherrys laws.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Sept. 24: Maharashtra revenue minister Narayan Ranes son Nitesh has been booked for attempt to murder after he allegedly fired at an associate even as the Opposition alleged delayed police action and demanded a CBI probe.        
	Nitesh, in his early thirties, has been accused along with two aides of having shot at Chintu Sheikh in a fit of rage at the office of his NGO, Swabhiman Sanghatana, in Mumbais suburban Khar around 4.30pm yesterday.        
	Sheikh  who was with Raj Thackerays MNS before joining Niteshs organisation  apparently managed to escape and informed the police. He is now being treated at Hirananadani Hospital.        
	But the doctors there said they had not come across any evidence of bullet injuries though he appeared to have been assaulted. Chintu Sheikh got himself admitted yesterday. We have done an X-ray, and CT Scan, and we dont think it is a bullet injury, Dr Sudhir Chatterji said.        
	Nitesh has denied the incident saying he had not met Sheikh and since he had armed security, he did not need to carry a weapon. It is a conspiracy to defame me and my organisation. Cant trap a tiger using a mousetrap. Better luck next time!! Nitesh wrote on Twitter.         
	Narayan Rane alleged Uddhav Thackeray and his Shiv Sena were behind the conspiracy against his son.        
	Chief minister Ashok Chavan suggested he was unaware of the facts. I will collect information about the incident. Asked about allegations of government pressure on the police to go slow, he said: There is no question of government interference.         
	But the Opposition accused the government of trying to hush up the matter, the allegations probably stoked by the fact that Nitesh and his two accused aides, Nitin Vardhanarayan and Zahid Shaikh, have not questioned so far.        
	Leader of Opposition, the BJPs Eknath Khadse, described the allegations against Nitesh as very serious. The government is trying to protect him. The case must be handed over to the CBI, Khadse said.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, March 12: The Trinamul Congress ordered its MPs to sacrifice their concerns over the hike in fuel prices and support Pranab Mukherjee unequivocally during a discussion on the budget in the Lok Sabha today.        
	Anxious to prove its loyalty to the UPA despite almost-daily differences with ally Congress on several government policies, Mamata Banerjees party placed its alliance above its political concerns.        
	Trinamul issued the strongest possible parliamentary whip  called a three-line whip  ordering all its Lok Sabha MPs to not just attend the House but to vote in favour of the budget.        
	The support of the UPA partner was crucial to the Congress because the Left and the BJP have been attacking the government over the rising prices of essential commodities, especially fuel.        
	Mamata had publicly criticised the hike announced by Mukherjee in the budget on February 26. Trinamul held a rally in Calcutta after the hike was announced. Mamata is also upset with Mukherjees decision to withdraw exemption for the railways from service tax levied on goods transporters.         
	The Trinamul whip came after days of tension with the Congress over the womens reservation bill.

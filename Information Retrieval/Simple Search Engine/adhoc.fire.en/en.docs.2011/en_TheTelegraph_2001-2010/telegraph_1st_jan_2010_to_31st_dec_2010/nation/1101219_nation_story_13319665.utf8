          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                      On the prowl                          
	Lucknow, Dec. 18: The terror of an elephant has closed the Rishikesh-Dehra Dun highway to traffic after 4pm for the past six days.        
	The male elephant has killed three persons, injured six and upturned vehicles travelling down the road that cuts through an elephant corridor in Rajaji National Park, prompting the Uttarakhand forest and wildlife department to turn to experts for advice on how to deal with the animal.        
	In its report to the state government, the forest department has said the attacks began on the night of December 8 at Sat Mod in Rishikesh when the 20-year-old elephant attacked a jeep on its way to Dehra Dun. It overturned the vehicle and crushed to death one of the three occupants  a 70-year-old woman  after she had managed to get out and was trying to escape.        
	On December 14, Sunil Rawat, 34, was the next victim. Rawat, the driver of a government car, died when his vehicle went off the road while trying to avert a collision with the elephant around 9.30 in the night.         
	The next day, the elephant overturned a truck transporting sugar. He has since been coming back to the spot frequently to feast on the sugar.        
	On December 16, it crushed to death a village woman who was trying to take some sugar from the truck.         
	Residents of at least three villages along the road gheraoed forest officials yesterday demanding protection and compensation for the damage the elephant has caused to standing crops.        
	The Uttarakhand principal chief conservator of forests, Raghu Bir Singh Rawat, has sought the advice of S.P. Goel and K. Chaudhary of the Wildlife Institute of India and experts from the Elephant Behaviour Project, a central government initiative.         
	The experts are believed to have told the state government it has two options: declare the elephant a rogue and kill it, or relocate it. Or, administer some drugs and see if there is any change in behaviour, take it to the nearest elephant herd and let it try to integrate.         
	Experts from both institutes have pointed out that increase in traffic, frequent flashing of headlights and honking have been disturbing the elephant habitat at the national park that is part of a long elephant corridor spread over Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

          RASHEED KIDWAI                                              Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Vijay Mallya                                
	Bhopal, Dec. 13: Three quick telephone calls from BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and Ravi Shankar Prasad prompted Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan to retract a statement that the Rajya Sabha should be scrapped because of electoral malpractices.        
	Shivraj had thundered on Sunday afternoon in the presence of Union law minister Veerappa Moily and Chief Election Commissioner S.Y. Qureshi that the upper House in Parliament should be abolished.        
	Alleging that moneybags were deciding who would get elected to the House of elders, Shivraj, otherwise known for sobriety, said people like Kingfisher were entering the Rajya Sabha. It was seen as a reference to Vijay Mallya, whose Kingfisher brand sells beverages and runs an airline.        
	The words flew so fast that the chief minister forgot the industrialist had won the Rajya Sabha nomination with the support of his own party, the BJP, in Karnataka.        
	Shivraj said: There is horse trading in the Rajya Sabha elections... seats are bought and sold... sometimes its Kingfisher, sometimes others. Democracy is shamed.        
	But by late Sunday night, Shivraj was heard speaking on a similar topic but in a measured voice. He carefully searched for words and spoke slowly, apologising for his remarks. The Rajya Sabha is a constitutional institution and I respect it, and I also respect all the members of the Rajya Sabha, and if people have construed a different meaning to my words, I apologise, Shivraj said.        
	It is believed that hours after Shivraj called for the abolition of the Rajya Sabha, leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj called him up, pointing out that as chief minister, he had crossed a Lakshmanrekha.        
	The leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley, was reportedly more elaborate, pointing out how the upper House had a special place and that coming from a chief minister, it amounted to questioning a constitutional body. Jaitley is himself from the Rajya Sabha.        
	Shivraj, who has been advocating simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls and a presidential form of democracy, is said to have feebly told the BJP leadership that had the Rajya Sabha not been around, Manmohan Singh would not have become Prime Minister. The genial chief minister, however, agreed to retract his statements.        
	Ravi Shankar Prasad, a Rajya Sabha member, is said to have pointed out to Shivraj that since Parliament was in session till Monday, his stand would embarrass the BJP.        
	While these telephone conversations were taking place, BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain, who had a tiff with Shivraj at one point of time, chose to go public, saying the Madhya Pradesh chief ministers remarks were his own.        
	After becoming Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Shivraj had not vacated his Pandit Pant Marg accommodation in New Delhi even though it was allotted to Shahnawaz.

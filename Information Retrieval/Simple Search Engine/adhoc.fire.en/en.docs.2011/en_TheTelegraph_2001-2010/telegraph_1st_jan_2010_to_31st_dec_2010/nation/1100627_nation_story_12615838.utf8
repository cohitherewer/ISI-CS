          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                       Pakistan interior minister Rehman Malik with Chidambaram in Islamabad on Saturday. (AP)                          
	Islamabad, June 26: Home minister P. Chidamabaram was quick to upturn the Indian Tricolour inadvertently placed inverted between him and counterpart Rehman Malik but that appears to have been by far his most successful manoeuvre on this visit.         
	He found his hosts fulsome on promise, as they have been for a while, and kept his verdict on delivery pending.         
	His interactions never reached the new gear Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is trying to crank ties to, and if he caught a whiff of hope, as he said he had, it was probably a leftover waft of the more convivial tryst between foreign secretaries Nirupama Rao and Salman Bashir two days ago.         
	Perhaps dictated by the requirements of the new atmospherics the two Prime Ministers are trying to generate, the home ministers did make a brief, and unexpected, joint appearance before journalists but it was apparent they were still at nothing more than paving the road with good intentions.         
	Malik issued a fervent assurance that Pakistan had resolved to pursue the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attack to the logical end, leaving no stone unturned.         
	Without saying as much, Chidambaram let it be known it was a pledge he had often heard and seen little movement on. Nobody is questioning intentions, he said. We are looking for outcomes, and outcomes alone will decide if we are on the right track.        
	Chidambaram then articulated his takeaway from the trip with what can best be described as open-ended platitude: I leave with the conviction that we have both exchanged views and understood the situation and agreed to address it with all the seriousness that it deserves.        
	It could well be that the feeble affirmatives Chidamabaram is attaching to his visit  good, hopeful  are driven by nothing more than the need not to disrupt the resumption of multi-pronged engagement mandated by the Prime Minister.         
	A top official affirmed that despite a deficit in expectation, the home ministers delegation was keen it did not sound a sour note when an apex level effort to improve ties had just been flagged off. This dialogue is still fairly fragile, he said, clearly casting the home ministers visit as one piece of a larger design, Terrorism is, of course, of chief concern but there is a bigger process unfolding and it will require patience at every level.         
	The prospect of a tactile breakthrough during external affairs minister S.M. Krishnas visit in mid-July is still real and New Delhi is keen it does nothing to undermine the promise of forward movement. Chidambarams circumspect pose through his stay is part of that careful calibration.         
	That, of course, has not meant that the home minister has flinched from articulating Indian worries and demands: round up and punish those who masterminded the Mumbai attack, dismantle the terror machine and while law takes its time getting hold of Hafiz Saeed, at least show the will to put a lid on his virulent anti-India posturing.         
	It is not clear whether he received any specific guarantees on Saeed, or others that India holds responsible for the Mumbai attack and are still at large.         
	It is even less clear if Chidambaram and his team are willing to be taken by the renewed promises on addressing Mumbai and tackling terror that they have been lavished with over the last couple of days.         
	Responding to questions earlier in the day, Rehman Malik had expressed willingness to meet the Indian demand for providing voice samples of the alleged Pakistan-based handlers of the Mumbai terror team.         
	Foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has made similar noises in a series of interviews he has been giving. But Indian officials appear in no mood to pronounce that as a breakthrough just yet.         
	Echoing Chidambaram, a senior official said: We have to wait and see if action follows and they deliver what they promise, for quite a while now the Pakistan government has been saying it is willing to act but used one or the other excuse to delay action. Look at Hafiz Saeed.        
	Indeed, sections of Chidambarams party appeared a little rankled by Pakistans championing of the anti-terror resolutions on the Saarc platform. It is very well for them to say they too are victims of terror and attempt parity with India, said one, but the fact is they are providing haven to terror attacks on us. Multilateral resolutions against terror are all very well, but they cannot take away from the bilateral issues with Pakistan on the subject.         
	Neither will several of the multilateral anti-terror mechanisms agreed upon by Saarc home ministers today  exchange of information and intelligence is among them  necessarily apply to bilaterally between India and Pakistan, the official appeared to suggest.         
	It will be a good thing to be in a situation when we are able to exchange intelligence, but that is way off. We are talking of trust-building, but at the moment the deficit far outweighs that.

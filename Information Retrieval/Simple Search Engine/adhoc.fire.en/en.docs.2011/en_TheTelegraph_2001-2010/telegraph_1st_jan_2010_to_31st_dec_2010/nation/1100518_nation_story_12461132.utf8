The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress secular jab at Left 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Congress secular jab at Left 
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, May 17: Panned over price rise, the Congress is hitting back at the Left for sitting in the BJPs lap.        
	Exactly a year after the May 2009 elections threw up signs of Congress revival, the party claims to have become the sole protector of secular politics, while accusing its former ally of digesting flagrant violations by RSS outfits.        
	Have we heard even a single strong statement condemning the BJP in the last one year. Have the CPM and the CPI, continuously attacking the Congress on price rise and even resorting to a Bharat bandh, attacked the rent-a-riot saffron brigade of the Ram Sene? Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said.        
	The leaders of the Left are found at the leader of Opposition Sushma Swarajs door; we can say the Left is sitting in the BJPs lap, he added.        
	Tiwari said the Left must clarify if the threat to Indias secular polity had ceased, particularly when needles of suspicion for the blasts in Malegaon, Mecca Masjid, Ajmer and the Samjhauta Express pointed to outfits that had links with the Sangh parivar.        
	The time has come for the government to holistically look at the entire web of the larger RSS pantheon, he said, before going on to add: Will the secular parties sacrifice their ideology at the altar of anti-Congressism?         
	When pointed out that the Left was only trying to forge parliamentary strategies on policies they ideologically oppose, he said: We have a simple question: has the threat of communalism died? The Left should realise there is a permanent fault-line in Indian politics and that is the RSS challenge to secularism. No party should ignore that.

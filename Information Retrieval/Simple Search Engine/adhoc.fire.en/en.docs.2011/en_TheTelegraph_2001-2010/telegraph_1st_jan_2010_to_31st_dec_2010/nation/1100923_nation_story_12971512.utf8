          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa scored a victory against the Reddy brothers of Bellary when he re-inducted confidante Shobha Karandlaje into his ministry today.         
	The cabinet shuffle strengthened Yeddyurappas hands in more ways than one: he dropped a favourite of the Reddy brothers, K. Shivannagouda Naik, and Gulihatti D. Shekhar, who was allegedly passing on information on the BJPs internal politics to the Janata Dal (Secular).        
	Shekhar had threatened to commit suicide if he was sacked but accepted the decision silently, at least for the moment.         
	The three Reddy brothers had warned of a revolt if any minister was shunted out and if Shobha was brought back. According to reports from Bangalore, they quietly attended the swearing-in.         
	The chief minister managed a balancing act by ensuring caste parity and placating another powerful adversary, BJP general secretary and Bangalore MP Ananth Kumar. He inducted six ministers and got rid of three.        
	Of the new entrants, C.H. Vijayashankar, who is from the backward caste of Kurubas dominating the Mysore region, replaced K.S. Eshwarappa, another Kuruba who had quit the government on becoming the Karnataka BJP chief. A. Narayaswamy, another debutant, is said to be close to Kumar. S.A. Ramdas, also inducted today, was a strong opponent of Shobha when he was close to the Reddys. His entry suggested that he has made peace with Yeddyurappa.         
	Around this time last year, the chief minister was forced to drop Shobha to buy peace with the Reddys, who own mines in Bellary, when it looked as though they would bring down the government -- the BJPs first in southern India.         
	Between then and now, the clout of the Reddys has considerably diminished after the Supreme Court and the Centre cracked down on illegal mining. With the exception of Sushma Swaraj, their patrons in the BJP, too, steadily distanced themselves from the brothers.         
	This time Yeddyurappa, armed with support from the RSS and the BJPs central leaders, managed to get his way.

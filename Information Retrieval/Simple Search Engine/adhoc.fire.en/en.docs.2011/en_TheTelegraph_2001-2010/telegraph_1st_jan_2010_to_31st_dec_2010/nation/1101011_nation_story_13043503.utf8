	Wellington, Oct. 10 (AP): The New Zealand television anchor who made fun of Sheila Dikshits name resigned today.        
	Presenter Paul Henry left his post at Television New Zealand, a state broadcaster, after his racist comments sparked outrage in India.        
	On his Breakfast show two weeks ago, Henry also called Dikshits name so appropriate because shes Indian.        
	On Friday, India said in a formal protest to New Zealand high commissioner Rupert Holborow that it strongly and unequivocally denounces the racist remarks of the journalist in question.        
	Today, Henry said it was no longer practical in the current environment for me to do the job I was employed to do.

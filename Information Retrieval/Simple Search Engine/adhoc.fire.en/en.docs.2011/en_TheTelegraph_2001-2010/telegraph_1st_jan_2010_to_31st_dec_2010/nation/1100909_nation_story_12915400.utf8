The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rs 120-crore family venture
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rs 120-crore family venture
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: Thick as thieves, and all in the family.        
	A Delhi father and son duped investors of an amount that almost matches the relief the Prime Minister announced for cloudburst-ravaged Leh last month  Rs 120 crore.        
	But today, Bhupinder Pal Singh, 55, and Gurkaran Singh, 25, saw their carefully made plans to spend the rest of the lives abroad in luxury run into rough weather when they were arrested after a three-year hunt.        
	Like their deception game, the dramatic manner in which the duo were caught was the stuff of many a potboiler as the fugitives run from the law ended with a police chase through two states that lasted over an hour.        
	The Singhs carried a bounty of Rs 20,000  a microscopic fraction of the amount they had swindled from over 5,000 investors.        
	A probe revealed that the duo, residents of neighbouring Gurgaon in Haryana, owned a jewellery shop at Rajouri Garden in west Delhi. Not satisfied with the money they were making selling ornaments, they decided to float a company, M/s Pavi Overseas Pvt. Ltd, in 2007 and unveiled an investment scheme, Kanak Dhara.        
	Bhupinder was the self-appointed managing director and Gurkaran the director, according to the schemes brochures. They lured investors on the pretext of giving back astronomical returns, which turned out to be 1,500 per cent to 6,000 percent per annum, said a Delhi crime branch officer working on the case.        
	The duo claimed those investing in the initial stages of the scheme would be gainers, while the latecomers would earn less. This, the police said, was a ploy to trap unsuspecting investors and ensure maximum initial collections. This was done to attract more and more innocent persons into the trap, the officer added.         
	After earning Rs 120 crore, the Singhs felt it was enough for them to lead a comfortable life. Realising their misdeeds would be exposed sooner than later, they closed down their office and went into hiding.        
	The police had announced the cash reward for information leading to the duos arrests in December 2008 after receiving hundreds of complaints from the victims, many of them from different parts of the country.        
	Considering the huge sum involved, we had alerted our counterparts in several states. After cheating the amount, the duo moved around the country and never stayed more than two months in a place, the officer said.        
	Acting on a tip-off, sleuths camped near a Gurgaon market today and saw the two get off a Tata Safari and step into a foreign bank. The duo were accompanied by a man who alerted them and within minutes, the three sped away. After an hours hot pursuit, they were stopped and arrested near a petrol pump in Delhi cantonment.         
	The two had lured investors not only from Delhi but also from Punjab, Mumbai, Che-nnai and other places, said the officer.

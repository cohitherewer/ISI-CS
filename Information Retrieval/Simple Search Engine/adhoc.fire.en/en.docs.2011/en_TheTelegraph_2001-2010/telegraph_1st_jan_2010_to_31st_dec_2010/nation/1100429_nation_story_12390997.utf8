The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Digvijay gets support from foes
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Digvijay gets support from foes
          SHEENA K.                          Digvijay                                  
	Raipur, April 28: Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh may not find friends in the party for his scathing attack on Union home minister P. Chidambaram over the Maoist issue, but his one-time foes in the heartland have come out openly in his support.        
	Former Union minister Vidya Charan Shukla and former chief minister Ajit Jogi have backed Digvijay on his stand over the Naxalite issue.         
	The support of both the leaders is seen as an important political development as Digvijay has enjoyed a good rapport with them.        
	In undivided Madhya Pradesh and later after Chhattisgarh came into being, Shukla was considered as bte noire of Digvijay. Even Jogi never had a good political equation with Digvijay. The rift between Jogi and Digvijay was so big that the latter never came to Chhattisgarh officially when the former was chief minister.        
	Thanks to an article written by chief minister Raman Singh lashing out at Digvijay, the leaders  who never saw eye-to-eye  came out in his support. Raman had castigated Digvijay and charged that it was during his tenure in undivided Madhya Pradesh, the Maoists had created their strong base in Chhattisgarh.         
	During Digvijays regime, nominal Maoist incidents took place that too near the borders, Jogi said, adding that now (in the regime of Raman), it had spread across the state.         
	Shukla echoed Jogi and said: The Maoist incidents were hardly taking place during the Digvijay government.        
	The Congress general secretary could feel some respite at a time when other Congress leaders, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, had distanced themselves from Ramans statement on the Maoist menace.

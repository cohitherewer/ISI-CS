	Bhubaneswar, June 2: Orissa will soon have an e-surveillance mechanism for pest attack through use of scientific tools so that the farmers are benefited and remedial actions can be initiated by the agriculture department.        
	Scientists working under the Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology, must change their strategy and include climate change as their research focus area and also impact patterns to help farmers, said agriculture production commissioner R.N. Senapati at state-level research council meeting.        
	Agriculture secretary U.P. Singh was also critical of the yield gap between research and production.

  - Christian council lens   on Kandhamal visit        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 23: Bangalore-based Global Council of Indian Christians feels that the delegation of European diplomats, which visited communally scarred Kandhamal recently, should have met all sections of society.        
	They should have met the civil society of Orissa and not a particular section, said GCIC president Sajjan K. George here today when reporters pointed out the allegations of Hindu organisations that the delegation had met only church leaders and Christian victims in Kandhamal, which gave rise to suspicion that they had a hidden communal agenda.        
	I welcome the visit of European delegation if it helps India secure a permanent seat in the UN Security Council and projecting Orissa as a tourist destination. If they want to involve themselves in a holistic way, they are most welcome, said George.        
	But if the visit has given rise to any misgivings in the minds of the people of Orissa, it should be removed. If there is a perception that the visiting delegation had attempted to tinker with the judicial process it should be removed by the European Union through a clarification, observed the Christian leader.        
	The visiting European delegation was scheduled to meet the fast-track court judges in Kandhamal during their visit. But the programme was cancelled following protests by the local legal community alleging that it would amount to influencing the judiciary and infringing upon the sovereignty of the country.        
	George also expressed his dismay over the failure of the National Commission for Minorities and the Union government in ensuring provision of adequate relief to the 2007 and 2008 communal riot victims.        
	Stating that the commission was apparently concerned about a section of the society, George said they should also be concerned about miseries of Christian victims in Kandhamal. He demanded a compensation of at least Rs 2 lakh to each family whose houses had been fully damaged during the riot.        
	Alleging that Christian victims were being threatened by Hindu fanatics, George demanded security for them. He also appealed to the Orissa High Court to provide protection to the witnesses and riot victims.

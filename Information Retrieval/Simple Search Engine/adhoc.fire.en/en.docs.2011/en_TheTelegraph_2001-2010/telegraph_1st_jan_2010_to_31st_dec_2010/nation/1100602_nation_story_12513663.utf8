The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Terror eye on train, Delhi Metro
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Terror eye on train, Delhi Metro
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, June 1: The Lashkar-e-Toiba plans to target the Deccan Odyssey, a luxury train that is popular among foreign tourists, and the Delhi Metro, intelligence inputs suggest.        
	The inputs were gleaned from intercepts by the Intelligence Bureau a day before the Jnaneswari Express tragedy in Bengal.        
	The Deccan Odyssey runs in Maharashtra and parts of Goa between September 5 and September 26, home ministry sources said. The period coincides with 9/11.        
	No specific dates have been mentioned in the threat to the Metro, the sources added.        
	The alerts have prompted a security scurry among rail and home ministry officials.        
	We are evolving a strategy in which security will be given according to categories of trains, one of which will be luxury trains for foreign tourists. We cannot have the same type of security for all, Railway Protection Force chief Ranjit Sinha said.        
	Soon after it received the inputs, the home ministry wrote to Railway Board member (traffic) Vivek Sahai, who today took over as board chairman, succeeding S.S. Khurana.

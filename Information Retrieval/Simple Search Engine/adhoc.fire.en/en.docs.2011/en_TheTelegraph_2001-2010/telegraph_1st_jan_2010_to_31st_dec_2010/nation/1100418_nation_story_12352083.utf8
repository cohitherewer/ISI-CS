  - I am feeling much relaxed          ARCHIS MOHAN                          Lalit Modi with the Dalai Lama at McLeodganj in Dharamshala on Saturday. (PTI)                                        
	Dharamshala, April 17: His standing at a low, his IPL perch precarious and controversies buffeting him like well-directed bouncers, Lalit Modis search for inner peace has taken him to the doorstep of the Dalai Lama.        
	Whether Modi discovered inner peace at 4,780 feet above sea level remained as unfathomable as the names of the stakeholders of most IPL teams, but 90 minutes with the Buddhist monk did appear to have made some difference.        
	I am feeling much relaxed after listening to the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, Modi said, adding that he needed the Dalai Lamas blessings.        
	His teachings are very meaningful and one derives peace of mind listening to him, Modi added.        
	The Dalai Lama exhorted Modi, his wife and a dozen-odd cricketers from Kings XI Punjab and the Deccan Chargers to look within for peace.        
	If Modi did look within, he gave the impression that he found nothing to hide, particularly from the income-tax department. IT is doing their job, we have nothing to hide, he said.        
	The inner peace didnt last long. Modi was soon his combative self. He claimed his tweets referring to Sunanda Pushkar were a result of his phone having been hacked.        
	Modi described as incorrect reports that the IPL governing council members had met informally here to work out how to cut him to size. All speculation in this regard is wrong. Its just a creation of certain vested interests, he said.        
	However, sources in the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association said Modi looked uncomfortable yesterday as he sat watching the first-ever cricket match to be held at Dharamshala while other members of the governing council, such as Arun Jaitley and Rajiv Shukla, continued their meetings without him. Shukla later denied there was any formal or informal governing council meeting.        
	Along with Modi, some cricketers too attended the Dalai Lamas discourse. They included Andrew Symonds, Yuvraj Singh and S. Sreesanth.        
	From today, I shall be a changed man. I could relate to a lot of things he said, Sreesanth declared, adding that he played his cricket with passion and this often led people to misunderstand him.        
	The other cricketers included Chaminda Vaas, Rohit Sharma, Piyush Chawla, V.V.S. Laxman, Pragyan Ojha and Kings XI coach Tom Moody.        
	Later in the day, Mahela Jayawardene, a practising Buddhist, his wife and a few other cricketers took a stroll down McLeodganjs serpentine shopping street. They bought trinkets, junk jewellery and souvenirs.        
	While many Tibetan shopkeepers seemed unaware of the celebrity status of the shopper in T-shirt and jeans, they were left in little doubt that the tourist was a VIP when other visitors from the plains mobbed the Sri Lankan batsman.        
	The town is teeming with tourists, most of whom have come from Haryana and Punjab or from other parts of Himachal. The next match is on Sunday, between Kings XI and the Chennai Super Kings.

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: A plan to set up state unified commands in four Maoist-hit states has failed to take off following opposition to the involvement of senior army officers at the tactical level.        
	The plan, announced on July 14 by the Prime Ministers Office after a meeting Manmohan Singh held with chief ministers of several Maoist-affected states, was to appoint retired major generals as advisers in the unified commands led by the respective chief secretaries.        
	But sources in the Union home ministry said the plan was yet to take off. So far neither has any major general been appointed nor has any work been done by the unified commands. The home minister will review the issue shortly, a ministry source said.         
	A brigadier-rank officer has already been appointed as an adviser in the Union home ministry, but the Centre cannot force states to have a similar arrangement as law and order is a state subject.        
	We are not in a military rule. It (the presence of such an officer) is not of urgent need, Bengal chief secretary Samar Ghosh had said yesterday when asked whether the appointment would be made anytime soon.        
	Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Orissa are the four states where the unified command was proposed.        
	Sources said Union home minister P. Chidambaram had asked the chief ministers of the Maoist-hit states to bring to the table things we are doing right and the things we are doing wrong so that we can have a free and frank discussion on this very serious subject.        
	The states seem to have given their opinion and the home minister appears to have accepted it.         
	Sources in the states said the issue of appointing retired major generals could be considered wrapped up and over and Delhi could be thinking of another mechanism to streamline operations against the rebels, who have already killed over 250 security personnel this year.        
	Police sources in Chhattisgarh said there was no point having a retired major general as an adviser when one could make central paramilitary forces more proactive.        
	For one, it was an intra-state idea and not an inter-state unified command which could have served a purpose. In addition, as the CRPF has got its act together and its director-general is leading from the front, it should be allowed to go ahead. This is not exactly an infantry job here, said a senior police officer.        
	A source said the CRPF now had an authorised strength of 2.85 lakh personnel and as co-ordination between states and central paramilitary forces improves, the plan to involve retired army officers would be ultimately given up.        
	Sources in the states said they would rather have PBORs (ex-service personnel below officer rank) than senior officers whose ideas could clash with senior police officers who devise tactics on the ground.        
	The defence ministry recently cleared a proposal to let ex-servicemen be deployed in Maoist-affected states. These personnel with long experience in de-mining will help de-mine huge swathes in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Orissa to start with, sources said.         
	Another plan agreed on July 14 was to provide more helicopters to states for logistical support, such as troop movement, supplies and evacuation. Sources said a fresh list on which states would be leased how many Mi-17 helicopters was being drawn up by the defence and home ministries.

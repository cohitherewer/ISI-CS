	New Delhi, Dec. 15: Granpa Wen scored a perfect 10 with students of a Delhi school  he impressed them with his knowledge of Tagore.        
	Chinese Premier Wen Jiabaos first engagement in India was a visit to the Tagore International School where he interacted with about 27 students and a dozen-odd teachers.        
	His knowledge of Tagores works and not just as a writer but as a painter, sculptor and educationist left us all floored. He knew a lot about Tagore, principal Madhulika Sen said.         
	Wen, known to have a deep interest in Chinese poetry, talked about Gitanjali.        
	The sage poet was a household name in China and the older generation of literary giants in China have been deeply influenced by him, he said.        
	China, particularly Shanghai where Tagore had lived, was celebrating 150 years of the Nobel laureates birth, Wen said.        
	The Chinese Premier, who was assisted by a translator, asked the students: So how do you grade me?         
	Ten on 10, the students and teachers chorused.         
	The students described him as a cool grandpa and one of them  a Class 12 student  asked the Chinese leader if he could be called Grandpa Wen.         
	Wen, 68, said that was what children back home called him and added that he loved the company of children.         
	Tagore has remained a constant in the speeches and statements of both Indian and Chinese officials in the past month as they have prepared for the Wens three-day state visit.        
	Today, he spoke of Tagores works, his visits to China, what the poet meant to Chinese of Wens generation and how he continued to bind the two fast-emerging nations together.        
	Wen also tried his hand at calligraphy, teaching the students to write India and China are friends in Mandarin  both in the traditional style which is written right to left and the modern style which is written left to right.        
	Friendship between the two countries was a theme at each of his public appearances. India and China are friends forever, he said, in a throwback to the Hindi-Chini bhai bhai slogan.        
	The school in Vasant Vihar has for the past two years partnered with Jinuyan Senior High School in Shanghai and has had teacher exchanges and weekly e-learning classes in yoga and calligraphy. On Thursdays, an Indian teacher imparts yoga lessons to Chinese students through video conferencing. On Fridays, a Chinese teacher gives lessons in calligraphy.        
	Some of the students who interacted with Wen today had been to China as part of the schools exchange programme and recounted their experiences.         
	The Chinese Premier said India and China, two of the most populous countries in the world, had ancient civilisations and links. Friendship between our two countries has a time-honoured history which can be dated back to 2,000 years, he said, adding the relationship has become closer in the last 10 years.        
	 Welcoming CBSEs decision to start teaching Mandarin in its 11,000 affiliated schools, he said: In my view language is a very useful tool. It is a tool for heart to heart communication and it works as a bridge between the two countries.        
	After landing at Delhi airport in the afternoon, Wen said in a written statement: My current visit is aimed at promoting friendship, expanding co-operation, building on our past achievements and opening up new dimensions for mutual benefit and common development of the two countries.        
	Later in the day, he addressed industrialists. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh hosted a private dinner for Wen at home.        
	Tomorrow, the two leaders will meet for delegation-level talks in the morning. A strong delegation of 400 businessmen has accompanied Wen.        
	Tibetan protests        
	Nearly 400 Tibetan protestors took out a march from Rajghat to Jantar Mantar wearing T-shirts with slogans that said: Free Tibet Wen, Free Tibet Now.        
	Six protesters breached security and made their way near Taj Palace Hotel where the Chinese Premier is staying and shouted anti-China slogans.        
	We protested outside the hotel telling Wen Jiabao Tibet does not belong to him and China should vacate it, said Tenzin Norsang, one of the six protesters.

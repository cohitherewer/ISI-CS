The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rigged trials stall flak-jacket deal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rigged trials stall flak-jacket deal
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: A sting operation suggesting a top defence laboratory rigged the trials of bullet-proof jackets to favour one of the bidders has forced the Centre to stay the purchase of 59,000 such vests for the paramilitary.        
	In the tapes, R.K. Verma, joint director of the laboratory, which is run by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), says he had rigged the trials but could now undo the damage, sources claimed.        
	Verma also allegedly said that senior DRDO officials and corporate bigwigs were in touch with him over the Rs 150-crore jacket contract and claimed political patronage for his collusion with vendors on the price bid.        
	R.K. Verma has admitted that it was his voice on the CD, an emailed media statement from the home ministry said today, although it did not go into the details of the tapes contents.        
	Sources said the sting was carried out by a security firm that had supplied 20,000 bullet-proof jackets to the government last year but failed to make it this time.        
	The ministry has scrapped the test reports submitted by Vermas Terminal Ballistic Research Laboratory (TBRL), Chandigarh, and said bidders may be requested to submit fresh samples that would be tested again.        
	The new jackets were to weigh about 6.5kg each whereas the ones the security forces now use weigh over 14kg. The announcement of the new jackets procurement had gladdened the troops, especially those who are battling militants and Maoists and have to carry about 20kg of gear including their jacket, gun and ammunition.        
	Questions have repeatedly been raised in the country about the standard of bullet-proof vests given to police and paramilitary. In the tapes, Verma allegedly claims that during the trials, he had misrepresented the effect that bullets had on the jackets by fudging technical data.        
	The jackets were meant for the seven central paramilitary forces: the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Border Security Force, Central Industrial Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, National Security Guard, Assam Rifles and the Sashastra Seema Bal.        
	The home ministry statement said several complaints were received from different sources about the trials. On January 8, the CRPF, which was to receive 20,000 of the 59,000 vests, demanded fresh trials.        
	The director-general, Bureau of Police Research and Development, examined the complaints and the CD and reported that Verma has admitted that it was his voice on the CD, the ministry statement said.        
	The ministry will ask DRDO to nominate one or more scientists/technologists of integrity to conduct the tests on the fresh samples. The statement said the DRDO might be asked to take suitable disciplinary action against Verma after an inquiry.        
	This is the second big scandal in 10 days involving the purchase of bullet-proof jackets after the January 1 show-cause notice to eight senior Maharashtra police officers over the disappearance of a file containing purchase details of such vests.        
	The file had disappeared just days after allegations surfaced that anti-terrorism squad chief Hemant Karkare had died on 26/11 because his substandard flak jackets had failed to stop the terrorists bullets.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, April 16: The Supreme Court today upheld a Maharashtra ban on a book on Islam, A Concept of Political World Invasion by the Muslims, written by lawyer R.V. Bhasin.        
	The Maharashtra government had banned the book on March 9, 2007, four years after publication, on the ground that it could promote hatred.        
	The ban came at the request of groups such as the Indian Union Muslim League, the Maharashtra Muslim Lawyers Forum, the Islamic Research Foundation and the Jamaat-e-Islami-e-Hind.        
	A state notification quoted paragraphs to claim the book had made derogatory and false statements about Islam, Muslims and Muslim priests. It said an offence had been registered against the editors, printer and writer under several sections of the penal code, including 153A (promoting enmity between groups) and 295A (outraging religious feelings).        
	The ban was upheld by Bombay High Court, which held there could be academic criticism of a religion but it should not degenerate into insulting comment.         
	It said a religion could be criticised, but malicious criticism aimed at promoting communal hatred and painting a community in a villainous light was not permissible.        
	Bhasins lawyer argued in the high court that a book published four years ago could not suddenly upset Muslim sentiment in 2007.        
	Bhasin later appealed to the apex court, saying his book dealt with the spread of Islam in India and how the followers of Islam worked to proselytise the rest of the world.         
	He said the book had been translated into Hindi and had sold over 10,000 copies so far.

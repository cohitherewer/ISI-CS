          AMIT ROY                          A picture of Harpreet Aulakh from a family album                                  
	London, Dec. 4: Even by the standards of Indian murders in Britain  and there have been some horrific ones over the decades  Geeta Aulakhs killing because she had asked her husband, Harpreet Aulakh, for a divorce was particularly brutal.        
	Promising a fee of 5,000, 32-year-old Harpreet hired two men to do the deed: while Jaswant Singh, 30, acted as lookout, Sher Singh, a bogus 19-year-old student, struck four blows with a 14-inch machete that were so vicious that Geetas right arm was completely severed.         
	Harpreet, of Greenford, west London, Jaswant, of Ilford, east London, and Sher, of Southall, west London, were yesterday all given life sentences at the Old Bailey. The husband will have to serve a minimum of 28 years before he is considered for parole, while the two men he hired cannot come out for 22 years.        
	After doing her days duty as a receptionist at Sunrise Radio, Geeta was on her way to a childminder to pick up her two sons, aged 10 and 8.            PROOF IN PICTURES NAILS HUSBAND            Sher Singh (left) and   Harpreet Aulakh at a wedding   in Punjab            CCTV footage shows Harpreet buying a machete in a shop days before killing wife Geeta            Geeta Aulakh on a bus to collect 
  her children minutes before she 
  was attacked and murdered      
	Geetas mother, Nardesh Shinh, rushed to hospital just as her angel died. Doctors said her injuries were so severe that there was no possibility of saving her.        
	Her mother said: At 28, she had everything to live for. Geeta is missed as a daughter, sister, and friend, but most importantly as a mother to two young boys. What kind of life will those young children now have?        
	Detective chief inspector Howard Groves, who led the inquiry with commendable thoroughness, said: Geetas family and friends have finally seen justice served. I would like to thank the witnesses who came forward and gave evidence in this trial, as their willingness to do so demonstrates that so-called honour killings within our communities are not acceptable and that offenders will be brought to justice.        
	Geetas husband thought he was in the clear because he made sure he was captured on CCTV in a pub at the time of the murder in November last year.         
	But detectives discovered that Harpreet had offered 5,000 for the killing (although there is no evidence the money was ever paid) and had been in phone contact with Sher hours before it took place.        
	He could not deny that he knew Sher because pictures emerged showing the two men dancing at a wedding in Punjab. Shers DNA was also found at the murder scene.        
	Police dredged a local canal and came up with the machete. It was Brazilian made and its sole UK supplier had sent a batch of 20 to a shop in Southall, where only three were sold. Checking the CCTV, police found footage of Harpreet buying the machete for 14 days before the murder.         
	CCTV footage from a bus confirmed Geeta was on her way to collect her sons minutes before she was set upon by her assailants.        
	Sentencing the gang, the judge, Justice Saunders, said: It was a pointless, cold-blooded killing of a woman about whom no-one except Aulakh had a bad word to say. His reason for wanting Geeta dead was that she had made it clear to him that she was determined to divorce him and he was not prepared to accept that and he was prepared to kill her to prevent it happening.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trial nod for diabetic drug with heart risks 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Trial nod for diabetic drug with heart risks 
          G. S. MUDUR                               
	New Delhi, May 30: Indias apex drug regulators have approved a clinical trial of a medicine that could expose diabetes patients to an increased risk of heart failure and possible death, medical experts have warned.         
	The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has approved a study in India that will be a part of an international clinical trial to examine the cardiovascular effects of treating diabetes patients with one of two drugs  rosiglitazone and pioglitazone.         
	Both drugs provide effective blood glucose control. But over the past three years, studies have indicated that rosiglitazone carries a higher risk of heart failure than pioglitazone. A joint statement last year from the American Diabetes Association and the European Diabetes Association had advised against the use of rosiglitazone in the control of diabetes.         
	But the clinical trial, supported by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline and planned at dozens of sites in 15 countries, including 10 cities in India, will test rosiglitazone and pioglitazone in men and women above 50 who have diabetes.         
	Medical experts in India and North America have described the clinical trial as unethical, arguing that it ignores accumulating evidence and a wealth of data that suggests rosiglitazone carries greater risk than pioglitazone.         
	It is most unethical and inhuman to administer a drug that is already known to be inferior to the molecule it is being compared with, said Chandra Gulhati, editor of the Monthly Index of Medical Specialities, India, an independent journal of medicines.         
	One objective of the study is to determine how much more harm one drug causes than the other drug, said Ruth Macklin, a professor of epidemiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York.         
	The trial may result in deliberately harming patients, who agree to volunteer for the trial, Macklin has said in a letter to the US Food and Drug Administration, asking for a halt to the trial.         
	A study led by David Juurlink, head of clinical pharmacology and toxicology at a medical centre in Toronto, Canada, last year had indicated that there could be one additional hospitalisation for heart failure for 120 patients prescribed rosiglitazone instead of pioglitazone, and one additional death for every 269 patients treated with rosiglitazone rather than pioglitzone.         
	A spokesperson for GlaxoSmithKline in Mumbai told The Telegraph that the study design directed by the US FDA had specifically required a comparison of rosiglitazone to pioglitazone.         
	The spokesperson said over 450 trial sites have had the trial protocol approved by ethics committees and added that the trial will provide the best-quality evidence to assess the safety and efficacy profiles of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone.         
	The trial had been approved for multiple sites in Canada, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, and the US, among other countries last year. The Washington DC-based Public Citizens Health Research Group has said extra sites were added this year in select developing countries  India, Chile, Columbia, Mexico, and Pakistan  in an apparent attempt to increase the enrolment of patients into the trial.         
	Medical ethicists have expressed concern for years that enrolling patients for controversial clinical trials is easier in India where patients may not ask detailed questions about the trial.         
	The Indian trial sites are in Bangalore, Karnal, Kottayam, Mumbai, Nasik, Pune, Trichy, and Vijayawada and two in Cochin. Weve begun identifying patients for enrolment, said Ganapati Bantwal, an endocrinologist at the St Johns Medical College Hospital, Bangalore, one of the principal investigators in India. But he declined to say whether patients had already been administered the drugs.         
	The approval of the trial in India by drug regulators and the ethics committee at the St Johns Medical College Hospital suggests that both ignored the mounting evidence against rosiglitazone, said Gulhati.         
	It appears neither Indias industry-friendly drug regulators nor the ethics committee at St Johns took into account studies between 2007 and 2010 that have pointed out the risks of rosiglitazone, he said.         
	The Public Citizens Health Research Group has said it is difficult to imagine that a patient would willingly participate in a trial involving a drug, which the ADA and the EDA have declared as having no role in the management of diabetes.         
	Who are the physicians who embarked on this study with the drugs known harmful effects? Macklin has asked in her letter to the US FDA. She said the study violates principles in every guidance document in research ethics.         
	I would find it bothersome to prescribe rosiglitazone when an alternative drug is available, said Ambrish Mithal, chairman of endocrinology at Medanta Medicine, a hospital in Gurgaon. But rosiglitazone is available as an approved drug  so there are probably other doctors who see it as okay to become involved in a clinical trial with this, Mithal added.

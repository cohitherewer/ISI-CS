          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 1: The Wildlife Society of Orissa (WSO) has demanded a CBI probe into the recent mass killings of elephants in Simlipal Tiger Reserve.        
	WSO has put forward its request in a letter to Union minister for environment and forests Jairam Ramesh.         
	A CBI investigation is required to know the role of field forest officers as to whether they connived with the poachers in at least four cases, there was an effort to destroy evidence by burning or burying the bones, WSO secretary Biswajit Mohanty said today.        
	The elephant census was being carried out in April when the news first came about the alleged mass poaching of elephants.        
	Though local forest staff had reported the death of one elephant, two poaching cases were discovered after a senior forest official visited the park and found the two carcasses on the basis of information provided by the honorary wildlife warden of Mayurbhanj district, Sanjukta Basa.        
	In May, Basa, on being allowed to enter the park, located four other carcasses. While two were burnt in an apparent bid to destroy evidence of poaching, the remains of the other two had been buried in order to avoid detection, Mohanty alleged.        
	Basa was not allowed to visit the core area of the park on April 30 despite having an order from a senior officer.         
	The CBI should also inquire into poaching of tigers since there are now strong doubts about the future of tigers in this reserve, Mohanty further alleged, saying: They could have been trapped or killed by poachers in the absence of adequate protection.

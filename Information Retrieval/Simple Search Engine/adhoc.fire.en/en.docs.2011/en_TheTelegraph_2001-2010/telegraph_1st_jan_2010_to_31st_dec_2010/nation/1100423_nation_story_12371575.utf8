          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 22: Bombay High Court today questioned why tax exemptions should be given to a cash-rich tournament like the IPL and asked the Indian cricket board to furnish details of the total income generated by the league from matches played in Maharashtra.         
	The directive came during the first hearing of a public interest litigation filed by Shiv Sena leader Subhash Desai earlier this week alleging that entertainment tax exemptions to the IPL had resulted in revenue losses to the state exchequer. The petition demanded that the state collect entertainment tax from the tournament organisers.         
	The division bench of Justice P.B. Majumdar and Justice Rajesh Ketkar asked both the BCCI and the IPL to hand over copies of their respective constitutions and memorandum of articles by April 26, the date of the next hearing.         
	The bench also told the IPL to maintain accounts of the three remaining matches  todays semi-final, Saturdays third place playoff and Sundays final at the DY Patil stadium in Navi Mumbai.        
	The judges asked the government pleader, Dhairyashil Nalavade, and BCCI lawyer Neha Bhide if the IPL was a profiteering activity, and demanded information about the internal structure of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) under which the IPL functions.         
	The IPL works as a sub-committee regulated by a governing council under the cricket board. The bench also asked for the ticket prices as the petition alleged that IPL tickets sell for as high as Rs 40,000.        
	The petition alleged that the Ashok Chavan cabinet had decided to levy entertainment tax on the IPL matches played in Maharashtra, but the decision had not been implemented. Government pleader Nalavade informed the court that a discussion on levying the tax did take place in the cabinet meeting on January 20 this year, but no decision had been taken.         
	The high court took serious note of the tax exemptions given to the IPL, which has been dubbed as cricketainment by the organisers because of the mix of cricket, glamour, fashion and big money. Is this an entertainment or a sports activity? If industrialists are party to it, why is special exemption being given by the state? This is a serious issue, the bench said.        
	It also took note of the consumption of electricity for the night matches, another issue raised in Desais petition.         
	Hours after the high court took the government to task, chief minister Chavan said his cabinet would soon decide on implementing the entertainment tax.

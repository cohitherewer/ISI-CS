	Islamabad, Oct. 21: Pakistan today said it planned to send a two-member judicial commission to India to question those who recorded Ajmal Kasabs confession, and Indian sources said New Delhi would have no objection to that.        
	The Pakistani commission wants to verify the statements of the additional chief metropolitan magistrate and the chief investigating officer of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks case.        
	It will also interview the paramedics who performed the autopsies on the bodies of Kasabs nine accomplices, whom the government quietly buried last year.        
	A top government official in Delhi said: We have not been informed anything officially.... If they are sending people, we have no problems.        
	However, he said the Pakistani commission would be allowed to speak to the magistrate and chief investigator but not to cross-examine them, that is, challenge their statements.        
	Pakistani officials are presently working out the scope, mandate and the terms of reference of the commission, foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Basit said in Islamabad. He said the commission would visit New Delhi as soon as India agreed to these details.        
	Interior minister Rehman Malik had floated the proposal of the commissions visit during a phone conversation with home minister P. Chidambaram in August.        
	A Pakistani anti-terrorist court, which is trying seven suspects accused by India of involvement in the Mumbai attacks, had directed the interior ministry to ensure the availability of Indian officials who had interrogated Kasab and recorded his statements.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Chandigarh, Feb. 16: Inmates of jails in Punjab will be allowed to spend a week with their spouse once a year in a specially designed suite.         
	The plan is the brainchild of jail minister Hira Singh Gabria of the Shiromani Akali Dal.         
	Work on building the special suites has begun in Kapurthala and Faridkot district jails. Convicts starved of social interaction and sex frequently turn violent and take to drugs and sodomy. Making them spend time with their spouses will help in warding off evil thoughts, a jail ministry official said.         
	Each suite will have a bedroom, a lobby, a kitchen and a bathroom.         
	The prisoners should be given this facility where they can stay with their wives and even children on the jail premises after a fixed period, the official said.         
	The convicts, however, will require to have a record of good conduct, to be able to avail themselves of the facility.         
	Special arrangements will be made for those who have not been able to consummate their marriage.         
	Preference will be given to those inmates who have been given long sentences.         
	Despite a total capacity to lodge 12,000 convicts, Punjab jails have nearly 16,000 inmates.         
	We are working out the modalities and it will take over six months to put things in place. Prisoners should put their past behind and become good citizens after their release. Spending time with their spouses will help control frustrations, the official remarked.

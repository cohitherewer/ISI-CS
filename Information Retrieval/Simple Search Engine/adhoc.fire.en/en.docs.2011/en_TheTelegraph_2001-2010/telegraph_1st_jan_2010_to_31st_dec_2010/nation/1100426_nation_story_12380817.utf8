The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak wants Kasab handed over
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pak wants Kasab handed over
          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, April 25: Pakistans turn came today to ask India to hand over two 26/11 accused  including Ajmal Kasab.        
	Islamabad delivered six dossiers to New Delhi, asking it to send across Kasab and his alleged Indian accomplice Fahim Ansari, as well as the Indian police officers who had recorded their statements.        
	The dossiers were handed over to Indias deputy high commissioner in Islamabad, foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Basit said. We have shared information about the progress achieved so far in the ongoing (Pakistani) probe into the Mumbai attacks and answered Indias queries through these dossiers.        
	Basit said the dossiers asked New Delhi to hand over Kasab and Ansari so that proceedings can continue in a Pakistani anti-terror court that is trying seven 26/11 suspects accused by India.         
	Asked if India could hand over the duo in the absence of an extradition treaty, Basit said it was possible on a case-to-case basis.        
	On April 17, the Pakistani anti-terror court had authorised its Federal Investigation Agency to issue arrest warrants against Kasab and Ansari. One possible reason could be that Kasabs statement to Indian police has been ruled inadmissible in Pakistani courts.

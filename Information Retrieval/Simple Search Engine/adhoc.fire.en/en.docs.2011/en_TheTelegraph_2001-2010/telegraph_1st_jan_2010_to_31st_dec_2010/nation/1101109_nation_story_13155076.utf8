	Nov. 8: The anti-talks faction of militant outfit NDFB allegedly gunned down 18 people in Assam today, hours after security forces shot dead one of its cadres and a week after the group threatened to kill 20 Indians for every member killed in fake encounters.         
	A youth belonging to the outfit stopped a bus in a forest in Sonitpur district. Two of his accomplices forced seven passengers to get off. The seven were lined up by the three militants and shot dead, a police officer said. The victims have not been identified yet.         
	In another attack at Sonitpurs Belsiri, six militants on three motorcycles fired at a barber shop and an adjoining eatery, killing five people. Most of those killed were from Bihar.        
	A 30-year-old woman was also shot dead in another part of the district.         
	Around 6.30pm, militants gunned down Mohan Das, 70, and his wife Sakuntala at their home in Baksa district.         
	One-and-a-half hours later, NDFB terrorists in fatigues opened fire in a slum in Karbi Anglong district, killing one person.

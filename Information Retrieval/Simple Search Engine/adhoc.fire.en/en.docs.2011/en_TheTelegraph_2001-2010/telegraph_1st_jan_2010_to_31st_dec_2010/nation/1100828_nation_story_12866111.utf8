The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MPs united on pay hike, divided on process 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      MPs united on pay hike, divided on process 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: MPs were divided today on whether they should give up the privilege of deciding their own salaries, and some of them even objected to suggestions about forgoing the daily allowance if House business was disrupted.        
	Instead, as they united in the Lok Sabha to pass the salary hike bill, non-communist MPs mocked the hypocrisy of Left members, who walked out protesting the raise that comes at a time ordinary people are under the cosh of inflation.        
	Perhaps it was the popular mood against the hike that prompted many members to demand that an independent mechanism be set up to decide on MPs salary. BJP leader L.K. Advani asked the Centre to announce the mechanism before the session ended on August 31.        
	But parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal demurred, saying many questions needed to be addressed first.        
	On whom should we place the right to determine our salary? Should that recommendation be brought to Parliament again... should the principle of no-work, no-pay be accepted? All these require wider consultation.        
	Those opposed to an independent mechanism asked how officials could be allowed to decide MPs salary.        
	When some speakers said MPs should forfeit the daily allowance if the House was adjourned and no work was done, others argued they should not be punished for someone elses misadventures.        
	The House is adjourned usually because five to ten MPs create trouble. How can 500 MPs be punished for that? went the refrain.        
	Rashtriya Janata Dal member Raghuvansh Prasad Singh went a step further, saying: At times I feel satisfied that I have done well when the House gets adjourned on an issue concerning the people.        
	Most members demanded a higher pension for former MPs  perhaps to insure against a rainy day for themselves  but the Centre nixed the proposal.        
	The Left MPs left the House to a chorus of jao jao (go, go) and with taunts of double standards ringing in their ears.        
	Trinamul Congress member Sudip Bandopadhyay mockingly appealed to the Left not to draw the enhanced amount. He said the Left had, during its three-decade rule in Bengal, raised MLAs salaries at least six times.        
	We disapprove of this hypocritical attitude. This is double standards, Sudip said.        
	Raghuvansh claimed that he too had initially thought the Left was correct in saying that fighting for ones own salary was indecent.        
	But I thought about it seriously and asked myself whether I was going to accept the cheque for an enhanced salary or not. If I protest now and draw the whole salary, wont that (amount to) double standards?        
	Raghuvansh added: This isnt the first time Parliament is hiking MPs salary; that is mandated by the Constitution. The Left always protests and walks out. Then they are the first to queue up for the salary. I pity them as most of their money is taken away by the party.

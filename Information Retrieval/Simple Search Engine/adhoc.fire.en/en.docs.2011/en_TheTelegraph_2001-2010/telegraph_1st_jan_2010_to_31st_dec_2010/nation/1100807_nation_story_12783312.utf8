The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Team Bengal toys with rift ploy
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Team Bengal toys with rift ploy
  - State CPM leaders want to play on differences between Trinamul amp; Congress        ANINDYA SENGUPTA                          Karat                                      
	Vijayawada, Aug. 6: Bengal CPM leaders gathered for the extended central committee meeting starting here tomorrow are wondering whether the central leaderships unremitting anti-Congress line will serve them in next years state polls.        
	The murmurs, not new in the Bengal unit, have come at a time general secretary Prakash Karat expects colleagues at the conclave to back his approach of attacking the Congress-led UPA government and its neo-liberal policies.        
	Sources said a section of the state leaders wants to raise the issue at the four-day session  convened to review the tactical line after the party dumped the Congress-led UPA-I in 2008 over the US nuclear deal  when a separate resolution on Bengal is to be placed. The resolution will outline the current political situation in the state and the challenges the CPM faces ahead the Assembly elections.        
	The Bengal leaders believe they should be allowed to play up the differences between allies Congress and Trinamul. They feel, for instance, that they ought to campaign against Mamata Banerjees insistence on withdrawal of central forces from Maoist-infested Lalgarh. The aim should be to highlight the fact that her demand contrasts with Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs stance that the rebels are the countrys biggest internal security threat.        
	We are not against Karats anti-Congress line, particularly when food inflation and the hike in petroleum prices have hit common people. Let our agitation against the Congress at the Centre continue. But considering our electoral prospects, now that we have lost one election after another, our task should be to create a rift between the Congress and Trinamul. We should exploit issues on which Mamata Banerjee doesnt see eye to eye with the Congress, said a CPM state committee member, sitting in a Vijayawada hotel.        
	The leader said the aim should be to try to bring the Congress on our (the CPMs) side on issues where it has differences with Trinamul. We need to conduct a campaign in village after village that the allies do not share a common agenda.        
	A central committee member confirmed that there would be a separate discussion on Bengal at the meeting. There will definitely be a discussion on Bengal affairs. A separate resolution on Bengal will come up. Therefore, our leaders can raise electoral issues and, if necessary, the need for a separate strategy.         
	But politburo member B.V. Raghuvulu appeared to play down the reservations about the anti-Congress line, saying the main adversary in Bengal should be identified first. Bengal will be facing polls next year and deserves importance in the discussions. Its not a question of anti-Congressism. Our main rival in Bengal has to be identified. What the election strategy will be can be decided accordingly, Raghuvulu told The Telegraph.        
	The draft political resolution to be tabled at tomorrows session, however, says the key task is to fight against the whole gamut of neo-liberal policies the Congress-led UPA government has pursued.         
	Bengal CPM leaders who were opposed to the partys withdrawal of support to UPA-I want the pullout to be discussed again. Although there were local issues, we suffered badly (in recent elections) because of the Congress-Trinamul alliance that was struck after we withdrew our support to the Congress. We would be happy if the issue is raised, said another leader.

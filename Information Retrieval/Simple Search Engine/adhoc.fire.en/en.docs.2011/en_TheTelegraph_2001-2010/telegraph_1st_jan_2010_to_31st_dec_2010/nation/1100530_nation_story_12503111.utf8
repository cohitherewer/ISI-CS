          OUR BUREAU                              
	May 29: Bengal police chief Bhupinder Singh today said that about a dozen Maoists had come in a white pick-up van to sabotage the railway tracks at Rajabandh yesterday.        
	We learnt from local farmers that the group of rebels had come in the white pick-up van. We also suspect that two Maoists, who were released on bail recently, led the sabotage team, the director-general of police said.         
	Although Singh did not name anyone, police sources said the two recently released Maoists are Bapi and Umakanta.        
	The FIR lodged by the Jnaneswari Express driver, Bibhoy Kumar Das, yesterday with the Government Railway Police at Jhargram makes no mention of Maoists. The FIR just lists his version of events.        
	Das said in the FIR that he had heard an explosion and saw smoke under the engine around 1.12am, a GRP officer said. Immediately after the explosion, the train got derailed and before anyone had time to react, it was hit by a goods train, the FIR said.         
	Additional director-general of railways, Dilip Mitra, said the driver also mentioned that he saw smoke under the engine after the explosion. The driver also mentioned that there was a jerk after the explosion, said Mitra.        
	The case would be handed over to CID for investigation, Mitra added.        
	The FIR was lodged for causing damage to railway property and under the explosives act.         
	Singh ruled out possibility of any blast.         
	There was no visible sign of any explosion. If there was an explosion under the train there would have been a fire. The driver has mentioned he heard a sound (of explosion) and saw smoke. Crackers may have been burst to alert those engaged in the sabotage. If there was any explosion then there would have been a big crater, Singh said.         
	Das mentioned in the FIR that he got down from the engine after the goods train crashed into the derailed compartments.         
	His FIR did not mention the posters of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities found at the spot.

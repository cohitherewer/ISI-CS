          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 3: Poor budgetary expenditure has been a cause of headache for the state government with less than a month left for the end of this fiscal.        
	An official review revealed that the government departments had been able to spend only 56 per cent of budgetary allocations on an average by January-end.        
	Interestingly, the steel and mines department tops the laggard departments showing the lowest expenditure of 5 per cent, followed by co-operation department (7 per cent) and revenue (10 per cent).        
	Against this backdrop, chief secretary T.K. Mishra reviewed the expenditure position and asked the secretaries to expedite spending of funds. He even directed the officials of the laggard departments not to ask for more funds.

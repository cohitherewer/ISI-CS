	New Delhi, Sept. 7: The cabinet decided to adopt the legislative route and bring a new enemy property bill broadly enshrining all the articulated concerns in Parliaments winter session.           
	According to a home ministry release, that is piloting the proposed legislation, the bill will incorporate the original ordinance as well as the official amendments. The government hopes to take care of the conflicting interests of the legal heirs of the enemy properties as well as those of the custodians/tenants. Union home minister P. Chidambaram and the other ministers, who rooted for a new ordinance on enemy property, were overruled in a meeting of the cabinet today.                   
	New Delhi (PTI): The government on Tuesday agreed to open the doors of the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER) for students passing out of International Baccalaureate schools, but has decided not to tinker with the existing course pattern of the IISERs. The decision has been taken at a meeting chaired by the HRD minister Kapil Sibal and also attended by the directors of the five IISER institutes.

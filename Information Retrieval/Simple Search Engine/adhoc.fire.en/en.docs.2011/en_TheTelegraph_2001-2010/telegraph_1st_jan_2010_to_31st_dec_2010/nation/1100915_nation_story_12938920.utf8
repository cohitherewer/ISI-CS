          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Congress has put off zonal conferences to mark its 125th anniversary in the east and north possibly for fear of disturbances in the wake of the September 24 Ayodhya verdict.        
	The east zone meet was to be held in Calcutta on September 25 and the north zone one in Mohali on September 27.        
	The party officially claimed the conferences had been put off because of unusually heavy rain in both regions, but sources said the real reason was the fear of a disturbed political and social atmosphere. Allahabad High Court is due to decide the title suit on the disputed Ayodhya site, which is being claimed by both Hindu and Muslim groups.        
	Sources said the Congress may have blamed the cancellations on the rain because no party can formally say it is expecting trouble after a court verdict, particularly when it can affect communal amity in the country.        
	Besides, the Congress, which is heading the government at the Centre, is expected to create an atmosphere that inspires peoples confidence.        
	The Congress has called a meeting on September 16 to assess the ground situation ahead of the verdict. The Centre has put security measures in place, but the party too is preparing to face the political consequences.        
	The Calcutta conference will be held only after Durga Puja. No new date has been fixed for the north-zone conference.

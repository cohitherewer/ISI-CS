	New Delhi, Aug. 2: Once accused of scientific rigging, the CPM is crying foul over rigged voter lists.        
	CPM leaders Sitaram Yechury and Basudeb Acharya will call on the Election Commission tomorrow to submit a memorandum alleging that fake voters are finding their way into Bengals election rolls.        
	Such complaints generally come from the Opposition, not a ruling party, but the CPMs allegation follows a series of poll reverses in the state it has ruled uninterrupted for 33 years.        
	We have got an appointment with the Election Commission tomorrow. It is a very serious matter. Thousands of fake voters are making it to the voter list through false affidavits. The number of applications for inclusion of names is two to three times more than last year, Acharya, the partys leader in the Lok Sabha, told The Telegraph.        
	In the last six Assembly polls, it was the CPM that had faced serious allegations of scientific rigging.        
	CPM leaders said the state election office was accepting false affidavits. Officers in the state election office are working like cadres of Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress and accepting applications based on false affidavits, said a party source.        
	Told about the allegation, Trinamul chief whip in the Lok Sabha Sudip Bandopadhyay lashed out at the CPM. They (the CPM) are past masters of scientific rigging. During their long rule they have included the names of even dead voters. This time none of their tricks will work.        
	Sources said the memorandum, without mentioning Trinamul, would accuse some of Bengals leading political parties of pushing in the fake names in collusion with state election officials.        
	CPM leaders said the state unit had on July 29 submitted a memorandum to the chief electoral officer. Now the central leaders will take it up with the chief election commissioner.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 14: The Orissa government will ask those who had fled Kandhamal during and after the 2008 communal violence to return to their villages and assured them security, if necessary.        
	The government will come out with advertisements in various newspapers with an appeal to this effect.        
	A review was undertaken by the chief minister following the visit of a delegation of European diplomats to the riot-scarred district.        
	The delegation had observed that several riot-affected people in Kandhamal were still scared to go back to their village and were staying in temporary shelters. Fifteen months after they were uprooted, thousands still live in makeshift shanties along the road and in the forests with no seeming hope of rehabilitation, the archbishop of Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese, Raphael Cheenath, said recently.         
	Sources said the chief minister asked the district officials to restore confidence of the riot victims by providing them security, if needed, and redress their grievances at the local level. It was also decided that those who were scared to go back to their villages out of fear would be provided security and would be rehabilitated. There would be toll-free telephone numbers to help the victims communicate with the police and district administration. Those who are reluctant to go back to their respective villages will be resettled at Nandagiri near G. Udaygiri.         
	The chief minister also directed the officials to expedite implementation of the package of schemes announced for the development of violence-ravaged Kandhamal district.        
	During the discussion, the officials clarified that the administration had not sought any financial aid from the visiting European delegation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 5-year rule for colleges

	New Delhi, May 10: Colleges seeking affiliation to any university in the country will need to first serve a five-year probation and commit a dedicated fund under new legally binding regulations that threaten errant varsities with the withdrawal of funding.        
	The regulations, circulated by the UGC to all universities last week, are the first binding rules governing which institutions can seek affiliation to universities as colleges.        
	Although colleges must be affiliated to universities for their students to be eligible for degrees under the UGC Act, the commission has till now governed affiliation through isolated directives issued from time to time.         
	But the UGC (affiliation of colleges to universities) regulations, accessed by The Telegraph, has now put in place a uniform affiliation regime that all full-fledged universities will need to follow. Deemed universities cannot affiliate colleges.         
	Till now, each university was effectively following its own rules on affiliation. It was a free for all, a senior government official said.         
	Under the new regulations, institutions seeking affiliation as colleges must meet a set of norms on land, classroom size and facilities, toilets, libraries, canteens, sports facilities, separate common rooms and hostels for boys and girls.        
	The institution seeking the status of an affiliated college must show evidence of a fund of Rs 15 lakh per programme it plans to offer for courses in the humanities and commerce. The corpus requirement will be Rs 35 lakh per professional programme the aspiring college wants to offer.         
	But even after meeting the slew of conditions required under the regulations, an institution will initially be granted only temporary affiliation. Only a college temporarily affiliated to a university for at least five years can apply for permanent affiliation  which a varsity can grant after inspecting the college and ensuring that it meets all norms.        
	The UGC has frequently been criticised for not using its clout as a funding agency to punish universities that flout norms. The new regulations explicitly threaten universities with withdrawal of funding.

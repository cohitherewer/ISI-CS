	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 12: Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama today inaugurated a 75ft, five-storey Rigon Thupten Mindolling monastery, billed as one of the biggest in south Asia, at Chandragiri Tibetan settlement in Gajapati district, around 300km from here.        
	Named Padma Sambhav Mahavihara, the colossal monastery  built at a cost of Rs 8 crore and spread over an area of 10 acres  was thrown open after the Dalai Lama conducted consecration ceremony this morning.         
	Nearly 2,500 guests from across the world witnessed the inaugural.        
	The Tibetan spiritual leader prostrated before the 21ft golden Buddha idol installed at the shrine and offered prayers in the presence of around 300 monks. Later in the afternoon, he addressed the gathering in Tibetan.        
	Chandragiri, called as Phuntsokling by Tibetan refugees as it means the land of happiness and plenty, is now a mini-Tibet. During the Chinese aggression of Tibet in 1959, these refugees had crossed over to India and had been resettled there. The place has four Tibetan refugee camps housing around 4,000.        
	Sitting pretty against the backdrop of hills and luxuriant tropical forest, the beautiful monastery greets visitors with colourful flags with dragons and inscribed prayers fluttering in the air.        
	It took more than six years to complete the monastery, the proposal for which was mooted during the Dalai Lamas visit in 2003-04. Initially, it was a wooden structure, which has been converted into a permanent edifice.        
	The mammoth structure will not just serve religious purposes but also double as an educational institution on the Buddhist philosophy. Around 200 Buddhist lamas will stay there and receive education and training, said Gyetrul Jigme Rinpoche, the head abbot at Chandragiri.        
	The complex comprises a mediation hall, administrative quarters, assembly hall of the lamas, chapels, shrines and a huge library of Buddhist scriptures.        
	The monastery, built in the Atanpuri style of Nalanda architecture, has been named after Acharya Padmasambhav, who was born in Orissa and believed to have spread Buddhism to Tibet in the 7th century.                     
	Statues of Padmasambhaba and Avalokiteswara were installed on either side of the huge Buddha idol. While rocks, wood, cement and earth have been used as the primary building materials, snow lions, dragons and garuda besides incarnations of the Buddha are the main motifs painted on the walls inside the mediation hall.        
	The mammoth structure  which can be compared to Indias largest monastery in Arunachal Pradeshs Tawang and another in Bomdilla  has been constructed by about 200 architects and workers from Bhutan, Tibet and Nepal.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 29: Leaders of the Left and other non-BJP opposition parties today decided to call on President Pratibha Patil to put pressure on the government for a joint parliamentary committee probe into the spectrum scam.         
	The leaders said they would urge Patil to advise the government to accept their demand for a JPC probe end the Parliament impasse.         
	We are all concerned about the continued disruption of Parliament and it is due to the obdurate attitude of the government in rejecting a JPC probe. Thereby we have decided to meet the President and urge her to advise the government, CPI leader D. Raja said after a meeting in Parliament.         
	The leaders said they had sought time tomorrow from the President, who returns to Delhi tonight after an official visit to the UAE and Syria.         
	The Left has joined hands with secular opposition parties like the AIADMK, Telugu Desam and the Janata Dal (S) to distance themselves from the BJP.

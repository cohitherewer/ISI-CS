The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BCCI Dharamshala date 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BCCI Dharamshala date 
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, April 15: Indian crickets top bosses are planning a weekend getaway to Dharamshala, but not to soak in the spiritual essence of the land of the Dalai Lama.        
	Instead, in this season of sweat equity, they would sweat on matters more earthly  like the IPL mess. Sources in the BCCI said the board top brass, clearly cheesed off with IPL boss Lalit Modi for tweeting the shareholding pattern in the Kochi franchise, would discuss ways to control the damage.        
	The ostensible reason for the trip to the picturesque Himachal hill station is a cricket match between a Media XI and an MPs XI. But while cricketer-turned politicians Mohammad Azharuddin, Navjot Sidhu and Kirti Azad would pad up for the April 17 friendly squeezed in between two IPL matches at the newly constructed Dharamshala cricket stadium, more serious stuff is on the agenda on the sidelines. A source close to the cricket board said the members, including Arun Jaitley, Rajiv Shukla and board chief Shashank Manohar, who are likely to leave for Dharamshala tomorrow afternoon, would discuss issues related to the upcoming IPL governing council meeting.        
	BCCI board members are scheduled to meet for a finance committee meeting on April 23 and a working committee meeting on April 24. But the source said they were also planning to hold the governing council meeting around the same time. But before the council meeting, the source added, the board members want to finalise their strategy on the IPL controversy and Modi. The source said the members wanted to project a united front and have their facts in order as they took on the allegations made by the consortium against Modi.        
	One of the allegations made by Rendezvous Sports, which is part of the consortium that successfully bid for the Kochi IPL franchise, is that Modi had offered them $50 million to withdraw from the race.        
	The IPL commissioner rebutted the charge and threatened legal action.

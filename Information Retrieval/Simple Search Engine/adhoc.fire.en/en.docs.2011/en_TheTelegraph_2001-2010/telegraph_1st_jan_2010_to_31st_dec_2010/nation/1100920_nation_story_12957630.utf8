	New Delhi, Sept. 19: The human resource development ministry is planning to set up colleges, Kendriya Vidyalayas, secondary schools and girls hostels in Naxalite-affected areas.        
	The ministrys higher education department, in a letter written on August 20, has asked the home ministry for details of Naxalite-hit areas.        
	The information will help in planning how and where to set up new institutions. We will also explore how to provide more grants to institutions in those areas through the existing schemes of the University Grants Commission (UGC), an official source said.        
	The ministry is also about to start a scheme to set up 374 degree colleges in educationally backward districts. We hope that the Naxalite-affected districts are covered by the scheme. If any district is left out, a separate development plan for educational infrastructure would be prepared, the source said.        
	Altogether 35 districts in the country are Naxalite-affected.        
	The HRD ministrys department for elementary education and literacy has also given priority to these districts under recently launched schemes such as the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), Model Schools and the Girls Hostel Programme.        
	As many as 384 schools have been approved for the Naxalite-affected districts in 2009-10 under the RMSA, which aims at universalising secondary education in the country by 2020. Under the Model School Programme, 32 schools out of the 327 sanctioned in 2009-10 are located in these districts and another 21 are proposed to be set up in seven districts in Chhattisgarh. Forty-four girls hostels have been sanctioned.        
	Under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the government has included these areas in the Special Focus Districts and is giving more funds for the creation of new primary schools, maintenance of existing infrastructure and providing other facilities in schools.         
	The expenditure on construction can be up to 50 per cent of the total funds allocated under SSA in these districts. The ministry also plans to set up more Kendriya Vidyalayas in the affected areas.

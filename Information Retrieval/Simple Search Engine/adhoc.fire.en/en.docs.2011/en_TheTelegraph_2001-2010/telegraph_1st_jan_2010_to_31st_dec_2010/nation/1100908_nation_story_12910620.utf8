          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: The Supreme Court has said a school can dispense with an inquiry as mandated by law while dismissing a teacher accused of misbehaving with students.        
	The court upheld an appeal by Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan against a Calcutta High Court order setting aside the dismissal of music teacher Rathin Pal, who was accused of misbehaving with five Class V girls of Kendriya Vidyalaya, NTPC Farakka.        
	The school principal initially referred the case to a nine-member teachers panel, which found that the girls statements tallied with the complaints made earlier. Another two-member panel also examined the charges. Two parents complained that Pal had threatened the girls.        
	The KV regional office in Calcutta then decided to dispense with an inquiry under the education code and sack Pal.        
	It is evident that Pal is prima facie guilty of exhibition of immoral sexual behaviour towards girl students of Class V. This is a situation where it is not expedient to hold a regular inquiry as it will cause serious embarrassment to the students and parents and would also vitiate the atmosphere of the school, it recorded.        
	Pal challenged the order in central administrative tribunal, which held against him, saying it was unbelievable that Class V students would conspire against the teacher.        
	But the high court overturned the order in December 2007, saying a summary inquiry should have been held before Pals dismissal. It set aside his termination with the direction that he be reinstated with 40 per cent back wages. But the top court rejected this.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: The Prime Ministers Office (PMO) today said Manmohan Singh had not pulled up ministers involved in the Commonwealth Games and only encouraged them to work together to make it a success.        
	The clarification added that he asked the Group of Ministers on the Games to work extra time.        
	The PMO described the reports in a section of media The Telegraph had also carried a report  as misleading.        
	Sources said the Prime Minister did not want to create a public impression of ministerial discord or failure. A source explained: The Prime Minister would not like to publicly humiliate his ministers in the middle of such an assignment. Whatever he said to them behind the closed doors was not for public consumption.        
	Another PMO source said: The Prime Minister is too much of a gentleman to allow his ministers to be derided publicly. They are doing a job and the Prime Minister wants them to achieve better results. This should not be presented as if he blasted the ministers. The sources, however, did not contest the thrust of the reports that the Prime Minister was unhappy and he expressed his displeasure before the ministers.

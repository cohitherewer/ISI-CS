          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                        Nirupama    
	Koderma, May 5: Three doctors have been showcaused for not preserving the viscera and foetus of Nirupama Pathak, the 23-year-old journalist whose death is being seen as a case of honour killing.        
	The civil surgeon of Koderma in Jharkhand today issued the notices to the doctors.        
	Police accused the doctors of handing over the body to the Pathaks without their consent  an allegation civil surgeon P. Mohan denied.         
	Nirupama, who used to work with an English business daily in Delhi, was found dead at her Chitragupta Nagar Colony home in Koderma on April 29. Her family had initially claimed that she was electrocuted, but the autopsy report revealed that she had been smothered and she was 12 weeks pregnant.        
	The police suspect that her family killed her as they did not approve of her relationship with a former batchmate, Priyabhanshu Ranjan, who belongs to a lower caste.         
	I had instructed the doctors, Sheo Kumar, K.P. Singh and Ashish Kumar, in writing to preserve the viscera and the foetus. But they failed to do so. They also did not mention the time of Nirupamas death in the post-mortem report. This is a serious lapse, Mohan said,        
	He quoted the doctors as telling him that the walls of Nirupamas stomach were clear and finding no symptom of poisoning, they didnt preserve the viscera.         
	Mohan said it seemed at least three persons had executed the murder.        
	Nirupamas father Dharmendra Pathak, a bank manager in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh, and two brothers, Samrendra Pathak, an income tax inspector in Mumbai, and Salil Saurabh, a PhD scholar in Hyderabad, have been asked to stay back in Koderma. Her mother has been arrested.

	Jamshedpur, May 15: In a bid to control rampant crime in railway areas, the Jamshedpur railway police has formed a quick response (QR) team comprising armed and lathi-wielding men.        
	A brainchild of superintendent of railway police (Tatanagar) Jeetendra Prasad Singh, the 12-member team was formed recently. The outfit is headed by a sub-inspector and also comprises assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) and constables.        
	The team is basically a rushing party. Its primary task is to respond quickly to any crime happening in their areas of our jurisdiction, J. Kerketta, deputy superintendent of police (Tatanagar), said.        
	According to him, sub-inspector Vinod Kumar Singh has been appointed head of the team. The team also includes ASIs and constables. Havildars have also been included in the party. Four members each comprise the armed and lathi party, Kerketta said, adding they were confident that crime in railway areas would be controlled with this initiative.        
	The DSP said the QR team becomes active as soon as a crime is reported from an area. Information regarding crime is relayed to the team from the control room. We are very particular to see that no time is wasted in relaying the information (to the QR team) as soon as they come from the eight-odd police stations operating under Jamshedpur rail police, Kerketta said.        
	The police stations are Jamshedpur, Chandil, Chakradharpur, Dangwaposi, Hatia, Ranchi, Bokaro and Muri.         
	Though its a large area the forces are confident of tackling the situation. The basic idea is to not delay matters as far as attending to a criminal incident is concerned. If needed, the team may be expanded, Kerketta added.        
	The QR team will also be involved in attending to naxal-related incidents. If required, the team will also rush with food and medicines to spots of Naxalite incidents. The whole idea is to rush help to the victims, an official said, adding the jawans in the team have been specifically instructed not to delay sending help to Naxalite-sensitive railway stations.        
	Moreover, the QR outfit is also working towards keeping a tab on platform crimes. Bag snatching, pick-pocketing and other crimes is quite common on platforms. The QR team will also respond to those who fall victims to such crimes. It will provide all possible help to the victims, a rail police official said.

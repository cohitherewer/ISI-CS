	Kathmandu, Jan. 15: Indian foreign minister S.M. Krishna began his three-day visit to Nepal on a positive note today by promising a review of the controversial Indo-Nepal Treaty of 1950.        
	Nepal foreign minister Sujata Koirala told reporters after talks with Krishna that he had responded positively to her suggestion for a review of the treaty, and that the two countries foreign secretaries had been asked to work out the modalities.        
	Krishna, who is accompanied by foreign secretary Nirupama Rao, met Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal in the evening.         
	Tomorrow, he is to meet President Ram Baran Yadav, Nepali Congress chief G.P. Koirala and Maoist supremo Prachanda, among others. The meeting with Prachanda is expected to be interesting as the Maoists have stepped up their anti-India rhetoric.        
	Police arrested the chief of the United Nepal National Front, Phanindra Nepal, when he led a black-flag demonstration against Krishnas visit at the main gate of the Kathmandu airport.

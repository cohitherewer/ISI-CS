          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 8: Government health centres across India may screen 70 million people for diabetes, high blood pressure and heart diseases over the next two years under a programme to reduce deaths and illnesses from chronic diseases.         
	The cabinet committee on economic affairs today approved a Rs 1,230-crore plan to implement the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke up to 2012.         
	The programme will train government doctors to screen people above 30 years, visit government clinics and prescribe preventive health tips to patients at risk and their families.         
	It will also launch health education campaigns to improve dietary habits, increase physical exercise and reduce the consumption of tobacco and alcohol among public.         
	The health ministry said the programme would be implemented through 32,000 trained health personnel in 20,000 health subcentres and 700 community health centres in 100 districts across 15 states.         
	The health personnel will be asked to screen patients opportunistically  patients attending a clinic for other complaints such as a fever or a throat infection would also be offered the screening tests.         
	The states are yet to be picked but were likely to select large states with high patient loads, a senior health ministry official told The Telegraph. The focus is prevention and early diagnosis to reduce illness and deaths.        
	Doctors caution that such screening may also lead to potentially vexing situations in which a patient diagnosed with a serious condition finds that the health centre lacks facilities or resources for treatment.         
	Thats why early diagnosis is crucial  many chronic conditions can be managed with modest resources or just through lifestyle changes if detected early, a doctor associated with the programme said.         
	Medical studies suggest that about half of all annual deaths in India are because of non-communicable diseases, mainly diabetes, heart diseases, cancer and stroke. About 10 per cent of the adult population may have high blood pressure, the official said.         
	The 100-district, 15-state initiative will be a vastly expanded version of a pilot programme launched in January 2008 in 10 districts from 10 states. But sources said the impact of that pilot is yet to be fully evaluated.         
	Doctors in public health centres are not used to managing chronic diseases, the focus so far has been acute care, said Shifalika Goenka, a faculty member at the Indian Institute of Public Health, Gurgaon.         
	The programme outlay has two components  Rs 499 crore for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and Rs 730 crore for cancer control.         
	The Union will provide 80 per cent, while states are expected to cover the rest.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: Six Indian science academies have jointly recommended limited release of genetically modified brinjal for cultivation accompanied by surveillance for short, medium, and long-term health effects, if any.         
	The academies have said there does not seem to exist any reasonable doubt on the biosafety of GM brinjal, but post-marketing surveillance after limited release would address public concerns as well as doubly ensure biosafety.         
	India should view GM crops as an important component of the food security strategy, but they are not a panacea, the academies said in a report produced at the request of the Union environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh.         
	The academies have also called for the creation of mechanisms to review performance of GM crops and to conduct surveillance for health effects.         
	In this field, public perceptions are as important as scientific facts, said M. Vijayan, president of the Indian National Science Academy, and Homi Bhabha professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.         
	Such new mechanisms will be necessary to help build public confidence, he said.         
	Ramesh had earlier this year imposed a moratorium on the release of GM brinjal that had been approved by Indias apex panel on genetically engineered products amid oppositions by sections of scientists and environmental activists.

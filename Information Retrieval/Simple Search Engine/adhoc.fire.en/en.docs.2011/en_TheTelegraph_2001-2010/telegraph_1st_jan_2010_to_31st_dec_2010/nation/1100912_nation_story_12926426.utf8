The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ayodhya caution to BJP states
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ayodhya caution to BJP states
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 11: BJP-ruled states have been told by the partys central leaders not to let law and order spiral out of control in the prelude to and the aftermath of the Ayodhya judgment.         
	The chief ministers have been told that they must be even-handed while identifying and acting against troublemakers and saboteurs, regardless of whether they were Hindus or Muslims.         
	The only problem, admitted a source in the Madhya Pradesh government, was in handling elements from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal if they were up to mischief.         
	Sources here said the leaders were aware of the fact that if things became unmanageable and communal riots erupted, the consequences would be particularly bad for the BJP governments of Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, classified as potential violence-prone states with an unfriendly dispensation in Delhi.         
	Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand  that have a relatively small Muslim populations  were not on the radar of concern yet.         
	We recalled the experience of December 1992, a leader said. Shortly after the Babri mosque was demolished, the Centre dismissed the BJP governments of Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi.         
	The BJP cried foul and played the martyr in the elections to these states a year later. The campaign backfired because Delhi was the only state to vote the BJP back to power.         
	Out of power in the Centre for two terms and struggling to insulate its state governments against all kinds of problems of the chief ministers making and Delhis instigation, the last thing the BJP wants is to see them felled in one stroke.         
	An aide of Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa told The Telegraph: The chief minister has put the state on high alert. Our political opponents and certain over-eager organisations of the Sangh parivar will have to be reined in. We may resort to preventive arrests.         
	Asked if Yeddyurappa could come down on the VHP and Bajrang Dal activists, considering he took his time to act against the Sri Rama Sene that had assaulted Christians and desecrated churches, the aide said: Theres a directive this time from our Delhi bosses.         
	While there was no word from any official contacted in Gujarat on Narendra Modis plans, Rajkot-based RSS functionary Praveen Maniar claimed: The Sangh and VHP will not create trouble for the government.         
	Sources said Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan was a bit edgy. He still doesnt have a measure of how things will pan out, a BJP source said.

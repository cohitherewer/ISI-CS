                                      Amitabh Bachchan      
	Mumbai, May 4 (PTI): Actor Amitabh Bachchan has developed multiple hernia in his lower abdomen that is causing him severe pain. But the 67-year-old actor, who has undergone three operations, is trying to avoid another surgery.        
	The previous surgeries have left a scar on his body. Now, the hernia in his lower abdomen has swollen up, and he uses a special belt while doing dance sequences or action scenes.        
	A stomach surgery, indeed two in quick succession always have the possibility of hernia developing. And that is what is of concern now. There are now two urgent hernia in the lower abdomen which have swelled up dangerously and cause me problems, Bachchan wrote on his blog.        
	Sharp pains when I stand for too long or walk too much. During dance and action scenes there is huge pain.... So the doctors have been after me for a surgery. I have been avoiding it because of my busy schedule. But I shall have to take care of it now, he wrote.

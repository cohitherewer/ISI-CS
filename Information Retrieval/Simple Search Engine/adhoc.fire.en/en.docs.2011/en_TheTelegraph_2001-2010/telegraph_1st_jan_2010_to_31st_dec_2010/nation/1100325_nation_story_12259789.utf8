          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 24: Indian and US army generals are in a four-day meeting in Chandigarh to draw up a time-table for joint drills even as an Indian Army contingent is preparing to head for an exercise in the US next month.        
	Lt Gen. Benjamin Randy Mixon, commanding general of the US Army Pacific, and Lt Gen. A.S. Sekhon, Indias Director-General of Military Operations (DGMO) are leading their delegations in the talks in the western army command headquarters in Chandimandir.        
	The delegations are part of an Executive Steering Group (ESG) of the militaries that supervises exchanges between the forces under the overarching India-US Defence Policy Group. The ESG is meeting for the 14th time.        
	In Chandimandir, where Lt Gen. Mixon is being hosted by the western army commander, Lt Gen. Shankar Ranjan Ghosh, the two sides are reviewing the joint drills that had taken place in 2009.        
	Among the biggest of these was Exercise Yudh Abhyas (war preparation) in October for which the US shipped 17 Strykers, its most modern fighting vehicles that lead in most ground operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, to Babina in Madhya Pradesh. The US also demonstrated the Javelin shoulder-fired anti tank gun made that the Indian army is interested in acquiring.         
	Executives from the gun-making firm Raytheon were also present at the exercise.        
	For the latest edition of the Shatrujeet series of exercise, about 200 Indian soldiers are scheduled to visit the US in April for nearly three weeks. The drill is likely to focus on training in a scenario involving nuclear, chemical and biological warfare.

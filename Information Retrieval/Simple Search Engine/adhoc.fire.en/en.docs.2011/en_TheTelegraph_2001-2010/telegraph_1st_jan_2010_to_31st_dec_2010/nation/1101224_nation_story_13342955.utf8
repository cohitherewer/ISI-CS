The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US visa fee negative: India
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US visa fee negative: India
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: India today described a new US law that extends the present visa fee to 2021 and imposes a levy on goods and services imported by America as a retrograde step and said it will send a negative signal to Indian investors in the country.        
	Commerce minister Anand Sharma in a letter to US trade representative Ronald Kirk said passing of such legislation would be to my mind a retrograde step for greater trade engagement, less than two months after the countries agreed to reduce trade barriers.        
	The US legislation seeks to levy a two per cent fee on goods and services imported by Washington and an additional visa fee to create funds for providing free medical treatment to those suffering from illnesses contracted while clearing the debris at the Ground Zero site in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attack.        
	The US Congress has passed a bill for creating a $4.3 billion fund for the ailing 9/11 rescuers.        
	The estimated budget will be funded by continuation of an increased fee on certain categories of H-1B and L1 visas. The move would mainly impact Indian IT companies, which earn about 60 per cent of their $50 billion revenue from exports to America.        
	The fee hike had originally been valid till 2014.         
	Funds would also come from a new two per cent excise on goods and services imported by the US government from countries which are outside the purview of the WTOs agreement on government procurement. India is among the countries outside the pact.

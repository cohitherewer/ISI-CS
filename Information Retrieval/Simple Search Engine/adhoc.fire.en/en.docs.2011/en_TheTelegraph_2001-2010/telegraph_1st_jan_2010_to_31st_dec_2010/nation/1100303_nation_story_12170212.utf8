The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jamia quota waiver plan
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Jamia quota waiver plan
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, March 2: The human resource development ministry is preparing to amend the law to exempt Jamia Millia Islamia from implementing OBC quotas by 2010 in a potentially controversial move born out of desire to not appear anti-minority.         
	HRD minister Kapil Sibal is keen to amend the quota law to exempt Jamia from a legally binding timeframe for implementing OBC reservations by the coming academic session, top government officials have told The Telegraph.         
	The move is potentially controversial because the ministry has otherwise remained rigid that all non-minority central higher educational institutions must implement commitments made under the quota law.         
	Jamia is not a minority institution, but powerful sections within the Muslim community have demanded minority status for the university and their petition is pending before an apex minority education watchdog.         
	The law, called the Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admissions) Act, made it mandatory for all non-minority higher educational institutions run by the Centre to implement 27 per cent OBC quotas in three years.         
	The law was implemented in the 2008 academic session and the coming term constitutes the last of the three years within which institutions are required under the law to complete the implementation.         
	But Jamia, caught in an internal debate over whether to seek minority status, has not even started implementing the quotas.         
	The ministry has on more than one occasion written to the university asking it to implement the quotas. The government even threatened that Jamias funding for expansion to meet the quota requirements will be stopped.         
	But the move to amend the quota law suggests that the ministry has now given up attempts to convince or pressurise Jamia into implementing OBC reservations.         
	Jamia vice-chancellor Najeeb Jung had earlier this year asked the ministry for three additional years  till the 2013 academic session  to try and implement the quotas.         
	But the HRD ministry has instead decided to amend the quota law.         
	Officially, the ministry is expected to argue that Jamia is being granted temporary exemption as the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions  Indias apex minority education watchdog  is examining the minority status demand.         
	The OBC quota law exempts minority institutions from reservations, and if the minority panel upholds the demand for such status, Jamia will not need to implement reservations.         
	But sources confirmed that the ministry and Sibal are under pressure to not appear opposed to minority concerns.         
	Most sections of the ministry argue that Jamia was set up by Muslims who did not view the varsity from the prism of their religion and wanted it to play a role in the national struggle for Independence.         
	Converting the university into a minority institution would be contrary to the vision of Jamias founders, they argue.         
	But pressurising Jamia into implementing OBC quotas could be viewed as a stand against sentiments of powerful sections of the Muslim community  a critical support base for the Congress.         
	Amendments to exempt Jamia from the three-year timeframe however may be criticised by the BJP which has repeatedly accused the UPA coalition of minority appeasement.         
	The move towards amendments could also trigger similar demands from other central higher educational institutions struggling to implement OBC quotas.

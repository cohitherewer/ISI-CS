          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 27: A group of scholars has written to the Central Vigilance Commissioner seeking a probe into alleged irregularities at Delhis Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, the main repository of the Freedom Struggles records.        
	The demand follows a special audit that revealed transfer of Rs 5 crore of public money from a private trust and improper hiring of consultants though regular staff vacancies remain unfilled. The audit also showed unjustified expenses on dinner parties and fairs.         
	Sumit Sarkar and Ramachandra Guha, among those who have sent the letter, said the CVC should immediately constitute enquiries into the financial and other affairs of the NMML (the museum).        
	They claim that the museums regular work  research, publication and acquisition of rare manuscripts  has almost stopped. The other signatories include Sunil Khilnani, Nayanjot Lahiri, Rukun Advani, A. R. Venkatachalapathy, Brinda Bose, Tridip Suhrud and Neera Chandhoke.        
	Last year, Rajmohan Gandhi  Mahatma Gandhis grandson  Partha Chatterjee, Mahesh Rangarajan and others had written to the Prime Minister with similar complaints.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Baa! Goat in garage allotted to MP
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Baa! Goat in garage allotted to MP

	New Delhi, March 2: Next time you pass by a garage allotted to an MP in a high-security zone near Parliament, dont be surprised if you hear the whirr of a sewing machine.        
	Or, maybe, even a bleat.        
	A tailor-made goat?         
	After you have pinched yourself hard, take a peek inside. Thats what Delhi police did.        
	What the cops found left them snorting. As if the plaintive baa wasnt enough, some of these garages had been turned into homes, complete with TV sets, refrigerators and almirahs, while a few had been converted into make shift tailoring shops and godowns and even resting places for goats.        
	A probe revealed the whole picture. Government accommodation, meant for parliamentarians and their vehicles, was being used by unauthorised people, Delhi police sources said after stumbling upon the unlikely residents.        
	When red-faced officers consulted files, they found the police had no record of these people.        
	For Delhi police, these unverified occupants have become a cause for concern. In a high-security area, they are a huge risk, said an officer.        
	The police are now preparing a dossier on all those living in official quarters allotted to MPs. The report, to be compiled by New Delhi district police, will be submitted to Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar and Rajya Sabha chairperson Hamid Ansari.        
	The alarm bells wouldnt have started ringing had it not been for a body lying in a park opposite the MPs Club in North Avenue, a VVIP area that is home to several parliamentarians and just 250 metres from Parliament.        
	Investigations said the man, identified as Akbar, had been strangled to death by his neighbour Shakil over a family dispute. But what the cops found out next sent them into a tizzy.        
	Both men were tenants of lawmakers who lived in the area.        
	Not only that, both were running full-fledged shops in the garages of the MPs who had apparently rented them out. In fact, Shakil had been staying there for the past 15 years.        
	Further probes confirmed what the cops had been fearing. There were many more like Shakil and Akbar living in MPs quarters, in high-security areas like North Avenue, without having had to go through any form of verification.        
	Many of these men you find living in these quarters are mostly hangers-on from the MPs constituency who have tagged along with him when he was allotted the house. Some are brought in by the MPs servants who have the reins of the house in their hands and sublet their quarters and the garages and make some money every month. They are a security threat because they havent been checked out or their antecedents verified, said a police officer.        
	Quite a few of these garages are locked from outside, but people can be heard working inside. Many are used as godowns with truckloads of stuff arriving every night, said a police source.        
	A peek into a garage at a VIP building barely 100 metres from Parliament revealed that instead of cars, there were TV sets, refrigerators and almirahs lined up inside, and a curtain to lend privacy.        
	The space comes at a cost. While the rent for a garage is anywhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,000 a month, staying in the servants quarters costs more.        
	Sources in the police said they were video-graphing these homes and would submit the visual evidence to the Speaker.        
	Last heard, the cops were also keeping their ears cocked. Just in case one of the residents bleated.

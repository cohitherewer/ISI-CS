          CITHARA PAUL                          Sonia Gandhi at the commemmoration panel meeting in Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 20: Even Rabindranath Tagore and Swami Vivekananda have failed to bring Mamata Banerjee and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee together.        
	Bengals chief minister and his principal rival both skipped the meetings of two national committees here today, held to fix the guidelines for the 150-year celebrations for the poet and the monk.        
	 Maybe both thought the other would be present, a culture ministry official said.        
	Mamata conveyed her inability to attend the meetings because of the Bengal civic elections, while Bhattacharjee was too busy with his official duties and sent state culture minister Anjan Bera instead.        
	Mamata and Bhattacharjee, a culture buff who loves quoting Tagore, have come face to face only once: at Calcuttas Raj Bhavan on September 7, 2008, when they failed to break the Singur deadlock.        
	Todays meetings  the Tagore committees late in the morning and the Vivekananda panels in the afternoon  had one surprise attendee, though. It was Sonia Gandhi, who had last week been seen with L.K. Advani before the Tagore portrait in Parliament, proving the poet can bring some opponents together, after all.        
	The UPA chairpersons name was not on the initial list of the two panels members. It was apparently added at the behest of the Prime Minister, who holds charge of the culture ministry and chaired both the meetings today.        
	Madam Sonia is quite interested in cultural issues and when there came a demand to include her too, we were all excited as her being there will add more power to the whole exercise, a ministry official said. Sonia took notes during the discussions, he added.         
	Despite Bhattacharjees absence, Manmohan Singh did take up the Bengal chief ministers letter requesting him to take steps to bring back to India the 12 Tagore paintings set to be auctioned in London on June 15. Singh told the Bengal culture minister the Centre would examine the matter but added that the government had no legal rights over the paintings.         
	Its almost impossible to bring the paintings back. Its unlikely the government can do anything in so short a time, the ministry official said.        
	The 42-member Vivekananda panel held its first meeting today. It has charted out a three-year programme to mark the monks 150th birth anniversary, which falls in January 2013.        
	The suggestions the panel has received include setting up Vivekananda chairs in Indian and foreign universities (including one in Chicago University to commemorate his path-breaking 1893 lecture).        
	There are suggestions for drawing the youth to Vivekanandas ideals through competitions, essays and study circles; reprinting his complete works as well as abridged versions; biographies by eminent authors; and propagating his message through radio, TV, the Internet, CDs and DVDs.        
	Other suggestions include the establishment of proper standards for yoga in the light of Vivekanandas understanding of the discipline.        
	The Tagore panel approved several decisions by the implementation committee headed by Pranab Mukherjee. These include the construction of a new Tagore centre in every state capital that lacks one, and renovation of Calcuttas Rabindra Sadan.         
	It was decided to hold a travelling exhibition of Tagores paintings in Paris, London, Berlin, Rome and New York in May 2011, when Mamata and Bhattacharjee are likely to be fighting for Writers Buildings. National awards will be given in Tagores name in the fields of literature, dance, music and the visual arts.

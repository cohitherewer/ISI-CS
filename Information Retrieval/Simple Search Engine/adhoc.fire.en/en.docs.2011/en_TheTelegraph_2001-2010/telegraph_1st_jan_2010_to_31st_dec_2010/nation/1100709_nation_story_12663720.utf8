The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP calls for all-party meet
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP calls for all-party meet
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A protester throws a stone at CRPF soldiers (not in picture) in Srinagar                                  
	New Delhi, July 8: The BJP demanded that the government must convene an all-party meeting to discuss the Jammu and Kashmir situation and find a way of resolving the crisis.         
	It appealed to the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party to stop playing competitive communal politics.        
	The BJPs spokesperson, Prakash Javadekar, asked the Centre to see that law and order did not go out of hand when the Amarnath pilgrimage was on because one of the goal of separatists is to create tension during this period.        
	Javadekar took the Congress-NCP government to task for firstly failing to curb the stone-pelters and for rewarding the surrendered stone-pelters with jobs and allotment of shops.         
	This low-cost-high impact stone-throwing technique was perfect for separatists as security forces really have no answer for it. A small stone has catalysed the ground situation.         
	These stone-throwers could have easily been disciplined because if it was a choice between being paid Rs 500 for the act and spending 50 days in jail, nobody would have gone for the first. Instead they are gifted with a special rehabilitation package. The governments message was throw a stone and you will get a job, he alleged.        
	Javadekar questioned the double standards adopted by the Omar Abdullah government towards the central forces and the stone-pelters. It booked CRPF personnel for the death of a youth during a protest on charges of murder. But it did not book the youths who are seen in the photos beating up a CRPF jawan mercilessly... this demoralised the forces, he said.

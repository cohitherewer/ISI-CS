The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC orders Amul to pay for smut calls
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      SC orders Amul to pay for smut calls
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 26: The Supreme Court has upheld a decision by the telecom department to recover Rs 4.5 lakh from Amul for calls made from the phone of one of its managing directors to international phone sex lines.         
	The official had claimed that someone else had misused his official phone line to make those calls. The Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd, which owns the Amul brand, challenged the amount as excessive.         
	The phone was installed at the managing directors residence in Anand town. The bi-monthly bills usually came to Rs 8,500. But on January 16, 1996, he got a bill for Rs 3,62,723 and on June 1, 1996, for Rs 91,929. This was on account of a large number of international calls known as party calls or sex talk calls.         
	After receiving the first bill, the official filed a complaint on April 25, 1996, that he was mischievously and unscrupulously billed for international calls made from other numbers, but shown otherwise. The official also complained that many times, when he lifted the receiver to make calls, he used to hear ongoing talk.         
	The telecom department verified the bill and informed the federation that the bill was correct as no portion of the line was exposed. The subscriber also had absolute control over whether or not to make a call as the phone had dynamic lock facility.         
	The department also contended that the phone was working and there was no complaint about it being out of order. The bills showed that the calls were made daily. As the phone was connected to an electronic exchange, there was no chance of excess metering, it said.         
	The managing director then filed an appeal with the general manager, Kheda telecom district, Nandiad.         
	However, as the bills were not paid, the telephone was disconnected on May 29, 1996. A writ petition was filed by the federation which was disposed of by the high court on July 29, 1997, directing the general manager, telecom, to examine the appeal.         
	The appeal was dismissed on the ground that the subscriber had not made use of the STD/ISD locking facility available to him. Moreover, all rooms had parallel lines for making ISD calls even without the subscribers knowledge.         
	The appellate authority also ruled out the possibility of any external misuse as the distribution point box was located on the federations premises and was under round-the-clock security.        
	It also pointed out that no part of the underground cable was exposed and not a single complaint had been made about the phone before April 25, 1996.         
	These calls were made in between calls to other stations in India in such close proximity that there was no chance of possible misuse by any third party or staff of the telecom department, the appellate authority said.         
	The federation again approached the high court, which dismissed the appeal on the ground that they had the alternative remedy of arbitration under Section 7B of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.         
	The arbitrator also held that the federation had to make complete payment of the bills. He also said that there was no age or sex bar to dialling these numbers and hence the calls could have been made by any family member of the subscriber, who had a son who was sitting for his Class X pre-board exam. The possibility of these calls having been made by the subscribers son could not be ruled out, he said.         
	The federation challenged the award in the high court which allowed the writ petition, imposing costs of Rs 5,000 on the telecom department, and quashed the bills and the consequential demand notice.         
	But on appeal by the telecom department, a two-judge Supreme Court bench of Justices R.V. Raveendran and Dalveer Bhandari set aside the high court order.

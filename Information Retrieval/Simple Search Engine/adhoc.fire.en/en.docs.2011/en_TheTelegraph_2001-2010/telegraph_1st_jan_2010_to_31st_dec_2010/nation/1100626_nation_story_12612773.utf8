	New Delhi, June 25: Delhi police doubt if the three youths behind the weekend honour killings in the capital were arrested by Uttar Pradesh cops yesterday.         
	Delhi police sources suspect that cousins Mandip and Ankit Gurjar and their friend Nakul could have surrendered after being assured that they would not be ill-treated in custody.         
	Garhmukteshwar, the place of their arrest, is dominated by Gurjars and sources said it could have been a surrender planned by politicians.         
	Also, the trio have been booked for the theft of their neighbours car, not for murder. The trio had used the vehicle to flee after Mandip killed his sister Shobha and Ankit murdered his sister Monica and her husband Kuldeep. Today, Delhi police failed to appear in an Uttar Pradesh court to take away the youths despite having a warrant.

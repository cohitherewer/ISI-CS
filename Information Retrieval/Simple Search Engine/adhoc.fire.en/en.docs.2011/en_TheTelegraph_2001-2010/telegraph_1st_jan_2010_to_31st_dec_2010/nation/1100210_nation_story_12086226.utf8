	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 8: Differing from his Bihar counterpart, Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik today expressed his strong determination and will to use force against the Maoists.        
	Till they (the Maoists) shun the path of violence, we have to use force against them to restore peace and law and order, Naveen told reporters here after returning from Calcutta, where he had attended the meeting of four eastern states affected by Left-wing extremism.        
	When it was pointed out that Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar held a divergent view that Maoist problem could not be solved by using force, Naveen said: When they (Naxalites) believe in violence, its difficult to have dialogue and restore peace. They are using violence, non-violence and crime on regular basis. When they (the Maoists) stop violence, then of course there can be dialogue. Till then, they have to face the force.        
	On whether development was an issue, Naveen said: No, when peace is restored after combating the ultras, development will naturally move very fast.        
	About any politics on the anti-Maoist operations among Congress and non-Congress ruled states, Naveen replied in negative. Referring to the discussions at the chief ministers conference on internal security chaired by the Prime Minister in Delhi on Sunday, he said: Almost everyone was of the opinion that till they (the Maoists) give up violence, they will have to be combated.        
	About todays meeting in Calcutta, Naveen said the general discussion was border strategy to combat the Maoists in the four eastern states, he said. Asked when the joint anti-Maoist operation would start, Naveen said: I think they (the Centre) will send the paramilitary forces soon. Plans will be made and of course we will have to combat the ultras to ensure restoration of peace.        
	Naveen said Union home minister P. Chidambaram assured him of deputing three battalions of central paramilitary forces in the northern and western districts besides the five battalions of central forces allotted for southern districts to combat the Naxalites.        
	Red attack on tracks        
	Railway property was targeted by Maoists on the third consecutive day in Bihar today on the last day of their 72-hour bandh.        
	RPF commandant R.S.P. Singh said the Maoists had attacked Narganjo station in Jamui district on the Jhaja-Jasidih section of East Central Railway late last night.        
	After beating up stationmaster Vijay Shanker, the Naxalites set ablaze the cabin and blew up a portion of the down line, affecting movement of long-distance and local trains for several hours.        
	Additional DGP (headquarters) U.S. Dutt, too, confirmed the incident.        
	East Central Railway chief public relations officer Dilip Kumar said in Patna that the damaged track had been repaired and movement of trains on the up line commenced at 5am and on the down line at 8.30am.        
	Several trains, including 2023/2024 Howrah Janshatabdi Express, were cancelled.

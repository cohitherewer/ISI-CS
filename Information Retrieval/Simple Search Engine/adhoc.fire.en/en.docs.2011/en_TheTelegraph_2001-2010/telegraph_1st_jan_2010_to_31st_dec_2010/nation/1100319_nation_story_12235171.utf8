          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, March 18: Mayavati today showed one of her most powerful officers the door over the cash-garland row, the second Brahmin in a key role to be shunted by the chief minister in a week.        
	Vijayshankar Pandey was turfed out as additional cabinet secretary and principal secretary, information, apparently removed for his failure to check the hail of negative publicity the chief minister faced over the garlands.        
	On March 15, Mayavati removed one-time close aide S.C. Mishra from a panel on the welfare of Brahmins.

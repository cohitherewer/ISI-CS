The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hounded, Maoists in south foray
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hounded, Maoists in south foray
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                            
	Hyderabad, Aug. 7: The hounded Maoists of Chhattisgarhs Dandakaranya forests are scouting for safer pastures.        
	In the crosshairs of Andhras Greyhound commandos and paramilitary forces, the guerrillas of Abuj Madh valley are apparently planning to shift base to the dense Satyamangalam forests on the borders of Kerala and Karnataka.        
	These forests, once home to notorious sandalwood smuggler Veerappan, are about a days drive plus a four-hour trek from Bangalore. Kannada filmstar Rajkumar was kept in captivity in this forest belt, peopled by the fiercely loyal Jenu Kurubas tribes (honey collectors), for over three weeks in 2005.        
	Sources said Andhra polices counter-intelligence wing got wind of the Maoists plan from documents they recovered from the Adilabad forests after the encounter killing of rebel spokesperson Cherukuri Rajkumar alias Azad in early July.        
	According to the documents, the CPI (Maoists) central committee has authorised Malla Raji Reddy, the partys south-west regional zone in-charge, to set up safe houses and necessary infrastructure in the Satyamangalam forests to house at least 1,500 rebels.        
	The final decision was taken at the Maoist plenary held in Karnatakas Sringeri forest belt in the second week of June, the sources said. Keeping (in mind) the Andhra experience (of elimination of top leaders), the party should strengthen itself against infiltrations, sabotages and covert police operations in setting up such a strong base, a central committee document said.        
	The Abuj Madh valley in Chhattisgarhs Dandakaranya belt was no longer safe for the party leadership, the document said. Since counter-intelligence agencies are succeeding in eliminating our top leadership in Jharkhand, Orissa, Bihar and West Bengal, they all should be protected and moved to a safer zone where the police intelligence can not reach them.        
	The reason the Maoists zeroed in on the Satyamangalam forests, known for its wildlife, elephant herds and sandalwood, was because it was very dense, hilly and had very few non-tribals, the sources said. The nearly 100sqkm forest belt is dominated by tribals and smugglers of ivory and sandalwood.        
	Police sources said documents recovered from Ramesan, a Maoist arrested from Keralas Wayanad district in May, had hinted at the proposal to shift base. Accordingly, Maoist cadres had begun infiltrating into Karnatakas Dakshina Kannada , Chikmagalur, Udupi and Kodagu districts, Tamil Nadus Cuddalore district and Keralas Kannur and Wayanad districts.        
	The plans for a southern shift, however, began as early as 2007, the sources said. By end-2008, Malla Raji Reddy, the Maoists south-west regional zone in-charge, had identified the Satyamangalam forests as the safest place for Peoples Guerrilla Liberation Army training and recruitment. Two recruitment camps were held in 2008 and 2009, a source said.        
	The director-generals of police of Maoist-infested states are scheduled to meet in Hyderabad on August 11 to discuss the Maoists shift strategy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | School final at 53, spurred by Rahul 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      School final at 53, spurred by Rahul 
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Dal Bahadur Kori, the former minister                                  
	Lucknow, June 3: The humiliation of failing a Class X board exam at 53 can be worse than losing an election.        
	But Dal Bahadur Kori wasnt daunted. The former minister in the Kalyan Singh government and the father of three graduates passed the Uttar Pradesh high school board exam with a first division, scoring 63.5 per cent.        
	So, what drove him to take the gamble of his life? Pat comes the reply: Rahul Gandhi.         
	Rahul Gandhi encouraged me to complete my education, said Kori, whose Padmanpur Bijauli village is in Rahuls Amethi constituency.        
	So nervous was Kori on June 1, the day the results were declared, that he sent an aide to find out if he had passed.        
	People were already jeering at me (when I took the exam). If I had failed, I would have been ridiculed. Still I went for it, said Kori, now a state Congress general secretary who lost his father at eight and reared others cattle to support his day-labourer mother.        
	Kori, who had joined the Congress in 2007 after several years in the BJP and a rather short spell in the ruling BSP, concedes being a matriculate isnt necessary in politics. But he still felt it was a stigma he should wipe off.        
	I did not want the secondary certificate to get a job. I know politics and education arent inseparable. We know Devi Lal (who became deputy Prime Minister) wasnt highly educated. But I put myself through this test. The moment I heard this (that I passed), I felt the stigma of being an uneducated politician would go, Kori said.        
	State Congress leaders felt the feat was an example for other Dalits. Prabesh Kori, a senior member of the state units SC/ST cell, said: Dal Bahadurs exam success would go a long way in making illiterate Dalits muster courage to get educated.         
	Only 3 per cent of the Dalits in the state are graduates, 1 per cent skilled in technical education, Prabesh Kori pointed out, adding that the rest are largely unskilled labourers.        
	Kori has four sons, including the three graduates, and a daughter. The youngest son and the daughter are in school.         
	Kori belongs to one of Uttar Pradeshs 66 castes recognised as Dalits. According to the 2001 census, Dalits make up 21 per cent of the states population.        
	Recalling his struggle as a child  which he says is typical of most Dalits  Kori said: I was sent to grazing grounds at the age of 9 when I was supposed to be in school. As a day labourer in the 1970s, my mother used to earn only Rs 20.        
	Later, hunger drove him to Kanpur in the 80s where he get a job as an unskilled labourer. I worked in households and tanneries. I began to defend the rights of Dalits and, in the process, began to lead protests, he says.        
	In 1993, the BJP gave him a ticket to contest from Salone but he lost. He eventually won in 1996, when the state had a mid-term election. In 1997, Kalyan Singh made me a minister of social welfare. I continued to be minister even after Kalyan Singh resigned and Ram Krakash Gupta became chief minister, Kori said.        
	Then, he switches to Rahul, calling him a great inspiration for us. When he visits a Dalit home, he talks about everything  education, agriculture, health  but not votes, says Kori, alluding to the Amethi MPs trips to Dalit homes as part of his efforts to bolster the Congress in the state.        
	Koris mission isnt over yet. I would like to pass my intermediate (Class XII) exam 2012. And then in 2014, I would like to be a graduate. In between is the 2012 (state) election. We have to fulfil Rahul Gandhis mission.

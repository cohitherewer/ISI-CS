                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Gay-law judge hurt
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 11 (PTI): The judge who passed landmark rulings like legalising consensual adult gay sex and bringing the Chief Justice of Indias office under the information act has said he is hurt at not being promoted to the Supreme Court.        
	I cannot pretend that I am not hurt. A sense of hurt is always there. These things happen in life, Delhi High Court Chief Justice Ajit Prakash Shah told reporters today, his last working day. The top judge, who will officially retire on Saturday after nearly 21 months in the current post, said it really hurts as a human being, though he made it clear that it is for the people to judge why I was denied the opportunity.        
	The Supreme Court collegium had left out Shah, one of the senior-most judges in the country, while recommending to the Centre names of other judges junior to him.

          [+uc('Our Special Correspondent   Arun jaitley')+]                                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: The BJP is bracing itself for another haul in Karnataka as chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa is enmeshed in more corruption allegations.        
	BJP president Nitin Gadkari appointed Rajya Sabha Opposition leader Arun Jaitley as the trouble-shooter for the state. Veteran MP Shanta Kumar was removed as the Karnataka prabhari (minder) and moved to Punjab where the BJP is a junior partner of the Akali Dal. General secretary Dharmendra Pradhan was brought in his place but he is expected to be Jaitleys under-study.        
	During the last crisis, when Yeddyurappa was on the verge of losing his job, Jaitleys word clinched the decision in his favour because, sources said, he took a more rounded and a political view of the situation and kept himself aloof from factional politics.         
	Sources said Jaitleys opinion was that the leadership should not be seen as easing out Yeddyurappa because he still controlled the votes of the dominant Lingayat community. He reportedly said if the government collapsed under the weight of its internal contradictions, the party could cut its political losses because then Yeddyurappa would not go down as a martyr.        
	After the bailout, Yeddyurappa ran into trouble when the Karnataka Lokayukta, Santosh Hegde, objected to a probe he ordered into his alleged irregular land dealings. The move seemed to undermine Hedges position because he was already looking into the matter.        
	Then, the rebel MLAs of the BJP moved the Supreme Court against their disqualification by the Assembly Speaker. The decision facilitated the governments victory in a no-confidence motion that was brought against it after these MLAs withdrew their support and reduced it into a minority. The court sent a notice to the chief minister.        
	A couple of days ago, the Lokayukta registered an FIR against Katta Subramanya Naidu, his son Jagadish and nine others in a multi-crore land scam. Naidu, who was an IT minister in the state government, resigned.        
	Sources said in case the government faced another no-confidence motion, Jaitleys experience in handling political crises could be useful.

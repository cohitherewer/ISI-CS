          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 15: The police today arrested Saswati Panda, the wife of top Maoist leader Sabyasachi Panda.        
	Saswati, alias Subhashree, alias Mili, was arrested from Palasuni on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar during a joint raid conducted by the police commissionerate and Special Operations Group. While police commissioner B.K. Sharma said the lady was Sabyasachis wife, he refused to divulge more.        
	Following inputs provided by the Special Intelligence Wing, the SOG personnel chased a vehicle loaded with Maoist literature from Balugaon, 100 km from here, and managed to reach the house in Palasuni where Saswati was hiding.         
	She was in charge of publicity and publication wing of the division. We have seized Rs 4 lakh from her possession. A laptop and camera were seized from her possession. Interrogation is on, said inspector-general (operations) Sanjeeb Marik.        
	Saswati was apparently operating close to Bhubaneswar to mobilise funds for the outlawed outfit. She was whisked away to an undisclosed location for interrogation.        
	Saswati was married to Sabyasachi in 1998. It was a love marriage. She was well educated and hailed from Nimapara, said Sidhharth, the elder brother of Sabyasachi, adding that the couple had no contacts with the family now.        
	She will be forwarded to court tomorrow, sources said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong workers want more from the top
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong workers want more from the top
          SANJAY K. JHA                                         Sonia Gandhi     
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh confronted corruption charges and attacked the RSS but the attempts appear to have failed to lift the morale of several ordinary workers, especially those from Bihar.        
	Many grassroots workers and middle-rung leaders conceded a day after the plenary that the mood remained sombre as the firefighting could not change ground realities overnight.         
	While the rise in onion prices came as a damper, a demonstration in front of Sonias residence for removal of general secretary Mukul Wasnik alerted the high command to the peril of organisational status quo.         
	One Congress MP told The Telegraph: People are not going to appreciate us only because we have acted in corruption cases and the BJP hasnt. The Bihar results do not give this message. We attack the RSS every time we meet but is that enough? We should analyse what is wrong with our politics after all, they are winning in Gujarat, they snatched Karnataka from us, they have defeated us conclusively in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.         
	Most AICC members and PCC delegates The Telegraph spoke to during the two-day plenary said the Bihar result was symptomatic of a deeper malaise and showed we cannot fight back.         
	They feared the party will do badly again in Uttar Pradesh and suggested that the high command ponder the failure to regain ground in these states, including Orissa. The majority view is that even Andhra Pradesh is slipping out of the Congresss hands.         
	Start afresh, Sonia told leaders from Bihar when they met her yesterday, forgetting that the party had done so after snapping ties with Lalu Prasad but wrong strategies and bungling by central observers delivered a debilitating blow at the very beginning.        
	The central leaders who were boasting of winning at least 40 seats have suddenly changed their tune, saying now that nobody expected a better show.         
	One Bihar leader pointed out: When complaints reached Soniaji about Wasniks misdeeds during ticket-distribution, we were told she was angry. But he continued and there was a plan to block Bihari delegates from participating in the plenary. What is worse, Wasnik was allowed to play a key role at the plenary and even take the mike despite protests from workers. Had the leadership been sensitive to workers sentiments, it would have asked Wasnik to lie low.         
	The proof of their anger was right there in front of Sonias residence today when Bihari workers staged a protest demanding Wasniks ouster from the party.        
	Such stubborn opposition to one leader has not been seen in the recent past. In fact, Sonia has taken action against those caught in corrupt deeds but has avoided hauling up non-performing or controversial leaders in the organisation. The face of the high command has almost remained the same over the last decade.         
	There is a feeling among senior leaders that Sonia might take tough decisions now only under pressure from Rahul Gandhi who is keen to renovate the organisational set-up.        
	Sonias reluctance to force her decisions is also reflected in the non-implementation of her important announcements in the past. Her decision to set up an institution which will work as the Congress think-tank is now being viewed with scepticism.         
	One of the big decisions at the Shimla conclave in 2003 was to set up a national training institute in which every Congressman and woman will go through an annual orientation course on contemporary political, economic and social issues and constructive work. Not even a brick has been laid for this institute so far.        
	Sonia also said the Congress would fight communalisation of education through the Bapu Sadbhavna and Shiksha Trust. Nobody knows about the contribution of this trust. She set up a force called Sadbhavna ke sipahi which is almost forgotten.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: Commonwealth Games Organising Committee officials had destroyed some incriminating documents before the CBI last month started its investigation into alleged corruption, sources in the agency said.         
	A probe revealed that some files, containing information on budgetary allocation and the names and contact numbers of people who benefited from the deals, were destroyed or smuggled out of the office before the CBI took over the case, a senior CBI officer said today.         
	The officer added that the CBI has the names of some officials who were behind the tampering and destruction of evidence.        
	A case of criminal conspiracy has been registered against these officials and they would be arrested soon. We have also made a list of documents which were found missing during the agencys raid at the organising committee office last month, he said. A large number of people are involved in the scam and we have drawn up a list of such people to be questioned soon, the officer said.         
	Three former top organising committee officials T.S. Darbari, M. Jeyachandran and Sanjay Mohindroo  accused in the Queens Baton Relay scam  are in judicial custody in Tihar jail after they were arrested by the CBI on November 15.         
	Darbari and Mohindroo, both confidants of organising committee chief Suresh Kalmadi, are accused of hiring taxis at unusually high rates for the Queens Baton Relay that could have cost the government up to Rs 4 crore.         
	The organising committee is understood to have paid the firm AM Films over 450,000 for services during the relay in London in October last year allegedly without following procedures.

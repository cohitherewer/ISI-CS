  - Sushma to obama: we are natural allies          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sushma Swaraj and Barack Obama at a meeting in Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: Whats a little Rudy-ness, er, rudeness between long-time friends? That was the message to Barack Obama from a rather defensive Sushma Swaraj this afternoon.        
	At her half-hour meeting with the US President, the leader of the Lok Sabha Opposition stressed that her party had always considered their two countries natural allies and cited the Vajpayee governments initiatives to strengthen relations.        
	Sushmas stance reflected the BJPs eagerness to salvage its US ties following spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudys ill-advised and shrill attack on Obama for his failure to mention the Pakistani hand behind the 26/11 attacks. Rudys remarks, made the day Obama arrived, were widely reported and commented on by the western media.        
	BJP sources admit in hindsight that Rudys comments came at a most inopportune time when the party was desperately seeking to woo back its urban middle-class voters, who are still sold on the American Dream and economic model.        
	A BJP statement said: She (Sushma) emphasised that the historical evolution of this relationship related to the initiatives taken by the NDA headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee when a strategic dialogue between the US and India had commenced. Obama, it added, appreciated and reciprocated her views.        
	Sushma, though, did add a few riders by cautioning Obama that the impression must not gain ground in India that for the US, Pakistan is an ally and India a market.         
	She appreciated the sympathy Obama had expressed for the 26/11 victims but apparently told him he should clearly identify those behind the carnage.        
	She emphasised that occasional utterances on behalf of the US, such as granting special status relationship to Pakistan or treating it as the most important non-Nato ally... caused concern in India, the statement said.        
	Sushma, MP for Vidisha near Bhopal, told Obama he must take effective steps to punish the (Americans) guilty in the gas tragedy. Obama invited her to visit the US in the near future, sources said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES                           CBI officials after a search at Bhanots residence in Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 30: The CBI today lodged FIRs against two Commonwealth Games organising committee officials and raided their homes as part of a probe into suspected irregularities in a contract with a Swiss company.        
	The officials  organising committee secretary-general Lalit Bhanot and director-general V.K. Verma  are considered close to Suresh Kalmadi, the Games committee chief. The two have not been arrested yet.        
	Todays FIR is the third the CBI has filed so far. The fresh FIR relates to irregularities in a Rs 107-crore contract that the committee granted a Swiss company for supplying electronic result update systems for the October 3-14 event.         
	The CBI has charged the two Games committee officials with criminal conspiracy, cheating and under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. It has also named the foreign company, Swiss Timing Ltd, in the FIR.         
	It is alleged that the accused officers abused their official position and entered into criminal conspiracy with a Switzerland-based company and other unknown persons to cheat the Government of India into awarding contract to the said company for acquiring Timing, Scoring and Result (TSR) System at exorbitant rates of Rs 107 crore, thereby causing a huge loss to the government, a CBI spokesperson said. He said the expression of interest was published announcing that only the Swiss firm met the criteria.         
	Subsequently, a request for proposal (RFP) was issued on October 1, 2009. This was surreptitiously amended on October 4, 2009, thereby making the bids even more restrictive. In response to RFP, two bids were received. However, the other firm (Spain-based) was allegedly wrongfully eliminated at the pre-qualification bid stage, the official said.         
	The CBI searched premises in Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida, among them were the residences of Bhanot and Verma.        
	Separate CBI teams also raided the offices of Games committee joint director-general (co-ordination) K. Sacheti and additional director Sangeeta Welingkar.         
	The CBI sources said the agency was investigating the role played by people close to Kalmadi before it questions the MP from Pune.         
	In his defence, Bhanot said all the decisions related to the Games were taken keeping government officials in the loop. We were totally transparent. Whatever decision has been taken, it has been taken jointly by the board and it includes the government members... he told a news channel.         
	Verma claimed the allegations against him were absolutely baseless. Any suspicion on any individual is totally baseless because you should see this whole matter has been examined by so many high-level committees. Several committees had examined the matter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kalyan to launch party today
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Kalyan to launch party today
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Jan. 4: Former BJP leader Kalyan Singh will launch a new outfit tomorrow before a planned trip to Ayodhya as he tries to hijack the temple issue from his faction-ridden parent party.        
	Sources said the new party could take away from the BJP the former chief ministers Lodh caste voters in western Uttar Pradesh, but senior leader Rajnath Singh appeared to play down the likely impact.        
	Rajnath, who put up a cosmetic show of unity in Lucknow today with other BJP leaders, admitted his party was in a dismal shape but said the state leadership was capable of recuperating from the present ills.        
	Sources close to Kalyan said he had applied for registration of his new party, the second he would be launching since his first expulsion from the BJP in 1999. Kalyan had then floated the Rashtriya Kranti Party but merged it with the BJP in 2004. He had become a Samajwadi Party ally before last years polls but snapped ties two months ago.        
	Today, on the eve of the expected launch of his outfit that sources said could be named Jan Kranti Party, he tried to needle the BJP. Kalyan, who turns 68 tomorrow, said he planned a trip to Ayodhya on January 6. Temple construction would be my key issue.        
	Observers said the trip was aimed at ridding him of the sin of tying up with Mulayam Singh and at earning the sympathies of BJP rebels who might cross over to his side. Among those expected to be in Ayodhya with him is Uma Bharti, another leader expelled from the BJP.

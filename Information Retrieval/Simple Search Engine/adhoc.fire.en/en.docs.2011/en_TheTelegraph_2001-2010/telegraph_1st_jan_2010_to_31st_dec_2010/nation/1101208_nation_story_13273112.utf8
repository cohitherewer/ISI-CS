The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | One-time pals warm to NDA
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      One-time pals warm to NDA
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Naveen Patnaik                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) have indicated they are not averse to doing business with the BJP and the NDA again.        
	NDA convener and Janata Dal (United) chief Sharad Yadav recently approached the BJD, AGP, AIADMK, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leaders, asking them to be part of a rally the coalition is planning to hold this month against the UPAs corruption.        
	The TDP refused, saying it would be part of the Left-led secular front, but the BJD said it would consider the offer.        
	Pyarimohan Mohapatra, the Rajya Sabha MP and political adviser to Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik told The Telegraph: Sharadji spoke to the chief minister. After that, we ran into each other in Parliament and he mentioned he had spoken. He made it clear that we (the NDA) are organising a rally and the BJP will also be a part of it. We might then consider joining it because we are exercised over the same issue. I will talk to the CM. He will decide in a day or two.        
	AGP leaders Chandramohan Patowary and Prafulla Mahanta will be in Delhi tomorrow. They are scheduled to meet BJP leader Sushma Swaraj. Asked if they would revive ties with the BJP, Sushma said: Lets see. I will request them to join our rally to start with.        
	INLD leader Om Prakash Chautala, whose alliance with the BJP snapped just before the last Haryana elections, is likely to be part of the proposed rally.        
	BJP sources said AIADMK leader M. Thambidurai told Yadav that party boss Jayalalithaa would reveal her mind after she returned to Chennai from Ooty this week. Thambidurai was unavailable for comment but his Rajya Sabha colleague V. Maithreyan said: I am not aware of any movement on this front.        
	Sushma said the rally the date will be finalised on Thursday  will be held under an omnibus Opposition banner despite the absence of the Left, Samajwadi Party and the BSP. The idea is not to rub off potential partners with the BJP tag, a source said.        
	It is expected that the Dal (United)s Yadav and Akali Dal functionaries will be as prominent at the rally as the BJP leaders. We want to make the point that we are better practitioners of coalition dharma than the Congress. The Congress is big brother to its allies, we will show that we are on the same footing as our partners, a source said.        
	The idea of making Yadav the principal negotiator for the NDAs expansion was to keep the BJP in the background.

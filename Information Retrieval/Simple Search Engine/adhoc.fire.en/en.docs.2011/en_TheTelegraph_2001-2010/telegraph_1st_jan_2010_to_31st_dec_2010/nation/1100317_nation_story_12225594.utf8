The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Youths, women and shuffle of old cards
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Youths, women and shuffle of old cards
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                            
	New Delhi, March 16: BJP president Nitin Gadkari today unveiled his team of 37 office-bearers and seven spokespersons, packing in a record number of youths and women to try and capture the seasons flavour.        
	Yet, his dreams of re-branding the BJP as modern, moderate and inclusive were checked by the need to balance the pulls and pressures from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and entrenched party factions.        
	The same old cards were reshuffled, a senior party official remarked. Nobody could tell who had won and who had lost.        
	If Sangh bete noire L.K. Advani saw proteges Ananth Kumar, Vasundhara Raje and M. Venkaiah Naidu continue in significant positions or get aptly rehabilitated, his efforts to similarly reward another acolyte, Shahnawaz Hussain, were stymied by the overlords of Nagpur.        
	Along with Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj, Kumar and Naidu were part of the Dilli Four cabal that Advani had supposedly used to thwart the Sanghs agenda to take the BJP over.        
	Once Jaitley and Sushma had been appointed leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha, respectively, the Sangh had thought its game plan of undermining Advani had kicked in.         
	It let it be known that while Advani had a free hand in Parliament, he would have nothing to do with the BJP organisation.        
	Todays developments would leave the Sangh brass chagrined.        
	Kumar has stayed put as a general secretary, Vasundhara has been appointed one, and Naidu continues on the all-powerful parliamentary board that frames policies and signs decisions.        
	Hussain, the only Muslim to have twice won a Lok Sabha election from the BJP, was expected to be made a general secretary. He met the Sangh brass several times in the recent past.        
	The BJPs political rationale was that if Narendra Modi and Varun Gandhi had only divisive potential, Hussain could counter the effect to an extent. This had been the calculation of Atal Bihari Vajpayee when he made Hussain a cabinet minister, a former minister said.        
	The Sangh allegedly put its foot down. Hussain is on the panel of seven spokespersons while his peer, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, remains a vice-president, a post regarded as ornamental except when the incumbent is occasionally given charge of an important state.        
	However, the Sangh was humbled when Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie, who fought a proxy battle against Advani on its behalf, were left out.        
	Sinha and Shourie were listed only as national executive members with 81 others who included actors Vinod Khanna and Kiron Kher apart from Vinay Sahasrabuddhe and Sudanshu Trivedi, political advisers to Gadkari and Rajnath Singh, respectively.        
	A source said Rajnath, Gadkaris immediate predecessor, had not come off badly.         
	Not only were his nominees, Thavarchand Gehlot and Vijay Goel, left undisturbed as general secretaries, he managed to get in a third, Arjun Munda.        
	Officially, caste and social considerations were cited as the reason  Gehlot is a Dalit and Munda a tribal. But those familiar with the power play claimed the Sangh had indulged Rajnath for standing up to Advani during his three-year tenure.        
	The chief ministers, barring Karnatakas B.S. Yeddyurappa, too secured berths for their acolytes: Gujarats Modi for Purushottam Rupala; Chhattisgarhs Raman Singh for Karuna Shukla and Saudan Singh; and Madhya Pradeshs Shivraj Singh Chauhan for Narendra Singh Tomar.        
	Anurag Thakur, son of Himachals Premkumar Dhumal, is set to head the youth wing.        
	This was a job Varun Gandhi had eyed. He was persuaded to settle for a secretarys post, a job he had earlier rejected as unworthy of his pedigree and political acumen.        
	If the top echelons were overrun with mostly familiar and tried-and-tested names, the secretaries were packed with future prospects.        
	Among them were TV stars Smriti Irani and Vani Tripathi, former cricketer and MP Navjot Sidhu, consumer activist Kirit Somaiyya and grassroots women leaders Saroj Pande, Kiran Maheshwari and Arati Mehra.        
	This post is a nursery for talent, a source said.

	New Delhi, Sept. 25: The Congress will not be unhappy to see the Ayodhya verdict put off for what one leader described as the next 200 years, a position likely to influence the Centres stand in the Supreme Court.        
	The majority of Congress leaders argue in private that no one apart from certain fringe elements is waiting expectantly for the verdict. Most party leaders cite Rahul Gandhis statement that the country has more urgent issues than Ayodhya to address.        
	What Rahul said reflects the partys mindset. Why should we pray for instability? After all, the Congress invariably becomes the worst loser in a polarised atmosphere, a senior leader said.        
	The implication is, the Centre is unlikely to advocate an early verdict when the attorney-general gives his views in the Supreme Court on September 28.        
	One issue that will test the Centres attitude is that of granting an extension to Justice Dharam Veer Sharma, one of the three judges on the high court bench that is to deliver the verdict, who is due to retire on October 1.        
	If the verdict cannot be delivered by October 1, it will mean that either Justice Sharma will need to be given an extension or that a new bench will have to rehear the case all over again, which could take months or years.        
	Legal experts say that if the apex court seeks an extension for the judge, the Centre is expected to grant it. But a Congress leader said: It (granting extension) is a cumbersome process. It is very difficult to say anything now.        
	Another leader, who has a legal background, said: What is the harm if the verdict does not come for the next 200 years? No government is going to relish a tense situation. Let the verdict come only when we are ready to accept it peacefully, not now when interested parties are itching (to squeeze it) for political benefits.        
	Party leaders, however, expressed annoyance at insinuations of a Congress role in the verdicts postponement.        
	If you cant believe even the Supreme Court, who would you believe? How can the government manage the Supreme Court? one leader said.        
	Asked why the party had welcomed the Supreme Courts interim decision when the entire country was waiting for a verdict, he said: Who is waiting? Nobody is waiting except for the media and interested parties. The country has moved ahead and is grappling with other issues.        
	The Congress leadership is aware of the enormous difficulties that would arise after the verdict. They know it will not be easy to build either a temple or a mosque at the site even after the verdict, whichever way it goes.

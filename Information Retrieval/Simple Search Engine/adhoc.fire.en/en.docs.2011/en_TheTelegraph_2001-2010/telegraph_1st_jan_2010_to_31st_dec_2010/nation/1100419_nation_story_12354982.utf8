The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP sees scam in sweat shed
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP sees scam in sweat shed
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                        Sushma Swaraj      
	New Delhi, April 18: Sunanda Pushkar today offered to surrender her Kochi sweat equity, but the BJP is not convinced.        
	The party said the sacrifice amounted to an admission of guilt on her friend Shashi Tharoors part.         
	If the BJP saw the seeds of a scam, the Left, too, was of the same view. If there was nothing murky, CPI Rajya Sabha member D. Raja said, why did she surrender (the sweat equity)?        
	BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said if proof was needed, here was proof of the ministers complicity.        
	If you (Tharoor) had no role in securing the sweat equity for your friend, how come you prevailed on her to return it? If somebody is found taking slush money, is he automatically absolved of guilt if he gives it back?         
	The company law has been flouted in this case because it states no equity can be gifted away until a company is registered for a year and the sweat equity should not exceed 1 per cent, the leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha told The Telegraph.        
	BJP sources said the party had, for the first time in six years, got something with which it could nail the UPA government on a specific case of financial wheeling-dealing and public loot and wouldnt let the opportunity go.        
	Party leaders said they saw in the IPL muck another Bofors but werent sure if the BJP should focus on a single issue or raise equally potent matters such as price rise and contradictions in the Maoist policy.        
	That is why we decided to firm up our parliamentary strategy every morning, depending on what is the issue of the day. A calibrated approach is better than a predetermined one, Sushma said.        
	The BJP is preoccupied with mobilising cadres for a public rally on price rise in New Delhi on April 21, but sources said the party was unlikely to take the Tharoor-Sunanda campaign to the streets, however politically seductive corruption was.        
	If I was asked to prioritise aam aadmi issues, certainly price rise will overwhelm everything else, an office-bearer said.        
	There is also a perception within the party that if the sweat equity saga is over-projected, it might tar the IPL endeavour.        
	Thats something we dont want because of the leagues huge appeal to youths. We dont want to appear spoilsports, the office-bearer said.        
	This is why L.K. Advanis statement on Saturday linking cricket to scandalous self-enrichment was viewed askance by a section of the BJP.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mohali, March 24: Punjab police commandos dont carry AK-47s nowadays. They carry whistles.        
	Reason?         
	Well, they arent fighting insurgents now. They are controlling traffic.        
	The reason to depute commandos in major cities stems from growing complaints of traffic violations and deaths caused by reckless driving. The traffic constable is not only harassed but at times also beaten up by offenders who claim to be relatives of powerful people and thus think they are above the law. Deploying commandos who are trained in the martial arts and can protect themselves without weapons, we hope, will instil a sense of fear in such people, especially youths, who while driving rashly risk not only their lives but the lives of others, a senior police officer said.         
	The commandos have been deployed in Chandigarh and some other towns of Punjab after an alarming increase in traffic violations and fatalities.        
	In 2007, 5,208 accidents were registered and 3,363 deaths reported. The next year, the number was 3,333 deaths in 5,409 mishaps. Last year, 3,622 people died in 6,425 accidents that were recorded. This year, 272 deaths were reported in 572 accidents in January alone.         
	Punjab police have listed 375 accident-prone areas on its website, and the list is growing.        
	We are given some basic knowledge of traffic control during training but it is a different experience while on the job, said Bhupinder Singh, as he signalled a car to pull aside for not stopping at a zebra crossing.        
	No police officer was willing to go on record on whether the commandos would be deployed for traffic duty regularly. The idea is to educate people about safe driving and the importance of obeying traffic rules. The commandos cannot book any offender personally, traffic constables stationed close by arrive immediately to issue challans.        
	Singh said: When errant drivers see us, they first think we are private guards (because of the black uniform) and get into an argument. The moment they notice commando on our uniform, they become quiet and we can overpower them by simply using our hands.         
	Another commando said: They (the motorists) drop names to get away but we have been categorically told to book everyone, even cars with red lights. The papers of those who keep arguing are confiscated and they are sternly told to go to the police station and wait for our return.

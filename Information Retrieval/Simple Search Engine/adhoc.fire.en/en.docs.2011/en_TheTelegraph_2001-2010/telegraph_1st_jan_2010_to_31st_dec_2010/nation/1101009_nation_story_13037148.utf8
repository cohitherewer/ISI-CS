The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Life in jail for Pratibha killer
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Life in jail for Pratibha killer
                            
	Bangalore, Oct. 8 (PTI): The cab driver convicted of raping and killing BPO employee Pratibha Srikanthamurthy in 2005 was today given a life term in a case that had shaken IT firms and prompted tighter safety measures for women.        
	Shiva Kumar, 27, was spared the noose but sentenced to imprisonment till death. Gowramma, the widowed mother of Pratibha, who had been demanding death, expressed satisfaction at the punishment handed down to the killer of her only daughter, saying the driver should rot in jail. Pratibhas husband Pavan Shetty echoed his mother-in-law.         
	But Pratibhas uncle H. Shrinivas, a former RBI general manager, insisted Kumar should have been given the death penalty. What is life imprisonment for a hardened criminal like him. He will just lead his life, eat and sleep. Death sentence would have put the fear of god in such criminals.        
	The courtroom saw some dramatic moments. Kumar, who had appeared unfazed so far, suddenly lost his cool after the sentence was read out and shouted: I am not guilty. I have not done it. Do a narco analysis on me.        
	Outside, as Kumar was being led away, his wife Suma, who had disowned him after the crime, threatened to commit suicide. If my husband is not released, I will drink poison and end my life, Suma screamed.

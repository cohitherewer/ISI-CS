	Darjeeling, April 13: The Queens Baton Relay for the Commonwealth Games, Delhi, will be brought to the Queen of the Hills in July.         
	Darjeeling is among the few places other than the capitals of states and Union territories where the baton will be taken. According to officials, the town has been chosen as the hills are of international interest because of the famed Darjeeling Tea and tourism potential.         
	It will be a historic day for Darjeeling. We will welcome the relay in a grand manner, Surendra Gupta, the district magistrate of Darjeeling, said.

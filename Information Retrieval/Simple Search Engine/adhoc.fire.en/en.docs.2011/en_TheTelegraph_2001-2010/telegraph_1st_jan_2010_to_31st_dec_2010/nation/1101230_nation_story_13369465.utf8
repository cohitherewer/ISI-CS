The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Solved: puzzle of Desai in terror nine 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Solved: puzzle of Desai in terror nine 
          AMIT ROY      
	London, Dec. 29: Gurukanth Desai, one of nine men charged with plotting to carry out Mumbai-style terrorist attacks in London and other cities in Britain, is a Muslim who changed his name by deed poll to take on a Hindu name, The Telegraph can reveal having consulted unimpeachable sources.        
	Why 28-year-old Desai, a married father of three young children, of Albert Street, Cardiff, felt he had to change his name and that, too, to a Hindu one must remain a matter of speculation until his Old Bailey trial next year.        
	However, as far as one can tell, Desai, despite his new name, remained a Muslim.        
	He faces serious terrorism charges, as does his brother, Abdul Malik Miah, 24, of Ninian Park Road, Cardiff, who was charged under his real birth name.        
	That clean-shaven Desai and bearded Miah, whose wife is five months pregnant, are brothers was mentioned  perhaps deliberately so  when the nine men, were remanded in custody at Westminster Magistrates Court on December 27. All nine were picked up in dawn raids by anti-terrorist police in London, Cardiff, Stoke-on-Trent and Birmingham on December 20.        
	When Desai was charged, he had to be indicted under his new legal name, not the one given to him at birth.        
	The Telegraph has independently established that Desai and Abdul Malik Miah are indeed brothers. The birth name of Desai has yet to be officially revealed by the authorities (though one unconfirmed report claimed it was Abdul Mannan Miah). It has also been suggested, though again not confirmed, that the brothers are of Bangladeshi origin.        
	The process of changing names by deed poll is relatively simple and inexpensive in Britain, though there will now be concern both on the part of the one-million-strong Hindu population and the security services if would-be terrorists are suspected of acquiring names associated with other faiths to bypass scrutiny.         
	The rule stipulates that in the United Kingdom the law permits you to change your name by deed poll at any time and for any reason. You should note, however, that it is a criminal offence to change your name with the intention of using the new name to deceive or defraud an individual or organisation. For example, it is an offence to change your name with the intention of avoiding your past creditors.        
	There is nothing specific in the rules about acquiring a new name with the intention of committing a terrorist act  not yet anyway.        
	It should be emphasised that the relationship between Hindus and Britains 1.6 million Muslims, is, on the whole, harmonious. Often, they live side by side in many parts of the country with no trouble whatsoever. Having had to confront common problems of racism, they have been natural allies to a great extent.        
	Balham in south London is a typical example of the two faiths happily living near each other, shopping in each others establishments, enjoying each others festivals and eating in each others restaurants. In the summer season, mangoes from India and Pakistan are sold side by side, a perfect symbol of amity.        
	It is also worth pointing out that most Muslims are proud of their faith and would be loath to take on a Hindu name unless there was a specific reason for them to do so. The Desai case still seems exceptional but it does appear to set a dangerous precedent.        
	A recent article in a British broadsheet explained that people change their names for entirely legitimate reasons. Divorced women, for example, often feel they need to cut off links with their ex-husbands and return to their maiden titles; foreigners Anglicise their names to try and fit in with mainstream society; people in show business frequently formalise their stage names (Cliff Richard from Harry Webb or Elton John from Reg Dwight); and job seekers, fed up with rejections because they have non-Anglo Saxon names, think life would dramatically improve if they are called something else, which does sometimes turn out to be the case.        
	Under Britains lax laws, anything goes so long as the new names are not offensive or plain silly. The law in the UK has permitted name changes by Deed Poll since the year 1760. But the Legal Deed Poll Service directors reject names such as Osama bin Laden (its been attempted) or Jesus Christ or swearwords.        
	The article pointed out: Changing names to escape prejudice  or to better fit in with the establishment  has gone on for decades. A number of Tory politicians from Jewish immigrant families have changed their names: (former Tory leader) Michael Howard is the son of Bernard Hecht; (former chancellor of the exchequer) Nigel Lawsons grandfather, Gustav Leibson, changed his name to Lawson after becoming a British citizen in 1911.        
	It added that Gideon Osborne was 13 when he rebelled and changed his name to George  after his war hero grandfather  and has since smoothly progressed to become chancellor. Life was easier as a George; it was a straightforward name, he has said.        
	In 2010, a staggering 90,000 people changed their names. That they are able to do so online for as little as 13.39 has certainly helped.        
	A spokesperson for the Legal Deed Poll Service said: While many sought to make the alteration due to divorce, boredom or to bring a little bit of cheer, others just fancied a change.         
	In Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet, the lovesick Juliet posed the eternal question: Whats in a name? That which we call a rose/ By any other name would smell as sweet.        
	The views of Gurukanth Desai on this question will now be eagerly sought.

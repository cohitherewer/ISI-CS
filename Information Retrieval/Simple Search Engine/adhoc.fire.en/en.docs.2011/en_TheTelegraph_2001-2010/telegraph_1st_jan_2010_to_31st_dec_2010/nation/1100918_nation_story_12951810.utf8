The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trinamul to assess impact of Rahul tour
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Trinamul to assess impact of Rahul tour
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mamata Banerjee and Rahul Gandhi                          
	 Calcutta, Sept. 17: Mamata Banerjee has asked her lieutenants to check out the impact of Rahul Gandhis Bengal trip and assess if it would have an effect on the Trinamul Congresss support base, sources said.        
	The Trinamul chief is also miffed at Rahuls insistence that the Congress will not bow its head before anyone, the sources said. Not only does that indicate a hardening in the Congresss seat-share stand for the 2011 Assembly polls, it is also in line with Rahuls words that the partnership with Trinamul would have to be based on dignity and respect.        
	A Trinamul general secretary close to Mamata said she had taken note of Rahuls repeated assertions. Now she wants us to sound out our men in the districts on the impact of Rahuls tour and whether support for Trinamul is the same or not. Our leader is confident of our partys vote bank but still wants an informal assessment done.        
	The MLA said Mamata had been busy over the past few days with official work and party programmes, but we kept her posted on Rahuls roadshows, meetings with Congress leaders and what has been appearing in the media.        
	Another Trinamul leader said the party leadership was concerned about the large number of youngsters who had showed up wherever the Congress general secretary went.        
	The young brigade started switching to Trinamul from the 2008 panchayat polls. In the last municipal elections too, youths voted for us in large numbers. The CPM is no longer their favourite. So, we must ensure that young boys and girls continue supporting us. It is to be seen whether Rahuls visit has had any impact on our vote bank.        
	Some Trinamul leaders said the youths might have turned up at Rahuls meeting venues out of curiosity to catch a glimpse of him. Didi has told us Trinamul is the only party that has relentlessly fought the CPM and thats the reason for our overwhelming victories, a leader said.        
	Another source said gauging Rahuls effect on the minority community was also on Trinamuls agenda.        
	A Trinamul MP said Singur and Nandigram had changed Bengals voting pattern as the minorities had then drifted from the Left and begun supporting Mamata. They had also lauded her decision to allow candidates to take rail recruitment tests in Urdu. Besides, Mamata had increased the frequency of trains to areas with high minority concentration.        
	After all this, if the Congress wants to make inroads into our minority vote bank by making Rahul visit their areas, how can Mamata tolerate that? We are keeping a watch on how the minorities react to Rahuls visit, the MP said.

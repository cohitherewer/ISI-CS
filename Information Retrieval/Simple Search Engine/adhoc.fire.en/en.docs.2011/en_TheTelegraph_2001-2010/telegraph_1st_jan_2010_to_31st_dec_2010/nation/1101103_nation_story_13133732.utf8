The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi trims big-bang hopes
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi trims big-bang hopes
  - Time to consolidate relationship with US, says foreign secretary        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Barack Obama (top) and Nirupama Rao                                
	New Delhi, Nov. 2: Dont expect dramatic breakthroughs or a big bang during President Barack Obamas three-day India visit, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao said today.        
	Rao and national security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon both tried to temper expectations from the visit.         
	The foreign secretary said Obamas visit to India was taking place at a time when our relationship has matured significantly.        
	So, it is natural that this visit would be somewhat different from the visit of President (Bill) Clinton, which took place 22 years after the visit of President (Jimmy) Carter and after a time of great strain in our relationship; or that of President Bush, when we were at an important build phase of the relationship, she told a seminar on US-India Strategic Partnership in New Delhi.        
	It will be an opportunity to consolidate all that we have built in the past decade. We are not at a stage in our relationship for dramatic breakthroughs and big bang.        
	Earlier in the day, Menon had tried to play down expectations from the visit and home secretary G.K. Pillais comments that the US did not share specific information on David Headley, a key 26/11 accused.        
	The national security adviser said the access the US gave India to Headley was unprecedented and that such co-operation was not possible five years ago. Yesterday, home minister P. Chidambaram had said the Headley issue has been blown out of proportion. Intelligence sharing (between the US and India) has been extremely good.         
	He spoke within hours of US ambassador Timothy Roemer meeting him. By tamping down the Headley issue, any minor achievement now can be touted as a breakthrough.        
	In India, (there is a debate on) how much did the US know about Headley at what time and how much did they tell us. If you look at the broader picture, the kind of access we got to Headley is unprecedented. This is not what many states do very easily, Menon said, adding that the dissatisfaction we hear, whether it is outsourcing or counter-terrorism, is because expectations from the relationship are high.        
	We should be pragmatic and work the relationship where it works... I think we have the moment where we can be ambitious about the relationship, Menon, who will visit Beijing to do the spade work for Chinese Premier Wen Jiabaos likely visit in mid-December, said.        
	Rao said India-US relations have deepened and intensified in the past two years. Since April 2010, the Prime Minister and President Obama have met six times, she said, citing the number of agreements, including one on counter-terrorism, that the two countries have signed.

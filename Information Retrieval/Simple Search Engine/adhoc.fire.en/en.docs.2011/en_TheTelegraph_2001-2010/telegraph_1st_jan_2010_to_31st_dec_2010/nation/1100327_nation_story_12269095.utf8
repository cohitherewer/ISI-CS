  - Kapoor foresees hot summer in J amp;K        SUJAN DUTTA AND ARCHIS MOHAN                                    
	New Delhi, March 26: A two-year frozen turbulence in relations between New Delhi and Islamabad is threatening to come unstuck with Pakistan saying that it is sending more troops to its border with India and India saying that it is preparing for a hot summer in Kashmir.        
	Indian army chief General Deepak Kapoor, who met Union home minister P. Chidambaram today, said infiltration of militants through the Line of Control had increased this winter compared with the winter of 2008-2009.        
	General Kapoor, who had a 20-minute meeting with Chidambaram, said that despite the increase in infiltration of militants we are fully capable of handling the situation.        
	Home ministry sources said there were at least 60 attempts by Pakistan-based militants to infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir since January. Forty militants were killed by security forces this year.        
	This effectively means that not only has a phased drawdown of troops been put on hold but the army may put more boots on the ground to make its security grid more dense.        
	A senior home ministry official read developments in Pakistan as reactionary and an effort to put the clock back to the years before former President Pervez Musharraf talked about a soft border in Kashmir and increasing economic ties with India.        
	There is a change in Pakistans strategy. They now want to keep Kashmir boiling. We are concerned because the municipal polls are coming up. But we have faced worse, the official said.        
	In London, Pakistans high commissioner to the UK told a newspaper that Islamabad had pulled out troops from the Afghan border and re-deployed them at the Indian front.        
	The government has had to send some troops down there because we dont want to leave ourselves exposed, Wajid Shamsul Hasan told The Financial Times. This is taking away from our defence capabilities on the Afghan border, he was quoted by the daily.

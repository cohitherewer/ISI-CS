	Ranchi,May 29: Jharkhand womens and girls teams will leave for New Delhi on Monday to participate in the three-day national rugby championship, starting from June 3.        
	Each team will comprise 10 players. Their performance at the meet will be taken into account while selecting the national rugby team for the Asian Games, which is scheduled to be held China in November this year, said K.K. Singh, the general secretary of Jharkhand Rugby Association.        
	He added that rugby for girls was introduced in the state last July. In less than a year, these girls have learnt the nuances of the game well. We are really impressed with their performance in the practice sessions, said Singh said.        
	The senior girls at the camp, which continued for a fortnight in Khunti, were all football players. Hence, it was a transition to a different format altogether, but they have adapted themselves very well to rugby, said coach Praveen Kumar Gupta.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 29: The defence ministry is suspecting that a nexus of junior officers and senior commanders conspired to transfer the land on which the 31-storeyed high-rise was built in Colaba in south Mumbai.        
	Two former army chiefs, a former navy chief, politicians and their relatives  including the Maharashtra chief ministers mother-in-law  had been allotted flats in the building.        
	The ministry is also suspecting that in 2003 the army doctored information on the title of the land near a military installation on which the Adarsh Society built the high-rise. Prima facie, there seems to have been a criminal conspiracy of some kind involving personnel of the Defence Estates Organisation and others. We are still establishing the facts of the case. If necessary, the investigation may be outsourced, a defence ministry officer said.        
	The government wants to take demonstrative action before the Parliament session begins on November 9, the source indicated.        
	 The Union environment ministry specifically said yesterday that it had not given any green signal to the building.         
	Ex-chiefs stand        
	Three former armed forces chiefs  retired admiral Madhavendra Singh and retired generals Deepak Kapoor and N.C. Vij  have said they would return their flats if the apartments were indeed originally meant for Kargil widows.

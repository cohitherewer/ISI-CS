                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rahul sends party-first signal in UP
  - Cong leader tells flock not to hype poll mission 2012          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Rahul Gandhi at Amethis Jama Masjid on Id-ul-Zuha on Wednesday. (PTI)                                         
	Lucknow, Nov. 17: Rahul Gandhi got his teeth examined at Amethis Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital yesterday but Congress insiders have suggested he wants them to cut their teeth on party work, not power politics, now.        
	Rahul has been telling party workers not to hype Mission 2012  the term being used to describe the Congresss target of winning the next Uttar Pradesh polls  and toil to strengthen the organisation first.        
	If one keeps emphasising Mission 2012, poll aspirants will crowd party offices, giving up work in the districts. Rahul wants the leaders to be with the people, forgetting if they will get a ticket for the next state polls, said a senior leader.        
	Rahul sent another message in Amethi yesterday. He visited an inter-college shooting competition and, while there, aimed at the bulls eye. He hit it.         
	Party leaders saw it as their MPs way of signalling to them that they need to acquire the skills and training to hit the poll target.         
	Today, Rahul was in Lucknow, where he met Muslim leaders on Id and had a quiet lunch in a restaurant before returning to Delhi.        
	Mission 2012 was coined by the Congresss unit  though Rahul insists it is a media coinage  after the young leader led last years Lok Sabha campaign and was credited with having more than doubled the number of party MPs from the state to 21 from 10 in 2004.         
	In the Assembly, the party has 25 members, a tally that will have to go up over eight times to 200 for the Congress to have a crack at power in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Immediately after the 2009 Lok Sabha poll success, the party had begun projecting itself as an alternative to the ruling Bahujan Samaj Party. Rahul had stayed in Dalit homes during the campaign, attempting to wean away Dalits and backward castes  which form the core support base of chief minister Mayavati.        
	But this year appears to have brought a reality check. Rahul, leaders say, has begun to realise that the Congress isnt able to cash in on the anti-incumbency against Mayavati because of its organisational weakness.        
	Rahul Gandhi told the party seniors not to jump into any anti-government campaign till party workers are well prepared. The leaders, therefore, are holding their ammunition against the Mayavati government till the Bihar polls (under way) and Bengal elections (next summer) are over, a party functionary said.        
	Indian Youth Congress president Rajeev Satav echoed the sentiment, saying Rahul wants party workers to dedicate themselves to the organisations revival than aim for power politics now.         
	At a Youth Congress event in Lucknow last week, Rahul had also suggested the party wasnt stopping at 2012, saying if necessary, the mission may stretch up to 2017 and 2022 (when subsequent state elections will be scheduled).         
	A section of the state leaders wondered whether Mission 2012 was being slowed down. But a senior leader clarified: All seniors have geared up for Mission 2012 but the party is no hurry to place all its cards on the table.        
	Rahul had also declared at the programme that he would not go in for an alliance with any regional party in the 2012 polls. Purna bahumat pe hi sarkar banayenge (We will come to power on our own with full majority).

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi presence on July 21 dais uncertain

	Calcutta, July 20: Mamata Banerjee usually does not let the Congress share the limelight with her but against the backdrop of the train tragedy, the presence of central leaders on the July 21 dais would have been a morale-booster.        
	Till late this evening, the Trinamul Congress leader was pinning hopes on either Pranab Mukherjee or M. Veerappa Moily showing up at the martyrs day rally tomorrow.        
	However, sources in Delhi said the possibility of either attending the rally had turned uncertain. If neither Congress leader is able to make it, they can cite prior engagements. But some are also seeing in the uncertainty a gentle reminder by the national party to Trinamul that the ally should also learn to accommodate local Congress leaders.        
	Finance minister Mukherjee has a scheduled meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Jammu and Kashmir at 10am in Delhi tomorrow. Later in the day, a meeting with finance ministers of states, including Asim Dasgupta of Bengal, is lined up.        
	Pranabda may attend the Calcutta rally only after he finishes his meeting here. But it all depends on him because he has another important meeting at 6pm here, one of Mukherjees aides said over the phone from Delhi tonight.        
	Moilys private secretary Ramakrishna Reddy said the law minister would not be able to attend tomorrows Calcutta rally because of some important meetings in the capital.         
	The minister had promised Mamataji that he would come over to Calcutta for the rally but now it is difficult for him to leave Delhi at this juncture, Reddy added. Other sources said Moily was also expected to travel abroad tomorrow.        
	The AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, K. Keshava Rao, who is camping in Hyderabad, said he would not attend the rally. Rao, who had attended Mamatas rally last year, said: This time, I cannot because of my preoccupations in Hyderabad.        
	AICC sources said their national leaders had no intention to distance themselves from Mamata. But they want her to invite state Congress leaders to tomorrows rally.        
	Pranabda had already said that Mamata had nothing to do with the train mishap because it was merely an accident. But all want Mamata to take the state Congress by her side because it will help strengthen the alliance, an AICC leader from Delhi said.        
	At a time Mamata is facing flak over the functioning of the railways, the presence of the Congress leaders would have helped her reaffirm the message that the national party is standing by her.        
	 Mamatadi had invited all the three important Congress leaders to tomorrows rally a week ago. She also spoke to Pranabda yesterday to remind him about his commitment to attend the rally, said Mukul Roy, Trinamul general secretary and the junior minister for shipping.        
	Sources said Mamata also spoke about the importance of attendance by AICC leaders. The Congress leaders presence at tomorrows rally would act as a morale-booster for our party workers at this juncture. I want the principal UPA partner to be with us at a time the CPM is holding me responsible for the train tragedy, a legislator quoted Mamata as telling a meeting of party MLAs and councillors today.        
	If the central leaders do not turn up, state Congress leaders, including Bengal unit president Manas Bhuniya, might attend the rally.         
	I have not yet received any invitation from the Trinamul Congress. I shall surely attend tomorrows rally, provided the state Congress is invited, Bhuniya said tonight.

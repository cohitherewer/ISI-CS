          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 10: The 55-year-old wife of a Burrabazar gift shop owner was found dead in her Bhowanpore flat this evening.        
	Chetna Sanghvi was lying on her back in a bed when her uncle and aunt, who live on the floor above, entered the apartment using a duplicate key as it was locked from inside.        
	Police said there were no blood or injury marks. Neither was there any sign of struggle in the room.        
	Around 2pm, Chetnas aunt came down and rang the bell but she didnt respond. Assuming that she was taking a nap, the aunt went back to her flat, said Sarbadarshi Ghosh, who lives opposite the Sanghvis.         
	The aunt came back at 6pm. When Chetna failed to respond again, the aunt called her husband and entered the flat. They called Ghosh seeing the lifeless Chetna and then phoned her husband.         
	Maheshbhai Sanghvi runs a gift shop at Kajaria Market in Burrabazar. He had left home as usual at 10am on Monday.         
	Ghosh said: It was quite apparent that she had passed away and we immediately informed the police. There was no external injury visible to the naked eye or any signs of struggle.        
	The Bhowanipore police station is a stones throw from the building on the upscale Royes Street.         
	Till late at night, the body had not been removed as police said they were gathering evidence. With the entrance to the building cordoned off, relatives of the Gujarati family were forced to wait on the road. Someone told me she (Chetna) was ill but when I came here around 10pm, I heard she was dead, said a relative sitting on his scooter.        
	The couple have a daughter, who lives in Delhi.

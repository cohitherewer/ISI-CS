          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, July 26: Jammu and Kashmirs seniormost Congress leader has blamed the previous state government led by Ghulam Nabi Azad for the unending spate of stone throwing by youths in the Valley.        
	Stone throwing and agitation is his (Azads) legacy to Jammu and Kashmir, said 90-year-old Ghulam Rasool Kar, one of the most loyal and reliable Congress leaders in the state. Kars words against a fellow Congress leader are the first note of dissent in public at a time when many in the present government have privately blamed the previous Azad dispensation for sparking the protests in 2008.         
	That Kar is not part of the pro-Azad lobby is no secret.        
	Azad lost power in state in 2008 at the peak of the Amarnath agitation when the Congresss then ally, the Peoples Democratic Party, withdrew support. The crisis arose after the government transferred 100 acres in the Valley to the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board, triggering massive anti-land agitation in Kashmir and counter protests in Jammu.         
	Kar also said last evening that Azad had mishandled the 2008 Amarnath land agitation and it was his wrong decisions that sparked the protests in which youths attacked security personnel repeatedly with stones.         
	Although showing anger by pelting policemen with stones is a decades-old form of protest in Kashmir, it touched a crescendo during the Amarnath land agitation two years ago and has not abated since.         
	Since June 11 this year, the current unrest in Kashmir has claimed 17 civilian lives, mostly because of firing by the forces. Hundreds of people, including youths, police personnel and CRPF soldiers, have been injured.         
	The authorities have also arrested hundreds of youths, scores of whom have been booked under the Public Safety Act that allows their detention without trial for up to two years.         
	Kar said: The current agitation in Kashmir needs to be resolved politically, suggesting talks involving all stakeholders in the state rather than violence.         
	Some Congress leaders, though, came out in defence of Azad today and blamed Kar for weakening the party. Kar is single-handedly responsible for weakening the Congress in the state while Azad was responsible for bringing peace and development to the state, said senior Congress leaders Asgar Karbali and S.S. Chani today in a statement.

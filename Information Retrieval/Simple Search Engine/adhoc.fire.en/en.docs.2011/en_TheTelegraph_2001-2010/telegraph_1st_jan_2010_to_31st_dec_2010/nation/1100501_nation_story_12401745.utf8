	 New Delhi, April 30: The Supreme Court today revived a PIL on an arms-landing case related to the 1993 Bombay blasts spiked by a judge allegedly because the petitioner had complained about his posing outside a private gym.          
	Gujarat High Court will now rehear the plea, dismissed over three years ago by Justice B.J. Sethna, against a government panels clean chit to top police officers in the landing of ammunition and RDX on the Porbandar coast. The cache was smuggled a little before the chain blasts and was reportedly used in the explosions.          
	The petitioner, lawyer Yatin D. Oza, alleged in his appeal to the apex court that a two-judge bench headed by Sethna had dismissed his plea only because he had complained to the President about the judges improper behaviour of flexing his muscles outside the gym.           
	Oza, a former president of the High Court Advocates Association and a two-time BJP MLA, had sought a CBI inquiry into the arms landing case. Sethna had said the PIL was just a camouflage to foster personal disputes and purely a private interest litigation. The judge also fined Oza Rs 25,000 for filing the PIL on flimsy grounds.

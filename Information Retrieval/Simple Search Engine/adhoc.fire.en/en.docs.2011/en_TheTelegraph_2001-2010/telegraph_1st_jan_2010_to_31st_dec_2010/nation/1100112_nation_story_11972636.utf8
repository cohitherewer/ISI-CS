The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | For border, a safety sheath 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      For border, a safety sheath 
          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: When it comes to the safety of Indias border guards, CBMs  confidence-building measures arent enough, the Centre has decided.        
	So, enter CVMs.        
	Condom vending machines will soon dot Indias frontiers, protecting the likes of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and Border Security Force (BSF) troops.        
	The home ministry has entrusted the ITBP, which guards the remote and inhospitable frontier with China, with buying 1,080 condom-vending machines that will be distributed among all the paramilitary forces.        
	ITBP personnel man the Line of Actual Control (LAC) ahead of the army and spend longer assignments on the field, often in remoter postings and at higher altitudes compared with the army.        
	Among all the paramilitary forces, they are the most prone to ailments such as frostbite, high-altitude pulmonary oedema and gangrene. But these are not the only health risks they face.        
	Overall, paramilitary personnel in India reported 80 cases of HIV/AIDS last year.        
	We need to encourage safe-sex practices in troops posted in far-off border areas for prolonged periods, a senior paramilitary official said.        
	The CVM suppliers will need to meet technical specifications detailed in the tender document, which says these machines:        
	 Should withstand rough handling        
	 Should not weigh more than 24kg        
	 Should not require electricity to operate        
	 Should have sleek design and fine craftsmanship        
	 Should have space for 25 packets        
	 Should dispense condoms only when the specified coin is inserted and not a fake one or one of a different denomination        
	If the last requirement sounds intriguing, officials arent explaining.        
	The condom vending machines will be distributed among the ITBP, BSF, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), National Security Guard (NSG), Assam Rifles and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).        
	Of the 1,080 machines, the BSF and the CRPF  the two largest paramilitary forces will receive 300 each. The ITBP, CISF and Assam Rifles will get 125 each; and the National Security Guard, the smallest, only five.        
	The machines will initially be placed at battalion and sector headquarters and later at the larger border outposts, including those along the India-Pakistan border in Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir, guarded by the BSF.        
	Last month, the ITBP invited tenders for the supply of these machines, with a December 22 deadline.        
	The catch for the suppliers is that they will need to transport and install these machines at far-flung places in Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam and deep into the Thar desert.

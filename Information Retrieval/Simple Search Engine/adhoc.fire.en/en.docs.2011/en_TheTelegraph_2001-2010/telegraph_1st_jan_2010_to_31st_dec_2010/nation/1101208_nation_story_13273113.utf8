The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 2G zealous Joshi puts party in a fix
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      2G zealous Joshi puts party in a fix
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: The BJP and its allies are worried that veteran leader Murli Manohar Joshi may be unwittingly weakening their case for a Joint Parliamentary Committee on the telecom scandal.        
	In his capacity as the public accounts committee (PAC) chairperson, Joshi has thrown himself enthusiastically into the job of getting to the bottom of the 2G spectrum scandal, discussing the issue in meeting after meeting.        
	His excessive zeal, his NDA colleagues fear, might undermine their stand that a PAC scrutiny is not enough. The NDAs logic has been that a PACs mandate is limited to being an auditor while a JPC is empowered to examine every aspect of an issue.        
	When the NDAs parliamentary leaders met this morning, Sharad Yadav of the Janata Dal (United) and S.S. Ahluwalia and Yashwant Sinha of the BJP raised the issue in Joshis presence.        
	They asked him why the PAC was discussing 2G spectrum so frequently when it had other issues on its plate. They stressed that if Joshi were seen to be toeing an independent line, it might take the thrust out of the NDAs corruption campaign against the ruling alliance. Yadav, sources said, was quite upset.        
	After years, we have succeeded in bringing the issue of corruption back to the mainstream discourse. If Joshi now gives the impression of going soft on the UPA, people will doubt our intentions, a Dal (United) source said.        
	Joshi has held seven meetings after taking over as PAC head in May this year. At a meeting this evening, he summoned two former telecom officials, Pradip Baijal and Siddharth Behura, to brief members.        
	Officially, the PAC has other matters to examine too but sources in the committee said that every session was informally discussing the spectrum scandal. They added that the PAC would meet tomorrow to follow up on todays briefing.        
	Its the days burning issue, a PAC member said.        
	After Yadav and the others raised their objections, however, Joshi briefed them about all the meetings he had chaired, emphasising he had not deviated from the BJPs official line.        
	He said the PAC was only examining the CAGs report; the JPC could do everything else. He said there was no conflict between the two, an Opposition source said. Some in the BJP, however, continue to be sceptical about Joshis agenda.        
	We will live to rue the day we decided to replace (Gopinath) Munde with him. The party should have known that Joshi is a bit of an individualist and has a penchant for grandstanding, a Rajya Sabha MP said.        
	Hes the kind who will make his points to the media only to prove that he is above the BJP, a Lok Sabha MP remarked.        
	Another source, however, said that if Joshi appeared over-enthusiastic, it was because he felt provoked and upset with the canard that the JPC demand was partly meant to undermine his authority as PAC head.        
	Asked what she thought of Joshis role, Sushma Swaraj said: If it seems as though he is working super-fast, its only because nothing else is happening in Parliament. Advani made it clear that our demand for a JPC will not affect Joshis authority.        
	Joshis tenure as PAC chairperson ends in June 2011. I can be re-nominated, he told The Telegraph. Many in the BJP think he will not be, unless the RSS pressures the party.

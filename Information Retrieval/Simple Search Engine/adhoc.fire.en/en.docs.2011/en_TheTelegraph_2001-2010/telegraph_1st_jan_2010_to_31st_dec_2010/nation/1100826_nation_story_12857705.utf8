          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Itanagar, Aug. 25: Former Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Gegong Apang today termed his arrest on corruption charges a blessing in disguise, musing on the times he found solace in cultivation to escape from political reverses.        
	Apang was arrested yesterday in Itanagar for his alleged involvement in a public distribution system scam. He said he had a sympathy wave in his favour. This is sure to turn out to be a blessing in disguise for me, he said.        
	I have demanded a CBI inquiry, which I strongly feel can exonerate me from false charges. Only a handful of persons tried to damage my image. No one can finish me off. Aam janta is on my side.

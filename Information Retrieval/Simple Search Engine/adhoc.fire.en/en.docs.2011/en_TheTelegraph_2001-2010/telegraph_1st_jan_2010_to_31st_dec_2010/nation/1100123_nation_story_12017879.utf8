The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Course bar on deemed varsity
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Course bar on deemed varsity
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: The Centre plans to bar all deemed universities from offering distance- education courses under new regulations after a review of these institutions found widespread abuse of quality norms.         
	The regulations, currently being finalised by a human resource development ministry task force, intend to bring down the shutters on distance education courses offered by deemed varsities, top sources have confirmed to The Telegraph.         
	These regulations will be valid for all such universities, including those found by the review to be fit for the status.         
	A central review into Indias 130 deemed varsities ordered by HRD minister Kapil Sibal found 44 unfit for the tag, another 44 short of standards but capable of improving in three years and 38 fit for the status.         
	The ministry on Monday had submitted an affidavit before the Supreme Court listing the 44 deemed universities found unfit for the tag. The affidavit states that the government intends to strip these institutions off the deemed tag.         
	These 44 blacklisted institutions alone have an estimated 74,808 students enrolled in distance education programmes.         
	Government sources said close to another 1 lakh students could be enrolled in the programmes at the remaining deemed universities.         
	The move to bar deemed universities from offering such programmes followed the review panels findings that these institutions were offering courses like engineering and even medicine through the distance mode.         
	These courses by their very nature require hands-on laboratory work, which the distance education programmes often did not provide for.         
	Some deemed universities were found to be offering long- distance PhD programmes. The review found one deemed university allowing distance PhD students to even pick their own guide. Some of the deemed universities quizzed about their distance programmes did not provide full details.         
	Under the planned regulations, deemed universities currently running distance education courses will be asked to seek affiliation from state open universities (SOUs) or the Indira Gandhi National Open University (Ignou).         
	Affiliation will ensure that the future of distance-education students currently enrolled at these deemed universities is not in peril. Students will receive degrees from the recognised open university that grants affiliation  an SOU or Ignou.         
	But once the regulations are notified, deemed universities will no longer be allowed to enrol fresh students in distance -education courses.         
	The move could, however, prove controversial and might be contested by deemed universities on the ground of discrimination as full-fledged universities would retain the right to offer distance courses, the sources said.         
	Deemed varsity status allows institutions the power to award degrees and grants them autonomy from universities to which they would otherwise need to be affiliated as colleges.

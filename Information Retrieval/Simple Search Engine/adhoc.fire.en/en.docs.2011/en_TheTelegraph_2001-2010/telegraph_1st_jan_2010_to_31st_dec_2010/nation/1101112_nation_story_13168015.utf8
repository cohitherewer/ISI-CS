  - CBI move to close two ruchika cases helps ex-cop          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          SPS Rathore                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: Former Haryana police chief S.P.S. Rathore was today granted bail by the Supreme Court in the Ruchika Girhotra molestation case, the relief coming almost six months into an 18-month sentence.        
	What helped Rathore was a submission by the CBI that it had decided to close two fresh cases filed against him last year by the family of Ruchika, who committed suicide three years after the 1990 molestation.        
	In one of the cases, the former top cop was accused of doctoring Ruchikas post-mortem report. The second alleged Rahore had got her brother Ashu tortured in police custody. The original case , charging Rathore with abetting the suicide, may go the same way, his lawyer Uday Lalit indicated.         
	The cases were filed in December last year amid a national outcry after a CBI court was seen to have let off Rathore lightly by sentencing him only to six months in jail.         
	A sessions court had increased the term to 18 months on May 25 this year, after which Rathore has been lodged in a Chandigarh jail. Punjab and Haryana High Court rejected his appeal against the sentence and his bail plea on September 1, prompting him to move the apex court.        
	The petitioner (Rathore) shall be released on bail on condition he shall not leave the country without the permission of the chief judicial magistrate (Chandigarh), Justices P. Sathasivam and B.S. Chauhan said.        
	The judges rejected the argument of the Girhotras lawyer that a free Rathore could influence witnesses  the CBIs decision to close the fresh cases was cited as an example of his clout. The bench said: The court considers bail even life convicts.

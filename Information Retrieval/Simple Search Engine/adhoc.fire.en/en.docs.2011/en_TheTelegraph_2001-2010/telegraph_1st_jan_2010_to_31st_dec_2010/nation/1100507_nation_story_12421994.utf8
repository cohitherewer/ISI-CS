	New Delhi, May 6 (PTI): A motor accident claims tribunal has awarded a compensation of over Rs 23 lakh to an aspiring model who became permanently disabled after sustaining injuries in a road accident five years ago.        
	The petitioner (Anuj Sikka) was an aspiring model who had participated in many fashion events. He could have earned a handsome amount had he established himself, the tribunal said.

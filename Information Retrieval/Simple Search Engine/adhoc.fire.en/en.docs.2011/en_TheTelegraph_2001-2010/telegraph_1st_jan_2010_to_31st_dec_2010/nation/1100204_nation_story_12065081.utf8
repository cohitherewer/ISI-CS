The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Minister Salman in the dark, CVs at play
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Minister Salman in the dark, CVs at play
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                      Salman Khursheed                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: The request came from the minister  on his letterhead.        
	Only, Salman Khursheed didnt even know that he had recommended someone for a job. Neither did his ministry.        
	Alarm bells have started ringing at the corporate and minority affairs ministry after the biodata of two job seekers landed up at the offices of two prospective employers with reference letters from the minister on his letterhead.        
	The first CV, with the reference letter attached, reached Rail Bhavan on October 30.        
	On a hunch, an official called up Rajesh Ranjan, whose CV was attached to the reference letter.        
	To his surprise, Ranjan not only denied sending his CV to the ministry but also said he knew nothing about the reference letter. He said he had sent his CV to a placement agency in Old Delhi, thats all, a police officer said.        
	It meant a conman had gained access to Khursheeds office and stolen the letterheads when no one was watching.        
	The railway ministry took up the matter and Khursheeds office was informed about the fake letter with his forged signature.        
	Khursheeds additional private secretary Giri Ketharaj then lodged a complaint with New Delhi district police in December.        
	The police have arrested a suspect and, while his name has not been revealed, most ministry staff said he was a regular visitor.        
	He would always say Hello Sir, how are you, and greet us. He claimed to be the private secretary of Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Pappu Yadav and we believed him. One doesnt try and investigate these things unless something happens. We would always run into him in corridors. We dont write such letters and can definitely say they were fakes, said a source in the ministry.        
	Incidentally, Pappu Yadavs real name is also Rajesh Ranjan.        
	The second CV with a reference from Khursheed landed up at the office of a private airline. The recommendation was for a pilots job. But Seema Malhotra, whom the letter had recommended, denied having sent any letter or CV to the airlines. But like Ranjan, she too named the same agency where she had sent her biodata.        
	This has got nothing to do with the ministry, he was a hangers-on, a source in Khursheeds department said, referring to the arrested suspect. When a new minister takes over, there is lot of chaos in the offices. One cant keep track of people coming in and going out. It happens in all ministries.        
	Its not yet clear how many such letters written on the ministry letterhead are in circulation now.        
	But one thing is certain. Next time a visitor to the ministry greets an employee with Hello Sir, how are you?, he is going to get a hard look. A long hard look.

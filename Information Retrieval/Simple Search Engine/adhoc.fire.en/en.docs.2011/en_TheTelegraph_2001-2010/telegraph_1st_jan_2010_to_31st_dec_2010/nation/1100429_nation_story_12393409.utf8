	New Delhi, April 28: The government has introduced in the Lok Sabha the Wakf (Amendment) Bill, 2010, which provides for representation of women in the wakf councils.         
	The bill also suggests the inclusion of professionals and experts in the wakf councils. It addresses the issue of inadequacies in data on wakf properties, encroachment and development of the boards properties and the absence of a statutory obligation to ensure the flow of information from the state wakf boards and state governments to the Central Wakf Council.         
	The bill proposes a specific time period for the completion of survey of such properties.        
	Besides seeking to prohibit the sale and gift of wakf properties, it suggests stringent penal provisions to prevent encroachments and provisions to streamline the process of removal of encroachments.         
	The bill gives statutory power of monitoring to the Central Wakf Council.

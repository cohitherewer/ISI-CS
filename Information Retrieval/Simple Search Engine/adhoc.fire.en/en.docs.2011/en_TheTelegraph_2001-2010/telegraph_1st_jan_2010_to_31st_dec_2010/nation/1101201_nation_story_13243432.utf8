The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | N-plant runs into protests
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      N-plant runs into protests
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 30: Trade unions and local groups have alleged that the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Park, which would have six giant French-made reactors, was given conditional environment clearance in undue haste ahead of President Nicolas Sarkozys visit starting Saturday.        
	Along with Citu and other trade unions, the Konkan Bachao Samiti and the Janhit Sewa Samiti today vowed to hold protests in Mumbai and Konkan this week.        
	They have announced protests in Mumbai on Thursday and in Madhban-Jaitapur in Konkan, the project site, on Saturday. On Friday, the groups will bring together experts like A. Gopalakrishnan, the former Atomic Energy Regulatory Board chairperson, to raise questions on the clearance to the project.        
	The groups have rejected the Rs 15 crore compensation announced by the government.        
	The issuing of the so-called conditional clearance in the absence of a consideration of radioactive risks by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board is not only premature and illegitimate but also a clear lapse of governance, Vivek Monteiro, the secretary of Citus Maharashtra unit, claimed.        
	The lapse of governance appears to be deliberate and is taking place under the undue influence of the PMO and undue haste to meet the deadline of Nicolas Sarkozys visit to India.        
	Environment minister Jairam Ramesh had laid down 35 conditions to protect the marine environment, fisheries and biodiversity at the site.

          PRONAB MONDAL AND NARESH JANA                          The rally for the IG                                        
	Salua, Feb. 21: Family members of Eastern Frontier Rifles (EFR) personnel took out a procession at the force headquarters here today in protest against possible action against special inspector-general Benoy Chakraborty.        
	Armed EFR personnel walked along the flanks of the procession, putting up a show of controlling the crowd.         
	The protesters gave the government 48 hours to drop the idea of taking action ag- ainst the IPS officer who had publicly blamed a junior over the Maoist massacre at Shilda. We will launch a bigger agitation if any action is taken against Chakraborty. We will demonstrate in front of Writers Buildings, a protester said.        
	Around 1pm, the 300-strong procession comprising wives, daughters and sons of EFR personnel, many of them carrying placards saying sach kahne ki saza suspension (punishment for telling truth is suspension), went around the compound. They came outside and blocked for half an hour the road that leads to IIT Kharagpur, barely 3km away.         
	What the IG told the media yesterday was absolutely right. None had come forward before him and showed the courage to tell the truth. We will go for a bigger movement in his support, said Manoj Chhetri, a cops son who was directing the rally with a hand-held public address system.         
	Chakraborty, who held a news conference yesterday at Salua with his face and head masked, had blamed the district police chief for setting up the Shilda camp in a crowded place and not heeding his requests to get it shifted.         
	Amid allegations that the EFR personnel lacked alertness, the IG blamed their failure to retaliate properly on the fear of civilian casualties. He also said he felt proud that his men could kill five Maoists before falling.        
	Sources at the EFR hub said Chakraborty had wanted to resign last night. He told his aides he had been pulled up by his superiors for telling the truth, which went in favour of the EFR personnel who were at the Shilda camp, a cop said. As word (about his possible resignation) spread, family members, mostly wives of EFR personnel, decided to organise the rally.        
	Although the EFR personnel in uniform did not participate in todays rally, they hung around, as if trying to control the protesters. Till now, we are not participating in the rally. But if action is taken against the IG, the force might revolt, said an EFR constable standing in front of the headquarters gate when the protesters blocked the road.        
	A policemans wife, Shanta Gurung, said: He is the first person I have seen take a stand in favour of his subordinates. It is our duty to stand behind him. That is why we are out on the streets.        
	In the Darjeeling hills, from where 13 of the 24 slain EFR personnel hailed, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha came out in support of Chakraborty. It is because of government apathy that the camp was not shifted and so many of our community members had to die. We condemn any action against Benoy Chakraborty, general secretary Roshan Giri said.

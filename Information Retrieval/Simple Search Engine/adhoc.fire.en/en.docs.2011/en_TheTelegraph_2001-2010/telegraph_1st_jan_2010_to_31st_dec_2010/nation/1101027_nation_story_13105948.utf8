The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Express duo booked for killing deer on tracks
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Express duo booked for killing deer on tracks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          A spotted deer		    
	Lucknow, Oct. 26: The driver and guard of a train that mowed down five spotted deer in Katernighat Wildlife Sanctuary in eastern Uttar Pradesh have been booked for causing harm to wildlife.        
	The animals, of which four were female, came in the way of the Gokul Express possibly on Sunday night while crossing the tracks running through the sanctuary, about 130km from Lucknow. The train runs between Kashganj and Gonda in the state.        
	Bahraich divisional forest officer R.K. Singh filed an FIR against the yet unidentified duo after discovering the carcasses on Monday morning. It was saddening to see the mangled carcasses of the animals scattered near the rail tracks. It appeared to be a case of negligent driving, he said today.        
	Singh said he had decided to file the FIR as such accidents had been recurring in the sanctuary  a tiger was killed in 2008  despite rail officials assurances that train drivers had been instructed to check their speed.         
	The 30kmph speed limit inside the sanctuary is never followed. So, we had to take this drastic step, he said.        
	A case has been registered against the duo under Section 51 of the 1972 Wildlife Protection Act for breaching conditions wilfully to cause harm to the wildlife in a sanctuary. Sources said that if found guilty, the officials could be jailed for three to six months or fined or both.        
	But prosecuting the driver and the guard wont be easy, a forest official said.        
	A similar FIR had been filed against the driver of a Guwahati-bound goods train that mowed down seven elephants in the Dooars forests on September 22. But no follow-up action was taken despite it being the largest casualty in a single incident in recent memory.        
	A Northern Railway train driver said it was difficult to spot animals silently crossing the tracks in the darkness. A train running at 20kmph requires 600m to stop after the brakes are slammed. But the driver can only see up to 50m in the dark. So sometimes it becomes impossible to stop the train on time, he said.        
	In Rajaji National Park in Uttarakhand, six elephants were run over by a train in 2007. Forest officials had then claimed that the drivers refused to be sensitive about wild animals.        
	According to a 2007 report by the Wild Life Trust of India, the broad gauge rail track passing through Rajaji National Park has killed 18 elephants in the last 18 years.

                              Sunanda Pushkar                            
	New Delhi, April 22 (PTI): Sunanda Pushkar, whose friendship with Shashi Tharoor and sweat equity in IPL Kochi triggered controversy, has said she helped the franchise raise a lot of money and was not the former ministers proxy.        
	She termed as insulting the accusation that she was acting as a proxy for Tharoor in getting the Rs 70 crore equity. Cant I make my own money? He has not been corrupt for so many years, for which I am proud to be his friend. Why would he be corrupt now?        
	Sunanda, 48, said she had met Tharoor two years back through a friend. We are certainly close now, but that closeness only developed less than five months ago. I am very proud to know him because, most of all, he is a good and honest man, she told a magazine.

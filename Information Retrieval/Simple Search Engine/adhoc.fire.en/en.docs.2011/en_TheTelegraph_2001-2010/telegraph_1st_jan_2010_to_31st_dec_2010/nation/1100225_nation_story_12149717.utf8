	Calcutta, Feb. 24: Railway minister Mamata Banerjee announced a string of industrial projects for Bengal in her second consecutive budget, in keeping with her post-election effort to project an industry-friendly image.        
	However, she underscored that no land would be forcibly acquired by the railways.        
	From large production units like wagon manufacturing and refrigerated container factories to drinking water bottling plants  the railway minister has announced industrial projects for the entire Bengal, from New Jalpaiguri to South 24-Parganas to Purulia.        
	In Bengal, other than the two wagon manufacturing units, which the railways plan to set up on their own, the rest will all be in the public-private participation mode. So, the costs have not been worked out, said a Railway Board member.        
	Railway officials said that though land had not been identified, it would not be a problem as there was enough railway plots in the places identified for the projects.        
	According to Mamatas railway budget, for the first time the railways will have their own refrigerated container manufacturing unit at Budge Budge in South 24-Parganas.        
	It is unfortunate that about Rs 35,000 crore worth of produce perishes every year and farmers are pushed into distress sale, and some of them even commit suicide, Mamata said.        
	In last years budget, Mamata had announced a Kishan Vision project under which refrigerated warehouses were be set up at various locations where farmers could store their products. The Budge Budge project announced today would manufacture the refrigerated containers to carry the goods to different parts of the country.         
	The factory will require around five acres. Highly perishable cargo can be carried in these containers, a railway official said.         
	The minister also announced the setting up of five wagon manufacturing units, of which two will be in Bengals Burdwan and Haldia. Each factory will require around 35 acres.         
	These will be the first wagon manufacturing units owned by the railways in Bengal. In this state, all wagon production units are owned by private parties. These projects will be implemented by the railways, an official said.         
	A coach manufacturing unit will be set up in Kanchrapara in the North 24-Parganas and a factory to make diesel locomotive components at Sankrail in Howrah. Each unit will require around 150 acres and will be joint venture projects. The railways will have 26 per cent share while a private party will own 74 percent, the official said.        
	A coach mid-life rehabilitation workshop, or a unit to refurbish ageing railway coaches, is also being planned at Anara in Purulia and an estimated 250 coaches will be produced every year.         
	There is a shortfall in capacity to meet the demand for coaches and such a unit is required as new trains are being announced every year. Such units are required to meet the shortfall, an official said.         
	A rail axle manufacturing unit will be set up in New Jalpaiguri. This will eliminate the demand for importing rail axles, the official said.        
	Two bottling plants for packaged drinking water were announced in the budget at Farakka and Mal in north Bengal.         
	Mamata announced the modernisation and capacity augmentation of the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works. This will increase the manufacturing capacity from 200 engines a year to 275. A centre for excellence in design, development and evaluation of new technology will come up there.        
	Railway sources said it would take sometime to start the process of setting up the factories in the PPP model. Among last years projects, two locomotive component manufacturing units were announced at Dankuni in Hooghly. Work on one has begun while the tendering process is on for the other.        
	The tender process for the Metro coach mid-life rehabilitation factory at Noapara and the thermal power plant at Adra in Purulia, also announced in the last budget, started a few days ago.

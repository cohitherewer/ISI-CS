The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Soren gone, forces fight Maoists
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Soren gone, forces fight Maoists
          OUR BUREAU                              
	June 14: Security forces in Jharkhand have engaged Maoists in a gunfight over the weekend, claiming the first tangible success in five months and ending a lull that set in when Shibu Soren took over as chief minister.        
	The encounter began less than a fortnight after Soren resigned following the withdrawal of support by the BJP. Jharkhand is now under central rule.        
	Unofficial sources put the death toll of the rebels at 10, but the CRPF, which was involved in the encounter, refused to confirm the figure. A commando from the Cobra force was also killed.        
	CRPF deputy inspector-general Alok Raj would not say how many Maoists died in the 20-hour jungle battle that began on Saturday and ended yesterday morning in Sonua-Bandgaon, 120km from Jamshedpur. We dont have the bodies and weapons to show. But it is a tangible success for the CRPF and police, Raj said.        
	The use of the word success was a turnaround from the sense of drift that marked Sorens five months in power when his government was believed to have gone easy on the rebels. Citing medical reasons, Soren had also stayed away from a meeting convened in Calcutta by Union home minister P. Chidambaram.        
	 Allegations were then levelled that Soren was repaying a debt for the help he took from rebels during the elections.         
	It was not clear how successful the security forces were in the weekend encounter but the change in attitude was evident.        
	The security forces today claimed that they had busted a busy rebel training camp equipped with a computer and a generator. The camp was being frequented by Maoist leaders and cadres from Bengal and Andhra Pradesh, the forces said.         
	Among the seizures were 21 Claymore mines, dry fish, rice and jaggery as well as three motorbikes.        
	The police fired some 3,000 bullets and the CRPF and the Cobras at least 16 mortars, while the Maoists used their hilltop advantage to fire even more heavily, sources said. I have never seen such a long encounter, Cobra commandant Rajiv Rai said.        
	 The operations will be intensified. Its an opportunity to flush out the rebels who are strategically positioned in the hilly jungles of Sonua-Bandgaon, said inspector-general (operations) D.K. Pandey.         
	The success follows the recent arrests of two middle-level Maoist leaders. Bihar police arrested Shambhu, a Bihar-Jharkhand military commission member, while Andhra Pradesh police arrested Chandrashekhar Gorebale, a member of the CPI (Maoist) state committee in Karnataka.

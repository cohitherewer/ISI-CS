          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, Feb. 23: Indias foreign secretary-level talks with Pakistan on Thursday, which will be closely monitored in every significant capital around the world, will be a wholly bureaucratic exercise if one goes by the briefing papers for the bilateral dialogue, according to those who have seen these documents.         
	With the majority of members of both the cabinet committees on political affairs and on security either opposed to the resumption of dialogue with Islamabad or reserving their judgement for now about the wisdom of such a course, there is less of political direction or input in the talks than for any similar negotiations with Pakistan in the last six decades.         
	Curiously, the situation on the Pakistani side is a mirror image of Indias: President Asif Ali Zardaris hold on power is best described as tenuous. And unlike similar past scenarios across the border, the army in Pakistan is not exactly raring to take over the reins of power despite a clear political vacuum.         
	Which leaves Pakistans foreign secretary Salman Bashir in a somewhat similar situation as his Indian counterpart Nirupama Rao. This can make or mar the dialogue: much will depend on the chemistry between the two top diplomats.         
	If they go beyond their stiffly-worded briefs to recall their days together in Beijing, joke about their respective postings in Vilnius and Moscow or discuss the lives of their two sons each who are of similar age, these two interlocutors may be able to step out of their official straitjackets and have a real conversation about bilateral relations without note-takers.         
	That offers the only hope for Thursdays talks, which are otherwise on a precipice and can collapse over disagreements which are so pervasive that there is no meeting ground even on how to conduct future dialogue between the two countries.         
	The last time chemistry worked miracles during Indo-Pakistan foreign secretary-level talks was during P.V. Narasimha Raos stewardship of the government when Indias J.N. Dixit and Pakistans Shahryar Khan got along like a house on fire.         
	It helped that Dixit could recite couplets in Urdu as easily as someone from the other side of the border and Khan, the scion of the princely family of Kurwai in what is now Madhya Pradesh and son of the eldest daughter of the last Nawab of Bhopal, could rise above the baggage that Punjabis who become Pakistans foreign secretaries inevitably bring into the dialogue with India.         
	Dixit and Khan agreed on a settlement of Siachen, but in the wee hours of the morning when the settlement was to be made public, Narasimha Rao went back on the agreement.         
	One of the few points on which Rao and Bashir will agree, without note-takers of course, is that the Dixit-Khan formula is the only possible settlement of Siachen, although their political bosses on both sides are now in no position to put that settlement on the agenda of the Indo-Pakistan dialogue. At least, not yet.         
	Officials who were present at the first meeting in New York last September between Rao and Bashir since the latter relinquished his post as ambassador in Beijing, where the former continued as envoy for another year, said it went beyond formal pleasantries.         
	The only consensus within the political leadership on the advice given to Rao as she prepares for the talks is that India should not be at all defensive during the dialogue and that whatever is put across to Bashir should be without even an iota of self-doubt on her side, according to those familiar with her brief. But that in itself will be a big change from Sharm el Sheikh where dismay, doubt and depression pervaded the Prime Ministers delegation to the non-aligned summit after Manmohan Singh and his Pakistani counterpart, Yusuf Raza Gilani, agreed to delink terrorism from their bilateral dialogue and allowed a reference to Balochistan in their joint statement.

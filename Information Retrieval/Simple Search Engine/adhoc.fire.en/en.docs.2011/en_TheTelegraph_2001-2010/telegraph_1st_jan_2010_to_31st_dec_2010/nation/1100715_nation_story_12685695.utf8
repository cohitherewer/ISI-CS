          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, July 14: A Simi operative with Lashkar and ISI links, who killed two cops while targeting policemen in hit-and-run attacks, was arrested here today after a three-year hunt, police said.        
	Vicar Ahmed alias Vicaruddin, known as a police killer and carrying a Rs 5-lakh bounty on his head, had been training guns on cops since nine persons were killed in police firing on a rampaging mob, hours after the Mecca mosque blast of May 18, 2007.        
	Vicaruddin often used Calcutta as a corridor to cross over to Bangladesh from where he had gone to terror camps in Pakistan, according to intelligence sleuths who arrested him along with an associate. Vicaruddin also smuggled weapons during his trips across the borders and recruited youngsters for jihad, the sleuths said.        
	A 9mm pistol used in one of the many attacks on policemen had helped intelligence sleuths identify the Students Islamic Movement of India operative.        
	The suspect was picked from a doctors residence in the Chilkalguda area of Secunderabad early this morning.         
	The sleuths said they had zeroed in on the 40-year-old after arresting a physician from Gujarat, identified as one Suleman, and Dr Haneef, the person who allegedly sheltered him, two days ago. The police also said they had seized two weapons and other incriminating material from the duo.        
	Andhra police chief R.R. Girish Kumar said Vicaruddin and his associate were reportedly planning more attacks.        
	Vicaruddin was allegedly involved in the murder of a home guard, Balaraju, at the Falaknuma outpost here on May 18 last year. On May 14 this year, he shot at a police picket and killed a constable, Ramesh, in the old citys Shahali Banda area.        
	In his other guerrilla-style attacks on cops since the police firing in the aftermath of the 2007 blast, Vicaruddin had injured two constables who tried to arrest him in December 2008. As he fled, he left behind a letter demanding action against all the policemen who were involved in the firing more than three years ago.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Raju shows up in court
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Ramalinga Raju                          
	Hyderabad, Aug. 24: B. Ramalinga Raju, the man behind the biggest corporate fraud in India, today briefly appeared before the CBI designated court for the first time since he was hospitalised last September for a liver infection.        
	Dressed in black trousers and white shirt, the former Satyam Computers chairman looked very frail when he showed up with his doctor and appeared to have difficulty standing. He was replying to court summons, one of the conditions Andhra Pradesh High Court had set while freeing him on bail on August 18.        
	Raju, who confessed in January 2009 to masterminding the Rs 7,800-crore accounting fraud in what was then the countrys fourth largest software exporter, waved to reporters but refused to speak to them while leaving the courtroom of XXI metropolitan judge B.V.L.N. Chakravarti. The court adjourned trail hearings till Thursday.        
	Rajus advocate Bharat Kumar said his client would approach the Supreme Court again seeking exemption from appearance in the trial court on health grounds.        
	The former Satyam chairman has skipped court appearances since he began treatment at the Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences in September 7, 2009, for hepatitis C and a liver infection. His doctors had refused to let him take part in video-conferencing from hospital.        
	Soon after Raju was granted bail, the CBI had said it would contest the order in the Supreme Court as it suspected he would be able to influence the 250 case witness, mostly former employees of Satyam.

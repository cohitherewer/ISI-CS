The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Indians in Pak seek asylum after kidnaps
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Indians in Pak seek asylum after kidnaps
                            
	Islamabad, Dec. 27 (PTI): Twenty-seven Hindu families from Pakistans Balochistan province have approached the Indian high commission for political asylum after a series of kidnappings and killings targeting the community, an official has said.         
	Saeed Ahmed Khan, a regional director for the federal human rights ministry in Pakistan, made the revelation while addressing a seminar on the unrest in Balochistan in provincial capital Quetta yesterday.         
	As many as 27 Hindu families from Balochistan have sent applications to the Indian (high commission) for asylum in India, he told the seminar attended by leaders of political parties and representatives of civil society groups.         
	In the latest incident targeting the minority Hindu community in Balochistan, unidentified men abducted an 82-year-old spiritual leader, Maharaja Luckmi Chand Garji, and four of his companions on Wednesday.         
	Three of the men were freed later though Garji is yet to be traced.         
	Several parties called a strike this week to protest Garjis abduction.         
	The strike was called by the All Parties Shehri Action Committee, Balochistan National Party, Anjuman-e-Tajiran and the Baloch Students Organisation.         
	Khan told the seminar that Hindus had been living in Balochistan for centuries but several members of the community had been kidnapped or murdered in recent weeks.        
	This, he contended, was forcing Hindus to seek asylum in India.         
	This was a matter of great concern and the government should take immediate measures to improve the law and order situation in Balochistan, Khan said.

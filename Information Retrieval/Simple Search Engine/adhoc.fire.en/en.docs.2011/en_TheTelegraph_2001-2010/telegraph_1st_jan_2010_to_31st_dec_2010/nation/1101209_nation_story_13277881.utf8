	 New Delhi, Dec 8: The government is set to put in place a vocational education framework under which students can get skill-based training in schools and can pursue graduation and post graduation in subjects of vocational education.           
	The proposed framework seeks to introduce skill-based subjects in various areas, including automobile, information technology and telecom, hospitality, financial services and insurance and construction industry. These courses will be available in schools, polytechnics and technical institutions.                  
	 New Delhi (PTI): Lt Gen. A.K. Nanda, former engineer-in-chief, has been censured by the army after a court of inquiry investigating the allegations of his sexual misconduct held that he had acted against service decorum. He was accused of misbehaviour while he was on an official trip to Israel with a junior officers wife in May this year. The inquiry, however, could not conclusively establish the charges against Nanda, defence minister A.K. Antony said.                   
	 New Delhi: India has decided to attend the ceremony where the Nobel Peace Prize will be presented to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo in Oslo on Friday.

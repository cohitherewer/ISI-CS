	New Delhi, Jan. 2: The Delhi police commissioner initiated disciplinary action against 1,428 police personnel last year and dismissed 56.         
	Y.S. Dadwal said he would not tolerate the chalta hai attitude. I have always maintained that I will not tolerate any indiscipline in the force.... I expect strict discipline, honesty and integrity in the police department, he said.         
	Since assuming office in late 2008, superseding the popular Kiran Bedi, Dadwal, 57, has suspended 10 station house officers and 30 more are facing proceedings.

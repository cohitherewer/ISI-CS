          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 9: The Commonwealth Games Federation today ordered an investigation into the ticketing mismanagement that has led to athletes performing in front of empty stands at several venues for the seventh day.         
	If people go to the ticketing counters and they dont get tickets, there is a problem. We have asked for an investigation and we hope to get a report by tomorrow, federation chief Mike Fennell said.         
	Outside Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the main Games venue, a school attendant was caught selling tickets meant to be given free to students. Police sources said thousands of complimentary tickets were being sold in the black market.         
	Attendance has improved but is still not satisfactory, Fennell said. All the venues we have checked yesterday have better attendance. We will continue to pressure the organising committee to ensure that the attendance is increased whether through sale of tickets or issuing tickets to various groups. It was house full at the boxing, wrestling and lawn tennis stadiums.         
	A senior committee official who did not want to be named revealed that tickets were not even printed in the numbers that they should have been for several events.         
	Rekha, 34, who works in a school in Moti Nagar, was caught red-handed selling complimentary passes for entry to the track and field events. The police arrested her from near the organising committee ticket counter last night, deputy commissioner (south) H.G.S. Dhaliwal said.         
	She told us she got these tickets from a physical education teacher of the school, he said, adding 96 complimentary tickets of different dates and denominations were seized from her.         
	DD does it again         
	Savpada village near Nashik in Maharashtra yesterday had tuned in to DD Sports to watch local girl Kavita Raut compete in the 10,000m finals.        
	Kavitas coach, Vijendra Singh of the Sports Authority of India, had even stuck posters in the Games Village: Kavita will be running today. Watch it on TV. Kavita won bronze  Indias first in track and field in these Games  but it wasnt on TV. I had no idea that the race will not be shown live, the athlete said today, adding she wished Doordarshan had at least telecast the medals ceremony. She was surprised when my parents and two brothers called up to know the result.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Apology blows in wind
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Apology blows in wind
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 12: Apology was in the air today, if not quite carrying the recipients address.         
	I love India and Indians. I love Mumbai and Mumbaikers and once again reiterate I, sincerely from the bottom of heart, regret having hurt so many, tweeted Shah Rukh Khan.        
	Thackerayji, are you listening?        
	We cant say for sure. The Shiv Sena and its leader were silent for most part of the day. The Sainiks were too busy getting picked up  some 800 of them were arrested.        
	When Bal Thackeray did speak, he appeared to have heard something. The Tiger, as his admirers call him, neither roared nor growled.        
	(The) Shiv Sena never insisted that Shah Rukh Khan apologise to (the) Shiv Sena, he said. Our stand was that Shah Rukh apologise to the nation.        
	SRK, of course, quickly slammed the lid on any speculation his tweet could be interpreted as an apology for saying earlier that Pakistani cricketers should have been allowed to play in the Indian Premier League, which got Thackerays goat.        
	The star clarified that he was saying sorry to his fans alone  across the world.        
	That should include the nation, even Thackeray would agree.        
	Anyway, after declaring that the agitation against My Name is Khan was successful  whatever Shiv Sainiks had to do, they did  Thackeray appeared to suggest live and let live.        
	Those who want to see the film could do so, he said in a statement tonight.        
	Let cinema theatre owners who love Khans love for Pakistan show the film...and let those who like pro-Pak elements, see the film.

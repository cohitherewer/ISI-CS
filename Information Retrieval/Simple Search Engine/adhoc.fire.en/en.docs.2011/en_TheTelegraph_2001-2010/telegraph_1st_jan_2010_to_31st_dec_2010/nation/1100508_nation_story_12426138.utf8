The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP rejects CM formula
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP rejects CM formula
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, May 7: The BJP today rejected the JMMs proposal to share the Jharkhand chief ministers post on a rotational 50:50 formula.        
	If the formula had been accepted, the government would have been headed by a BJP chief minister for half of its remaining term and by a JMM leader for the other half.        
	A senior BJP leader said his party was not enthusiastic about forming the government in Jharkhand. He said stability was of prime importance and it was nowhere in sight now.        
	In the past, the BJP had in Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka experimented with the arrangement the JMM was proposing.         
	In Uttar Pradesh, it was in a coalition with the BSP, and in the southern state, the arrangement was with the Janata Dal (Secular).        
	Both times, it bit the dust.         
	In Uttar Pradesh, Mayavati, who was the chief minister for the first half of the governments tenure, pulled out of the coalition when it was time to hand over power to the BJP.         
	In Karnataka, the Dal (Secular), led by the father-son duo of H.D. Deve Gowda and H.D. Kumaraswamy, refused to honour their promise to the BJP.        
	The political implications of this power-sharing structure, however, played out differently. The BJP paid the price in Uttar Pradesh for being outsmarted by a Dalit woman and lost its pre-eminence in legislative politics.         
	In Karnataka, B.S. Yeddyurappa projected himself as a martyr of the Gowda-Kumaraswamy machinations and got a thundering mandate in the last elections from an emotionally charged electorate.        
	It is learnt that the JMM had also insisted that the BJP should have one of its tribal MLAs as the chief minister and not an MP  a condition that irritated BJP leaders who were palpably impatient with the JMMs tendency to play big brother to a mainstream party.

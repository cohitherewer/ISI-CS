	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 2: Hundreds of tribals today participated in a rally in Kalinga Nagar industrial complex in Jajpur district to mark the fourth anniversary of the police firing in which 14 tribals had been killed while opposing Tata Steels project.        
	Vistapan Virodhi Jana Manch, the organisation spearheading the agitation against the proposed steel plant of the Tatas, held the rally in which representatives of various anti-displacement bodies that have been opposing other industrial projects took part.        
	Agitators expressed their solidarity with the anti-displacement movement in Kalinga Nagar and vowed not to allow the Tata Steel project to come up.        
	Members of the manch had blocked the Daitari-Paradip express highway since January 2, 2006, till March 9, 2007, in protest against displacement and the police firing. The blockade was lifted following a high court order.        
	The manch took out a rally from the firing spot in Champakoila village, where land has already been handed over to Tata Steel for its proposed steel project, and gathered at the Veerbhumi, the mass cremation ground of the firing victims. There, a memorial meeting was held.        
	Hundreds of local tribals paid homage to their beloved by offering flowers and oil to the memorial columns erected at the mass cremation ground three years ago. The columns were built joining 14 pieces of laterite stone symbolising the 14 firing victims.        
	A declaration was adopted at the meeting pledging support to the agitation in Kalinga Nagar against Tata Steel.        
	We are totally opposed to displacement and will not allow the steel plant to come up, said manch secretary Rabindra Jarika.        
	On the other hand, about 200 local displaced tribals held a parallel meeting at Tata Rehabilitation Colony near Dangadi, 7km from the other meeting venue.        
	We want industrialisation and progress, said a tribal villager.        
	Though eight platoons of armed police had been deployed for security there was no confrontation between the anti-displacement protesters and plant supporters today.

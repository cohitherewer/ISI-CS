The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court seeks CBI lens on CBSE card row 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Court seeks CBI lens on CBSE card row 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 2: Calcutta High Court has asked the CBI to probe why 186 Class X students of a Nadia school did not get CBSE admit cards for this years examination when 33 others from the same institution got them.         
	Justice B. Somadder, who described the case as strange business, directed the school board to issue provisional admit cards to the students for the exam that starts tomorrow. Their results will be withheld till the court gives its verdict.         
	If the verdict goes against the students, their examination will be considered null and void, the court said. They will have to register with the CBSE to sit for the examination again.        
	The lawyer for the CBSE board, M. Menon, said Vivekananda Academy in Nadias Betai area had sought the registration of only 33 students from the board, so only they got the admit cards. No registration had been sought for the other students, Menon said.         
	The petition filed by the parents of the 186 students, however, said Vivekananda Academy had taken money to register the childrens names with the board. They had paid the registration fees but did not get the admit cards.        
	The petition added that the school had applied for the registration of 150 students with the board in September 2008 and again for the same set of students along with another 36 in September the following year.        
	Rama Sharma, a CBSE spokesperson, said from Delhi that board registration rules specify that schools must register their students when they are promoted to Class IX, which is generally in April. No student can be registered after that.         
	By this rule, both registrations  mentioned in the parents petition  were invalid.        
	CBSE counsel Menon gave a different version. He said the school had applied for registration of 33 students in April 2008, which follows CBSE rules. So, they got the admit cards.        
	Mangal Chandra Maulik, the secretary of Vivekananda Academy, said the board was correct. Only 33 students of the school had been registered to sit for the Class X exams in 2010, he said.        
	The school did not apply for registration of any other student, Maulik said. Last year, we came to know that the principal had in an unauthorised manner applied for registration of 150 students. We dismissed him. We are not aware of the names of any other students being sent for registration.        
	Maulik said some years back, students of nearby schools that were not affiliated to any board used to sit for the CBSE exams by registering as students of Vivekananda Academy. But the practice had been discontinued, he added.        
	The school got CBSE affiliation in 2003.        
	Justice Somadder said: The truth behind this strange business of sending different lists at different times has to come out.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: An angry Congress leadership today forced Harish Khare, the Prime Ministers media adviser handpicked by the party itself, to issue a clarification on his critical comments.        
	 Khare had yesterday described the Congress as statusquoist.        
	Khare met the Prime Minister this morning and explained his position but was asked to issue a clarification.        
	Khare said: I attended and spoke at the seminar in my capacity as a journalist and as an analyst of the Indian political scene. My observations dealt with the Digvijay Singh government (1993-2003). I was commenting on the inherent dilemma a political party faces in bringing about social change. I have always believed and argued that the Congress party is the nations most enduring source of stability.         
	But some senior leaders still want tough action against the media adviser.

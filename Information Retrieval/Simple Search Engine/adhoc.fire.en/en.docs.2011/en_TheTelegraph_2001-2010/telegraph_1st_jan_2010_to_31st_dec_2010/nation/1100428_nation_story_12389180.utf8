          ANANYA SENGUPTA AND NASIR JAFFRY                                        Madhuri Gupta    
	New Delhi/Islamabad, April 27: Being a government information officer may ensure one is privy to very little information.        
	The Indian diplomat arrested as a Pakistani spy could have done more damage had she been in the foreign ministrys political wing rather than its information department, veteran diplomats have said.         
	Madhuri Gupta, 53, a second secretary in the Indian high commission in Islamabad, used to translate Urdu reports from the Pakistani media for the missions press and information wing.        
	The information wing is isolated from the political wing and the most vital departments. (So, she) could not have been privy to the most sensitive of documents, PTI quoted K.C. Singh, a former secretary in the foreign ministry, as saying.        
	However, Delhi police officers said Gupta used to nose around for information unrelated to her work. Besides, the intelligence agencies are probing her links with a senior RAW official in Pakistan, from whom she may have gained information but who may have been unaware of her intentions.        
	Gupta also worked as a liaison officer with various foreign missions in Pakistan, and investigations are on to find out if she had passed information to other countries as well.        
	Whatever she may have handed over, she made a packet out of it, a police officer claimed. She has revealed she earned a lot of money (by spying) and that most of the money is in Pakistan, although some has been routed to India.        
	The intelligence agencies believe she owns at least three flats in Delhi and Noida.        
	Sources said Guptas main brief seemed to have been to inform her contacts about the mood at the mission and about any strategic decision taken in Delhi on Pakistan.        
	More damage is done if it is someone in the political wing, K.C. Singh said, according to PTI. However, it is a penetration. We earlier had penetration (into an Indian mission) by the US and East Europeans, but this is a first from Pakistan.        
	Police sources said several documents had been seized from Gupta along with two mobiles, one with a Pakistani number and the other with an Indian one.         
	After having worked in the foreign ministry for 30 years, Gupta had last year been promoted to the Indian Foreign Services Group B cadre. Her post of second secretary was senior only to the entry-level one of third secretary. This seemed to have made her bitter and resentful.        
	She says she was unhappy at her postings and, over the years, became depressed, a police officer said. She felt she deserved more after so many years of service.        
	Some sources said Gupta had claimed she had done the spying to get even with certain colleagues. They did not elaborate.        
	Sources suggested the ISI, Pakistans spy agency, may have recruited her in 2006-2007, just before her present job, when she was an assistant director with the Indian Council of World Affairs, an international relations think tank.        
	Senior Pakistani officials claimed the arrest was a ploy by Indian hawks to scuttle the peace process just when it was about to take off.        
	The timing of the arrest suggests (an intention) to sabotage the meeting between our Prime Ministers. Those who arrested Gupta (on Sunday) and later broke the story to the Indian media (today) could have shelved the issue for a few more days had they been sincere about the peace process, a Pakistani security official told The Telegraph.        
	Guptas arrest comes at a time Manmohan Singh is expected to meet the Pakistan Prime Minister on the sidelines of the Saarc summit, which begins in Bhutan tomorrow.        
	A similar attempt was made in February just two days after the two countries agreed to hold talks at the foreign secretary level. An unidentified person, claiming to be a spokesman for a previously unknown outfit, Lashkar-e-Toiba al Alami, had called the correspondent of The Hindu in Islamabad to claim responsibility for the Pune blasts.        
	Another Pakistani official said: This shows the mindset of the hawks in the Indian establishment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Call to run varsity like a company
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Call to run varsity like a company
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, March 16: Private firms should be allowed to set up and run the Prime Ministers promised innovation universities like companies without any government role other than catalysing the project, Indian industry networks have told the Centre.        
	The innovation universities were conceived by Manmohan Singh as hubs that could emerge as international knowledge magnets that would attract the best teachers and researchers from across the globe for path-breaking research.        
	Assocham and the PHD Chamber of Commerce have asked the human resource development ministry to exempt private firms interested in starting the innovation varsities from basic requirements all educational institutions have to satisfy. PHD stands for Punjab, Haryana and Delhi.        
	In separate but almost identical letters to the ministry, the two industry chambers have demanded that institutions registered as companies be allowed to start the innovation universities. The demand is controversial because accepting it could signify the first step towards allowing private educational institutions to legally distribute profits.        
	Under Indias National Education Policy, education remains a strictly not-for-profit industry which means that all institutions  public funded or private  must reinvest profits into education.        
	All educational institutions must first be registered as a society under the Societies Act  which bars entities from distributing profits  before any course or degree they offer can be recognised.        
	An industrial group must start a separate society registered under the act to enter the education industry.        
	But if the demand made by the industry chambers is accepted, private firms can start educational institutions and the profits earned can be listed as company profits.        
	While both the chambers have suggested allowing companies to run the innovation varsities, PHD has recommended adding a condition barring the distribution of profits for the first 10 years.        
	The chambers have also proposed  using identical language  that the visitor will be a professional of international repute identified by sponsors and appointed by the president of the board. The president, in turn, will be picked by the sponsors.        
	But at the same time, the chambers want the government to offer tax exemptions and assistance in acquiring land for the universities.        
	The HRD ministrys blueprint for the innovation universities already grants them much greater autonomy and lesser government scrutiny than any varsity.         
	These universities can follow their own pay structure or faculty salaries, set their own fees, and their accounts will not be scrutinised by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.

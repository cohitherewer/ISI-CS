          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, June 5: A groom in Andhra Pradesh yesterday refused to marry the bride until she chanted Jai Telangana.        
	Only minutes were left for the wedding to be completed when software engineer Jayakrishna, 28, sprang his condition, a strange one even in a country used to last-minute dowry demands holding up marriage ceremonies.        
	Jayakrishna is from Nalgonda district, which is in the Telangana region, but the wedding was being held in bride Swetas village of Jaggayyapeta in coastal Andhras Krishna district.        
	Swetas parents were horrified. As a Congress activist who supported Samaikya Andhra (a movement for a united Andhra Pradesh), I was aghast that politics was set to ruin my daughters personal life, said Raghupati Rao, father of the bride.        
	Even Prabhakar Rao, the grooms father and a close friend of Raghupati, said he was shocked.        
	As the end of the muhurtam (auspicious hour) approached, everyone pleaded with the groom but he would not budge. Nor would Raghupati  who was proving to be as stubborn as his prospective son-in-law  let his daughter mouth the words.        
	Sometime around 10.40am, an hour after the muhurtam had passed, Jayakrishna relented and said it would do if the brides brother raised the Telangana slogan.        
	The brother, a student of Vijayawada Medical College, eventually shouted Jai Telangana three times. The priests quickly found another muhurtam just an hour later and sanctified the marriage to everyones relief.        
	Sources said Jayakrishna had once studied in Hyderabads Osmania University, the epicentre of last years Telangana movement. Nearly 300 students had committed suicide across the region over the delay in the grant of statehood to Telangana.        
	The issue continues to bitterly divide Andhra Pradesh, with political workers of the Telangana region boycotting rallies by leaders from other regions and even tours by ministers. The Centre has for now put the matter on ice by setting up a committee to study the demand for smaller states.

          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                                 A Raja    
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: The CBI today registered a preliminary inquiry into alleged irregularities in the grant of telecom licences since 2001 after seeking legal opinion.        
	We have registered a preliminary inquiry following the Supreme Courts directive to investigate all licences awarded over the past nine years, a senior CBI officer said.        
	The agency will now probe all decisions taken by the BJP-led government in granting telecom licences during its 1999-2004 term.        
	The preliminary inquiry will be completed in three months and it will be converted into a case after examining all documents and getting hold of evidence, if any, the officer said.        
	A fresh case could not be registered now as there was no prima facie evidence, he said.        
	Recently, the Supreme Court had directed the CBI to widen the ambit of its telecom probe to 2001 and register a case to probe whether there was any loss to the public exchequer while granting licences.        
	Last week in a meeting chaired by CBI director A.P. Singh and attended by officials of the agencys anti-corruption branch, it was planned to seek legal opinion before registering a fresh case to probe the matter.        
	We took legal advice and it was decided that we would first file a preliminary inquiry to probe the alleged irregularities since 2001. In the absence of any substantive complaints and prima facie evidence of any wrongdoing between 2001 and 2006, we need to first examine documents relating to the policy decision during the BJP-led government. We need to do our homework first before filing a fresh case, the officer added.         
	The CBI, which is now investigating complaints of irregularities in 2007-08, has to submit a status report to the Supreme Court by February.        
	Last week, the agency questioned former telecom minister A. Raja on advancing the cut-off date for allocating spectrum and on the role of his relatives in companies that allegedly acted as a front for telecom firms that got spectrum between September 2007 and January 2008.

	Bhubaneswar, March 27: If the Centre gives its nod, Talsari beach on the Orissa coast along with Digha in Bengal will be developed into a tourist circuit.        
	A proposal to this effect was put forth by the Orissa government during a meeting between chief minister Naveen Patnaik and Union minister of state for tourism Sultan Ahmed here last evening.        
	State tourism minister Debi Prasad Mishra said the state government had identified 700 acres for the project to be developed in the private-public-partnership mode and the Centre had been requested to provide funds for development of core infrastructure for the project, which would attract middle-class domestic tourists.        
	Talsari  just around 10km from Digha  is located on the coast near a river mouth.         
	State-run Orissa Tourism Development Corporation has also accommodation facilities in the less-frequented beach.        
	During the discussion, the state also sought central support for establishment of an international convention centre in Bhubaneswar to attract tourists to Orissa.         
	The chief minister has proposed an international convention centre to attract tourists to Orissa. We will consider it, said Ahmed.        
	Development of tourism infrastructure in Buddhist heritage sites also figured in the discussions.         
	Of course, there is ample scope for development of Buddhist tourism in Orissa. However, there is a lack of marketing initiative and publicity, Ahmed observed.        
	Mishra said the state sought an extension of the Delhi-Kolkata Maharaja Classical Express, modelled on the Palace of Wheels in Rajasthan, to Bhubaneswar.         
	We have suggested that the train can be diverted from Bodh Gaya to Bhubaneswar on its way to Bengal, said the minister.        
	At present, the train takes 12 days and 11 nights to reach Kolkata to Delhi. The journey time can be extended to 12 days and 12 nights, he said.         
	The Union minister assured the state to consider if the state government sent a detailed proposal, sources said.        
	The state also urged for conversion of Food Craft Institute at Bolangir into an Indian Institute of Health Management and offered to provide additional land for it.         
	Besides, the state government has also demanded establishment of an Indian Institute of Hotel Management in Rourkela.

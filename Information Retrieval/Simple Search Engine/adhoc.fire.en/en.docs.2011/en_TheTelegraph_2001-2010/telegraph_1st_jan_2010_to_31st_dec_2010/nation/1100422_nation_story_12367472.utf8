The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul meets Amar as part of wider plan
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rahul meets Amar as part of wider plan
          SANJAY K. JHA                                     Rahul Gandhi, Amar Singh                                  
	New Delhi, April 21: Rahul Gandhi has expanded his strategy to revive the Congress in Uttar Pradesh before the 2012 Assembly elections.         
	While the Congress general secretary has involved many senior party leaders in the process to obtain inputs from different sources, he has also reached out to fringe players, including expelled Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh who is fighting for political survival.         
	Rahul is trying to inject fresh life into the Congress organisation by arranging several statewide rallies, like the Chetna Yatra he flagged off on Ambedkar Jayanti. He is also working out constituency-wise electoral strategies to counter the partys two main rivals  the BSP and the Samajwadi Party.         
	Another option he is exploring is the possibility of taking the help of smaller groups in the state.         
	Sources said the most significant development on this front was Rahuls secret meeting with Amar, who has been trying to cosy up to the Congress ever since his ouster from the Samajwadi Party.         
	But the antipathy that most senior Congress leaders nurse against Amar has prevented any formal communication with him even though he kept sending feelers through informal channels. It is learnt that Rahul finally agreed to meet him last month and discussed many issues.         
	Although the issues they discussed touched upon the possibility of Amars inclusion in the Congress, sources said that was not Rahuls priority at this stage. Amar would have to prove his political worth and commitment before thinking of joining the Congress, the sources added.        
	Some leaders feel Rahul may be interested in an informal and secret understanding with the outfit Amar has floated.         
	Amar may not have much political clout of his own but he knows Uttar Pradesh and the Samajwadi organisation inside out. He can be useful to the Congress as a spoiler by fielding influential candidates to hurt his former party and the BSP.         
	In constituencies where the Congress has considerable strength, some assistance from Amar can turn out to be crucial in multi-cornered contests. His efficacy will then become an important factor in the decision on his entry into the Congress after the 2012 polls.         
	Rahul has not depended on a single channel for advice and inputs even within the party. Although Digvijay Singh, the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, has been working hard on strengthening the organisation, Rahul has invited his predecessor Satyavrat Chaturvedi to make presentations on the states political realities.        
	Chaturvedi and Digvijay are not known to think alike but pressure from a section of local leaders, particularly Brahmins, compelled Rahul to widen the consultation process.         
	A section of the Congress are plotting to oust Digvijay from Uttar Pradesh as they suspect his assignment has given him an opportunity to get closer to Rahul.         
	Many senior Uttar Pradesh leaders have also conveyed to Rahul that Digvijays style of functioning has created rifts within the organisation. But it is true that no general secretary has worked so hard in the state in the recent past. There has been a dramatic improvement in the Congresss performance in the last Lok Sabha election.

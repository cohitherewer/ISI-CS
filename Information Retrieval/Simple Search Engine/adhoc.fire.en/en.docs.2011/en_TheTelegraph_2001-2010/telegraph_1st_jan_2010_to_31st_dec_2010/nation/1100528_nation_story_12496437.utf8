	New Delhi, May 27: A junior sailor with the Indian Navy has been arrested on the charge of passing on sensitive information to Pakistans ISI, with police claiming they caught him with photographs of critical installations.        
	Chand Kumar Prasad, posted in Mumbai at the navys aircraft maintenance unit, was picked up from New Delhi railway station yesterday.        
	He was a junior sailor posted at INS Shikra in Mumbai and was on leave for the past week. Other details are being investigated, Western Naval Command spokesperson Capt. Manohar Nambiar said in Mumbai.        
	The arrest came a month after Madhuri Gupta, a diplomat in the high commission in Islamabad, was picked up for spying for Pakistan.        
	Police sources said among the documents found on Prasad were a photograph of the strategic Hindon air base near the capital and a map of the Meerut Cantonment area, the second-largest cantonment in India.        
	Sources said the 24-year-old, whose movements were being tracked, was planning to travel to Nepal via Uttar Pradesh to meet an ISI contact. Prasad was today produced before a magistrate, who sent him to police custody for five days.

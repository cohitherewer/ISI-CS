          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 13: Calcutta police tonight decided to step up vigil at Eden Gardens for the India-South Africa Test following the blast in Pune.        
	Once central security agencies veered round to the view that the blast appeared to be a terror attack, Calcutta police officers went to the Eden to oversee a search of the premises and the entry points. The Eden will host the Test from tomorrow.        
	The joint commissioner of police, headquarters, Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner, south division, Supratim Sarkar, and the deputy commissioner, special branch, Parthasarathi Ghosh, were among the officers who went to the stadium at night.        
	The number of police personnel for overnight surveillance at the Eden was increased from 50 to 200. They were posted at the entry points and the empty spaces between the stands. Radio flying squads will patrol all roads around the Eden.         
	For tomorrow, the police strength at the playground has been increased from 1,500 to 2,000. Personnel in uniform and in plainclothes will patrol the ground.        
	Frisking will be more intense and more women police personnel will be deployed since they have to check ladies handbags as well, Shamim said.

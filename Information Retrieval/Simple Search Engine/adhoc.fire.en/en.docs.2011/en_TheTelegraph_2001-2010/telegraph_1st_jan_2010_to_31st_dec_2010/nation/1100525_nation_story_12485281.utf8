The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sushma signal at Rajiv ritual
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sushma signal at Rajiv ritual
          J.P. YADAV                          Sushma (left), Sonia                                  
	New Delhi, May 24: Sushma Swaraj showed up at Rajiv Gandhis memorial Vir Bhumi on his 19th death anniversary on May 21, becoming the first BJP leader to make what her party described as a new beginning.        
	The move, termed a good gesture by some BJP leaders, is significant as Sushma had threatened in 2004 to go bald if the Italian-origin Sonia became the Prime Minister. Sushmas party, the BJP, was leading the NDA government then.        
	But on May 21, Sushma, now leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, walked into Vir Bhumi and sat in the enclosure where Sonia was present along with Vice-President Hamid Ansari and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	It reflected that Sushma and her party had realised that burying personal enmities was more beneficial. Otherwise a routine affair for the leader of the Opposition to be present at a government programme, Sushmas visit attracted attention as no other BJP leader who has held the House post in the past had done so. Sonia took note of Sushmas presence. She greeted the BJP leader from across the enclosure.        
	BJP leaders acknowledged, though not in so many words, that after their successive Lok Sabha poll defeats in 2004 and 2009, they had realised that personal attacks on Sonia and Prime Minister Singh had been unwise moves.        
	The jibes, they admitted, had put off urban middle-class voters, the BJPs core supporters who had turned away from it. A pointer to this was the BJPs failure to win the state polls in urban Delhi three times now.        
	After Sushmas tirade against Sonia in 2004, the BJP carried the strategy in the 2009 general elections, when BJP prime ministerial candidate L.K. Advani mocked Singh as a weak Prime Minister.         
	The charge had provoked the otherwise soft-spoken Singh to hit back and turn the tables on Advani by questioning his iron-man image by making references to the release of terrorists in Kandahar as the NDAs home minister.        
	In the soul-searching after the 2009 general election defeat, the BJPs top brass found its personal attacks on Singh had misfired. For the middle class, Manmohan Singh presents a no-nonsense image in the crowd of discredited politicians. Targeting him seemed to have been an unwise move, said a BJP leader.         
	Since 2009, a perceptible change has been seen in the BJPs stance towards the Congress, in and out of Parliament. The barbs at Sonia and Singh almost seem to have become things of the past. Instead, the womens reservation bill brought Sonia and Sushma closer.        
	BJP MP S.S. Ahluwalia  known to be close to Sushma  termed her Vir Bhumi visit a good gesture for a healthy democracy and hinted at the BJPs desire for a bipolar polity, with regional parties marginalised completely. Political untouchability is a virus affecting regional parties like the ADMK-DMK, Mulayam-Mayavati and others. National parties should be free from it in the interest of nation building, he said.         
	But the change in stance could also be driven by the BJPs failure to achieve larger Opposition unity in Parliament and the realisation that the party continues to be a political untouchable for the Lalu Prasad-Mulayam Singh Yadav combine and the Left.         
	Ahluwalia said the Congress should rise above its prejudices. The Congress should return the gesture by paying respect to (Veer) Savarkar. He was a freedom fighter and the Congress shouldnt have any problem.

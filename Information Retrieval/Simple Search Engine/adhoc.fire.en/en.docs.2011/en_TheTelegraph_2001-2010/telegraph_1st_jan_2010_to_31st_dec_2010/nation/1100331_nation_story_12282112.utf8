          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Horse Nettle weeds endanger crops                                  
	Cuttack, March 30: Positive strains of Horse Nettle, an alien weed, which has the potential to hamper agricultural production and harm both human and livestock population, have been located in three more regions in Orissa, according to scientists of the Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI).        
	Horse Nettle, with its high level of toxicity, can particularly affect grazing livestock. Consumption of the weed can cause health problems  ranging from diarrhoea to paralysis.         
	T.K. Adhya, the CRRI director, today said plants of this invasive weed species had been detected at Keonjhar districts Ghasipur, Chandbali area in Bhadrak district and Sadar area of Cuttack district.        
	Quick response teams of scientists have already been despatched to these areas to make an assessment of the situation. They will initiate measures to prevent and control spread of the invasive weed in collaboration with field personnel of the state agriculture department in these districts, he said.        
	Fears of invasion of alien weeds in Orissa had come true when the first incidence of germination of Horse Nettle was detected in Niali area of Cuttack district in December last year.        
	As part of the National Invasive Weeds Surveillance Programme, CRRI launched the search for five invasive weeds in nine districts  Balasore, Bhadrak, Mayurbhanj, Sundargarh, Keonjhar, Jajpur, Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur and Cuttack.        
	The objective of National Invasive Weeds Surveillance Programme is to eradicate the possibility of the spread of these alien weeds, he said.

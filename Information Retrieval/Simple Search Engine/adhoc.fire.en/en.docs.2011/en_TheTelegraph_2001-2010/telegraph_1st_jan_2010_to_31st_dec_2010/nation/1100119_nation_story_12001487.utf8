  - Petition not to club community with Hindus rejected        OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Jan. 18: The Supreme Court today dismissed a petition demanding Sikhs be taken out of the definition of Hindu as provided in the Constitution.        
	We do not have the power to direct Parliament to amend the law, a bench headed by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) said.        
	Petitioner Joginder Singh Sethi had said the matter was an emotional issue with Sikhs and sought a court direction to the Centre to amend Article 25 of the Constitution.        
	Explanation II to Article 25 says that any reference to Hindus should be understood to include a reference to Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists.        
	A Constitution review committee, headed by former CJI M.N. Venkatachaliah, had recommended that Explanation II be deleted.        
	It has been eight years since the commission submitted its recommendations, Sethis counsel Mukul Rohatgi said, urging the court to ask the government to implement the report.        
	This (Explanation II) amounts to saying that the Sikhs are virtually Hindus. Their identity as Sikhs then goes, the petitioner said.        
	He added that the definition posed several practical problems for Sikhs.        
	For instance, the communitys marriage laws are governed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Sikhs face problems when they migrate abroad since their marriage certificates are issued under the Hindu Marriage Act whereas they have declared their religion as Sikhism on their immigration forms, the petitioner argued.        
	Besides, the Hindu Marriage Act does not recognise several Sikh wedding customs. For instance, the petitioner argued, Sikh marriages include no saptapadi (seven steps round the fire) unlike most Hindu marriages.        
	Sikhs generally follow the now-repealed 1909 Anand Marriage Act, the petitioner said, asking that this law be revived and renamed the Sikh Marriage Act. Even Pakistan has a Sikh Marriage Act, though Sikhs are a small minority there, he said.        
	The court sympathised with Sikhs for the problems they face during immigration, but said Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists had been included under the term Hindus only for convenience. It said: It is just a grouping for the purpose of implementation of the laws.        
	At the height of militancy in Punjab, protesters had burnt copies of the Constitution demanding Sikhs be treated as a separate religious community. The government had then agreed but has sat on the matter for decades.        
	The Venkatachaliah panel also suggested that Article 25 (2)(b) be reworded to include a separate reference to the Sikh, Jain and Buddhist religions.        
	This clause allows the state to pass any law on social welfare for Hindus or reform of their religion, or to throw open Hindu public religious institutions to all sections of Hindus.        
	The review committee had suggested the clause be reworded to say the state could make any law providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu, Sikh, Jain or Buddhist religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of these religions.

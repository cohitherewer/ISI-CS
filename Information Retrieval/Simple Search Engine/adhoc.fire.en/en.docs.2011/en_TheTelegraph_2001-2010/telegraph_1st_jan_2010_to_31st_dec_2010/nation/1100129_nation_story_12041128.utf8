	New Delhi, Jan. 28 (PTI): The Prime Minister is understood to have sought an explanation from women and child development minister Krishna Tirath over how the picture of a former Pakistani air force chief appeared in an ad published by her ministry.        
	Ministry sources said she had yesterday explained to Manmohan Singh the procedure for taking out such ads. They said Tirath had sought two weeks to probe the lapse and submit a report, but the PMO wanted it done faster.        
	The sources had earlier said the minister had not involved the directorate of advertisement and visual publicity (DAVP), the agency responsible for preparing all government ads.

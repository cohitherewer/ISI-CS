          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, Sept. 6: A Commonwealth Games swimming medal prospect faced possible uncertainty over his participation after being injured in an attack apparently prompted by a feud with a classmate over a girl.        
	Chennais M.B. Balakrishnan, the national champion in 50 and 100-metre backstroke, is back home from hospital and insists he will recover in time for the October 3-14 event in Delhi. But coach T. Chandrasekaran fears his training may be hampered.        
	The 21-year-old suffered a cut on the back of his head and contusions in the Sunday morning assault with cricket stumps by two persons while he was on his way to a pool in west Chennais Shenoy Nagar for training.        
	Balakrishnan was rescued by autorickshaw drivers and admitted to a private hospital. The two attackers fled. The swimmers parents, both doctors, have taken him home saying they would nurse him back to health.        
	Today, Balakrishnan expressed confidence that he would make it to Delhi. Winning at the CWG (Commonwealth Games) for our country has been my dream and I am sure I will recover and speed up my training to be at full fitness.         
	Coach Chandrasekaran appeared cautious. The stitches on the head and the contusions will heal in five days. But they could still interrupt his training, which is essential to keep the momentum and the fitness level at a peak.        
	Balakrishnan told police he had no enemies but a preliminary probe revealed the swimmer and a classmate from their engineering college were interested in the same girl.         
	The girl had spurned the other boy after Balakrishnan won the 50-metre gold medal in the SAF Games last month. This apparently angered his classmate. He had even tried to assault Balakrishnan in the college canteen earlier but the swimmer had slipped away, said a police officer.

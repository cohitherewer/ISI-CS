                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pending proof, plan for Pak talks on track
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES                      Krishna and Chidambaram on Sunday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 14: The foreign secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan slated for February 25 appear on course with New Delhi ruling out any knee-jerk reaction to yesterdays Pune blast and preferring to wait for the probe.        
	Sources in the government said India did not want to play into the hands of terror outfits by cancelling the meeting. They said security agencies had to first come up with concrete evidence in the attack  as in the case of 26/11, after which India had blamed the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba and suspended the dialogue.                  
	External affairs minister S.M. Krishna refused comment on whether the Pune blast would affect the talks but stressed that the process couldnt be hostage to strikes. They (terrorists) want to create fear and suspicion. They sow seeds of distress to create confusion and we will not be cowed down by terror, he said in Chennai.        
	Krishna suggested he would rather wait for the preliminary probe report to be handed in before reaching conclusions. I am not going to talk about the talks right now. Let us wait for the report (of the investigative agencies) first. By this evening, we will be in a position to get the report. Once the report is available, the government will evaluate the whole situation and then we will do deep monitoring, the minister said.        
	Earlier in the day in Delhi, national security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon met Manmohan Singh along with home minister P. Chidambaram to brief the Prime Minister on the events. Menon and Singh are seen as architects of the talks offer.        
	But late this evening after visiting the site of the explosion and the victims in Pune, Chidambaram refused to be drawn on the talks, saying the matter will be considered in New Delhi. I have not come here to answer questions on the diplomatic or external affairs side. Those are matters we will consider in Delhi.        
	Pakistan, too, seemed to see no hurdles. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said: We condemn terrorism in all its manifestations. We want to be freed of terrorism and this menace. Asked whether the talks would be successful, Gilani told a news conference in Rawalpindi: Let the dialogue process begin first.        
	Sources in Delhi said India and Pakistan shared a complex and accident-prone relationship, and incidents like yesterdays attack were not entirely unforeseen. Last week, the sources had spoken about possible hurdles and warned that a repeat of the Mumbai strike would be a huge setback to the planned talks.        
	However, despite early suggestions from security agencies that either the Indian Mujahideen or its handlers in the Lashkar or Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) may be behind the Pune explosion, the Centre is treading with caution in the absence of a smoking gun linking the strike with any of the Pakistani outfits.        
	India has decided, however, to strongly raise the issue of terror during the February 25 talks and the fact that top leaders of the JuD, an alleged Lashkar front, continued to engage in anti-India propaganda. Under the lens is the February 5 speech of JuD leader Abdur Rahman Makki justifying attacks on India. The speech was made a day after India made public its talks offer. The Pune attack came a day after Pakistan formally accepted the offer.        
	The sources, however, cautioned that any evidence of a Pakistani hand in yesterdays strike would make it difficult for India to go ahead with the talks. The BJP, the main Opposition, has already come out against resuming the talks.        
	The US and British governments denounced the attack. We condemn the cowardly attack on innocent people in Pune last night. The UK expresses its wholehearted solidarity with India. Our sympathies and condolences are with the families of all those affected in this incident, said a British foreign office spokesperson.         
	The US expressed outrage and offered all possible assistance in the investigation. The US remains shoulder-to-shoulder with India in the fight against terror and will help bring the perpetrators of this cowardly act to justice, Timothy J. Roemer, the American ambassador to India, said in Delhi this evening.

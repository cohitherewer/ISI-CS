The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Panel nod to impeach Calcutta judge
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Panel nod to impeach Calcutta judge
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: A Rajya Sabha-appointed probe panel has found Justice Soumitra Sen of Calcutta High Court guilty of misbehaviour related to misappropriation of funds, setting the stage for his impeachment.        
	The conduct of Justice Soumitra Sen as a receiver when he was an advocate and his series of acts and omissions, as well as his conduct, after he was appointed a judge are matters that bring dishonour and disrepute to the higher judiciary. They shake the faith and confidence which the public reposes in the higher judiciary, the three-member panel headed by Supreme Court judge B. Sudershan Reddy said in its report.        
	If Sen is impeached, he would go down as the first judge in India to have been removed. The first impeachment motion against a judge  V. Ramaswami  collapsed in the Lok Sabha in 1993 following abstentions by Congress MPs. Ramaswami retired as an apex court judge in 1994.        
	Judge impeachment rules under Article 124 of the Constitution require a judicial inquiry  by a peers group  to precede a political inquiry. The Rajya Sabha had set up the panel on December 16, 2009. Former Punjab and Haryana High Court Chief Justice Mukul Mudgal and jurist Fali S. Nariman are the other members.        
	The report will now go to the business advisory committees of the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha. Once the phraseology is finalised, it will have to be passed by both Houses in the same session with a two-thirds majority of members present and voting. But the number of votes should not be less than the simple majority of each House. Once adopted, the motion will have to be presented to the President to pass a formal order of removal.         
	Before the vote, Sen will get an opportunity to defend himself in the House, either in person or through a lawyer.        
	The judge declined comment but his lawyer Subhash Bhattacharya said the process followed by the authorities concerned in prosecuting his client was bad in law. Bhattacharya said lawyers would defend Sen before Parliament and that his client would surely be found innocent.        
	A key factor will be the stance of the Trinamul Congress given the fact that the Left had initiated the impeachment motion against Sen in the Rajya Sabha and set the ball rolling for the committee to be formed.        
	Eyes will also be glued to whether the Congress will follow ally Trinamul as the matter relates to a Calcutta judge. The Congress will also be under the spotlight because of its stand in the Ramaswami impeachment case, though spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan hinted today that the party may back Sens removal.        
	Let me study the report. But let me categorically say that whether it is the legislature, executive or judiciary, we would certainly like to see that the highest degree of probity and integrity is maintained, she said.        
	Told about the Ramaswami case, Natarajan argued that Sens was different. I do not understand the comparison between the Justice Ramaswami case and that of Justice Soumitra Sen....We should not compare these two issues.        
	The misrepresentation by Sen  who had repaid the funds  had influenced a division bench of the court to strike down an order of a single-judge bench that he was guilty, the panel said. This misrepresentation influenced the division bench to expunge the adverse remarks against Justice Sen. Sens lawyer Bhattacharya argued that the judgment of the division bench has been ignored.         
	Sen had claimed that the money was invested to earn more interest in a company called Lynx India Ltd  while he was found to have kept the funds in his personal bank account. His contention that he suffered losses because the company wound up in 1999-2000 was also incorrect, the panel said in its report.

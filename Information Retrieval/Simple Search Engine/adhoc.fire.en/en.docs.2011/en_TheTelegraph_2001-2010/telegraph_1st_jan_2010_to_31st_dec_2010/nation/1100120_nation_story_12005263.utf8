The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Politics steps aside, almost   My God! UPA chief going to Buddhababus chamber? 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Politics steps aside, almost     My God! UPA chief going to Buddhababus chamber? 
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                                                Sonia Gandhi by the body of Jyoti Basu at the Assembly. Picture by Amit Datta      
	Calcutta, Jan. 19: The Assembly buzzed with expectation since noon. She would be arriving any moment, was the word.        
	But the minutes ticked by till, around 12.30, CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim whispered into Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees ears.        
	The chief minister promptly stood up, stepped out of his Assembly chamber and walked down to the VVIP entrance of the House at the Calcutta High Court end to welcome the woman whom his party had abandoned 18 months ago over the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	Bhattacharjee had followed the same ritual earlier in the day to receive Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, Union urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy, Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Lalu Prasad and former Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu as they arrived to pay their respects to Basu.        
	Yet there seemed an added urgency to the chief ministers steps this time, a glint in his eye and a smile on his lips.        
	Please ensure order. The CM has said so. Dont allow the media to rush in, we cant compromise with Sonia Gandhis security, an official from the chief ministers secretariat told the police.        
	Bhattacharjee was accompanied to the VVIP entrance by Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim, leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee and leader of the Congress legislature party Manas Bhuniya.        
	Special Protection Group personnel threw a security ring around the entrance. Minutes later, Sonias convoy rolled into the Assembly portals. It was 12.40.              
	A smiling Bhattacharjee offered a namaskar. Sonia, who wore an off-white silk sari with black stripes and a long black cardigan over it, reciprocated. Please come, the chief minister said.        
	He guided the Congress president, with Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee following, into the enclosure where Jyoti Basus body lay.        
	By then, CPM leaders had stopped allowing visitors to come up to the dais to take a look at Basu. Party MP and politburo member Brinda Karat, the late Subhas Chakrabortys wife Ramola and Debjani Ghosh, wife of Basus confidential assistant Joykrishna Ghosh, were urged to step off the dais because Sonia would be arriving any moment.        
	Please clear the dais. Too many people have assembled here. VVIPs are coming in. The Congress president and the Bangladesh Prime Minister will arrive soon, announced CPM state committee member Rabin Deb, prompting many party leaders to climb down from the dais.        
	The chief minister ushered Sonia in. Salim, state finance minister Asim Dasgupta and CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury stood in line as she stepped on the dais. The crowd erupted and began shouting that they be allowed to move forward to catch a proper glimpse of Sonia.        
	A few hundred surged towards the rostrum as the Congress president inched forward and asked Mukherjee to lay the wreath on Basus body. As Mukherjee did so, she moved to the other side, looked at Basus body and bowed.        
	For a minute, silence reigned. Bhattacharjee motioned to Sonia, showing her the way out of the enclosure. She walked out silently.        
	Condolences over, it was time for pleasantries.        
	Sonia walked down the Assemblys serpentine corridors to the chief ministers chamber to meet Basus son Chandan and his wife Rakhi.        
	Trinamul Congress MLA Jyotipriya Mallick wondered aloud: The UPA chairperson going to Buddhababus chamber? My God!        
	The chief minister murmured something while walking down to his chamber, to which Sonia smiled. Following them were Asim Dasgupta, Halim, Yechury, Jaipal Reddy, Congress Working Committee member K. Keshava Rao and a host of other Congress leaders. Mamata Banerjee had skipped todays programme but Partha Chatterjee walked into the chief ministers chamber along with the rest.        
	It was left to expelled CPM member and former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, waiting in the chamber with wife Renu, to introduce those present. Somnath sat to Sonias left; Mukherjee and the chief minister to her right.        
	Soniaji spoke to Chandan and his wife and son Subhojyoti first after settling down on the sofa. She spoke to the chief minister and Yechury for a few minutes, a source said. But she listened more than she spoke.        
	Sonia left at 12.55, after 15 minutes in the Assembly with the media kept at a distance, but not before she had had a cup of black tea.

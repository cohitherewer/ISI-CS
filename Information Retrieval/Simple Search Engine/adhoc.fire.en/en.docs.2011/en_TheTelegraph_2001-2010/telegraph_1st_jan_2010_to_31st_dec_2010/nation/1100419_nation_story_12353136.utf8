          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Family members of a patient wait outside the casualty department of a hospital in Bhubaneswar during the strike on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	Cuttack, April 18: SCB Medical College Hospital authorities said they had adequate number of additional doctors to tackle the influx of patients following a strike by peripheral doctors of the Orissa Medical Service Association from today.         
	While 50 members of the association at the hospital joined the strike from today, there had been a steady rise of patients, especially for OPD, after the association stopped receiving patients in remote areas a couple of days ago.        
	Hospital superintendent D.N. Maharana said members of the Orissa Medical Teachers Association at the medical college had been pressed into duty.         
	He added that he had made arrangements for a number of assistant professors of different departments to manage the casualty ward. Four ambulances have also been pressed into service at the casualty ward to meet any unforeseen situation.        
	The pathology department has been asked to take over management of the hospital blood bank.         
	While the hospital receives 1,500 to 2,500 patients for outdoor services at different departments every day, it has 1,200 to 1,400 indoor patients at any given point of time.        
	As part of its contingency plan, the hospital had issued directives to all doctors on leave to rejoin duty immediately.         
	A temporary embargo on granting leaves had also been issued. If necessary, the doctors will put in extra hours of duty, he said.        
	Chief district medical officer Manorama Dei said all the 64 Ayush (ayurvedic amp; homoeopathic) doctors, along with 29 allopathic doctors appointed on contractual basis, had been engaged to monitor patient care services at the City Hospital (district headquarters hospital) in the city and the 14 primary health centres in the district.

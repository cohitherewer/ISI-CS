          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, Oct. 18: A Gujarat High Court judge was left stunned when the lawyer of a Dalit petitioner argued he would not be able to do justice to his case because he was a Brahmin.         
	This court has come across such argument for the first time from a learned advocate after it assumed office as judge of this court, Justice R.R. Tripathi said, dismissing Atul Ramjibhai Makwanas petition.         
	Makwana had approached the high court against the Junagadh district judge, who, he said, was favouring only Brahmins for the posts of Class III and Class IV staff in his office. His lawyer, A.M. Chauhan, told the court that nearly 60 per cent of selected candidates were Brahmins.         
	The petitioner, who had applied for a job, said interviews were conducted twice but he was not called.         
	Then, Chauhan submitted: The surname suggests that Your Lordship also belongs to the same community (Brahmin) and, therefore, I want that this court may not take and hear this matter. The lawyer wanted a non-Brahmin judge to hear the case.         
	Taken aback, Justice Tripathi said it was a fit case for issuing notice for contempt against the learned advocate and, if he is making this submission on instruction of his client, then against him also but he was restraining himself.         
	The learned advocate seems to have made the aforesaid submission only with a view to either bring pressure on the court and obtain a favourable order or to get his matter out of this court, he said.         
	The court deems it proper to dismiss this matter so as to discourage such a practice.         
	Dalit activist Valji Patel said the advocate should not have made such an insinuation. The petitioner raised a genuine issue but in casting aspersions on the high court judge, the main issue got lost, he said.         
	Chauhan, who is planning to appeal to a division bench, said the petition was dismissed without behind heard on merits.

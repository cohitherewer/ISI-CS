          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 3: The Supreme Court has ruled that fast-track courts, set up to ease the load of pending cases in subordinate courts, will continue to function in all states till further orders.        
	Most of these courts were created under a centrally funded scheme on April 1, 2001, and were expected to lapse within five years. But they have since been given repeated extensions, the last one valid till March 31, 2010.        
	The scheme will continue till further orders, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan said. There are 1,734 such courts in the country, dealing mainly with cases that are over five years old.        
	Trial courts have the largest number of pending cases, of over 2.5 crore, followed by 1.5 lakh cases in the high courts and 50,000 in the Supreme Court. The average time taken to dispose of cases in trial courts is over 10 years.        
	Five fast-track courts were envisaged to be set up in every district to clear the backlog. The scheme functions under the respective high courts, and the infrastructure is provided by the state governments.        
	The Supreme Court, acting on a petition filed by Brij Mohan Lal, has been monitoring the functioning of such courts since they were set up. At the last hearing on the petition on February 26, the apex court expressed unhappiness over the fact that several states had still not created the sanctioned number of such courts.        
	Bengal, for example, has so far only created 120 of the 151 courts sanctioned. But in Assam, all 20 fast-track courts have started functioning, as also in other north-eastern states. Other states yet to create the sanctioned number of courts are Gujarat (sanctioned 166, created 65), Andhra Pradesh (sanctioned 108, created 71), Orissa (sanctioned 72, created 44), Uttarakhand (sanctioned 36, created 26), Maharashtra (sanctioned 187, created 115), Madhya Pradesh (sanctioned 85, created 68) and Delhi (sanctioned 20, created 8).        
	The Supreme Court directed the states chief secretaries to explain why vacancies in fast-track courts have not been filled up, and also asked the registrars-general of the high courts in the states to give explanations. Appointments are usually made to these courts by the state governments on the basis of the recommendations made by the high courts. The court also asked the Centre to make fresh budgetary allocations.        
	Attorney-general G.E. Vahanvati, appearing for the Centre, assured the court that fresh budgetary allocations would be made for the fast-track court scheme. The Union budget has allocated around Rs 74 crore.

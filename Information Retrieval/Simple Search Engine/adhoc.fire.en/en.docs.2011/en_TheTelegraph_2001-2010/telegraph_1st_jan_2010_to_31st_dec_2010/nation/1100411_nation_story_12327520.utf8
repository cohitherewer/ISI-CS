          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, April 10: A young woman whose scarred forehead constantly reminded her of the man who molested her three years ago stabbed her tormentor to death after seeing him tease a girl yesterday.        
	Muzaffarnagar resident Rachna Kumari, a mother of two children, ran into her house, took a knife and drove it into Anil Kumars stomach. Kumar, 35, a habitual offender who was released from jail about a week back, died on the spot.        
	Rachna then went to a police station and surrendered.        
	Sanjay Garg, sub-divisional police officer in Purkaji, some 425km from Lucknow, said Rachna has been arrested.        
	Rachna, 25, had been molested on a crowded road in 2007 at Tughalpur, 1km from Purkaji, by Kumar. Based on a complaint she filed, Kumar was sent to jail.         
	While Kumar was in jail, Rachna got married to a brick kiln owner and had two kids. But though three years had passed, the scar on her forehead reminded her of her molestation constantly, Garg said. Rachna, the police officer added, while trying to wriggle free from Kumar, fell on the uneven road and cut her forehead. Yesterday, her anger swelled up when she saw Kumar teasing another girl.        
	Garg said Rachna was working in the kiln but couldnt control her fury. She took a knife from her house, came back and plunged it into Kumars stomach which caused his death.        
	Police sources said Kumar was a habitual offender and had several cases against him, including rape.        
	The sources said Muzaffarnagar had one of the highest figures of gender crime in Uttar Pradesh.

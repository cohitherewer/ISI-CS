          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, July 18: A tribal widow who boils river herbs and snails for food but doesnt have a BPL card to get government help has put her two children up for sale in a Malda village that is among the districts poorest.        
	Shanty-dweller Myno Baskes plight has come to light at a time the Centre is working to pass a food security law for the really poor  the benefits of which are unlikely to reach anyone without a BPL card.        
	The 50-year-old woman lives in a bamboo hut in Old Maldas Najarpur, which is barely 15km from the flyover-studded Malda town but remains one of the poorest of the districts 634 villages.        
	Dulal Chaki, the deputy chief of the local Muchia panchayat, said he could not help as the family did not have a BPL card. He was silent when asked why the card was not being issued despite Myno having a voter ID.        
	Five years ago, Myno had lost her husband, and two years later, she sold her elder son, then aged 14. I got Rs 2,000 from a contractor. I had sold my son Rajesh to him. What could I do? I cant feed my children. I dont know where he is now. Nobody has come to our help, not even the panchayat, said Myno.        
	Her younger son, 13-year-old Subhash, has been suffering from a weakness, unable to get up from bed for days at a stretch and Myno is determined to sell him, too, along with daughter Fulmati, who is 11.         
	At least he will get food. He is always ill. I collect herbs that grow on the riverbank, and snails when I get them. We boil them for food. Even that is not available everyday.         
	All of Najarpur knows about Mynos search for buyers. Neighbour Shiben Das, a labourer, said: We try to help her. But everybody here is poor. We cant feed them everyday. She wants to sell her children. All of us know about it.         
	District magistrate Pramol Kumar Samanta expressed shock. The government does not have a dearth of funds. How can a woman sell her children for want of food? I am shocked the family has been deprived so long. I will ask the BDO to visit the family, said Samanta. The proposed food law is to kick in next April in a fourth  or 200  of the countrys poorest belts.

	New Delhi, Dec. 10: An arm of the countrys teacher-education regulator has been accused of perversely denying recognition to teacher-training institutes, contributing to the acute shortage of schoolteachers in the country.        
	The Jaipur-based northern regional committee (NRC) of the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) turned down each of the 373 institutes that applied for recognition this year, a review committee of the human resource development ministry said.        
	The (ministry) committee found that the NRC adopted an obstructionist approach. The institutes had applied for NCTE recognition for running BEd and MEd courses in the 2010-11 academic session, a source told The Telegraph.        
	It was found that the NRC did not adhere to the laid-down procedure and acted in an arbitrary manner. It asked for certain documents that were not required. Prime facie it seems the NRC harassed the aspiring institutes on the pretext of deficiencies or lack of documents.        
	An NCTE official said the 15-member NRC, headed by its director Y.S. Yadav, has now been dissolved.         
	The NCTE is the apex body mandated to achieve a planned growth of teacher education in India. It has four regional committees that grant recognition to teacher-training institutes if they fulfil land, infrastructure and faculty requirements.

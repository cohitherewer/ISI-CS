          ZEESHAN JAWED                          Punit Kumar Shaw                                  
	Calcutta, May 29: Punit Kumar Shaw wanted to stay back for his best friends wedding. Today, his friends were still waiting for news from Rajabandh, hoping against hope as rescue workers cleared coaches S5 and S6 of the Jnaneswari Express.        
	Had the 25-year-old accounts executive with a mobile service provider not boarded the train, he would have been at his friends wedding this evening.        
	Punit had reluctantly boarded coach S5 of the Jnaneswari Express on Thursday night. He wanted to stay back because his best friend and classmate from college was getting married, said friend Sunil Gupta. But his sister, who stays in Raipur, insisted that he come for her brother-in-laws wedding. So he left on Thursday night, Gupta recalled, sitting on the terrace of 9A Kings Road, the marriage venue in Howrah.        
	Till Thursday evening, Punit, too, had been sitting here with his friends, making plans for the wedding. Today, his friends sat in a huddle, a picture of gloom.         
	Gupta and some other residents of the area had rushed to the site of the crash on Friday morning to search for Punit but returned in the evening after a long, futile wait because rescuers hadnt yet started taking out bodies from the two coaches. Coach S5 was almost buried under the engine of the goods train, Gupta said.        
	Till early this afternoon, there has been no news of Punit because the rescue workers couldnt make much headway in clearing coaches S5 and S6, Punits brother Basant said from Rajabandh.        
	The two coaches were finally cleared late this evening, but there was still no news of Punit.        
	A former student of a central Calcutta college, Punit had joined the mobile service provider at Salt Lakes Sector V last year and was preparing for his MBA.        
	He was doing well for himself and his family members wanted him to get married soon, Gupta said. They are inconsolable.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karats Bloc prem day
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Karats Bloc prem day
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Netaji                                  
	New Delhi, May 5: Prakash Karat, heading the CPM that had been critical of Subhas Chandra Bose, took time off from his partys central committee meeting today to attend a convention organised by the Forward Bloc to press for declaring Netajis birthday as desh prem day.        
	Karat, in a brief speech, assured ally Forward Bloc of full support in the campaign to compel the central government to formally declare Netajis birthday  January 23  as desh prem day to instil patriotism among citizens.        
	Karats desperation to keep ally Forwad Bloc in good humour was linked here with the upcoming civic elections and the Assembly polls next year where the CPM faces a tough battle.         
	Karat said that the Azad Hind Fauj was a great example of secularism and wondered why the Congress-led government did not accept the demand for declaring Netajis birthday as desh prem day.         
	Karat said the ministers seem to be more interested in IPL franchises and not bothered about recognising the contributions of a great freedom fighter like Subhas Chandra Bose. The government does not have to make any expenditure on this, he said.        
	CPI leader A.B. Bardhan said: We have no problem in accepting that we (the communists) made a mistake in assessing the role of Subhas Chandra Bose.        
	The central government had recently turned down the demand made by the Left parties to declare Netajis birthday as desh prem day.         
	Many eminent personalities took part in the freedom struggle of India and the immense contribution made by them cannot be judged relatively. If at all a day is to be declared as desh prem divas, it does not appear to be appropriate to be so declared on the birth anniversary of any particular personality, a minister had said in reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha.        
	Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad were among the invitees to todays meeting but could not make it, though the Samajwadi leader sent an MP.

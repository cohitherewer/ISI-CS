The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Another email threat 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Another email threat 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Naveen: Worried                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 8: Even before the police could crack the source of the email threat sent to chief minister Naveen Pattnaik on March 27, his office received yet another email last night threatening a repeat of the Dantewada massacre in Orissa, if the joint operation against Maoists was not stopped.         
	The email, like the previous one, has been sent from the id plga.ocac.in and takes responsibility for the death of 11 policemen in Sundays blast at Koraput. It has threatened to invade the official website of the state and destroy the information network.         
	A complaint has been registered with the police. We are investigating the case. It will be inappropriate to disclose anything now, police commissioner B.K. Sharma said.         
	The earlier mail that came on March 27 warned of attacks on vital installations in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Puri. It had also threatened to avenge the injuries inflicted upon top Maoist leaders Kishenji and Bikram. It was traced to the Czech Republic and had been sent from the domain anonymizer.in that hides the senders details including his Internet Protocol (IP) address.         
	State-run Orissa Computer Application Centre authorities said that they have contacted the Czech authorities who confirmed the email was sent from Orissa through BSNL. We have asked for more details, said an officer of the centre.         
	For the first time, the commissionerate registered a criminal case under Section 66 A (Cyber Crime) and 66 F (Cyber Terrorism) of the Indian Information Technology Act-2008. A case has also been registered under Section 506/507 of the Indian Penal Code.

	New Delhi, April 21: The heat got to the man who wanted to turn the heat on the government.        
	Nitin Gadkari, the youngest president the BJP has ever had, today passed out briefly at a rally here against price rise, apparently unable to bear the Delhi scorcher even as older leaders around him seemed to have endured it. L.K. Advani, 83 and Murli Manohar Joshi, 76, were among the veterans who attended the event.        
	The 53-year-old Gadkari collapsed in a vehicle just after finishing his speech at the Ram Lila grounds. Unlike him, the other leaders werent driving away from the venue: they had just started a march to Parliament.        
	Aides and colleagues rushed to allay any impression that the BJP chief wasnt well. Gadkarijis health is now okay, said party leader Vijay Jolly soon after Gadkari regained consciousness.        
	Party insiders say the bulky Gadkari, who is particular about his yoga and sticks to a healthy diet as part of his weight-loss regimen, had eaten only poha (lightly fried flattened rice) and papaya for breakfast. The suggestion was that the light diet may have left him weaker and less prepared to cope with the heat. Other leaders, too, appeared to have been drained out. None of the bigwigs stayed till the end at what was touted as the partys biggest show of strength in recent months in Delhi.         
	In his speech, Gadkari said the BJP would sound a war cry against price rise so loud that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would hear it. But at the venue itself, he hardly seemed to be heard: few were seen clapping.        
	The speeches were fine, but its the heat. I have braved the heat to pledge my support to the cause of the party I believe in, said Om Prakash Sharma from Madhya Pradesh.        
	For 35-year-old Sugai Devi from Bihar, the speeches seemed fine, even though she couldnt identify a single leader who took the dais. Its very uncomfortable because of the heat. But I liked all the speeches.

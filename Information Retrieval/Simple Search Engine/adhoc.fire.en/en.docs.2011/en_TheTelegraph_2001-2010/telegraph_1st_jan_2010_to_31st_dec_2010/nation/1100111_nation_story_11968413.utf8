The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amar sends MLA alert to Mulayam
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Amar sends MLA alert to Mulayam
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 10: Amar Singh has sought to flash an unstated warning to Mulayam Singh Yadav that he should not be taken lightly, stung by the insinuation that he was a power player with no popular following other than a flock of Bollywood stars.        
	The first sign that Amar would not go without putting up a fight was evident in a letter sent to Mulayam on Sunday by Moradabad MLA Sandeep Aggarwal.         
	Aggarwal said Amar had enhanced the Samajwadi Partys national profile and it was in Mulayams and the partys interests to retain him.         
	Aggarwal told The Telegraph he had spoken to Amar before writing the letter and claimed that 25 other MLAs and five MPs were ready to quit the party with Amar. However, he named only one, Azamgarh MLA Chippu.         
	Aggarwals letter was meant to show that Amar had a base in the Samajwadi Party independent of Mulayam, and that it was not confined to Bollywood imports, the phrase used by Mulayams cousin and Rajya Sabha MP Ram Gopal Yadav to describe Sanjay Dutt, Jaya Prada and Jaya Bachchan.         
	Sanjay resigned last night as a party general secretary, and the two Jayas were said to be contemplating a similar move.        
	Asked about the letter, Mulayam said: I will not react to any Tom, Dick or Harry. I challenge this MLA to resign. I dont know how people like him get elected on our party symbol.        
	Today, the Samajwadi chief sounded conciliatory towards Amar and maintained he would not let go of his estranged confidant.         
	Mulayam told reporters in Calcutta that he would not accept his (Amars) resignation. Everything will be sorted out.        
	But later in the day, he claimed: These words were put into my mouth. I told the reporters clearly that I am here to call on Jyoti Basuji, whom I deeply respect, and I will not make political statements.         
	He said he had not spoken to Amar. I will speak to him when it is necessary. First let him return to India.         
	Mulayams son Akhilesh Yadav, who heads the Uttar Pradesh unit of the party, said: This is a serious political issue and cannot be resolved through the media and blogs. Amar Singh is my uncle and a member of our family. We keep saying things, good and bad, to each other. In fact, we spoke a while ago.         
	Asked what he thought of Ram Gopals accusation that Amar had brought the party to ruin, Akhilesh said: At the end of the day, our party should not be enfeebled and our workers should not be confused. Beyond this, I will not say anything.         
	Mulayam will spend the next two days in his hometown Saifai, meeting party colleagues and workers to get a sense of the unfolding events and their political ramifications.         
	The Samajwadi old guard led by Ram Gopal lay low today after being rebuked by Mulayam and Akhilesh. They were told that if they thought Amars blogs criticising the Samajwadis on the eve of the Uttar Pradesh legislative council elections had caused damage to the party, their broadsides had not helped either.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Enter: CPM-like regimen; Exit: culture clan   Mamata pulls off disciplined show

  Mamata pulls off disciplined show          DEVADEEP PUROHIT                                     
	Calcutta, July 21: Mamata Banerjee is today doing what the CPM has been doing for years and, doing it better.        
	After coining successful slogans and routing the CPM in successive polls  panchayat election in 2008, Lok Sabha elections in 2009 and the civic election in May this year  Mamata has shown that she can beat her main political rivals at organising mammoth, but disciplined, rallies.        
	Although estimates of the turnout at todays gathering ranged from 20 lakh (Mamatas claim) to three lakh (official figure from police), there was little doubt that todays martyrs day rally was the biggest in the recent past. But more than the numbers, the disciplined show became the talking point by the end of the day.        
	I have never seen such a planned and well-organised Trinamul rally. It was almost like a CPM rally, said a senior Calcutta police officer with over two decades of experience in managing such political gatherings.        
	Not only did Mamata sing We shall overcome  a common theme in Left meetings  with gusto, the CPM-style slogan chanting with clenched fists and rhythmic clapping with the songs from the ranks made the rally look different from a normal Trinamul event.        
	Trinamul sources told The Telegraph that everything about the rally  the seating arrangement on the four stages, who would speak when, and deployment of leaders at key places around the stage  was planned at 30B Harish Chatterjee Street well in advance to avoid confusion. Senior leaders like Mukul Roy, Partha Chatterjee and Subrata Bakshi implemented the plans without leaving any margin for error.        
	Stage I, where Mamata spent most of the time, was meant for 40 people, including the MPs, guests like Keshava Rao of the Congress and former MP Krishna Bose. All other leaders sat in their designated places Such discipline is rare, said a source.         
	Who will sit where is key to planning any CPM rally, where the seats are determined on the basis of the leaders position in the party.         
	Not just the leaders, even the ranks sat through todays three-hour rally maintaining order, barring a few exceptions.        
	We had 20 camps across the city to control the sea of people who were heading towards the meeting venue. We had to stop lakhs of people from reaching the venue as it could have created chaos there, said Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee.         
	In the heyday of the CPM, party secretary Biman Bose often used to claim that lakhs of people were stopped midway to avoid a stampede-like situation at the Brigade Parade Grounds.        
	Today, it was Mamatas turn to crow about the turnout. Putting the turnout figure at 20 lakh, she called it the worlds biggest gathering.         
	According to sources in the Trinamul camp, specific instructions were sent out to district party leaderships to drum up support for todays programme and get as many people as possible to make the rally a success.        
	I travelled 12 districts in the past few days explaining the political significance of the meeting and the need for their (supporters) presence, said Subhendu Adhikari, the Tamluk MP who is also the state president of the Trinamul Youth Congress.        
	CPM leaders like Subhas Chakraborty had perfected the art of filling up the Brigade for big-ticket rallies by bringing people from far-flung districts.         
	When Mamata was claiming success for getting people from remote villages in North Dinajpur, Malda and Murshidabad, she was probably sending a message to Alimuddin Street that she has beaten them at their game.

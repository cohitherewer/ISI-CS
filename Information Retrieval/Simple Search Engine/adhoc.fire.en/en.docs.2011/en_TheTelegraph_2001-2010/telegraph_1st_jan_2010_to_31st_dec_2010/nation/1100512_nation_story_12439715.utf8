The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Online result trial for CBSE
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Online result trial for CBSE
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, May 11: Students may receive their Central Board of Secondary Education certificates online as a trial before the government introduces a law requiring all Indian educational institutions to place academic qualifications on a tamper-proof database.         
	The human resource development ministry plans to ask Indias largest school board to award its Class X and Class XII certificates on a secure online depository, before expanding the plan to cover all academic qualifications.         
	Top government officials have told The Telegraph that the CBSE will be asked to act as a pilot for the project, and that the HRD ministry ideally wants the board to offer online degrees this year itself.         
	But the board will be able to give the degrees online this year only if the ministry successfully identifies a depository for the task in time, the officials added. CBSE results are normally declared by end May, though the board has not issued a formal date yet.         
	If the ministry fails to select a depository by the end of this month, it may ask the board to try the online method while releasing the results of entrance examinations it conducts, such as the All India Engineering Entrance Examination or the All India Pre Medical Test, sources said.         
	It may otherwise need to depend on other government examinations to test the project before making it mandatory, or will have to wait till next year to use the CBSE examinations to conduct a trial run.         
	Over 1.6 million students appeared for the CBSE Class X and XII board examinations this year.         
	The process of selecting a depository comes even as the ministry finalises the National Database for Academic Qualifications Bill, 2010. Under the bill, all institutions  central and state school boards and all higher educational institutions  will have to place the academic qualifications they offer on the depository.         
	The depository will be tamper-proof and each student will have a unique account  like with dematerialised accounts for shareholders  where the contents of the documents cannot be changed.         
	Each time the student produces transcripts of his academic performance for higher studies or while applying for jobs, the institution or employer can verify the authenticity on the depository.         
	The move is aimed at curbing the practice of fraudulent degrees frequently used by students and job applicants and follows a series of complaints over the past few years received by the government, especially from foreign countries.         
	The HRD ministry is likely to pick either the Central Depository Services Limited or the National Securities Depository Limited  the countrys two registered online depositories for stock market securities  to maintain the database.         
	The ministry has just started the process of issuing requests for proposals from these two depositories, the sources said.

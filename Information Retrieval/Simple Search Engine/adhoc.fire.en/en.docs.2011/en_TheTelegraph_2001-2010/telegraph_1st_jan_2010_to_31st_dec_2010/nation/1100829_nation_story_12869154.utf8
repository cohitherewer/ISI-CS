	Mumbai, Aug. 28: The civil aviation authority today suspended 10 crew members of a Jet Airways flight a day after several passengers were injured after being allegedly goaded into jumping off the plane onto the tarmac following a mistaken fire alarm.        
	While punishing the two pilots and eight cabin crew members for serious procedural lapses, the directorate-general of civil aviation (DGCA) summoned the training chiefs of all airlines for a review of training procedures for cabin and flight crew.        
	The incident at Mumbai airport has hung another cloud over Indian civil aviation, which is already plagued by near-collisions and radar blinks.        
	Several passengers said they had been asked to jump off the Chennai-bound plane, a claim that remained puzzling in the face of the airlines insistence that escape chutes had been opened and the passengers taken down.        
	A Jet spokesperson blamed the injuries on the panic that set in after crew thought they had detected a fire as the aircraft taxied before take-off and the pilot ordered an evacuation. A passenger, Amit Mitra, said the crew had asked a woman to jump from a height of 22 feet. They were saying Jump, jump right now, vacate the plane.         
	Jency, another passenger, said: We were all asked to jump from the wing side... (which) is too high. There were many old people.        
	Aviation sources said the cabin crew may not have briefed the passengers properly. They said the pilot had erred by failing to activate a dousing tool called fire bottle and instead ordering evacuation. Also, though the fire alarm related to the left engine, the left exit was opened along with the right.        
	The DGCA said 14 of the 131 passengers were injured. Jet said four passengers - two with fractures  were still in hospital. It added that the evacuation had followed standard operating procedures. An inspection found no fire, smoke or any other abnormality. The DGCA has ordered an inquiry.

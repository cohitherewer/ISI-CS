	Jan. 8: Amitabh Bachchans proximity to Amar Singh and his bonhomie with Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi could lead to the exit of his wife Jaya Bachchan as a Samajwadi Party member of the Rajya Sabha.        
	Sources said Jaya was unlikely to be re-nominated to the Upper House given her familys friendship with Amar, who had fallen out with Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and resigned from the posts he held in the party.         
	Jayas term ends in July along with those of six more Samajwadi MPs.         
	Highly-placed sources said that away from the public glare, Mulayam and Amar fell out over, among other issues, the Bachchans.         
	Amar, according to the sources, was aware that close friend Amitabh was planning to approach Modi with a request for a special screening of his home production Paa.        
	When Mulayam, who has been championing the cause of Muslims, got wind of it, he sought a clarification. The Samajwadi chief was told that Amitabh had his own independent life and his action has little or nothing to do with the conduct of Jaya as party MP.         
	Mulayam, the sources said, was not convinced, pointing out that the actor had served as unofficial ambassador of the Samajwadi Party and even featured in its campaign capsules. Amar, it is believed, continued to lobby for Jaya, but Mulayam, the sources said, made it clear that politically the party cannot be patronising the wife of someone who is nudging close to Modi, under whose chief ministership hundreds of Muslims were slaughtered in the Gujarat riots of 2002.         
	The Samajwadis strength in the Uttar Pradesh legislature has vastly reduced since 2007 and this will impact its numbers in the Upper House. Instead of seven, the party can only get two members elected.         
	Therefore, we will choose our candidates judiciously, keeping caste and religious equations in mind. Two of the MPs who will retire are Muslims (Kamal Akhtar and Amir Alam Khan). We will definitely have a Muslim candidate. It is not necessary we will re-nominate the outgoing members because we need to project a youthful face. There are competent and hard-working youngsters who deserve a place in the Upper House, said a member of the Samajwadi parliamentary board.        
	Amitabh, who has lavished praise on the Gujarat chief minister in his blog, has raised eyebrows across the political and social spectrum by describing Modi as shahenshah and offering himself as tourism ambassador of Gujarat.         
	Bollywood sources see the bonhomie as an effort by Amitabh to look beyond Uttar Pradesh, where the Samajwadis arch enemy Mayavati has entrenched herself.         
	Modi has already been picked out for praise by industrialist Anil Ambani, a friend of Amitabh and Amar, and, the sources said, it was natural for the actor to follow the path charted by the business tycoon.         
	Amitabhs supporters, however, insist his meeting with Modi was only a request to make Paa tax-free in Gujarat. The actor has also written in his blog that he had offered to promote Gujarat as he was impressed by its cultural heritage.        
	The BJP stressed that no political spin should be given to the Bachchan-Modi bonhomie. It has nothing to do with Amars resignation. The timing of his meeting with Modi was coincidental and it was a social event, a BJP Rajya Sabha MP said.        
	Amitabhs Samajwadi association too had begun with social meetings that started a little before Amar became close to Mulayam. The actor used to address Mulayams rural meetings when he was re-elected as chief minister in 1993.        
	Disillusioned with the Bachchans, Mulayam, the political sources said, is now turning to Amars bete noire Azam Khan, who is set to return to the Samajwadi fold.         
	If Khan is indeed considered for homecoming, it would upset the other Jaya in the party. Actress Jaya Prada, along with her namesake Jaya Bachchan, formed part of the Amar cabal in the party.         
	Jaya Pradas candidature from the Rampur Lok Sabha seat had provoked resentment in the party and led to the departure of Khan, its most prominent Muslim leader.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: Small but well-armed teams of the Lashkar-e-Toiba have infiltrated Mumbai and Ahmedabad to cause trouble during the festive season, according to an alert by intelligence agencies to police commissioners of the two cities.        
	Two teams of less than a dozen people each have entered the two cities sometime after the last week of November and have been conducting reconnaissance of likely targets, sources said.         
	Last week, the Union home ministry sent out alerts to the two police forces specifically.        
	For more than 24 hours now, Mumbai police have been conducting house-to-house searches in some areas of the city, home ministry sources said.         
	Additional forces were deployed in markets, religious places and bus and railway stations in the two cities.        
	Both cities had been sites of terror attacks, especially since 2008. Since then, intelligence flows have improved substantially but so has the quality of attempts by terrorists, claim intelligence agencies.         
	This year, over 15 plots by terrorists to trigger blasts have been foiled because of intelligence inputs that have come from both within and from agencies like the CIA or the Israeli Mossad, according to the sources.        
	We have been continuously receiving inputs from intelligence agencies about possible terror strikes. We are analysing these inputs and taking things very seriously, Mumbai police commissioner Sanjeev Dayal said, asking residents not to panic.

	New Delhi, Jan. 16 (PTI): The Congress today refused to speak on the purchase of 150 copies each of three books by Shashi Tharoor by his own ministry of external affairs.        
	This is something that falls in the domain of the foreign ministry. The party has nothing to say, party spokesman Manish Tiwari said.         
	The books are for Indian missions abroad. A media report had hinted Tharoor had used his clout to sell his books.        
	Tharoor hit out at the bash ST (Shashi Tharoor) brigade on Twitter. He said my books had been bought by MEA years before I had anything to do with government, no idea they had again last year.

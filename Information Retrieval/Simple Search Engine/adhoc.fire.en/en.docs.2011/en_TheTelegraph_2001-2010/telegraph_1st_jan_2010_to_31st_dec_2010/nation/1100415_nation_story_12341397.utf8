          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 14: Neither Shashi Tharoor nor Brinda Karat will like this common factor: both have received unflattering text messages from the same place.         
	While the junior foreign minister was asked to apologise to IPL commissioner Lalit Modi or be prepared to die, the CPM leader was censured for her style of politics.         
	Both the threat messages were sent from the Harinagar area in Delhi around the same time last night. Although police said Manik Verma, from whose cellphone the message to Brinda was sent, had been detained, they were tight-lipped about Tharoors case.         
	The death threat to Tharoor, sent to his officer on special duty Jacob Joseph, asks the junior foreign minister to stay clear of the Kochi franchisee as the D-company is involved in the IPL team. The message was attributed to Chhota Shakeel, a member of Dawoods gang.        
	The message sent to Brinda read: You are harming the country by your politics.         
	Tharoors office informed the home ministry about the SMS, following which a police team whisked him away to an undisclosed location where he stayed for some time before returning to his Lodi Road residence.         
	Police sources said the person held in Tharoors case was being questioned by officials from the special cell and the Intelligence Bureau.        
	The sources said the police were yet to establish any underworld connection.         
	However, the police said they had not registered a case because there was no complaint from Tharoor.

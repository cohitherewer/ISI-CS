The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Local vs outsider in Ayodhya
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Local vs outsider in Ayodhya
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Lucknow, Oct. 6: Mohammad Hashim Ansari, the 90-year-old petitioner in the Ayodhya title suits who had initiated efforts to settle the dispute locally and avoid an appeal in the Supreme Court, today accused outsiders of threatening to subvert the attempt.         
	When I started to negotiate peace with Mahant Gyan Das on October 3, those busy so long in deriving political mileage out of the issue felt their shops will shut down now. They are issuing threats and plotting to eliminate me, Ansari said, claiming he had been receiving anonymous threat calls.         
	The oldest living petitioner in the title suits repeated that he had launched the peace effort with the consent of the Sunni Central Waqf Board. If these national-level leaders are allowed a free run the dispute will never get resolved, the Ayodhya resident fumed. Ansari said he was deeply hurt by board counsel Zafarayab Jilanis statement that he was merely a litigant. The 90-year-old, who had filed the Babri petition before the Sunni board, said he was trying to fight fundamentalism with all his strength, being merely a litigant, and Jilani could not come in the way.         
	You cannot silence Hashim. I will establish harmony at any cost, said the petitioner, who had approached Mahant Gyan Das, the chairman of the Akhara Parishad, to try and find a way to settle the dispute in line with the Allahabad High Court judgment that made a three-way division of the land.         
	Ansaris call to bury the dispute and make a fresh start had found takers in fellow Ayodhya residents Gyan Das and Mahant Bhaskar Das, who belongs to the Nirmohi Akhara, also a petitioner in the title suits. But Gyan Das had warned that outsider leaders who make political capital out of the issue would try to complicate it. He was referring to the VHP and the BJP.         
	Ordinary Muslims in Ayodhya also appear to be in favour of Ansaris peace move.         
	Heads of religious groups or political parties have failed to deliver anything, Sadiq Ali, a tailor who has been stitching clothes for the Ram Lalla deity for over a decade, said over the phone. I am a tailor who stitches the holy robes of Lord Ram. Had it been a Hindu-Muslim issue, would I have been allowed to carry on stitching clothes for Ram Lalla? Ali asked, backing Ansaris efforts for a dialogue.

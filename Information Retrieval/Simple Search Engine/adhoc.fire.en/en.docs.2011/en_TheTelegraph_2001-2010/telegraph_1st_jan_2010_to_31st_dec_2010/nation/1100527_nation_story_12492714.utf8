The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Legal delay haze over Afzal plea for death
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Legal delay haze over Afzal plea for death
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          Afzal Guru                                  
	New Delhi, May 26: Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru has moved the Supreme Court saying he is ready to be hanged as solitary confinement was worse than death, but the countrys law minister said clemency petitions involved a process that couldnt be short-circuited.        
	No one can be hanged under political pressure, M. Veerappa Moily told The Telegraph today.        
	Handed death by a Delhi court in December 2002, later confirmed by the apex court in August 2005, Afzal has been waiting the past five years while his file moved around government departments.        
	Last week, after 16 home ministry reminders, the Delhi government backed the sentence and forwarded the file to the lieutenant governor, but said the implications of the hanging on law and order needed to be examined.        
	Afzals lawyer N.D. Pancholi, who met him in Tihar Jail last week, said the death-row convict was fed up with the solitary confinement and the delay in deciding his mercy plea.        
	Afzals contention is that he has been sentenced to death and not solitary confinement. He said the delay was not helping him and a decision should be taken as soon as possible, the lawyer said. He is saying it is better that he is hanged (and)  is ready for that.        
	Highly placed sources in the Supreme Court said the top court could not, and would not, address any plea by Afzal while his mercy petition was still pending with the office of the President.        
	The sources said Afzal had written directly to the court in March but was told his plea could not be entertained after a review petition had been dismissed.        
	The top court had dismissed Afzals plea for a review in January 2007.        
	Nothing has been heard from him since, one of the sources said. Nothing is pending with the court.        
	In his letter, Afzal had urged the court to direct the government to decide his mercy plea fast. He also sought a transfer to a jail in Jammu and Kashmir so that his family could meet him.        
	Legal experts said technically, only the President could grant clemency but the court could step in again later once the President decided either way on Afzals mercy plea. If his plea is rejected, Afzal, they said, could challenge the Presidents decision on the ground that all facts relevant to the case, including mitigating factors, were not submitted.         
	They cited a Supreme Court judgment of 1998, which said all relevant facts should be presented to the President so that presidential powers could be exercised in a fair and just manner.        
	The experts also cited a 1971 judgment where the court said a prisoner who had experienced the agony of living death for years was entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of this court for examining whether it was just and fair to allow the sentence of death to be executed.        
	The court said the convict had for more than six years (been) under the fear of sentence of death and commuted the punishment to life imprisonment.

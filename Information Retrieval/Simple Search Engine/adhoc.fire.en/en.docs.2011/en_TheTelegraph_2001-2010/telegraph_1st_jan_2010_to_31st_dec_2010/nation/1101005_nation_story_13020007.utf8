          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 4: Beggars have been evicted from Delhi but Games venues are still jingling with the sound of coins.        
	They are being collected rather, confiscated  by police because coins are on the list of items banned from Games venues for security reasons.        
	Spectators, foreign and Indian, saw these boxes staring at them yesterday and today. The police have already confiscated coins worth Rs 1 lakh.        
	During security check, our officials asked visitors to drop coins in boxes set up inside the stadiums, said police spokesman Rajan Bhagat.        
	The coins, brought to the police headquarters where 15 cops have been assigned to count them, are lying unclaimed. Bhagat said: Well hand them over if people come to claim them. But if nobody turns up, they will go to the government exchequer after six months.        
	The head constable supervising the counting said it was impossible to return the coins because spectators were not given receipts for the coins. He said coins were confiscated from several foreigners too.        
	There was a lot of confusion at the stadium. Many wanted to know what security threat the coins posed, said spectator Arvind Singh. That mystery is still unexplained, but perhaps the authorities feared that fans might greet athletes by showering coins, as some jatra and film audiences used to do decades ago.

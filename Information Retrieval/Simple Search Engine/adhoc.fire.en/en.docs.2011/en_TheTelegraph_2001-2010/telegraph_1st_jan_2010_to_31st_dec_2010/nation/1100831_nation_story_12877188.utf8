          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 30: Major Leena Gaurav, a law officer with the army, is on course to become the first woman in the army to be granted a permanent commission outside the medical corps.        
	The army headquarters, however, is not happy as it feels such a decision defies the logic of battlefield compulsions. But the A.K. Antony ministry has directed the service to put up a token show of an equal opportunities regime.        
	The army has extended Major Gauravs service by a little over three months to enable her to have a shot at getting through a selection board for permanent commission.        
	Officers on Short Service Commission serve for a maximum of 14 years. Those on Permanent Commission can serve up to 60 years of age depending on their rank, eligibility and medical fitness.         
	Currently, the option of permanent commission is not given to women.        
	Under the terms of the Short Service Commission, Major Gaurav was to have retired on August 23 but now the army headquarters has allowed her to continue in service till December 1. If she is not selected she will have to retire.         
	The army has extended her service on a government order following a court direction. The order is nearly two years old. On September 26, 2008, the government issued a notification, after a court direction, that the army will grant permanent commission to eligible lady officers in two wings  the Judge Advocate General Branch and the Army Education Corps. There is an understanding and it is accepted by the government that women will be considered for permanent commission only in departments where there should be no chance of coming into contact with the enemy, a senior officer said.        
	In no modern army in the world are women engaged directly in the combat arms, the officer said. In some countries women soldiers can volunteer to go into combat wings if they are found fit.        
	The distorted feminist logic of politics and a complex court battle has forced the army to de-link Permanent Commission Service from the more important task of combat.        
	The army has been contesting a case in the Supreme Court trying to explain its stand.         
	In shaping the policy on lady officers, the army has had to contend with two major factors. First, how should the government or the country react if a woman were to be taken hostage by the enemy or if she is too weak to bodily evacuate casualties? Second, how does a woman take command of a unit manned exclusively by men who are not acculturised to serving under a woman?        
	Now there is a third point. As the officer explained: What if the soldiers are unwilling to be led by a woman in the thick of a battle? But the army is wary of putting these arguments that it is making before the government in public domain because it worries they might be accepted in a political milieu that thrives on tokenism.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Valley gets interim pill, silence on army act 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       A family looks out of a window in Srinagar on Saturday. (AP)                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: In the absence of any consensus on major policy initiatives, including autonomy and revocation of the armed forces act from certain parts of the Valley, the Centre today announced a set of interim confidence building measures and said it would constitute a team of interlocutors to carry forward the dialogue on resolving the Kashmir tangle.         
	Among the big-ticket measures Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah has been asked to speedily implement are descaling of security bunkers, pickets and checkpoints from Srinagar and other Valley townships, a reassessment of notified Disturbed Areas, the release of all those arrested for stone-pelting and related incidents of violence over the last three months and, a review of all those detained under the Public Safety Act (PSA).         
	The cabinet committee on security, which met today to take stock of feedback from the visit of an all-party delegation to the state last week, has also decided to grant Rs 5 lakh to the kin of each of the 108 people killed in security firing.         
	According to the home ministry, 84 people are in judicial custody, 110 in police custody and 51 persons under the Public Safety Act.         
	This dispels the myth that there are thousands of people in police custody, home minister P. Chidambaram said.         
	Omar Abdullah was quick to welcome the advisory as a first step towards resolving the crisis.         
	He is to hold a meeting of the Unified Command, which includes the Army, and may well decide to denotify the Disturbed Areas Act from certain non-border Valley districts as a precursor to lifting the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. It is not clear whether the Centre has granted him tacit consent on this, but Omar did drop a hint today. The army cannot always decide what is right, he said.         
	Briefing the media on the cabinet committees deliberations, Chidambaram was less forthcoming on the future of the armed forces act.         
	The Centre has always held that it is for state governments to effect such decisions, at least technically. There are divisions in the Union cabinet on the issue.         
	The army is outspokenly opposed to either revocation or dilution of the act, as is the BJP, which voiced its concerns again in the wake of the cabinet committee on security.         
	Chidambaram offered no clues on who might head the team of interlocutors, saying on that it would probably be a team of three or four under the chairmanship of an eminent person to begin the process of a sustained dialogue with all sections of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.         
	The interlocutors will, in all likelihood, be mandated to open talks with a cross-section of Kashmiri society including separatists, the youth, civil society and major political stakeholders.         
	Although he refrained from approaching separatist spearheads during the all-party delegation visit, Chidambaram had nodded assent to those who wanted to meet leaders such as Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and Yasin Malik.         
	Chidambaram said two Special Task Forces, one each for Jammu and Ladakh regions, will also be appointed to examine their needs, with particular reference to deficiencies in infrastructure. In addition, the Omar Abdullah government has been asked to take steps immediately to reopen all schools, colleges, universities and other educational institutions, hold special classes, if necessary, and ensure that examinations for the current academic year (2010-11) are conducted.         
	Significantly, the Centre has not yet given up on holding panchayat elections in he state, scheduled for October. It might prove a tough task given the current ferment  and the security requirements for the six-phase Assembly poll in Bihar  but there is keenness in some sections of government to go ahead as the polls may just rekindle political activity in the Valley.         
	The eight-point charter that the cabinet committee on security agreed upon also includes a special central assistance of Rs 100 crore to schools and colleges for improvements in the existing infrastructure such as class rooms, auditoria, laboratories, libraries, play grounds and toilets etc.

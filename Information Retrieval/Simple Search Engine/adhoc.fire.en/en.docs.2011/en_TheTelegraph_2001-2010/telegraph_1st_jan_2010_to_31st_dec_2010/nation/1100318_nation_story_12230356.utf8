The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP open to changes in womens bill
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP open to changes in womens bill
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Sushma Swaraj    
	New Delhi, March 17: The BJP might be open to changes in the womens reservation bill that the government might moot to see it through in the Lok Sabha.        
	Addressing the media today, Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said the BJP would go with an open mind to the all-party meeting the Centre had said it would convene to find a way out of the impasse.        
	Unlike the Left that has said a blanket no to any move to dilute the 33 per cent reservation, Sushma indicated the BJP would consider the proposals if and when the government put them on the talks table.        
	We will react to the governments proposals when they come, she said, asked how the BJP would respond if the quota was whittled down.        
	Sushma also stressed that she would not allow the use of marshals when the bill was voted on in the Lok Sabha. Several BJP MPs had openly disapproved of the party silently watching the spectacle of the anti-bill dissenters being bundled out of the Rajya Sabha by marshals before it was voted on.        
	One MP, Hukmdev Narayan Dev, had compared the passivity to an episode from the Mahabharata when Bhishma and Dronacharya mutely watched Draupadi being disrobed.        
	Sushma admitted to divisions in the BJP over the bill. There are differences. We are a democratic party and give members a chance to articulate their views. But once a whip is issued, everybody is bound by it, she said.        
	Quite a few of the BJP Lok Sabha MPs had privately conveyed to the leaders that they should be allowed to exercise a conscience vote instead of being tied down to the tyranny of a whip. Sushma and others rejected the demand outright.        
	However, sources said even the leaders had to contend with the fact that MPs of the other backward classes had spoken out against the proposed law and warned that if the BJP did not support the clamour for an OBC sub-quota, it might have to pay a heavy price in elections in the heartland.        
	The bills opponents also stressed that while their peers in the Upper House had little or nothing at stake while voting for the bill because the 33 per cent quota did not cover their House, it was a different ballgame in the Lower House. Yielding 181 seats just like that is suicidal, an MP said.

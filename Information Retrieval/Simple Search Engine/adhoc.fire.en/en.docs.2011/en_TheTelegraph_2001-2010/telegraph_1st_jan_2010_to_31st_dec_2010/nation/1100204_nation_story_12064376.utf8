          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: Delhi police gave a rare show of impartiality  the cops harassed a sub-inspector just like they treat civilians who seek their help.        
	Sub-inspector Rajiv Kumar, who lost Rs 80,000 to a conman by a sleight of hand, was abused by a colleague who was to probe his case and then his file was closed in a day.        
	If a policeman is treated this way, I only have sympathy for common people, Kumar was left saying.        
	 Kumar went to a State Bank of Hyderabad ATM to withdraw cash around 9pm on January 27. He swiped his debit card four to five times but the money failed to come out.         
	While he was fumbling at the ATM machine, a youth entered and offered help.        
	An unsuspecting Kumar handed him his card. He, too, swiped it but the card would not work. The youth then handed the card back to Kumar saying he should contact his bank.        
	Kumar said: After he gave me the card, I put it in my pocket and went home. The next day when I took it out to call my bank I saw it wasnt my card at all.         
	The card was of the State Bank of India and in the name of a Mohammad Ejaz Khan, Kumar found to his astonishment. He immediately dialled 100 and the case was assigned to investigating officer Raghubir Singh.        
	Kumar said he kept calling Singh, but was told that the officer was in his village and could not look into his complaint. He would have to wait, Kumar was told.         
	A day later, Singh called Kumar and threatened him with dire consequences if he pursued the case and blamed him because he went to the ATM at night.         
	Its all your fault. Who told you to go to the ATM at night? he asked.        
	 When Kumar landed at Daryaganj police station where the case was registered, he found that his file had been closed.         
	I was being blamed for using my card at night. How ridiculous is that? Kumar said.        
	More trouble awaited him at the bank where he was asked to pay Rs 1,500 for a look at the CCTV footage to identify the conman in the ATM.        
	But by then, he had been robbed of Rs 80,000 because he had failed to block the ATM card.        
	Kumars experience is perhaps what Delhi residents face every time when they seek the polices help.         
	This has happened to me. When I went to the police they registered a case and said they would look into it. I presume they are still looking into it since I havent got a paisa back or any news if the man got caught. I am happy that the cop was treated the same way. At least they werent biased. This has happened to many people I know and all of them have said their cases have never been registered. The cop will now understand what we are subjected to daily, laughed Ashish Singh, who was robbed in a similar fashion outside an ATM and lost about Rs 50,000 before realising he had been duped.

	Mumbai, Nov. 28 (PTI): A fashion designer with Bollywood connections was arrested last night after he and his driver allegedly assaulted senior citizens of a building where he had recently bought two flats.        
	Riyaz Gangji, 41, and his driver Izaaz Khan, 22, had an argument with members of the New Sujata Housing Society building on Juhu Tara Road and assaulted four persons who objected to the designers plans to make changes to the premises to make a garden, police said.        
	Gangji and Khan were arrested last night while five others are absconding, Santacruz senior inspector Madhukar Chaudhari said.        
	 According to the police, Gangji, who stays in the western suburb of Lokhandwala and for whom several Bollywood stars have walked the ramp, had purchased a flat each on the ground and first floors of the building recently.        
	He started renovation work in his two flats. He was also altering the premises of the building to make a garden without the permission of the housing society. This was objected by the society members but Gangji refused to heed their objections, Chaudhari said.        
	Gangji and his associates assaulted four society members who are senior citizens. One of the victims, Dinanath Chaturvedi, 70, complained to police following which an FIR was registered, Chaudhari added.        
	Gangji and his associates have been booked under IPC sections 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Valley curbs on cyber world 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Valley curbs on cyber world 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Sept. 14: The Omar Abdullah government has carried its crackdown on protesters to the electronic and cyber world, announcing curbs on emails, news channels and social networking and video-sharing sites.        
	After the ban on text-messaging services in June, the government has now cracked the whip on miscreant Internet users and TV channels. Cable news networks  such as Take 1, J amp;K News, Sen, Wadi and Mouj Kashmir have been ordered to stop airing local news bulletins or any Pakistan-based news channel in the Valley, though they can do so in Jammu.        
	The government had yesterday banned the Iran-based English channel, Press TV, after it reported an alleged desecration of the Quran in the US. Netizens sending emails or involved in video-sharing too are facing the governments wrath for causing annoyance or inconvenience.        
	A police spokesman said two cases had been registered against anonymous miscreants who uploaded objectionable videos on YouTube. They have been accused of morphing pictures to falsely depict atrocities by the security forces. This is being done to incite people. Investigations are on to apprehend the accused, the spokesman said.        
	Many Facebook users allege the police are harassing them for supporting the separatist-led agitation. Officers say they are monitoring emails and have warned users who support the agitation.        
	Any electronic mail or electronic mail message for the purpose of causing annoyance or inconvenience, or to deceive or to mislead the addressee or recipient about the origin of such message, shall be punishable with imprisonment that may extend to three years with a fine, the police spokesman said.        
	Thousands of youths are using video-sharing and social networking sites to support the separatist campaign. Dozens of pages  some operating under the names Sangbazan (stone-throwers), Mazloom Kashur (Kashmiri victims) and Bekaar Jamaath (the idle group)  have been created on Facebook and have thousands of followers.        
	Strange strike        
	Hardline Hurriyat chief Syed Ali Shah Geelani has announced an unusual 11-day strike, asking people to carry out all their daily activities at night from September 16 to 26. He has asked shops, factories, mills and public transport to operate from 7pm to 7am but stay closed during the daytime.

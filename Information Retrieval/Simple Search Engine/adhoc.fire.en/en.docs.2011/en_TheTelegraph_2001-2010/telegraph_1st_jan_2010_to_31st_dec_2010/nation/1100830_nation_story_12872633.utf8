  - PM gives certificate to Nehru stadium but wants efforts redoubled to finish work        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium 
  on Sunday. (AFP)                                
	New Delhi, Aug. 29: Heavy rain stayed away, nosy parkers were kept away and the Prime Minister came calling, bringing some cheer to the beleaguered organisers of the Commonwealth Games.        
	Manmohan Singh gave his stamp of approval for at least the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium  the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies as well as weightlifting and athletics events.         
	Singh visited the Jawaharlal Nehru sports complex early afternoon and found it beautiful. This, however, came with a caveat. He asked government agencies to redouble their efforts to quickly complete whatever work remained as people were expecting a spectacular and flawless opening to the CWG.        
	Singh was shown facilities including the playing fields, royal box, stands for spectators, security and other arrangements, PMO officials said.         
	Union sports minister M.S. Gill and organising committee chairman Suresh Kalmadi accompanied the Prime Minister during the visit to the stadium, which lasted 29 minutes. Journalists were kept away.        
	There have been reports that a part of the athletic track had caved in at the stadium after the incessant rains that lashed Delhi recently.         
	Problems have also been reported in construction of a tunnel through which performers will come out  like the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony  during the opening and closing ceremonies.         
	After reports of delays and allegations of corruption, the Prime Minister had convened a high-level meeting on August 14 to review the Games preparations. Among other things, he had asked the S. Jaipal Reddy-led Group of Ministers (GoM) to hold meetings once a week instead of every fortnight.         
	Later, the PMO had deputed 11 senior bureaucrats to oversee construction at various Games venues. The committee of bureaucrats headed by cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar was given overriding powers, effectively clipping Kalmadis wings.         
	Singh had said that all pending work should be completed in a time-bound manner and decided to visit select venues of the Games in the last week of this month.         
	Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit has fixed September 10 as the deadline to complete all Games related work. Agencies have missed at least three such deadlines.        
	Thundershowers have been forecast in Delhi till Friday.

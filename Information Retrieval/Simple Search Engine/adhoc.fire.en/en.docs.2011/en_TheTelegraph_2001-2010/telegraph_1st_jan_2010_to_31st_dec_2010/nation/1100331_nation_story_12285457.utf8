The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | At Columbia, a clash of lectures
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      At Columbia, a clash of lectures
          ARCHIS MOHAN                             Yechury and Shankar                          
	New Delhi, March 30: CPM leader Sitaram Yechury and Indias US ambassador Meera Shankar will speak at separate conferences in Columbia University the same day and loosely on the same topic, leading some to wonder if a Delhi conspiracy is at play.         
	The conferences are scheduled on April 1 at two different locations of the university in New York, days before Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to the US to attend the Nuclear Security Summit in mid-April.         
	Columbia University academicians who have organised the daylong conference featuring Yechury suspect a conspiracy in the Indian embassys plan to hold ambassador Shankars lecture on the same day.         
	I feel almost as if there is a conspiracy to keep the audience away from Sitaram (Yechury)s talk, wrote one of the academicians  an organiser of the conference  in an email to one of the other speakers.         
	Yechury will be the keynote speaker at a daylong conference on Neo-liberalism, Secularism and the Future of the Left in India at the varsitys Heyman Center for the Humanities. The other speakers are Leftist academicians from India  Prabhat Patnaik, Jayati Ghosh, C.P. Chandrashekhar and Javeed Alam.         
	Shankar will deliver a lecture on Democracy and Pluralism in India in the Jerome Greene Annex at the Columbia Law School. Her talk will be followed by a reception to celebrate two gifts to Columbia University from the Government of India, said dean of Columbia Law School David M. Schizer in his invite.         
	While Shankar will deliver her lecture at 5pm, the conference featuring Yechury is scheduled from 10am to 7.30pm.         
	The organisers of Yechurys event feel that Shankars lecture was planned to either keep audiences away from the CPM leaders event or give the Indian government space to issue a rebuttal to whatever Yechury says.

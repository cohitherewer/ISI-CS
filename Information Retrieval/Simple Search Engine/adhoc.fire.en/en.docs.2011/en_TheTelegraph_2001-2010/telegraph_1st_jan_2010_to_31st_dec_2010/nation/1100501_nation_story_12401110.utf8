                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitish banks on Biharipan slogan
          NALIN VERMA                          Nitish Kumar takes his Vishwas Yatra to Bagahi village in West Champaran on Thursday. Picture by Deepak Kumar                                  
	Patna, April 30: When he sits in silence, he blogs prolifically. And when he walks, he goes to schools and monitors if the students have learnt the alphabets and tables, and also inspects public distribution shops.        
	Apparently, Nitish Kumar is on his well-composed mission  officially named Vishwas Yatra  to win Bihar again in the coming polls.         
	Biharipan (pride for Bihar) has turned out to be his favourite word, which he repeats time and again in course of his interaction with the people. I am seized with the problems of my state and its people. I am on the mission to inculcate Biharipan among them. I do not have time to waste on the issues, which are not concerned with the cause of the state, the Bihar chief minister said, adding he had no interest in IPL and other controversies right now.         
	On the first day of his Vishwas Yatra yesterday, Nitish went to a middle school at Bagahi village in West Champaran district and straightway entered into a classroom asking the boys to recite table. He also checked their IQ, asking them some general knowledge questions one by one.         
	Immediately, he attracted attention of the officials towards the poor condition of the school building and asked them to repair it. Then, he inspected a public distribution shop without notice, checking the register to find out if the shop-owner has given desired quota of grain, kerosene and sugar to BPL families. Have you got the quota of your grain? he asked to a villager. Yes sir, pat came the reply from a young man.         
	His eyes fell on a house without roof. Have you got Rs 35,000 to get your house constructed, Nitish asked Ramsudesh Mahto. Ramsudesh said: Yes.        
	Then why havent you got your house built?         
	I am yet to get tiles. I will get it and build as soon as I will get bricks soon.        
	Now, Nitish also blogs (www.nitishspeaks.blogspot.com) at the end of his days journey. He responds to the people who comment on his pieces. In a way, either moving out or sitting in silence, Nitish is interacting with more people than his main rivals, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan in the poll-bound state.

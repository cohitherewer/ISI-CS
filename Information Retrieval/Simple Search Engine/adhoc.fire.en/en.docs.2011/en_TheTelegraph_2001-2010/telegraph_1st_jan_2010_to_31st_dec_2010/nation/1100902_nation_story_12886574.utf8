          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: The Supreme Court today directed the Centre to ensure all schools occupied by the armed forces are vacated within two months and to augment school infrastructure in the Northeast to stem trafficking of children to southern states.        
	A two-judge bench issued the order on a PIL alleging that children below 16 years were being lured by promises of a better life and illegally taken from Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya and Arunachal in the Northeast to Andhra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.        
	The children are being separated from their parents by unscrupulous and unregistered orphanages and homes and kept in subhuman conditions, the PIL alleged. Most of the children are malnourished and some had been exploited, it added.        
	The top court had on March 29, 2010, asked the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights to inquire into the allegations. Subsequently, about 76 children were repatriated to their home states.        
	The commission has since been monitoring the process. Today, it asked for court permission to continue this. It also suggested that a major part of the problem was the state of schools in the Northeast.

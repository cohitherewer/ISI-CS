The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | More seats in technical colleges
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      More seats in technical colleges
          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                           Kapil Sibal                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: Tech education regulator AICTE today decided to increase the number of seats in technical streams, although nearly two lakh seats remained vacant this year in engineering colleges across the country.        
	Human resource minister Kapil Sibal, who announced the decision that covers engineering, management and architecture courses, said it would mitigate the demand-supply gap in technical education.        
	Seats will be increased from 40 to 60 (in each course) to provide for a larger number of seats and optimisation of resources without having to set up new institutions, the minister said.        
	The decision by the All India Council for Technical Education, the statutory body to standardise technical education in the country, is expected to lead to an overall increase of nearly two lakh seats in various engineering disciplines, 80,000 in management and 20,000 in architecture courses.        
	The move to raise the number of seats has come at a time when nearly two lakh BTech seats  or 20 per cent of the total seats available in about 3,000 engineering colleges across the country  found no takers this year.        
	In Orissa, some 50 per cent seats have not been filled. The vacancy ranges from 20 to 30 per cent in engineering colleges in states like Bengal, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.         
	The number of engineering institutions has doubled in the past five years from nearly 1,500 in 2005-06 to over 3,200 now, including 200 institutions that offer M.Tech courses.        
	Management courses now offer some four lakh seats, while there are 40,000 in architecture courses.        
	The AICTE has also decided to create 5 per cent supernumerary seats in each institution which will be reserved for students from economically backward backgrounds.        
	Students whose family income is less than Rs 2.5 lakh a year can get admission to these seats and will not have to pay tuition fees.         
	It was the discretion on the part of the institution to apply for such a scheme. Now these seats are made mandatory for every institute up to 5 per cent, Sibal said.        
	The AICTE also modified approval norms under which institutes can offer standalone postgraduate programmes. Under existing norms, PG courses were allowed on campuses that offered undergraduate programmes.        
	Sibal said BSc students could seek lateral entry to a second-year BTech degree programme provided they had mathematics at Class XII or at the BSc level.

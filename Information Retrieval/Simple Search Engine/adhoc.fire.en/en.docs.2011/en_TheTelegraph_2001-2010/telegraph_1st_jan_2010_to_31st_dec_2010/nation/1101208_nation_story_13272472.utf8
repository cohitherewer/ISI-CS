The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bill on workplace predators tabled
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bill on workplace predators tabled
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 7 (PTI): The government today introduced in the Lok Sabha a bill aimed at preventing sexual harassment of women at workplace in various forms, including implied or overt promise of preferential treatment or threat or interference in her work through intimidation.         
	The Protection of Women against Sexual Harassment at Workplace Bill, 2010, provides for mandatory setting up of an internal committee by a company or any other institute to probe a written complaint by an aggrieved woman employee or settle the matter through conciliation.         
	Moving the bill, women and child development minister Krishna Tirath said the objective was to enact a comprehensive legislation to provide safe and secure and an enabling environment free of all forms of sexual harassment to every woman, irrespective of her age or employment status (other than domestic workers).         
	It fixes the responsibility on the employer as well as the district magistrate, additional DM, the collector or deputy collector of every district in the state as a district officer and lays down a statutory redressal mechanism.         
	The proposed legislation makes it incumbent on the employer to order a probe into any complaint and provides for a fine of Rs 50,000 in case an internal inquiry is not set up by the employer or an attempt is made to contravene the provisions of the new law. However, in the case of false or malicious complaints, the bill provides for action against the complainant in accordance with service rules and in any other manner in case no service rules exist.         
	The malicious intent or falsehood on part of the complainant shall be established after an inquiry in accordance with the procedure prescribed before any action is recommended, says the bill introduced amid pandemonium caused by the Opposition in demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe into the 2G spectrum issue.         
	But mere inability to substantiate a complaint or provide adequate proof need not attract action against the complainant, it says.         
	The bill has identified actions that would come under its purview as implied or overt promise of preferential treatment in her (any womans) employment; or implied or overt threat of detrimental treatment in her employment; or implied or overt threat about her present or future employment status.         
	Other cognisable actions are: Conduct of any person which interferes with her work or creates an intimidating or offensive or hostile work environment for her; or humiliating conduct constituting health and safety problems for her.

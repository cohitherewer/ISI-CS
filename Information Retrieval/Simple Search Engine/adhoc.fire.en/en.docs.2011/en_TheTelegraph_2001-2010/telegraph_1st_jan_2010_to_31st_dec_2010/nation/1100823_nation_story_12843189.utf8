The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 1000 girls schools for backward belts
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      1000 girls schools for backward belts
          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 22: The Centre plans to open over 1,000 residential schools for girls in backward and remote areas as part of its plan to universalise education.        
	The National Sample Survey has found out that over 81 lakh children aged 6 to 13 years remain out of school and that most of them are girls.        
	The human resource development ministry has told the finance ministry it wants to set up 1,073 new Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas. These are residential upper primary schools meant mainly for tribal, Dalit, backward-class and minority girls in blocks where the rural female literacy rate is below the national average and the gender gap in literacy wider than the national average.        
	India now has 2,573 Kasturba Vidyalayas while 1,073 educationally backward blocks do not have such schools. An estimated Rs 2,365 crore will be spent to open the new schools.        
	A meeting of the finance ministrys expenditure finance committee discussed the proposal on July 28, an official told The Telegraph.        
	The meeting was held to consider the HRD ministrys overall proposal to align the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan norms with Right to Education rules. A key point on the agenda was to finalise the Centre-state funds share for the Abhiyan, which will be the main vehicle for implementation of the Right to Education.        
	The Abhiyan looks to universalise primary education. The Right to Education, which came into force from April 1 this year, says education is the right of every child and makes it the governments responsibility to ensure that every child gets schooling.        
	In this context, providing education to the 81 lakh out-of-school children  who make up 4.28 per cent of the population in the 6-13 age group  will be a major challenge. Sources said the Centre also planned to have additional residential schools in places with a large number of girl dropouts.        
	According to enrolment figures, 29 per cent students in the existing 2,573 Kasturba Vidyalayas are from the Scheduled Tribes, while girls from the Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes account for 27 per cent each. Eight per cent students are from the minority communities.        
	These schools also target the daughters of migrant workers and girls who are unable to complete regular school.

	New Delhi, Sept. 25: The firm that will conduct the Common Admission Test has put up video clips on the IIM-CAT website to familiarise candidates with exam patterns and also taken a slew of measures to deal with possible glitches.        
	Last year, during the exams first computerised test, thousands of candidates aspiring to enter the countrys top B-schools had to sit for a rescheduled exam after glitches prevented flow of questions and instructions through local servers on to computer screens.        
	US-based firm Prometric said the video clips would help guide candidates on the pattern of the exam to be held between October 27 and November 24. The clips can be accessed on the website www.catiim.in.        
	The clips give details of formalities that candidates have to complete and also demonstrate the functions of a review panel, which the examinees can use to know and mark the questions they have answered.         
	With over 9,000 computers being used for CAT across 33 cities, a Prometric official said a small percentage might be affected during the test.         
	Our global experience tells us that a small percentage will have problems. We have incorporated this into our planning and built in additional contingency measures to ensure that all registered candidates will be able to take the test within this years (October 27-November 24) testing window, said Prometric India MD Soumitra Roy.        
	The contingency plan includes extensive operational trials and testing every computer that will be used for CAT 2010. Other measures include checking technical requirements at all test centres, which will be quarantined.         
	If any computer develops a problem during the exam, the student will be provided another on which he can answer the remaining questions. The answers in both computers will be evaluated to mark the candidate.         
	All test centre staff will be given intensive training so that they can assist candidates if any problem arises. Some 2.5 lakh students are expected to take the test this year for admission to the Indian Institutes of Management and some other B-schools.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wary of Soren, BJP taps Ranchi allies 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Wary of Soren, BJP taps Ranchi allies 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Eye on CM post: Yashwant Sinha (top) , Arjun Munda                                 
	New Delhi, April 30: Tempted by Hemant Sorens bait of the chief ministers post, the BJP is sounding out allies Janata Dal (United) and All Jharkhand Students Union (Ajsu) on the possibility of forming a government in Jharkhand.        
	The party, however, is wondering whether Hemants father Shibu Soren has a Plan B of ditching it and striking a deal with the Congress on more favourable terms.        
	The BJP had decided to withdraw support to Shibu Sorens Jharkhand Mukti Morcha-led government after he voted against the partys cut motions in the Lok Sabha. But it changed its mind after Hemant made an offer on Sorens behalf to hand over the states reins to the BJP.        
	Former chief minister Arjun Munda and Yashwant Sinha, both Lok Sabha MPs, have emerged as contenders for the top post. Munda is the front runner because he is the only weighty tribal leader the BJP has in the state.        
	Sinha is a Kayastha, a caste prized for its ability to influence public opinion despite its small numbers. But the BJP fears that Jharkhands tribals, more politicised than their counterparts in Chhattisgarh, may feel alienated under a non-tribal leader.        
	Still, Sinhas name was on the table because some leaders argued that with his long experience as a Union minister, he was cut out for the task of cleaning up the mess in the Jharkhand administration and provide a stable government.        
	However, Sorens silence after his Lok Sabha vote  barring a written semi-apology to leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj and BJP president Nitin Gadkari  has been a source of worry for the BJP.        
	Party leaders wonder whether Soren and Hemant are on the same page on installing a BJP-led government. The BJP fears Soren may install a JMM lawmaker as chief minister, supported by the Congress, in return for a Union cabinet berth for himself.        
	Soren has two months to get elected to the Assembly if he wants to remain chief minister, but he is finding it a problem to get a seat with his close relatives having refused to vacate theirs.        
	Central BJP leaders have been burning up the phone lines to Ranchi to find out where each MLA stands and whether the JMM may be on the verge of a split.        
	We should not find ourselves in a situation in which Hemant promises everything but the MLAs go away with his father. We want to ensure we have a government that lasts at least a year, a source said.        
	The BJP parliamentary board, which met here this morning, asked Hemant and Ajsu leader Sudesh Mahato to come over to Delhi tomorrow for discussions.         
	Gadkaris predecessor, Rajnath Singh, is expected to play a crucial role in the meeting because he was in charge of Jharkhand as a general secretary and has retained an interest in the state.         
	It was Rajnath who principally persuaded Gadkari to go in for a tie-up with the JMM after the previous state elections.        
	Tomorrows meeting is not expected to come to a conclusion because L.K. Advani, Sushma and Arun Jaitley will not be present. They will be in Gujarat to attend a state government event and will return on Sunday.        
	After their return, the parliamentary board will sit again to take the final call on whether the BJP is in a position to form a government or whether it should withdraw support to Soren.        
	Briefing the media today, general secretary Ananth Kumar confirmed receiving letters from Soren and Hemant after the BJP announced withdrawal of support.        
	Sorens letter said Jharkhand should not be pushed towards Congress misrule while Hemant said he was ready to have a BJP-led government, Kumar said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: The Union environment ministry today iterated that Lavasa Corporation should stop all activities at its hill station construction site near Pune until it is ready with a final order on the project expected before December 31.         
	The fresh order issued today by the environment ministry comes five days after Lavasa Corporations representatives met ministry officials and asserted the company had the required approvals for 5,000 acres in the backwaters of Warasgaon in Sahyadri hills.         
	The spot was chosen by agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, whose family members used to be associated with the project.        
	The ministry had last month sent a notice to Lavasa Corporation warning that the company had not sought environmental clearances required for the project covering 18 villages near Warasgaon lake, 215km from Mumbai.         
	The ministry  which had also invited to the December 9 meeting non-government groups opposing the construction  has said the hearing and an examination of relevant documents submitted by both sides has given rise to serious issues.         
	The ministry said submissions at the meeting indicate that large-scale construction and development work at the project site has resulted in a deterioration of the environmental status of the area.         
	The concentration of construction activity near the water reservoir will seriously damage the quality of water in the reservoir that provides drinking water to the city of Pune downstream.         
	Lavasa Corporation argued at the meeting that the company has used latest technologies to stabilise the hill slopes at the site. But the ministry said hill slopes cutting has affected their stability and the companys claim of stabilisation does not merit acceptance at this stage.         
	The ministry observed that the development activities might change the storm water drainage system of the area and lead to flooding of some unexpected areas. It has also indicated that the impact of construction debris needs to be analysed along with waste-water management and the road infrastructure required.         
	Lavasa Corporation and the opposing groups have been asked by the ministry to send any additional documents they may have in support of their arguments for another hearing on December 22, ahead of a decision on the project before December 31.         
	In their arguments in favour of the project, Lavasa representatives have told the ministry that the development activity has improved the area to a large extent. The company has planted 600,000 trees and 441 local villagers are working with the company.         
	Lavasa has responded to the ministrys interim order saying it had been issued without objective verification and physical site assessment which subverts the basic tenancy of natural justice. The order simply repeats unsubstantiated and generic claims made by groups opposing the project, the company said in a statement issued tonight.         
	Bombay High Court which is hearing a petition on the issue is expected to deliver its hearing on December 16.

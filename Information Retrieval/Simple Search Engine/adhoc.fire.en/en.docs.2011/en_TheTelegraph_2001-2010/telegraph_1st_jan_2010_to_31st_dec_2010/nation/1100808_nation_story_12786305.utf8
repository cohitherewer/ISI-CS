The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Civic poll time boon for Modi 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Civic poll time boon for Modi 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      Narenda Modi                          
	Ahmedabad, Aug. 7: Narenda Modi is expected to give precedence to local bodies elections in Gujarat over the Bihar polls, a source in the state BJP said.         
	Both will happen simultaneously, over October and November, and are likely to be long-drawn because in Gujarat, voters will elect municipal corporation and district panchayat representatives.        
	The source saw the timing as fortuitous because it gives the Gujarat chief minister a ruse to keep off from campaigning in Bihar and risk annoying BJP ally Janata Dal (United).         
	Nitish Kumar, the Dal (U) leader and Bihar chief minister, has made it clear that Modi was unwanted in his state, especially when his poll strategy foregrounds winning over the Muslim votes.        
	The BJPs Bihar leaders heaved a sigh of relief. Although the first instinct of those such as Rajiv Pratap Rudy was to tell off Nitish when he put Modi in his place during the BJP national executive in June, expediency got the better of grandstanding.         
	More so, after an internal survey showed that alone, the BJP and the Dal (U) would not make it but together they might just touch the half-way mark.        
	Modi, said sources, is expected to lead the party from the front in the local elections for various reasons: with the CBI breathing down his governments neck in the fake encounter cases, the BJP cadre couldnt quite get a measure of the political fall-out.         
	We are confused. Now it looks as though the central government is getting the better of Modi through the CBI. Sometimes it appears as if the chief minister has an upper hand. The fact is that Amit Shah (the junior home minister, who is in jail after he was charged in the conspiracy to kill encounter victim Sohrabuddin) was Modis right-hand man and we have to see how the arrest plays out for the chief minister, an MLA from south Gujarat said.        
	He hoped Modis campaign would set the tone of the BJPs answer to the Centre and the CBI and rev up the election machinery that is lying dormant.        
	The elections to the municipalities of Ahmedabad, Baroda, Rajkot, Surat, Jamnagar and Bhavnagar among others and panchayats are expected to be a test for Modi for more than one reason. First, they are the biggest elections after the 2007 Assembly polls and an indicator of whether he has retained his winning streak.         
	Second, they are expected to be a barometer of the political impact of the Shah case and of Modis ability to re-cycle his Gujarat pride card.

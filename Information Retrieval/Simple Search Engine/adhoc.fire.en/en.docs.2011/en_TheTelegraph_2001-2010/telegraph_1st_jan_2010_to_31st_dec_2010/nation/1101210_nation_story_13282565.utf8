	New Delhi, Dec. 9: Scientists have found a new way to curb intense cravings -- for chocolate, ice cream, or even cigarettes. New research released today shows that cravings for food may be effectively suppressed by repeatedly imagining the act of consuming it.         
	A set of experiments by researchers in the US has shown that mental imagery may be used to reduce desire for specific foods, reversing a long-standing assumption that thinking about a delicacy only increases the desire to eat it.         
	Their findings, to be published in the US journal Science tomorrow, suggest that people could use mental imagery to tweak eating habits, perhaps even the use of addictive substances such as nicotine.         
	Whenever craving occurs, one should just imagine as vividly as possible the pleasure of consuming that food, said Joachim Vosgerau, an associate professor of marketing at the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and a member of the team.         
	If you crave a chocolate, imagine eating a large chocolate bar, bite after bite, if you crave a cigarette, imagine smoking an entire cigarette, drag after drag, said Vosgearu, who is also director of the Centre for Behavioural Decision Research at CMU.         
	A number of psychological studies in the past have suggested that merely thinking about a desirable stimulus increases its hedonic appeal. The CMU team designed five experiments where participants were asked to imagine nibbling on cheese or chocolate.         
	The results showed that imagined consumption decreased its actual consumption. In one experiment, for instance, participants who had imagined eating 30 cheese cubes consumed less cheese than did participants who had imagined eating three cubes.         
	The difference between previous imagery studies and our studies is that we asked our participants to repeatedly imagine consumption of a food, Vosgearu told The Telegraph. Such repeated imagery reduces the subsequent actual consumption of food, he said.         
	Earlier research has established that mental imagery can stimulate the same regions of the brain that are activated by the actual experience. A classic research paper in the 1970s, for example, had highlighted that just the thought of a spider crawling on a leg can generate an increase in heart rate and perspiration -- in a person sensitive to spiders -- just as would have been caused by a real spider.         
	The new results show that repeatedly imagining the consumption of a food habituates people to it and reduces their desire for the food -- the effect is driven by lower levels of motivation, and not because they view the food as less palatable than earlier.         
	We think these findings will help develop future interventions to reduce cravings for things such as unhealthy food, drugs, or cigarettes, team member Carey Morewedge, an assistant professor of social and decision sciences, said in a statement through the university.         
	The researchers point out that the imagery effect is stimulus-specific. Imagining eating cheese will only decrease desire to eat more cheese, and not desire to eat ice cream. The effect is thus unlikely to help curb hunger.         
	The findings, the researchers say, might subtly alter deaddiction strategies.         
	Recurrent cravings are a major hurdle when someone is trying to quit smoking. Typically, one tries to suppress the thought of cigarettes which could be psychologically painful and cognitively demanding, Vosgerau said.         
	The new research suggests that repeatedly thinking about each puff will curb the craving.         
	Ive been smoking for almost 20 years and just quit 16 days ago, Vosgerau revealed. Whenever the craving becomes too strong, I use our technique of imagining smoking. It appears to dampen the urge.         
	Psychiatrists say the results appear linked to a standard treatment method called exposure response prevention which is often used to treat fears, anxiety disorders, or obsessive compulsive disorders.         
	Repeated exposure to an anxiety-causing stimulus can reduce anxiety, said Vivek Benegal, additional professor of psychiatry at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore. In clinical practice, we use mental imagery to extinguish anxiety. Here it is used to reduce the desire for food.

	 New Delhi, May 10 (PTI): The Delhi government has threatened its officials with heavy penalty if they keep passing RTI applications from one department to another, slowing the response while making it difficult to pinpoint blame for the delay.          Information commissioner Shailesh Gandhi had written to chief secretary Rakesh Mehta that the RTI Act allowed only one transfer, and within five days, if the official who received the application did not have the information. Gandhi said he had observed RTI applications being transferred from one official to another, making it difficult to identify the errant official in case information was not provided within the stipulated 30 days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Price dips in bulb belt
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Price dips in bulb belt
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                                          A vendor sorts onions at Mundera, a wholesale market in Allahabad, on Wednesday. (PTI)      
	Pimpalgaon (Nashik), Dec. 22: Balasaheb Shinde squatted on a plastic sheet with hundreds of red onions scattered before him.        
	In a normal year, the 30-year-old farmer would have been counting the thousands in his stock and smiling.        
	Unseasonal rain has destroyed the bulk of his crop this year. Then the export ban kicked in.        
	Even if I get an average price of Rs 2,500 per quintal, I will take home only Rs 12,500, says the farmer, who has produced just five quintals this season on his one-acre farm in Nashik, the countrys largest wholesale hub for the bulb crop.        
	Onions are selling at Rs 80 a kg in Delhi and Rs 70 a kg in Mumbai, but in Maharashtras onion belt, many small farmers like Shinde havent got even a quarter of their investment back. Most of their crop destroyed, they now stare at months of grim financial struggle till June, when the sowing season begins.        
	It wasnt like this when the week began.        
	On Monday, trucks and tractors had lumbered into markets laden with onion. The wholesale price had touched a peak of Rs 6,273 a quintal, or Rs 62 a kg.        
	The government responded by banning exports to arrest the price spiral, especially in the metros.        
	Prices dropped sharply at Nashiks biggest farm produce markets at Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon the next day, sliding to a highest of Rs 5,411 a quintal on Tuesday and to Rs 3,700 a quintal on Wednesday, according to officials of the Pimpalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).        
	This is the highest price for the quality produce. The low-quality ones fetched as little as Rs 500 per quintal, while the model or average price was around Rs 1,400-Rs 1,500, Pimpalgaon APMC supervisor R.S. Mahale told The Telegraph this afternoon.        
	If untimely rain has hit farmers hard  Mahale said only 8,000 quintals had arrived today for sale compared with 25,000 quintals on a normal day in a good season  the export ban has exacerbated the misery of onion growers in Nashik. The Pune-Nashik region accounts for 70 per cent of Indias onion exports.        
	The ban has worsened the situation of farmers here. They could have sold their meagre produce at Rs 6,000 a quintal, but the export ban is driving prices down, said Baburao Devre, a 47-year-old polytechnic institute employee who does farming on the side.        
	Exporter Devendra Modi, said the unseasonal rains might have also affected quality, which means fewer buyers.        
	Changdeo Holkar, vice-president of farm products co-operative Nafed, questioned the logic behind the export ban. If untimely rain destroyed crops, speculation and hoarding by middlemen and traders had also driven the prices through the roof, he said.        
	In Umrane, for example, on Monday, onions sold for Rs 7,100 a quintal, which works out to Rs 71 a kg.        
	Then the ban pushed the prices down, hitting farmers like Shinde and Lahanu Nikam.        
	Nikam, 54, who owns a four-acre farm, stood beside a tractor full of better-quality red onions. Since wet onions deteriorate fast, I sold seven quintals that my farm produced at Rs 725 per quintal a fortnight ago. Now I am using my tractor to transport somebody elses produce. At least I can get Rs 200 from this, said Nikam, who drove from Chandwad to Pimpalgaon, 32km away.         
	According to Nikam, onion cultivation involves an investment of up to Rs 60,000 per acre. So if nature plays truant, it spells disaster for the farmer. Last year, Cyclone Phyan destroyed our crops, this time the November rains. We can produce wheat and other small crops, but onion is the only crop we have for survival, Nikam, who received a compensation of Rs 2,200 for the damage caused by the cyclone last year, said.        
	But onion farmers dont want such government largesse. Simply give us an assured minimum support price of Rs 3,500-Rs 4,000 for whatever we produce, Nikam said.

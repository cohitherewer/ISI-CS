The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | N-bill nudge to Left, hopes rest on Right
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      N-bill nudge to Left, hopes rest on Right
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Sitaram Yechury      
	New Delhi, Aug. 24: The Prime Ministers principal mediator and science and technology minister Prithviraj Chavan met Left leaders Sitaram Yechury and D. Raja today and sought their support in an attempt to enlarge the area of consensus around the nuclear liability bill.        
	PTI quoted CPM MP Yechury saying after the hour-long meeting that the minister appeared willing to consider our points of view, especially those relating to suppliers liability. But we have to see the fine print of the proposed legislation.        
	CPI leader Raja told The Telegraph: The minister told us we have an open mind on everything.        
	However, with the Left sticking to its known position that the bill goes against the grain of the crucial recommendations of the standing committee (of Parliament) by protecting the interests of the foreign suppliers of nuclear equipment and domestic private players, the government is not pinning any hopes on it.         
	It continues to bank on the BJP for seeing the bill through both Houses.        
	A key actor involved in the negotiations, and who did not want to be named, is learnt to have told his colleagues that while he had no doubt that a resolution was in sight with the BJP, the Left would not abandon or soften the ideological issues it had with the bill.         
	The PM wants us to evolve the widest possible consensus. So we met the Left leaders, said Chavan.        
	Chavan, who has been consulting the Prime Minister and his principal aides as well as atomic energy commission officials for the past two weeks, stressed that the government was ready to consider each and every amendment moved by the Opposition. We have accepted as many as 17 amendments. The Samajwadi Party wanted only the public sector in the nuclear business, we have done that. The Left wanted more stringent provisions to nail nuclear suppliers. We did that as well. One more change will not make a difference, he told The Telegraph.         
	Asked if the controversial phrase that stated done with the intent to cause nuclear damage in sub-clause (b) of clause 17 would be dropped, Chavan said: Lets see.         
	The government itself is likely to move an amendment to sub-clause 17 (b) to accommodate the BJPs proposal for more stringent action against suppliers when the bill is taken up in the Lok Sabha tomorrow.        
	The BJP wants it to be deleted or the word or to be placed between two sentences in the clause so that an operator will then not have to prove the impossible: that a supplier intentionally provided him defective equipment or poor quality materials in order to trigger a nuclear disaster.        
	But other sources emphasised the government will not yield to the Lefts demand for a higher compensation cap or legislate a commitment it sought that India will not become a signatory to any international convention in the nuclear regime.        
	Chavan assured Yechury and Raja that civil liability will not replace criminal liability in the event of a nuclear accident. The proposed law will kick in a victim-centred, prompt payment, no fault civil liability regime for the first time, he added.        
	The bill will be taken up in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.

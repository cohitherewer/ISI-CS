          OUR BUREAU                          Amitabh Bachchan at a save tigers campaign in New Delhi on Thursday. Picture by Prem Singh                                  
	Mumbai/New Delhi, March 25: Amitabh Bachchan today said the controversy over his presence at the Bandra Worli Sea Link inauguration yesterday had been manufactured, the remark apparently aimed at the Congress which has made an issue of the megastar sharing the dais with chief minister Ashok Chavan.         
	A fresh controversy has been rapidly manufactured on my involvement in today (Wednesday)s event on the sea link. But of that some other time and space (sic), Bachchan wrote in his blog in the early hours of Thursday.        
	The actor was perceived to be close to the Samajwadi Party by dint of his friendship with Amar Singh. After Amars expulsion from the party, the star, whose wife Jaya Bachchan is a Rajya Sabha member of the Samajwadi Party, has sparked speculation about his proximity to the BJP by agreeing to be brand ambassador of Gujarat and describing its chief minister Narendra Modi as shahenshah.        
	Bachchan, in his blog, justified his presence at the programme. I had been invited by the minister in the government to attend and so I went along, he said, but did not refer to the discomfiture of Chavan who said he felt he was at an awards event seeing Bachchan on the dais.         
	The Congress has used the controversy to underline that the megastar had become more untouchable by graduating from Amar to Modi. Chavan, a Congress leader said to be close to Sonia Gandhi who no longer shares the rapport her family once enjoyed with the Bachchans, has defended himself saying he was unaware the star had been invited.         
	He (Bachchan) is the brand ambassador of another state. We would like to promote our own state. Perhaps I would not have attended the function had I known that he would be present, the chief minister said.        
	Chavan appeared to have been let off the hook by the party high command, which, however, cautioned him not to be so careless in the future.         
	Congress media department chairman Janardan Dwivedi said the high command was satisfied with Chavans explanation but justified the unease in the Maharashtra Congress over the stars presence.         
	Dwivedi iterated that party workers were unhappy because Bachchan had associated himself with Modi, but Congress sources, speaking under cover of anonymity, maintained that the actors strained relations with the Gandhi family were at the root of the unease.         
	In an earlier blog entry, Bachchan had defended his stint for Gujarat tourism and wondered why his critics did not stop a Ratan Tata or an Ambani from investing in the state.        
	The controversy has again brought to the fore the edgy relationship between the Congress and ally NCP, whose minister issued the invite to Bachchan.        
	In an attempt to calm things down between the alliance partners, NCPs public undertakings minister Jaydutta Kshirsagar today took the blame on himself.         
	I had invited Amitabh Bachchan. He gave his consent at the last minute. I had not informed the chief minister, said Kshirsagar, who had yesterday justified inviting icon Bachchan for an iconic project like the sea link.        
	But the NCP wondered how the chief minister could claim he was unaware when Bachchans presence had been duly advertised in local newspapers. NCP general secretary Tariq Anwar told The Telegraph: This is a non-issue; the Congress should not waste time on creating such controversies. This was neither a political function nor a Congress platform. Even leaders from the Opposition are usually invited to such functions. Amitabh is a superstar and his popularity cannot be matched. There is a natural desire to invite such icons to make any programme successful. Congress leaders, however, feel NCP boss Sharad Pawar engineers such events to embarrass the party time and again.         
	Anwar rebutted the contention. It is wrong to see any motive. Pawarsaheb is in Russia and wont have any idea about this function. Some Congress leaders need to check their wild imaginations, he said.         
	The latest controversy comes days after Left-ruled Kerala rejected Bachchan as the brand ambassador for the Gujarat association.        
	Bachchan, in his blog yesterday, took potshots at the CPM  without naming the party  for objecting to his association with Kerala. You want to stop me from promoting tourism in a state, because you have reason to believe that there are political connotations to the event. This is such rubbish! he wrote.        
	 The last word in the Congress vs Bachchan battle is yet to be said. Bachchan is expected to attend the concluding session of the 83rd Marathi Sahitya Sammelan being held in Pune on Sunday to read poems of his father Harivansh Rai Bachchan. Several prominent Congressmen are expected to be present.

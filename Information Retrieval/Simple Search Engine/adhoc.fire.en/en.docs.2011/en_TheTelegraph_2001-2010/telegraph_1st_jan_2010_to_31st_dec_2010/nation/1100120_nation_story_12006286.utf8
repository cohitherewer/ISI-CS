The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Away and into the lab
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Away and into the lab
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          The body being handed over to SSKM. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	I had so far known that communists serve the people till their last breath. Today, I learnt that one can be of use even after death         
	Jyoti Basu, April 4, 2003              
	A poster with Jyoti Basus picture and a blurb bearing his words in Bengali greeted the CPM patriarchs body at SSKM Hospital at the end of his last journey.         
	The clock in the anatomy department on the ground floor of the BC Roy block showed 4.48pm when lab employees took the body inside on a flower-bedecked stretcher and shut the door behind them.        
	For those who had gathered outside SSKM hoping to see their leader there, the closing of the door was a disappointing end to a long vigil.        
	For Basu, it was the moment he had wished for when he signed a declaration form on April 4, 2003, pledging his body to science.        
	We have checked the body and the preliminary assessment is that the brain and some other body parts can be preserved for research, Asish Dutta, the head of the anatomy department, told The Telegraph two hours later.        
	Sources said the body was first taken to the Temporal Bone and Cadavaric Dissection Laboratory, housed in the same building as the anatomy department. Laboratory staff members injected an embalming fluid  a solution of formaldehyde, glycerine and ethyl alcohol  into the body.         
	Around 500ml of fluid was pumped in. It was then allowed to saturate the tissues. The fluid passes through the veins and reaches the heart, and finally the brain. This prevents further decomposition, explained a doctor.        
	The embalming fluid was drained out from the body through the mouth and nose after around half an hour.        
	A dose of formalin had been injected into Basus stomach at the mortuary Peace Haven on Sunday. But that would have prevented decomposition only for a week.        
	A doctor said Basus body was swollen when it came to SSKM. It was filled with water, probably because his kidneys had stopped functioning during his last few days.        
	Anatomy department officials said the clothes and other personal items that came with Basus body would be handed over to the CPM.         
	We kept aside his shoes, jacket, spectacles and a gold-coloured pen. All of these will be handed over to the party, a doctor said.        
	The body will be kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius for three days before the next laboratory process starts. Then, we will bring out the body and dissect the temple in preparation for preserving the brain. The body will be dipped in an embalming solution for a few hours before being taken back to the cooler, said department head Dutta.

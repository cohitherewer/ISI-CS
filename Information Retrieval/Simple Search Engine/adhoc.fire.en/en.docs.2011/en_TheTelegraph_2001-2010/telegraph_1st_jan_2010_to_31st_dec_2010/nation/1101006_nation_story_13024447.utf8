The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat mixes razing with title verdict
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Karat mixes razing with title verdict
          J.P. YADAV                          Prakash Karat                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: Prakash Karat today played on the Congresss worst fears over the Ayodhya verdict, saying it might be taken as a post-facto justification of the Babri Masjid demolition that was a criminal offence and an assault on the secular principle.        
	Terming the title verdict disturbing after a two-day meeting of the politburo, the CPM general secretary said it would set a dangerous precedent as it was based on faith.        
	He ruled out support to an out-of-court settlement that would be acceptable to both Hindus and Muslims. I dont think anybody needs to intervene. The decision of the Supreme Court would be final, Karat said.        
	The Congress, fearing an unsavoury political fallout, reiterated that the Ayodhya title suits and the Babri demolition were separate issues and the Allahabad High Court verdict did not condone the razing of the mosque in any way. It said it would welcome a negotiated settlement but would not take any initiative in the matter.        
	Karats criticism of the verdict is being seen as an attempt to court minorities ahead of next years Bengal elections. The states Left Front government has a lost a big chunk of its Muslim vote bank to Trinamul after the Singur and Nandigram controversies.        
	Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee has so far kept mum on the verdict.        
	Karat said the Ayodhya verdict had disappointed the minorities because it was not based on legality but on faith. Asked if that meant he shared Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadavs views, he shot back: I have given our view and am not concerned about what others have said.        
	If Karat targeted the Congress, he did not leave Trinamul alone either. Touching on land acquisition, a subject Mamata is believed to be sensitive to, he said: We want the 1894 Land Acquisition Act scrapped. The government must bring legislation for land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation in the forthcoming session of Parliament.        
	He also pointed a finger at Mamata. Not only is the Trinamul collaborating with Maoists, recently the railway minister visited Darjeeling and is forging ties with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, which is bent on dividing the state of West Bengal.

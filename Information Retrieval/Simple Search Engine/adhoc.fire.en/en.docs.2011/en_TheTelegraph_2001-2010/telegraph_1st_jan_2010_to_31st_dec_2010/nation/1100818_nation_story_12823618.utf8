	Aug. 17: The contentious issues of territory, tenure and composition of the Darjeeling hills interim set-up stayed unresolved today but the tripartite talks came to a consensus on administrative and legislative powers to the new body and the subjects under it.        
	The unsettled issues will be discussed at the next round of talks to be held by the Centre, the Bengal government and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha on September 7.         
	Roshan Giri, the general secretary of the Morcha, told The Telegraph after the talks today: The meeting was a success and an agreement has broadly been reached on issues like the number of subjects to be transferred to the new body as well as its administrative and legislative powers.         
	A home ministry official, however, expressed disappointment. We had hoped to clinch the deal at todays meeting. We hope the three stakeholders reach a consensus on all issues at the next meeting, he said.         
	 At todays meeting, the Centre proposed that the tenure of the new body should be extended to December 31, 2012, instead of the 2011-end suggested earlier. The Morcha is yet to make its stand clear on the matter.        
	The Centres draft given to the Morcha and the state had proposed that there should be 20 members in the interim authority. But the Morcha today said it should have 55 members.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Aug. 7: The Mayavati regime has ordered a crackdown on a restricted drug being freely sold in chemists shops and groceries and being illegally used by Uttar Pradesh vegetable growers and dairy farm workers.        
	About 258 dealers selling oxytocin have been arrested in raids in Agra, Kanpur and Jaunpur districts in the last two weeks. While 400 oxytocin injections were seized from a Jaunpur grocery yesterday, 13,000 vials were confiscated from a Kanpur drug wholesale market on July 20 and 30,000 vials from an Agra shop on July 26.        
	Oxytocin, codenamed anaj dawa and pani dawa by farmers, is a Schedule H drug that has legitimate uses in medicine  during complicated child birth  but cannot be used to grow bigger vegetables or increase milk production in cows as is being done by farmers in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.        
	According to Dr N.K. Jain, a consultant to the Uttar Pradesh health department, oxytocin cannot be sold over the counter without prescription from a medical practitioner. It is specifically banned for use on animals under the Prevention of Cruelty Act, 1960, as well as under the Food and Drug Adulteration Prevention Act, 1960.        
	However, surveys done in several Uttar Pradesh districts have revealed rampant use of this drug by unregistered health professionals during childbirth and by farmers in growing bigger vegetables and increasing milk production in cows. Union health minister Dinesh Trivedi had noted the problem early this year in a letter to the Union health secretary.        
	A Unicef survey done in 2009 revealed that in rural areas of Uttar Pradesh women in labour are often given the drug more than six times at the risk of rupturing her uterus and causing her death. The state has a maternal mortality rate of 46 per 1,000 live births, the highest in India.        
	Oxytocin cannot be given more than three times even during a complicated delivery. Health officials in Lucknow said unrestricted use of oxytocin could lead to nervous breakdowns, sterility and neurotic complications.        
	A 2005 survey done in 733 Uttar Pradesh villages by a health professional, Abhijit Das, for the voluntary organisation Sahyog had warned of the harmful effects of oxytocin.        
	We came across mothers who were given this injection nine times during labour by unregistered health workers during home delivery, although normally a mother cannot be given more than three times during labour even if this is used at all. This may cause rupture in the uterus and can even cause death, the study said.        
	In 2007, a study done by the Centre for South Asian Studies, University of Edinburgh, had said that Indias reproductive and child health policy needed to address the inappropriate use of oxytocin.                    
	Drug inspectors said oxytocin injections, costing between Rs 5 and Rs 15, were being made available to farmers, dairy workers and health workers by an illicit network of drug dealers.

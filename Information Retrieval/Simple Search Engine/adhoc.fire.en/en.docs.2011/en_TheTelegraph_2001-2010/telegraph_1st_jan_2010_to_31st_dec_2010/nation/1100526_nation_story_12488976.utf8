The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal to visit US for bill test
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sibal to visit US for bill test
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Kapil Sibal                                  
	New Delhi, May 25: Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal plans to visit the US this month-end on a litmus-test mission for a bill that allows foreign varsities into India but also imposes potential barriers for aspiring entrants.         
	Backed by the Prime Ministers Office, Sibal has successfully overcome resistance within the government to table the foreign educational institutions (regulation of entry and operations) bill in the Lok Sabha during the last session of Parliament.         
	But several entry barriers were either strengthened or reintroduced into the bill during the last stages of fine-tuning, which officials concede could trigger concern among universities the government wants to attract.         
	Sibal is scheduled to visit the US between May 30 and June 8, and will be visiting leading American universities on both the Pacific and the Atlantic coasts during the trip, government officials said.         
	They say the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The pudding (the bill) is ready, the visit will show us how many universities are ready to eat it, an official said.         
	This will be Sibals second visit to the US in seven months. During his visit towards the end of October 2009, the HRD minister had met the heads of several top American universities, including Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Yale.         
	Both MIT and Yale expressed interest in collaborating with Indian institutions and the HRD ministry has since set up a joint panel with MIT to take discussions with that institute forward.         
	But most top institutions  including MIT, Harvard and Yale  indicated that they wanted to wait and see the contents of the foreign educational institutions bill before committing to set up brick and mortar campuses in India.         
	The finalised bill, in the public domain now that it has been tabled in Parliament, allows the government to exempt select institutions from most provisions, but no institution can repatriate earnings made in India.         
	All earlier avatars of the bill required foreign institutions to commit a corpus of Rs. 10 crore that would be used to compensate students and employees if the institution in India stops operations.         
	At the behest of the Prime Ministers Office, the government had even dropped a clause empowering it to deny applicant institutions the right to start operations in India because of concerns over security, sovereignty or linguistic sensitivities.         
	But as was reported by The Telegraph on December 26 and 27, 2009, the government finally hiked the corpus amount fivefold to Rs. 50 crore and reinserted the clause on security and sovereignty.

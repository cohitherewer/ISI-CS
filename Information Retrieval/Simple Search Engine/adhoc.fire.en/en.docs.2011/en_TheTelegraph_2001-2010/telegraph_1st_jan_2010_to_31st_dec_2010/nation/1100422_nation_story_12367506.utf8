          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 21: A new research has affirmed the futility of current pledges made by 76 countries, including India, to meet the goal of limiting global warming by 2C under the Copenhagen accord signed last year.         
	Scientists in Germany have calculated that current pledges to curb greenhouse gas emissions could push global emissions in 2020 to a level 20 per cent higher than today  and warm the world by 3C by 2100.         
	The findings will appear in the scientific journal Nature tomorrow, two days before India, Brazil, China and South Africa  the Basic group  meet in South Africa to plan for future climate change talks.         
	The Basic ministerial meeting on April 25-26 will discuss, among other objectives, how to translate political agreements in the Copenhagen accord into negotiating text.         
	The analysis has shown that current pledges are likely to lead to global greenhouse gas emissions of about 48 billion tonnes to 54 billion tonnes by 2020  either level will fail to limit global warming to 2C.         
	No other study before has shown how wide the gap (is) between a 2C compliant emissions level and the current Copenhagen pledges, said Jeorgi Rogelj, a research team member at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.         
	Although previous assessments by environmental think tanks had cautioned that pledges at Copenhagen were not enough, the new study examines loopholes that are likely to worsen emissions.         
	These loopholes involve rules that allow countries to bank any surplus emissions they might have between 2008 and 2012 as allowances for use after 2012, and rely on land use and forestry to increase emission allowances.         
	Such accounting options could further deteriorate the already unambitious 2020 emission pledges, Rogelj told The Telegraph.         
	The accord, finalised in the final hours of a UN climate change conference in December 2009, was the best political agreement that could emerge from that meeting.         
	Between January and March 2010, 76 countries pledged proposals to either cut or curb growth in greenhouse gas emissions.         
	The European Union has offered to cut emissions by 20 per cent to 30 per cent from 1990 level. The US has set a target of 17 per cent reduction below 2005 levels  which would be equivalent to just 3 per cent below the 1990 level.               
	India has offered voluntary domestic actions that will seek to reduce emissions intensity of its GDP by 20 to 25 per cent from its 2005 level. The other Basic countries have also made similar voluntary pledges. While negotiations are expected to continue  differences over the nature of a legally binding pact persist. The Basic countries have argued in favour of extending the Kyoto Protocol that imposes legally binding emissions cuts on the industrialised countries and seeks voluntary actions by developing countries. But the industrialised countries have sought new, alternative mechanisms.

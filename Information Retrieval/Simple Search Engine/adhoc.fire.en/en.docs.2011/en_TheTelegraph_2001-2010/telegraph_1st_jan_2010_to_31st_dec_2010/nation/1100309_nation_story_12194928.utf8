          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          Balakrishnan. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, March 8: The Supreme Court today filed an appeal with itself against the Delhi High Court order bringing the Chief Justice of Indias office under the ambit of the Right to Information Act.        
	It argued that the CJIs office went beyond the confines of the Supreme Court, and so did not come under the ambit of the RTI even though the apex courts executive wing, the registry, did.        
	It cited the higher judiciarys unique position and said its independence should be shielded from any pressures or prejudices.        
	Earlier, the high court had taken note of the overwhelming public opinion in favour of transparency and accountability and struck a blow at the top courts resistance to sharing information, saying: Sunlight is the best disinfectant.        
	Since then, Supreme Court judges have, in deference to public opinion, placed information about their assets on the court website. But the top court has resisted attempts to elicit information about judicial appointments and transfers.        
	Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan has consistently argued that opening up sensitive information would lead to greater executive interference in the judiciarys functioning, eroding its independence in the long run. He has sought a political solution.        
	But with the deadline for the appeal drawing nearer and no solution in sight, the court filed the appeal today.        
	The high court had taken an entirely erroneous view of the nature of the CJIs functioning, the appeal says. It argues that the multitude of roles the CJI plays means it is possible for him to maintain an office separate from that of the Supreme Court, and that this takes him out of the RTIs ambit.        
	His office, the CJI has argued, holds information relating to other judges only in a fiduciary capacity (in a capacity of trust). He is, therefore, not obliged under the RTI to reveal such information.        
	The appeal also claims that forcing judges to reveal personal information violates their right to privacy under Article 21.        
	Judges under our constitutional scheme occupy a unique position and discharge unique functions. The effect of the HC judgment seriously impairs the position of judges and the doctrine of independence of judiciary, it says.        
	The framers of the Constitution, it adds, had insulated the higher judiciary from any interference, pressure or scrutiny. Independence of judiciary also includes in its ambit the independence from any pressures or prejudices, it says.        
	Articles 124(4) and 121 would thus put the nail squarely on projections, prosecutions or attempts to investigate or inquire into or discuss the conduct of a judge or the performance of (his or her) duties and on/off court behaviour except as per the procedure provided (in the) Constitution.        
	The only process contemplated against an errant judge was the cumbersome process of impeachment, it said. This insulation of the higher judiciary from all interference, executive or otherwise, was consciously developed and (woven) into the fabric of our Constitution.        
	Deemed varsities        
	Deemed universities facing derecognition today told the Supreme Court that the appointment of P.N. Tandon as head of the committee that recommended the withdrawal of recognition was improper as he himself was president of a varsity whose credentials were questionable.        
	The apex court, which posted the next hearing on April 13, asked the Centre to post online the recommendations of the review committee and the action plan of a task force on the basis of which the government had sought to de-recognise 44 deemed universities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia returns as soul minister
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sonia returns as soul minister
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sonia at a Seva Dal convention in Delhi on Monday . (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, March 29: Sonia Gandhi is officially back as UPA IIs social conscience-keeper.        
	She was today re-named chairperson of the National Advisory Council, a post she had given up in 2006 after the Opposition accused her of violating the rule that MPs must not hold offices of profit during their tenure.        
	The National Advisory Council (NAC), dissolved in 2008, now stands revived.        
	A media release said Sonia would have the status of a cabinet minister. While it said the government would periodically specify the salary and allowances of the chairperson and other members, and that the chairperson would be entitled to the salary and perks of a cabinet minister, it added a rider to avoid possible controversy.        
	It said any MP appointed a council member would not be entitled to salary or perks other than the compensation laid down in the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, popularly called the office-of-profit law.        
	The law was amended during the UPAs first tenure to exempt 40-odd offices, including the NAC chairpersons. Sonia, however, not only refused to resume office, she quit her Lok Sabha membership and contested and won from Rae Bareli again.        
	While her stand vindicated her politically and morally, it also spelt the NACs end, prompting its supporters to mourn the death of a mechanism that had functioned as a humane counterbalance to the governments economic reforms agenda.        
	In August 2009, the Supreme Court upheld the amendment after which the Congress subtly began a campaign to resurrect the NAC with Sonia at its head. Sources, however, said she was unwilling.        
	By February this year, it was clear that it was a matter of time before the NAC would be back. An influential section of the Congress and the government was feeling restive about the negative perceptions of UPA II as a dispensation that pandered to the privileged and had veered away from the Common Minimum Programme crafted by the Congress and the Left in 2004.        
	With the Centre set to pass the food security law, it was felt that an oversight committee such as the NAC was needed to monitor its implementation.        
	While in its first tenure the NAC had drafted and pushed signature UPA laws such as the right to information, rural job guarantee, right to education and forest rights, it is now likely to monitor their implementation and see that their benefits reach the intended targets.        
	Some in the Congress feel that several of the governments education reforms, though well-meaning, have been largely elitist, and that other key sectors such as health and rural development are not getting enough attention.        
	The NAC will closely watch the implementation of the Sachar committee recommendations and the RTI Act. It is also likely to vet the communal violence bill, criticised for lacking teeth, and push for the implementation of the Ranganath Misra report on job reservation for Dalit and OBC Muslims.        
	The Congress believes that the Misra proposals could blunt the edge of the campaign against the womens reservation bill as anti-minority and anti-OBC.

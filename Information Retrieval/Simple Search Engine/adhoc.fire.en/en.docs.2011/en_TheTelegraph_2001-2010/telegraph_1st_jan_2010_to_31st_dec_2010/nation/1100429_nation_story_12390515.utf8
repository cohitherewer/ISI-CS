The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Stir cloud on SAIL
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Stir cloud on SAIL
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A SAIL mine in Orissa                                  
	Cuttack, April 28: Four central trade unions  Intuc, Citu, Hind Mazdoor Sangh (HMS) and Aituc  have jointly served notice to Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) for an indefinite strike from May 10 to meet demands of contract workers.        
	R.P. Singha, the HMS vice-president, told The Telegraph today: The strike from May 10 will be continuous and in all plants, mines, townships and offices wherever contract labourers are working in the SAIL establishments through whatever mechanism of indirect employment through contract.         
	Around 1.2 lakh contract workers are expected to participate in the strike.        
	Singha said the HMS decided to go ahead with the strike after no agreement could be reached in matters of wages, parity of wages between units/jobs, payment of interim relief to contract workers with arrears and other issues despite best efforts from workers and the four unions during discussion on April 24.        
	He said: The SAIL management refused to sign an MoU or even a detailed minutes on the agreed points between the management and four unions, saying that the workers concerned are on contract. It insults all contract workers who are toiling day and night for production, maintenance, service of all types.        
	The notice was served on Monday on a five-point charter of demands. The four central trade unions have demanded agreement on Rs 8,630 as minimum wage for all contract workers in SAIL to achieve parity of wages in all units/areas.         
	The demands also include Rs 1,000 interim relief to all contract workers in SAIL with full arrears, with effect from September 2008.                    
	Besides, a special voluntary retirement scheme should be introduced to ensure adequate financial benefits for the workers while retiring or taking VRS, the central trade unions said in their notice.        
	Singha said: We expect the SAIL management to conclude an agreement with the representatives of the Intuc, Citu, HMS and Aituc in the form of an MoU or a detailed minutes on the problems and demands of contract workers.

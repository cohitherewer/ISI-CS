The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kalmadi gets a tip: lie low
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Kalmadi gets a tip: lie low
          ARCHIS MOHAN                                        Suresh Kalmadi    
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: Commonwealth Games organising committee chief Suresh Kalmadi, who recently received a rap on his knuckles from the Prime Ministers Office, has now been asked by the governments media managers to keep a low profile till the event is over.         
	Pressure is also mounting on Kalmadi from the highest offices of the government to quit as president of the Indian Olympic Association, a post he has held since 1996, within a fortnight of the Games closing ceremony on October 14.         
	Kalmadi, who has largely stayed out of the media spotlight for the past fortnight, appears to be heeding the advice of the media managers in the Press Information Bureau who are trying to salvage the Games from becoming a public relations disaster.         
	A senior PIB official, brought in to convince participating countries that Games preparations were on track and to appeal to the media to be more supportive of what is a matter of national pride, recently asked Kalmadi to cut down on his television appearances.         
	Officials at PIB responsible for publicising government decisions and policies believe that keeping him away from television cameras can reduce some of the negative publicity surrounding the Games.         
	Rightly or wrongly, in the public mind Kalmadi has become synonymous with all that has gone wrong with CWG. There is a need to present fresher faces from the organising committee to win peoples trust back, said a government source.         
	For the past fortnight, the organising committee has made a conscious effort to ask several of its other office bearers, including Lalit Bhanot, Randhir Singh, Dalbir Singh and director-general V.K. Verma, to address the evening media conferences instead of Kalmadi. The Games promotional films on television featuring him are also less frequent.         
	But the real trouble for Kalmadi is expected to start once the Games close on October 14. Sports minister M.S. Gill is not alone in wanting his vice-like grip on the Olympic association to end. Even the PMO has stepped in and wants him to quit after the Games, something that has been relayed to him, sources said.         
	Kalmadi has been president of the Olympic association since 1996, president of the Asian Athletics Association since 2000 and was the president of the Athletics Federation of India from 1987 to 2006.         
	Apart from allegations of corruption in the run-up to the Games, Kalmadi had upset the sports ministry by playing a controversial role in the Hockey India elections. His dragging the Indian High Commission in London into a controversy regarding an e-mail allegedly forged by his officials has also upset the government.         
	Kalmadi could not be contacted despite phone calls to his residence and his cell phone.

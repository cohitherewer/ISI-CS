          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                        Moily    
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: Jagjivan Ram Yadav was in jail for 38 years before getting bail when he was 70. Had he been convicted  his alleged murder of a neighbours wife in 1968 is yet to be proved in court  he would have been sentenced to a maximum of 14 years.        
	Calcuttas Ajay Ghosh, accused of killing his brother in 1962, had to spend 37 years behind bars  when 14 would have been enough. He was never tried.         
	Yadav and Ghosh are among three lakh undertrials waiting for a verdict. But today, the two had reason for hope.         
	Forty-two undertrials, charged with petty offences, were released by a Delhi court, heralding the start of an ambitious government plan to fast-track the criminal justice system in the country where undertrials account for 70 per cent of the jail population.        
	The plan, Union law minister M. Veerappa Moily hopes, will reduce the number of undertrial prisoners by two-thirds in six months. Moily, present at the Patiala House court to witness the first such process, believes the plan will help decongest jails besides reducing case backlogs and delays in justice. The 42 undertrials confessed to their crimes in the court before their release orders were issued.         
	It is a reformative process and should be encouraged, Moily said. We plan to release 1.7 lakh prisoners till July 31. We have asked courts and legal service authorities to prepare a list of prisoners who can be released, he added.        
	According to the latest data available with the National Crime Records Bureau, 12.58 per cent of the undertrials in the country are in jail for theft, 11.52 are behind bars for attempt to murder and 0.11 per cent are serving time on charges related to eve teasing.         
	A plan is under way to speed up trials not related to heinous crimes. High courts have been asked to identify such undertrials so their cases can be wrapped up quickly. The cabinet, Moily said, has agreed in principle to implement the national legal mission, meant to guarantee justice to every citizen, including those in jails.         
	Some states have started work. Last week, the Chief Justice of Bombay High Court set up a panel of its three senior-most judges to monitor cases of undertrials in Maharashtra and Goa. Jharkhand and Bengal too have moved on the plan.

	Varanasi, Dec. 9: Hours after the blast rocked Sitala Ghat on Tuesday evening, priests in Varanasi were busy buying woollens for a toddler, fetching milk and sending out volunteers to look for her parents.         
	A one-year-old girl was found crying on the steps of Dashashwamedh Ghat shortly after the blast 100 metres away had killed two-year-old Swastika.         
	This is the cycle of death and survival that ties us with river Ganga. It is as if Ganga told us when we were crying for Swastika that here is a one-year-old abandoned girl to look after, said Dinesh Dube, a priest of a local temple.         
	The priests who see the child as a miracle of Ganga Maiyya have named her Ganga  and officials looking to reunite her with her parents or find a foster home have picked up the name too.         
	Ranjeev Sharma, an officer with Dashashwamedh Ghat police station who is monitoring Gangas rehabilitation, said: She will be produced before the Child Welfare Board tomorrow. The board will then wait for her original parents to come and take her. If no one comes, she might be given up in adoption to an eligible couple. Many couples have already shown interest in Ganga.         
	It is not clear if the child got separated from her parents in the aftermath of the blast or whether she had been abandoned.         
	She appears to be either from a south Indian family or from a Bengali family. She cannot speak yet, Dube said.         
	Babu Maharaj, a high priest at Dashashwamedh Ghat who picked up the girl from the steps, took care of her till last night when she was taken to Child Line, a voluntary organisation for the rehabilitation of children. Ganga Goddess never takes anything permanently. If she takes anything, she gives it back too. If Swastika is dead, Ganga is alive, he said.         
	Swastika was in her grandmothers lap when the bomb went off. She was hit by shrapnel and died of brain haemorrhage, doctors said.         
	What sin of a two-year-old could have given her a death as violent as this. What a strange way of God is this, her father, Santosh Kumar Sharma, kept muttering. A lecturer in a local girls college, Sharma is a devout Hindu.

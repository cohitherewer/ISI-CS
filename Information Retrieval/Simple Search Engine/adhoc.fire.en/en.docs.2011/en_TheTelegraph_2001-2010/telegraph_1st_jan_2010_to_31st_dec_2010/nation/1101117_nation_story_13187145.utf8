          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: Global warming may raise Indias catch of mackerel and sardines, reduce malaria transmission on the east coast and bring more rainfall across the country but, scientists caution, there is no cause for cheer.         
	A group of Indian scientists today presented Indias assessment of climate change that is consistent with international projections of rising temperatures, increasing sea level and growing threats of droughts and floods, but with more India-specific predictions.         
	The report from the Indian Network for Climate Change Assessment (INCCA) has predicted that global warming driven by a rise in greenhouse gas emissions will raise temperatures in India between 1.7 degrees Celsius and 2.2 degrees Celsius by 2030 from the 1970 levels. Rainfall is expected to increase, but the number of rainy days will decrease and most regions of India may experience five to 10 days of extreme rainfall, the report said.         
	The INCCA team drawn from 18 academic institutions used computer simulations of future climate scenarios to predict the impacts of changing climate on crops, fisheries, water as well as health.         
	The simulations suggest that yields of irrigated rice may increase by 5 per cent in Orissa and northern Andhra Pradesh but reduce by 20 per cent on the west coast. Maize yields may drop up to 50 per cent along the coastal regions.         
	There will be some losses, and some gains  but we shouldnt be too hasty and draw inferences from these results, said Soora Naresh Kumar, a member of INCCA at the environmental division of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute.         
	The report, which is primarily based on previously published studies, said the frequency of cyclonic storms over the Bay of Bengal appears to be decreasing  contrary to the widespread belief that it will increase with global warming. But the frequency of cyclones during the post-monsoon season is expected to increase.         
	The simulations predict a larger catch of the oil sardine and the Indian mackerel  small marine fish that is a source of protein for millions of people along Indias coastline. Over the past two decades, the distribution of oil sardines has extended into marine areas where they were not caught earlier. Rising temperatures also allow the Indian mackerel to expand northwards and deeper into the sea.         
	The mackerel catch off Indias eastern and northwestern coasts has increased from about 8 per cent between 1961 and 1976 to 18 per cent during 1997-2006. The mackerel takes advantage of rising temperature of subsurface water, one scientist said.         
	The INCCAs analysis predicts rising temperatures will create new foci of malaria transmission in India as mosquitoes will spread to colder zones such as the Himalayan states. Even Jammu and Kashmir, by 2030, will have a period of up to two months when malaria may be transmitted.         
	But malaria transmission period may reduce by 34 per cent along the eastern coast because of higher temperatures, said R. Dhiman, a scientist at the National Institute of Malaria Research, New Delhi, who simulated the health impacts of climate change.         
	Scientists caution that the simulations are not perfect because they rely on assumptions. None of the existing climate models  all of them developed in foreign institutions  can simulate the behaviour of the Indian monsoon efficiently.         
	Indias environment minister Jairam Ramesh who called a meeting of the INCCA today said Indian scientists need to develop their own climate simulation model instead of exclusively depending on foreign models.         
	But a homegrown climate model is a challenge for which India isnt quite ready yet.         
	We will need about 20 to 30 senior scientists and an equal number of post-doctoral researchers all working together to produce our own model, said Ashwini Kulkarni, a researcher at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. We dont have such an effort yet  its a big challenge to launch such a science project when everyone is running towards engineering, she said.

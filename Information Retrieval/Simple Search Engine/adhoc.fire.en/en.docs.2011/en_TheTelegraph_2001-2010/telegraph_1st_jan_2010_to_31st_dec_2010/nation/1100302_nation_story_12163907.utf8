The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | German tie-up for sea grass study

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 1: The Chilika Development Authority has tied up with Leibniz University of Germany to study sea grass and the expanding sea meadows of the lake.        
	Sea grass is a vital indicator of coastal ecosystem and sea grass meadows serve as spawning and nursery ground for a large numbers of fish and invertebrate species and play an important role in the food web of inshore ecosystem. Six genus and 14 species belonging to two families are known from Indian coast, said Ajit Pattnaik, the chief executive of CDA.        
	Despite a recent surge in research activity, studies on Indian sea grasses are scanty and inadequate.         
	The CDA has entered an MoU with Leibniz University for the identification of sea grass of Chilika by using molecular taxonomy  known to be the most authentic method of identification of a species. Molecular taxonomist Jutta Papenbrock of the universitys institute of botany has already visited Chilika along with Matthias Pilz from Cologne University and carried out an in depth study of the lagoon particularly the sea grass meadows. Based on their observation, they said the sea grass diversity of the lagoon is quite rich and there is necessity for its taxonomic study, said Pattnaik.                          
	The experts have agreed to extend all co-operation for the exploration of the sea grass resources of Chilika and application of molecular taxonomy for identification of the species and ecological study of the sea grass meadows, he added.        
	Dugong (sea cow)  a highly threatened species of sea grass reported from Chilika in 1902  is extinct. It will be great if the Dugong returns to the lake, hoped Pattnaik.        
	While sea grass meadows are declining globally, the meadows in Chilika have been expanding showing a very good sign of recovery of its ecosystem. The meadows, only 20sqkm before the hydrological intervention in 2000, have expanded to 80sqkm after restoration. Thus, it has become imperative to carry out advanced study to monitor the sea grass meadows of Chilika, said Pattnaik.        
	In Chilika, five species of sea grasses  Halodule uninervis, Halodule pinifolia, Halophila ovalis, Halophila ovata and Halophila beccarii  have been recorded so far. Of this, occurrence of Halodule uninervis, Halodule pinifolia and Halophila ovata from the lagoon are new. Prior to the opening of the new mouth of the lagoon, the most common sea grass recorded was Halophila ovalis that is more tolerant of low salinity and low light. However, after opening of the new mouth, it was found to exhibit good growth and gradually observed to spread even to deep-water zones. It was also recorded for the first time in deep waters from the creeks of Krushna Prasad Island with prolific growth during post-monsoon months forming extensive meadows. The opening of the new mouth provided stable salinity regime with little fluctuations, improved water clarity, especially in post-monsoon and summer months, favourable for the growth of sea grass communities. This resulted in the proliferation of the sea grass bed in to deep-water zone and appearance of species like Halodule uninervis, Halodule pinifolia and Halophila ovalis.

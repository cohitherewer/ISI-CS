          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 4: Apeejay Surrendra Group, one of the largest industrial groups based in Calcutta, has expressed unhappiness over land-related problems in its Bengal projects, echoing a grouse expressed by other investors.        
	We are a big investor in the state but all our projects that have to do with real estate ..., said Karan Paul, chairman of the Rs 6,000-crore group, leaving the sentence unfinished but not the message he tried to convey.        
	The group that owns hotels, tea gardens, shipping lines and retail chains is executing seven to eight projects in the state, including a Rs 500-crore hotel coming up off the EM Bypass, a school, a logistics hub and housing complexes.         
	Paul specifically mentioned the land logjams stalling the hotel project as well as a Rs 2,000-crore shipyard that was to come up in East Midnapores Geonkhali but will now have to be shifted to another site in the state.        
	Bengal Shipyard, a joint venture equally owned by Apeejay and partner Bharti Shipyard, required 500 acres but the land-acquisition process ran into trouble, like projects elsewhere in Bengal in the aftermath of the Singur and Nandigram land protests.        
	Paul warned of a delay of at least two to three years in the shipyard, announced three years ago with a promise to also generate much-needed jobs. We have not scrapped the project. But it cant come up there (Geonkhali). The company is looking for a new location.        
	The 250-room hotel off the EM Bypass in Calcutta is caught in a legal dispute over the land. We bought land from the CMDA (Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority). I dont how know what this controversy is all about, Paul said.        
	A family has taken the Bengal government-run CMDA to court claiming the land, located in a spot called Nonadanga as their own and accusing the authority of illegally transferring the plot. The court has told Apeejay and five other companies that got portions of the land to carry out construction at their own risk.         
	But Paul said he was confident of starting construction next year. We are about to finalise the design.

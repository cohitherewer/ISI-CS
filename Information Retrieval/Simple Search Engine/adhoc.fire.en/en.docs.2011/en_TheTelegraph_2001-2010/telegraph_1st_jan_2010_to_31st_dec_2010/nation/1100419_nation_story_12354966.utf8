          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Lapang                                  
	Shillong, April 18: Meghalaya chief minister D.D. Lapang is set to hand his resignation to governor R.S. Mooshahary here tomorrow, with his deputy Mukul Sangma expected to take over.        
	Meghalaya will now have its fourth government in just over two years since the March 2008 state elections.        
	The dissidence-hit Lapang met Sonia Gandhi in Delhi at 5.30pm today and conveyed his decision to quit in writing. The letter was promptly accepted.        
	Lapang had been appointed chief minister on May 13 last year. Today he conceded he had lost majority support in the Congress legislature party. Twenty-one of the Congresss 28 MLAs in the state have thrown their weight behind Sangma. Sangma, a four-time MLA, said from Delhi that a group of central Congress leaders would arrive in Shillong tomorrow to watch Lapang hand over charge to him.        
	The legislature party will meet tomorrow evening at Lapangs residence and is expected to formally elect Sangma its new leader.         
	Sangma and a few other Congress legislators had flown to Delhi yesterday to meet central Congress officials and discuss the leadership tussle within the state legislature party. Lapang has been in the national capital since Friday.

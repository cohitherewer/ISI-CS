          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 29: The Union environment ministry today denied the Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society in Mumbai an extra four weeks it had sought to respond to a notice asking why the 31-storey building shouldnt be pulled down.         
	In a note sent to the Adarsh societys legal counsel, the ministry said the request for an extra four weeks was demonstrably unreasonable but added that it would grant an extension of seven days. The ministry showcause notice, sent on November 12, had sought a reply within three weeks.         
	The ministry has rejected the societys plea that it was handicapped by unavailability of space and basic necessities.        
	It has pointed out that the societys own statement indicates that it had spent substantial time collecting documents and preparing for a writ petition.         
	The society has filed a writ petition in Bombay High Court.         
	You have chosen to give a comprehensive response on factual, legal and constitutional issues, the ministry said in a letter sent to the societys Mumbai-based advocate, Satish Maneshinde.        
	This clearly and compellingly shows you have not been handicapped in any manner in the preparation of your reply.        
	The ministry has also told the society that while it may be represented by its legal counsel, appropriate representatives of the society must be present at any discussions with the environment ministry.        
	The Adarsh high-rise, which violates coastal zone laws, has not been approved by either the Maharashtra government or the Union environment ministry.         
	The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority had sent a showcause notice to Adarsh in November 2009, seeking details of any coastal zone regulatory clearance it had obtained.

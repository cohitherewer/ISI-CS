The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi trusts Maya to keep peace
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi trusts Maya to keep peace
  - Heartland CM gets a pat for Ayodhya        ARCHIS MOHAN                      Mayavati                                
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: The Centre is confident the Mayavati government will be able to maintain peace in Uttar Pradesh after the Ayodhya verdict on September 24.        
	In an indirect pat on the back for the state government, Union home ministry officials appear upbeat about her administrations preparedness to handle law and order problems in the aftermath of the Allahabad High Court ruling.        
	The P. Chidambaram-headed ministry has taken note of Mayavatis ability to handle the situation so far. Sources pointed out that she has refrained from making public statements or indulging in grandstanding in the run-up to next Fridays verdict.         
	Mayavatis silence and behind-the-scenes activities to push her administration into taking precautionary steps have also contributed to the confidence.        
	We do not foresee any problems. The administration is on its toes. Local peace committees at the village and mohalla (neighbourhood) levels are continuously holding meetings, said a senior official.        
	As a result of the meetings, an understanding between leaders and members of the two communities has gained ground that further legal avenues, such as an appeal in the Supreme Court, are open whichever way the verdict goes, the official said.         
	The Centre is sending 40 companies of paramilitary forces, less than a tenth of the 630 demanded by the state. The official said, however, that more forces could be dispatched two to three days before the verdict.        
	The ministry is considering an advisory to the media  similar to the one issued days before the threat by a US pastor to burn copies of the Quran on 9/11  not to beam visuals or interviews that may inflame passions.        
	The verdict comes barely 10 days before the October 3 opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games, a showpiece event tied to the countrys pride that could be besmirched if communal trouble erupts.        
	But Mayavatis actions appear to have calmed such fears. Her public conduct is in sharp contrast to then chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs grandstanding days before BJP leader L.K. Advanis Rath Yatra was to reach Ayodhya in October 1990. Mulayam had boasted that not even a bird can enter the town, let alone kar sevaks.        
	Advani was put under house arrest by then Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad before he could reach Ayodhya, but Mulayams aggressive posturing provoked kar sevaks and polarised people. On October 30, 1990, Mulayams police opened fire on kar sevaks in Ayodhya, an action that helped the BJP win power in the state in 1991.

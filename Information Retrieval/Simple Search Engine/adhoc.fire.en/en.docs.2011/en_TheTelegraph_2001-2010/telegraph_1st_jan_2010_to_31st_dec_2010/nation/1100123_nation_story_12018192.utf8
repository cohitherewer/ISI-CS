  - Politicians not for sports field: Shivraj        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Chauhan (top); Modi                                       
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: If Narendra Modi can hold a bat, Shivraj Singh Chauhan can wield a bait.        
	The Madhya Pradesh chief minister today took a veiled dig at his Gujarat counterpart and possible future rival by saying politicians should not head sports bodies. Modi is chief of the Gujarat Cricket Association.        
	Ostensibly, the salvo was aimed at Union sports minister M.S. Gill. BJP sources, however, said Chauhans real target was Modi and not Gill or the host of BJP leaders who head various sports associations.        
	Chauhan went out of his way to tell a news conference in Delhi how he regretted that his government could not hand over Rs 1 crore to the womens hockey team because of Gills inaction.        
	We are ready to give the amount and are awaiting the ministers response on whose name the cheque should be written. I had earlier written to the Hockey India chief but since I got no response from him, I met Gill and reiterated our request, he said.        
	Chauhan described the situation as a tamasha and added: There should be sporting spirit in politics but there should be no politics in sports. Unfortunately, there is too much politics in sports in our country. Sports bodies have become politicised. I believe politicians should not be heading sports bodies. In fact, they should leave such bodies.        
	On the face of it, the comments could rile many BJP leaders. Arun Jaitley is Delhi cricket chief; Yashwant Sinha and V.K. Malhotra head the countrys tennis and archery associations; and the Himachal Pradesh chief ministers son Anurag Thakur  a Lok Sabha MP  chairs the state cricket association.        
	Sources, however, said the comments were aimed at Modi who, Chauhan knew, would be his direct competitor three years on when the time came to pick the next BJP president, who would lead the party into the 2014 elections.        
	Like Modi, Chauhan is a long-distance runner who has set his sights outside Madhya Pradesh, a party source said.        
	Chauhan and Modi were on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs radar screen when it was looking for a new party chief last year. Both, however, had declined when they were sounded out, saying they wanted to prove themselves in their own states first. Modi has an election in 2012 and Chauhan in 2013.        
	Modi has won Gujarat twice and Chauhan has triumphed in Madhya Pradesh once. Both are from the backward castes, a fact that recommends them to the Sangh-BJP because the Other Backward Classes make up the largest electoral block in most states.        
	Both had worked as general secretaries in the central party organisation; so they know how to negotiate the slippery by-lanes of power in Delhi.        
	The dissimilarity lies in their personalities. Modi is constantly trying to shed his anti-Muslim image and showcase himself as someone in sync with the times by associating himself with cricket, doing sartorial makeovers and launching investment drives.        
	Chauhan too speaks the reforms language but those close to him say he would rather be known as a dharti putra (son of the soil) and Sangh die-hard.        
	He had earlier spoken out against Modis law that makes voting compulsory in local body elections. Chauhan had said the electoral process should be reformed to encourage voluntary voting.

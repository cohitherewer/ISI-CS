The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Flood money back to Modi
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Flood money back to Modi
  - Return of money or return of empathy too, wonders Bihar ally        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                   
	Ahmedabad, June 19: Nitish Kumar today returned Rs 5 crore the Gujarat government had sent as aid to Bihar during the 2008 Kosi floods, as his public war with Narendra Modi over a patronising advertisement continued.        
	The rebuff, the Bihar chief ministers latest to his Gujarat counterpart since he virtually told the BJP leader to get lost from his state, came exactly a week after Nitish said he would return the money.        
	The move, amid signs of a serious rupture between the allies, drew sharp criticism from both NDA partner BJP and Opposition Congress, while former chief minister and Bihar rival Lalu Prasad called it nothing but an absurdity.        
	Congress chief Sonia Gandhis political secretary Ahmed Patel said Nitish had insulted the people of Gujarat.        
	An official in the Gujarat chief ministers office said the CMO today received a letter and a cheque for Rs 5 crore from the Bihar government. The letter said the amount was being returned because it was lying unutilised.        
	The return of the amount is the latest in a series of snubs the two chief ministers have traded since Nitish, who is trying to flaunt his secular credentials, put Modi down publicly, saying the last thing he wanted was to be seen in the company of the BJP leader.        
	The excuse for the snub had been provided by Modi himself in the shape of patronising newspaper ads that praised him as a role model for Nitish and for the help he had given to Bihar during the floods. Nitish termed the ad uncultured and promised to return the Rs 5 crore.        
	A senior BJP leader said Nitishs action didnt seem to be impulsive tokenism. It is part of a strategy to get rid of the BJP before the Assembly elections later this year.        
	A Modi loyalist said Nitish had given a political colour to a humanitarian aid.        
	In Patna, Lalu Prasad told PTI: Your (Nitishs) political enmity with Modi has nothing to do with the relief... after all, it was the hard-earned money of the people of Gujarat.         
	Observers said Nitishs move was a setback for the NDA as a whole barely months ahead of elections.

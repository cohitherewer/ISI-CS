          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: Scientists have unravelled a primary mechanism that controls blood pressure in the human body, a research advance that may yield novel therapies and help prevent deaths among pregnant women.         
	A nine-member research team in the UK has identified a distinct structural change in a protein called angiotensinogen to a form that more effectively releases angiotensin which contributes to blood pressure.         
	The finding, published in todays issue of the journal Nature, raises the possibility that the structural change  a primary switch for high blood pressure  may be blocked to prevent the condition from developing.         
	Weve found the first step in the main process that controls blood pressure, said Robin Carrell, a research team member at the University of Cambridge.         
	By getting to look at an earlier change, were opening up new strategies and coming closer to the reason why people develop hypertension (high blood pressure), Carrell said in a statement issued through the university.         
	High blood pressure is a major risk factor for a number of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. Epidemiological studies in India in the past have suggested that one in four persons in urban India and one in 10 persons in rural India suffers from high blood pressure  and the total number of patients with hypertension may cross 60 million.         
	Obesity, salt and alcohol are the three most important factors currently driving high blood pressure observed in India, said Dorairaj Prabhakaran, a cardiologist and executive director of the Centre for Chronic Disease Control, New Delhi.         
	High levels of angiotensin make blood vessels contract and lead to high blood pressure. While drugs that inhibit an enzyme known as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are used as conventional anti-hypertension drugs, these medicines focus on the molecular mechanisms downstream of the primary switch  after hypertension has already developed.         
	Scientists are hoping that the discovery of the specific structural change in angiotensinogen will stir drug-designers to work towards new molecules that could prevent this change  and thus prevent hypertension from taking root.         
	Researchers are also hoping that the new finding would help reduce deaths from a serious condition called pre-eclampsia  high blood pressure among pregnant women.         
	Although it is not a common condition  it affects only about 8 to 10 in every 100 pregnant women  pre-eclampsia can threaten the health and survival of a pregnant woman and her child. A study from Banaras Hindu University published in the journal of the Association of Physicians of India this month found the incidence of pre-eclampsia to be 6 per cent.         
	The Cambridge-Nottingham team said its finding could reinforce efforts to develop new therapies that seek to block the change in angiotensinogen and prevent pre-eclampsia.

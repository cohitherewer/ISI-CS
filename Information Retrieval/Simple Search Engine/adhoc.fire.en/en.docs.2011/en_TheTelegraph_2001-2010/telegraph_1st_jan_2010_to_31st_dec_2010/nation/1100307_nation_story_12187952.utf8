	New Delhi, March 6: Scientists have observed an exotic subatomic particle that could push physicists closer to their goal of fathoming why half the universe vanished after its creation in the Big Bang some 13.7 billion years ago.         
	An international team of scientists created the previously unseen particle, called an antimatter hypernucleus, in experiments in a US laboratory that fleetingly produced the conditions that existed only a few microseconds after the Big Bang.         
	In the experiments at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Long Island, New York, scientists directed beams of gold nuclei accelerated to speeds close to that of light to collide, producing billions of short-lived subatomic particles.         
	Scientists from 13 countries, including physicists from Calcuttas Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC) and five other Indian institutions, contributed to the experiments whose findings appeared on Friday in the US journal Science.         
	Among 109 million collision events, the researchers spotted telltale tracks of 70 antimatter hypernuclei  particles made up of an antiproton, an antineutron, and another particle called an antilambda.         
	While antiparticles  somewhat like mirror images of ordinary particles  have been observed for decades and the first hypernucleus was observed in 1952, an antimatter hypernucleus had never been observed.         
	The new discovery may help us understand the predominance of matter over antimatter, said a senior VECC physicist and member of the collaboration who requested not to be named.         
	The gold-gold collisions in the Brookhaven accelerator produced a form of matter called quark-gluon plasma  a soup of fundamental particles  that physicists believe existed a few microseconds after the Big Bang.         
	Matter and antimatter emerged with equal abundance in both the gold-gold collision experiments and in the Big Bang. In contrast, antimatter appears to be largely absent in the present-day universe.         
	Understanding precisely how and why there is a predominance of matter over antimatter remains a major unsolved problem of physics, said Brookhaven team member Zhangbu Xu, a lead author of the Science paper. A solution will require measurements of subtle deviations from perfect symmetry between matter and antimatter, Xu said in a statement issued through the laboratory..         
	The antimatter hypernuclei produced in the Brookhaven accelerator had an average lifetime of about 182 trillionths of a second.         
	In future research, scientists hope to study lifetimes and masses of the particles in greater detail. A study of antimatter hypernuclei could help us understand better what made antimatter disappear soon after the creation of the universe, said Anju Bhasin, professor of physics at Jammu University.         
	The antimatter problem is important, said D.P. Mahapatra, a senior physicist at the Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar, and another team member. Matter and antimatter were produced in equal quantities after the Big Bang. The question is why do we now see only matter and no antimatter? In this experiment, the antimatter produced gets converted to other particles through various kinds of interactions.         
	This is exactly what happened during the Big Bang, Mahapatra said.         
	The Indian groups designed and installed a photon detector for accelerator experiments at Brookhaven, and participated in some of the data analysis for the collisions that led to the observation of the antimatter hypernucleus.

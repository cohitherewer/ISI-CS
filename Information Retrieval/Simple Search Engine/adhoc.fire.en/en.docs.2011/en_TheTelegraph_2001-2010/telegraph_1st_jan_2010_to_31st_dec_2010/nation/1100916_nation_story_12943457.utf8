          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Nitin Gadkari at the all-party meeting on Kashmir in New Delhi on Wednesday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: The BJP emphasised at the all-party meeting on Kashmir that any decision taken cannot exclude the people of Jammu and the Leh-Ladakh region because they belong to the state.        
	BJP president Nitin Gadkari  who attended the meeting with L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley  in his speech opposed any demand for autonomy and made it clear that any negotiation with the groups concerned the Centre and state government might hold must be within the constitutional framework and only after the groups have abjured violence.         
	In that situation, the BJP would give constructive co-operation in the development process, said spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad.        
	The BJP did not raise the issue of the chief minister Omar Abdullahs resignation, although just three days ago the party had demanded that he should be replaced by a more acceptable person because he was unpopular and completely alienated from his people. Asked, Prasad said: Omar Abdullah was not there at the meeting. We have already publicly demanded his resignation because he cannot escape blame for whats happening there.        
	Gadkari praised the security forces for their exemplary work in combating terrorism and said no decision that might demoralise them should be taken.        
	Asked if the BJP was satisfied with the outcome of todays deliberations, Prasad said: We are yet to find out the governments view. Let a decision come.        
	Sources said the partys representatives felt that there was nothing new in either the Prime Ministers peace appeal or the decision to send an all-party delegation to the Valley. However, Prasad said the BJP would be part of the team.

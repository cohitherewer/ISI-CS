The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Prachanda thwarted, big brother India smug
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Prachanda thwarted, big brother India smug
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                           Prachanda                                  
	New Delhi, Sept 19: The unilateral and frustrated withdrawal of Nepali Maoist boss Prachanda from the prime ministerial race is occasion for a little glee and much gratification among Indias Nepal policy makers.        
	They wont admit it publicly but Prachandas backing off is the consequence of sustained and often barely-concealed efforts by New Delhi to ensure he does not muster enough support in the Constituent Assembly to return as head of government.         
	The failure to elect a Prime Minister even after seven attempts means that the disabling political deadlock in Nepal continues.        
	Madhav Nepal is a lame-duck caretaker in the Prime Ministers office; the polity and the Constituent Assembly remain deeply fractured; and the peace process, pegged on the contentious issue of integrating the barracked Peoples Liberation Army into the mainstream, has become an extended impasse.        
	Above all, the writing of a constitution for the new republic, the Constituent Assemblys central mandate, is in peril of lapsing beyond the revised deadline set for end-May 2011.         
	The political process remains in a state of ramshackle breakdown, a top Nepali politician told The Telegraph. At the moment, the constitution seems the least of the priorities because there is so much jockeying for power. And yet, there is no breakthrough in sight, we are in a state of fruitless drift. He was probably hinting at the forthcoming eighth attempt at electing a Prime Minister scheduled for September 26.         
	Prachanda having withdrawn, senior Nepali Congress leader Ram Chandra Paudel is the frontrunner, but it is already apparent to most that he cant breast the tape because he does not have the numbers to run on.         
	A victor must get a minimum of 301 votes in the Constituent Assembly. Paudels best count in previous attempts has been 125-odd, and he cannot hope to better that by too many because the United Marxist-Leninists (UML), the party of caretaker Prime Minister Madhav Nepal, has decided to play neutral.        
	But for all that, Delhi is content to have successfully circumvented Prachandas return as head of government and keep in place a precarious power balance in Kathmandu that it can manoeuvre from time to time.         
	On the face of it, the pro-active Indian mission in Kathmandu allays any suggestions of an interventionist role.         
	Speaking to a leading Nepali weekly, ambassador Rakesh Sood assumed a duly correct hands-off tone. Political stability, he said, is first and foremost the task of the Nepali political leadership. It is not Indian policy that can bring about political stability but the desire and commitment of Nepali political leadership. As in the past, India has always indicated its willingness to support the efforts of the Nepali political leaders.         
	Events over the past few months, though, would suggest a higher level of Indian intercession than what ambassador Sood, or the foreign office, would admit to. Especially when it has come to blockading Prachandas attempts at regaining power.        
	When first elected Prime Minister as head of the largest party following the elections of 2008, Prachanda had been welcomed by India, if only grudgingly. Delhi had woefully misread the underpinnings of that campaign and a little startled that the Maoists had swept far ahead of the competition. Even so, it greeted the Maoists entry into the mainstream and hoped, perhaps, that they would slowly get co-opted into accepting the parameters of working under the Indian sphere of influence.         
	That expectation was jolted when Prachanda sought to install his own man as Nepali army chief, a move that India not only opposed but also saw as a sign that the Maoists would assert themselves more in power than the other Nepali political parties.         
	The crisis over the army chief culminated in Prachandas resignation, and the suspicions that erupted from the episode have yet to die down. Each time Prachanda has looked close to tipping the scales in his favour, something has happened to scatter away the support he shored up among non-Maoist parties, especially the four Madhesi (Terai) parties who together account for 82 Constituent Assembly seats and could well have swung things Prachandas way.         
	Delhi has effected a few sophisticated interventions. Like the sudden Kathmandu visit, between the third and fourth rounds of polling, of Shyam Saran as the Prime Ministers roving emissary. Saran, a former ambassador widely respected in Nepal, called Madhesi members of the Constituent Assembly for dinner during his trip and is believed to have argued against a vote for Prachanda.         
	Sarans counsel worked.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, Jan. 25: Vandals desecrated two churches in Karnataka today and damaged a statue of Mother Mary, prompting increased police presence at religious institutions in the state which had seen a series of attacks on churches in 2008.        
	Police said a statue of Mother Mary at a Mysore church was found broken today while a glass case protecting a statue of the Blessed Virgin outside a church in Uttara Kannada district, 380km from Mysore, had been shattered.        
	Its too early to read any connection between the two, said Karnataka additional director-general of police (law and order) A.R. Infant. We are taking precautions to see that these things do not recur.        
	In Bangalore, chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa directed the police to investigate.        
	A religious leader said there had been similar incidents in the recent past in Uttara Kannada. Father Derek Fernandes, the bishop of Karwar, said on January 22, residents had thwarted an attempt to damage a cross in Mundalli town. We had approached the police, but they took it lightly.        
	Eight persons, who had allegedly issued a public threat to destroy churches in Karnataka if attacks on Indians in Australia continued, were later arrested in connection with the Mundalli case.        
	Rev. Bernard Moras, the archbishop of Bangalore, sounded sceptical. Where is the connection (with the Australia attacks)? These people have once again started in a bigger way, he said, referring to the 2008 attacks.        
	Right-wing groups attacked at least a dozen churches in three districts in the BJP-ruled state in September 2008, apparently provoked by alleged conversion activity. No action has been taken against them. They feel they are strong now, Moras said.        
	Father Fernandes said three incidents of vandalism at churches were reported in September and October but no action was taken.

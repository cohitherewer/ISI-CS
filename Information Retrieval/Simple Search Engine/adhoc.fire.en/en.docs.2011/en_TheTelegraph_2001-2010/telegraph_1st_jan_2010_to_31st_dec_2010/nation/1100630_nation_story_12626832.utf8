          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, June 29: Christian groups in Nepal have joined hands to protect the countrys secular character  with a little help from the politically correct Indian Church.        
	The United Christian Alliance of Nepal, a joint platform of the Catholic Church and nine Protestant groups, was launched early this month to provide a unified Christian voice on national issues of common interest.        
	The move follows a conference in Mumbai organised by Nepalis living in India to prepare the ground for the restoration of the monarchy and also to reconvert Nepal  declared a secular nation a few years ago  into a Hindu nation.        
	The Church in Nepal had earlier sought the assistance of the Church in India on how to handle a Maoist demand to accommodate tens of thousands of cadres.        
	The cadres, who were coming for a May Day rally in Kathmandu, needed a place to stay and Maoist leaders were insisting that the Church provide the space.        
	At a loss what to do, the higher-ups of the Nepal Church had knocked on the doors of the more experienced Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI), the highest ecclesiastical body for Catholics in India.        
	The CBCI has a big say in the affairs of the Nepal Church, which until 1983 was part of various Indian dioceses. The politically correct CBCI advised the Nepal Church not to align with any political party as it could be harmful for the larger interests of the Church.        
	A unified Christian platform is very significant when the secular character of the country is under threat. We are happy that we could do a little bit from our side to help Nepali Christians to find a common voice, said a CBCI priest who didnt want to be named.         
	He said minority groups in Nepal, including Christians and Muslims, were worried about the countrys secular character getting affected.        
	The allusion was to the Mumbai conference last month. Delegates from 64 countries, including the US, Japan and Britain, had taken part in the Nepal Hindu State Unity Campaign, which, he said, was organised with the support of the Shiv Sena and the World Hindu Federation.        
	The new joint platform will guide Nepalese Christians to retain the secular character of the country, the priest added. According to him, the new forum had decided not to accept funds from any other country, including India, to avoid allegations of foreign funding.         
	The co-ordinators will be chosen by rotation from different communities. The alliances role, sources said, would be to give clear statements to the local government, political parties and the mainstream media.

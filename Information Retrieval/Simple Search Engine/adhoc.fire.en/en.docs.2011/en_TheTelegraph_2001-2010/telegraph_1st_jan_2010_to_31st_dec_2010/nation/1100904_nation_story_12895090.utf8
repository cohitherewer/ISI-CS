The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPI echoes Mamata
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CPI echoes Mamata
          J.P. YADAV                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: The CPI today virtually echoed Mamata Banerjee and demanded a judicial probe into the false-encounter killing of Maoist leader Azad, a move that could annoy big brother CPM.        
	CPI deputy general secretary Sudhakar Reddy, seen as a serious contender to succeed A.B. Bardhan as party chief, made the demand in a letter to Andhra Pradesh chief minister K. Rosaiah.        
	I am writing (for the) second time to you about an enquiry, this time for judicial enquiry, into the killing of Mr Azad alias Raj Kumar, in (a) false encounter in Adilabad by Andhra Pradesh police, Reddy wrote in the letter, dated September 3.        
	Embarrassed CPM leaders refused to react. During the just-ended monsoon session of Parliament, the CPM had attacked Mamata for demanding a probe into Azads death and sought a clarification from the Centre.        
	When contacted, Reddy confirmed making the demand. Asked about the mismatch with the CPMs stand, Reddy said: I believe the CPM will also not support a Naxalite being killed in a false encounter.        
	A senior CPI leader said: Both the CPI and the CPM had opposed the cold-blooded killing of Naxalites in the 70s. How can the CPM now take a different stand and support Azads killing? I believe they too will back our demand for a judicial probe. Reddy claimed the CPM had problems with Mamatas links with Maoists and not with her demand to probe Azads death.        
	A senior CPM leader said: We had attacked Mamata for passing a judgement over Azads death and sought an explanation from the Centre. I am not aware of the demand made by the CPI, so it would not be proper to comment.        
	Reddy, a former MP from Andhra Pradesh, wrote in his letter: I do not know Mr Azad. I never met him. But as I understand, he was never in action squads. He added: The Outlook magazine has published... that Azad was killed from (the) close range of 7.5cm, according to (the) forensic report, which they claim to be having with them. If it is true it cannot be an encounter. It is to be treated as cold-blooded murder.

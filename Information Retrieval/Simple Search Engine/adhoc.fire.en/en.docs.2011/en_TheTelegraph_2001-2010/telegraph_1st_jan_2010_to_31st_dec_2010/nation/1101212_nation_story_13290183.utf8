	New Delhi, Dec. 11: Ajay Gupta finished his dinner, drove to a deserted place, parked his black Honda City and then swallowed the poison.        
	The 42-year-old Delhi businessman did everything he could to pass his suicide off as murder so that his Bengali wife from Calcutta, Manisha Das, could claim the insurance of Rs 10 crore. That would help pay off his debts which had run up to Rs 9 crore.        
	But police, who had been probing the mysterious murder for the past 11 days, cracked the case after talking to a friend of the businessman.        
	Gupta had an insurance of Rs 10 crore in his name and wanted to present his suicide as murder so that his wife could claim the insurance and pay off the debts after his death, joint commissioner (north) Karnal Singh said.        
	Singh said Gupta, who had two daughters with Manisha, 35, was acutely depressed as his business had been running up losses since the past five years. His wife is from Calcutta and is shattered after she learnt about the motive behind her husbands suicide, the officer added.        
	Initially, the police had started a murder probe after Guptas body was found on November 30. The post-mortem report revealed that he died of poisoning. We suspected foul play and started a murder case, said an officer.        
	What might have further misled the cops was that the body had been found abandoned.         
	The cops later arrested two drug addicts, Ajay Lakra and Kumar Raju, who they said found Gupta lying unconscious in the drivers seat on November 30. They took away his purse, mobile, wristwatch, ATM cards, shoes, spectacles, pen and hearing-aid. After this they shifted him to the rear seat while Lakra took the wheel, the officer said.        
	They later dumped Guptas body and fled with the car, which they abandoned after an accident. A search is on to trace the vehicle, the officer added.        
	It was after the cops got hold of Guptas mobile that they realised it wasnt murder. The call details revealed the names of people he had spoken to that night.         
	After speaking to one of his friends, Rajesh Wasan, we came to know about Guptas plan. He told us Gupta used to ask him to arrange for a pistol or poison and how he wanted to present his suicide as murder, said an officer.         
	The police said Gupta also called up a friend saying he had got a threat call from a man who wanted to meet him.         
	We have zeroed in on one of his acquaintances who provided him the bottle of poison on the night of November 29, said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Brazils poverty pill draws Indians
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Brazils poverty pill draws Indians
          K.P. NAYAR                      Luiz Incio Lula da Silva                          
	Brasilia, April 15: The somnolent capital of Brazil is somewhat reeling from a sudden invasion of politicians from India and other Third World countries struggling to understand a curious phenomenon here of Luiz Incio Lula da Silva.        
	President Lula has ruled this country for nearly eight years and still retains a popularity rating of 73 per cent, defying the incumbency fatigue, the curse of many governments worldwide.        
	When he was elected for the first time in 2002, Lula had the support of only 61 per cent of the Brazilian people.        
	He has consistently consolidated and strengthened his hold on the people by launching a populist programme called Bolsa Familia within months of coming to office. In merely two years, it reduced the percentage of people living below the poverty line in Brazil from 28.2 per cent in 2003 to 22.7 per cent in 2005.        
	Indias interest in Bolsa Familia has suddenly grown because of the widely held belief that its National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) played a crucial role in the return of the UPA government to power in last years elections.        
	Union commerce minister Anand Sharma, who is now here as part of prime minister Manmohan Singhs delegation to a summit meeting of the India-Brazil-South Africa (Ibsa) group held today is the latest politician from India to marvel at Lulas hold on his people.        
	Sharma, one of Indias rising politicians, has been itching to prove his full legitimacy as a man of the people by contesting a Lok Sabha seat in recent years, but has been unable to do so.        
	Instead, he is now finding himself out of Parliament altogether, his membership of the Rajya Sabha having expired and his party so far unable to find a berth from a state other than his own Himachal Pradesh.        
	A few weeks ago, M.A. Baby, Keralas education minister and a central committee member of the CPM, was in Brazil. He came with a keen interest in this countrys impressive social welfare schemes.        
	The CPM is facing an uphill and almost impossible fight to return to power in Kerala, where state elections are due in 2011.        
	Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit and the states chief secretary Rakesh Mehta wanted to visit Brazil a few weeks ago, but had to cancel their plans because of their preoccupation with the coming Commonwealth Games, for which, preparations are lagging behind schedule.        
	In August 2008, Dixits administration launched its poverty alleviation programme, Samajik Suvidha Sangam or Mission Convergence in Delhi with the motto of reaching the unreached.        
	The programme is believed to played some role in Dixits re-election in December 2008, when she did a hat trick of becoming chief minister of Delhi for the third time.        
	Since then the Delhi administration has been in close contact with those who run Brazils Bolsa Familia programme in an effort to improve Delhis Mission Convergence by incorporating model elements of Lulas efforts.        
	The chief ministers visit would have been the high point of these contacts. The Delhi administration instead sent a team of high officials who are now here continuing those contacts.        
	But India is not the only country to show an interest in Lulas pioneering programme. Recently, New Yorks city government announced Opportunity NYC, a conditional cash transfer programme for poor New Yorkers modelled on the Brazilian effort.        
	In the seven years since its launch, Brazils Bolsa Familia has become the worlds largest conditional cash transfer programme benefiting over 45 million poor Brazilians.        
	It is called conditional cash transfer because it benefits people below the poverty line only if poor children are sent to school, for instance. The programme gives Reals R$22 ($12.53) per month for every child attending school up to a maximum of three children for every Brazilian family whose income is less than R$140 ($79.78) per month. If a family is in extreme poverty, with monthly income of less than R$70 ($39.89), that family will get a monthly sum of R$68 ($38.75).         
	Parents who vaccinate their children and thus improve the basic health levels of the nation as a whole will similarly get subsidies under Bolsa Familia.         
	Sources in the Prime Ministers delegation here for the Ibsa and Brazil-Russia-India-China (Bric) summits said Congress president Sonia Gandhis interest in Bolsa Familia has been aroused by the high level of transparency and relative absence of corruption in Brazils programme. She would like similar transparency in Indias NREGA.        
	The name of every beneficiary in Lulas pioneering programme is on a web site and beneficiaries withdraw their money through citizenship cards similar to the unique national identity card which India is now trying to create for all citizens.        
	In addition to India, ministers and officials from at least 20 countries including Chile, Mexico, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey and Morocco have visited Brazil in their efforts to emulate Bolsa Familia.        
	The World Bank has also adopted it as a model in its poverty alleviation efforts.

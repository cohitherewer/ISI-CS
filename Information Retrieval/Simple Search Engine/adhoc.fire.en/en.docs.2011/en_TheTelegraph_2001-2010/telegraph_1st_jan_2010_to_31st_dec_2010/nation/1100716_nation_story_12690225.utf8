          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                             
	Srinagar, July 15: An army colonel and two majors have been charged by Jammu and Kashmir police with killing three civilians in an alleged fake encounter.        
	Apart from Colonel D.K. Pathania, Major Moriya and Major Upinder Singh, five jawans  Satbir Singh, Hawaldar Bura Singh, Chandra Bhan, Baginder Singh and Narinder Singh  have been named in the 600-page chargesheet.        
	They have all been booked for murder and criminal conspiracy under the Ranbir Penal Code, Kashmirs equivalent of the Indian Penal Code.        
	The death of the three persons on April 30 in the Machil sector near the Line of Control sparked widespread protests in the Valley. The three  Shahzad Ahmad Khan, Mohammad Shafi Lone and Riyaz Ahmad Lone, all Sopore residents  were allegedly told to work as porters for the army but were taken to Machil and gunned down. The army has claimed the three were infiltrators and that they had received arms training across the LoC.         
	Three other persons  two civilians and a Territorial Army soldier  have also been named along with the Rajputana Rifles officers and jawans. Colonel Pathania, Major Moriya and Major Upinder Singh had no direct role in the operation, though the documents submitted by them showed there was a conspiracy with a common intention, said a police officer.         
	The chargesheet has blamed the army for not handing over the accused to the police for questioning and requested the court to facilitate their handover. The chalan has opined that the case has to be tried in a civil court and there is no scope for a court martial, a police officer said.        
	Never in the last 20 years has an army officer been handed over to the police. In this case, though, defence minister A.K. Antony had promised full co-operation with the state. The army had earlier insisted the officers and jawans be tried by a court martial but the Sopore court said they should co-operate with the police.         
	The army has already removed Colonel Pathania from the command, while Major Upinder has been suspended pending an inquiry.         
	Srinagar bandh        
	Stone-throwing protesters enforced a bandh in Srinagar today by targeting shops and vehicles. The violence was in response to the meeting between Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers S.M. Krishna and Shah Mehmood Qureshi in Islamabad.

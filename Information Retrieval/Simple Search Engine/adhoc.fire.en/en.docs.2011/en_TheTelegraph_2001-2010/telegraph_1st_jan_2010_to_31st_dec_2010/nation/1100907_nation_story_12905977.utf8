The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CM line pays off, for now 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CM line pays off, for now 
          J.P. YADAV                                        Rupesh Kumar Sinha.   (Ashok Sinha)    
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: The release of the three hostages today brought double relief for Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar as he deflected criticism from what is perceived to be a soft approach towards the Maoists and strengthened his political line ahead of the state elections.         
	The safe and unconditional return of the hostages also disarmed Nitishs adversaries who were left in no position to target the government on the issue.        
	Coming just ahead of the elections, it was victory in a way for Nitish as he did not succumb before the Maoist demand for the release of their jailed colleagues.        
	 For long, successive governments in Bihar have shied away from going on the offensive against the Maoists primarily because the rebels derive their strength from the politically powerful backward castes.         
	Nitish, too, was no different when he took over the reins from Rabri Devi five years ago. He adopted the strategy of focusing on delivery and governance, keeping police action in the background.                   Mohammad Ahsan Khan. (Ranjeet Kumar Dey)      
	Like the previous RJD government, he did not want to rub the Maoists the wrong way, afraid that it could harm him politically as he aspired to emerge as a mass leader of the backward classes. His strategy seemed to be working fine  the state witnessed no major Maoist attack in the past five years  till the latest incident shook the government.         
	Initially, it appeared that Nitish was groping for a way out of the crisis but finally managed to come out unscathed.         
	The ultimate losers were the Maoists who stood discredited for killing a tribal policeman, Lucas Tete, and freeing others who hailed from powerful sections of the Bihar society.        
	The Maoist fighters in Bihar are heavily dominated by Yadavs and other backward classes. It was learnt that the caste of sub-inspector Abhay Yadav weighed upon the Maoists in a big way to decide on releasing the captive policemen. To spread terror, the Maoists therefore chose to kill the poor tribal.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shashi clears interlocutor air 
                            
	Riyadh, March 1 (PTI): Minister of state for external affairs Shashi Tharoor yesterday said Saudi Arabia could be a valuable interlocutor but clarified after criticism back home that he did not mean Riyadh should be a mediator between India and Pakistan.        
	 We feel that Saudi Arabia of course has a long and close relationship with Pakistan but that makes Saudi Arabia even a more valuable interlocutor for us, Tharoor said, drawing condemnation from the BJP and the CPI.        
	Tharoor is on a three-day visit to the oil-rich kingdom with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	Hours after making the remarks, Tharoor, who had earlier run into controversies overt tweets on austerity measures and immigration policy, came out with an official statement. What I said was that Saudi Arabia was a valuable interlocutor for India. Any other interpretation was neither meant nor warranted, Tharoor said.        
	The minister tweeted: If I speak to u, u are my interlocutor! I mentioned the Saudis as OUR interlocutors, ie the people we are here to speak to. Some misinterpretn. No chance of my saying Saudi Arabia should be a mediator. Never said that or anything like it.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          President Pratibha Patil (right), accompanied by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Kumar Bansal (centre), arrives at Parliament in New Delhi on Monday. (AP)      
	New Delhi, Feb. 22: The government today vowed to tackle Left-wing extremism and rising food prices but the usual cocktail of promises was missing from the customary presidential address to Parliament before the beginning of a session.        
	Weighed down by inflation, President Pratibha Patils speech to a joint sitting of the House sounded more like a defensive explanation as it admitted the unhappy pressure on the prices of food grains and food products.        
	Even the rhetorical flourish about the welfare of the aam aadmi (common man) and the fight against communal forces  the invariable subtext of any Congress discourse  had given way to a sober road is long but our journey is in progress articulation.        
	The Maoist menace was, however, the first issue the President dealt with in her speech. The very second paragraph of her speech said: Left-wing extremists continue to indulge in senseless violence, as in their recent attacks in West Bengal, where a large number of innocent lives have been lost. These cowardly acts strengthen our resolve to meet with added vigour the challenge posed by such violence.        
	Maoist violence is not new but no government has formally presented it as the countrys principal problem. My government has also given a call to Left-wing extremists to abjure violence and come for talks. Our plan to strengthen civil administration and bring the fruits of inclusive development to all would continue with determination, Patil said.        
	Opposition leaders felt the reference to the Naxalite problem was very timid and didnt reflect home minister P. Chidambarams stand on the rebels. They also claimed Trinamul leader Mamata Banerjees invisible hand in the diluted text. But Congress leaders said muscle flexing in the presidential address would have been in bad taste.        
	Patil said the government was according the highest importance to checking food prices and blamed shortfall in production on drought-like conditions and the global economic slowdown.        
	But her contention that prices were going up also because targeted welfare schemes and higher procurement rates given to farmers had increased the purchasing power of the rural poor raised many eyebrows. Opposition parties dismissed the argument as mere sophistry.        
	Patil defended the governments role in handling the price rise and detailed several steps taken in the past few months to ease the burden on the people. She said a core group of senior ministers and some chief ministers had been formed to examine price-related issues.        
	She patted the government for managing a growth rate of 6.7 per cent at a time major economies were feeling the heat of recession and said the growth rate in 2009-2010 would be 7.5 per cent despite a host of welfare measures and massive social sector spending.        
	The President also said law and order and the communal situation had remained largely under control and listed legal and structural measures to strengthen the security apparatus to fight terrorism.

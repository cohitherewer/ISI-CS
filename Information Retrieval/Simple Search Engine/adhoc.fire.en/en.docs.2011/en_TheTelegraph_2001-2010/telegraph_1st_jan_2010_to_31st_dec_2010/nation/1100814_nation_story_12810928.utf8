          OUR BUREAU                              
	Aug. 13: Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is likely to call on Mamata Banerjee tomorrow at her Kalighat home where she is recuperating from injuries sustained in a car mishap after Mondays Lalgarh rally.        
	I may visit Calcutta tomorrow to see Mamata, the Union finance minister told The Telegraph tonight over phone from New Delhi. Sources close to the Trinamul chief said she had been intimated about the visit.        
	A Mamata aide said in Calcutta that Mukherjee had called her last night to enquire about her health. Didi spoke to Pranabda over the phone for about five minutes.        
	Earlier in the day, there was a flurry in the Congress after news broke that Mukherjee had written a letter to Mamata asking her to formally explain her stand on slain Maoist Azad.        
	Many Congress leaders rushed to deny a letter had been sent. Parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal stubbed out rumours it was he who had written the letter.        
	Trinamul MPs, who wasted no time in finding out the truth from Mukherjee himself, returned with a denial. They dubbed the reports a figment of the imagination, total rubbish, blatant lie.        
	MP Sudip Bandopadhyay went a step further, dropping the hint that Mukherjee was likely to call on Mamata to enquire about her health.        
	At the Lalgarh rally on Monday, Mamata had demanded a probe into Azads death, although the Centre has been maintaining that he was killed in an encounter. Opposition parties have asked how a Union ministers stand could differ with the Centres.        
	Although the Congress denied it had spoken to Mamata on the Azad issue, sources said Bansal had called her up to ask how the Oppositions queries should be handled. On Tuesday, Mukherjee had assured the BJP and the Left in Parliament that he would get back to them after ascertaining facts with Mamata.        
	Sources said Mukherjees visit, possibly his first to her Kalighat home, would send a positive message that the Congress-Trinamul alliance in Bengal was on firm ground and that efforts needed to be made to strengthen it further before next years Bengal elections.        
	The sources, however, added that he was ostensibly calling to enquire about her health but the real reason could be to remind her that she has to make a statement in Parliament before August 18 on her Lalgarh rally speech.

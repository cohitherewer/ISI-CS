The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Harass slur on Presidency teacher

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 14: Twenty-one students of Presidency University have accused a teacher of immoral behaviour and demanded his removal in a letter to their department head.        
	On the basis of the written complaint, made in January, the university authorities conducted an inquiry and submitted the report to the state government a few days ago, it was revealed today.        
	We, the students of third year honours of your department, are feeling very sad to inform you that we, especially the girl students, are feeling uncomfortable to attend classes due to his immoral behaviour, said the letter, signed by all 21 students of the class.         
	Offensive words that he used while speaking about their families were not expected of a teacher, the students said. Various activities of him while interacted (sic) with the girl students are embarrassing, the letter said. We dont want him to teach us further.        
	The teacher denied the charge and said he was being victimised by a section of his colleagues. The allegations against me are totally baseless, he told The Telegraph.         
	This has been done solely out of professional jealousy. This is a conspiracy to remove me from this university. I have a very good reputation as a teacher and an academic, which is why this conspiracy has been hatched.        
	His department head confirmed that the inquiry report has been submitted to the state government, but refused to comment further. A senior official in the higher education department said the government was examining the inquiry report and would announce its decision on the matter soon.        
	If the government decides on examination of the inquiry report that the teacher is guilty of misconduct, as alleged by the students, he is likely to be transferred from the university, a source said.         
	The students are unhappy with the university and the government for the delay in action. In their letter written eight months ago, they had appealed to the head of the department to take necessary steps against the teacher as early as possible.         
	We wonder how the authorities could take such a long time to complete the investigation, a student said.        
	Presidency was in the news last week after a private party was held on the campus. A Group D employee held a rice-eating ceremony in the university.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul answers Mumbai cry
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rahul answers Mumbai cry
          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: As Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray mounted an offensive against the Nehru-Gandhi family and accused it of being anti-Maharashtra, Rahul Gandhi today sent him a quiet rejoinder: he appointed a Maharashtrian as the Indian Youth Congress president.        
	Rajiv Satav, an MLA from Kalamnuri in Marathwada, will replace Haryanas Ashok Tanwar.        
	Congress sources said Rahul had almost made up his mind on Priyavrat Singh, an MLA from Khilchipur in Madhya Pradesh, but the Maharashtrian was finally preferred so the party could send a message to the Sena. Congress leaders also recalled that it was Sonia Gandhi who had handpicked Pratibha Patil, another Maharashtrian, for Rashtrapati Bhavan.        
	Congress sources said Singh was almost certain to make it till yesterday, but Rahul changed his decision apparently because of the frenzy created by the Sena. Satav, a Mali by caste, had also been chosen personally by Rahul as the Maharashtra Youth Congress president two years ago.         
	Rahuls decision comes against the growing chorus in the Congress to take on the Sena. Senas personal attacks on Rahul - particularly the comment that Mumbai didnt belong to the (his) Italian mummy  has left a section of the Congress seething. But the party reacted with restraint, expressing its resolve to fight the barbs politically.         
	At a news conference today, Congress spokesperson Jayanthi Natrajan said the pernicious attempt to polarise the country on regional lines will not be tolerated.         
	However, she faced a barrage of questions about the Congress-NCP government in the state failing to act against the Sena and Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, blamed for attacks on north Indians. Natrajan offered a feeble response: We have supreme confidence in our government and hope it will act at an appropriate time.        
	But she defended Rahuls comments on the Sena. Rahul Gandhi is touring the whole of India and trying to democratise the party system. Those who are unable to generate any positive programme make wild remarks about him.        
	On demands from within the Congress to ban the Sena and its mouthpiece Saamna, Natrajan said: This is a question of law which the government has to study. We call upon the people to reject this philosophy of hatred and divisiveness and ask the authorities to bring the perpetrators to book. The Congress, she said, will not allow anyone to violate the constitutional provision that allows every Indian to work wherever they want.        
	On Senas attack on Shah Rukh Khan over his remarks that Pakistani cricketers should be picked for the Indian Premier League and threat to his forthcoming release My Name Is Khan, Natrajan said: This is part of their (the Senas) ideology of hatred. We condemn it.

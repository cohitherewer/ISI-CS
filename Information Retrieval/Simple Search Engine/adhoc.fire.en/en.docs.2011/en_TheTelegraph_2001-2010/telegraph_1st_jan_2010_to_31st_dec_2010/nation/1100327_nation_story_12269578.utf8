The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | What Maya fought amp; Rahul just escaped: the bee
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      What Maya fought amp; Rahul just escaped: the bee
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul Gandhi                                  
	Lucknow, March 26: They almost stung Mayavati, and seemed determined to have a go at Rahul Gandhi. The buzzing bees have given security guards of VIPs a busy time.         
	For the past two days, civil and police officials in Sultanpur, along with horticulture department staff, have gone into an overdrive to demolish honeycombs in and around the district collectorate area.         
	All to sanitise the place for Rahul, who held a meeting in the district today to review development work.        
	The police, monitored by Special Protection Group, had been trying to drive away the bees and declare the area safe for the meeting. Officials said the SPG had asked for clearing the area before the district vigilance and monitoring committee meeting to be attended by Rahul at the Vikas Bhavan complex.        
	The security agency that is in charge of protecting VIPs did not want to take any chances following the sting attack on chief minister Mayavati last week.        
	Mayavati had ordered an FIR against unknown persons accusing them of hatching a conspiracy by unleashing the bees on her public rally at the Rama Bai Maidan on March 15.         
	Officials in Sultanpur, which falls in Rahuls Amethi Lok Sabha constituency, had lost sleep ever since they spotted three beehives near the Vikas Bhavan complex.         
	Not willing to be part of any bee plot, the Sultanpur police launched a drive against the honeycombs on Wednesday, smoking the insects out and smashing the hives.         
	But the bees swarmed back to the area yesterday.        
	The hives were not properly removed on Wednesday. We sought the help of the horticulture department to clear the area of the bees, Sultanpur superintendent of police Satyaveer Singh said.        
	Though Rahul Gandhis meeting to protect politicians was a closed-door affair, we did not wish to take any chances. Bees are becoming a security threat to politicians after what Mayavati experienced at the BSP rally in Lucknow, a senior district official told reporters.        
	He said that under the supervision of the SPG, which guards Rahul, several beehives were destroyed in the collectorate area in the past couple of days.        
	With the bees gone, district police chief Singh said the security was foolproof for Rahul.        
	This morning, when Rahul completed his meeting peacefully at Sultanpur, he had no idea what the bees might have felt after losing their homes, lamented Ratanlal Sharma, a Congress leader in the district.        
	Wildlife expert R.P. Sharma expressed concern at this drive against the bees. If this drive against beehives continues to protect politicians, the state will be hit by honey shortage and the cottage industry will die, he said.         
	The bees had been a nightmare for Mayavati when she was holding a rally at Rama Bai Maidan, 30km from Lucknow city, on March 15.        
	The currency garland adorning her, Mayavati somehow managed to finish her speech while a huge buzzing cloud from three honeycombs swarmed to her podium and kept on flying menacingly near her face.        
	Next day she ordered a probe into the incident and leaders of her party termed the bee attack a political conspiracy.

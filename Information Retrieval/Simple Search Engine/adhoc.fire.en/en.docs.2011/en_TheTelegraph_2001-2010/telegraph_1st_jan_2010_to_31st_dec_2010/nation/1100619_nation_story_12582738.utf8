          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 18: The BJP today suspended three MLAs for cross-voting in the Jharkhand Rajya Sabha polls but refused to react to the fact that two Janata Dal (United) MLAs had voted in favour of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha candidate, reflecting the unease in the relationship between the two allies.         
	We cannot take action against the JD(U) MLAs, BJP spokesperson Nirmala Seetharaman said.         
	Sources, however, said party president Nitin Gadkari would take up the matter with Dal (United) chief Sharad Yadav. The Jharkhand unit of the BJP has written a letter to Gadkari, informing him about the cross-voting.         
	Yadav said he would decide what action to take against Raja Peter and Sudha Chaudhary after receiving a report from the state unit of the party.         
	A top Dal (United) leader said his partys relations with the BJP in Jharkhand had always been strained. In the last Lok Sabha polls, no BJP leader campaigned for our nominees in Chatra and Daltonganj. The BJP in Jharkhand treats the Dal (United) with arrogance. Our state leaders always complain to us, the leader said, hinting that the cross-voting by the JD(U) MLAs could be a fallout of the rancour.         
	Seetharaman today confirmed that BJP MLAs Banwari Ram (Bihar), Bhimsen Chaudhury (Orissa) and Ram Chandra (Jharkhand) have been suspended. She also asked the Rajasthan unit of the party to probe why the votes of two MLAs from the state had been cancelled.         
	Action will be taken against the Rajasthan MLAs based on the inquiry, Seetharaman said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Echo of Arjun in Digvijay rhetoric 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Echo of Arjun in Digvijay rhetoric 
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, Dec. 12: Digvijay Singhs persistent attacks on the Hindutva brigade appear to carry shades of former mentor Arjun Singh, who too banked on rhetoric to try and cement his place in the Congress as a champion of the minorities.        
	In Madhya Pradesh, the home state of both, a faction-ridden Congress is virtually unanimous that Arjuns imprints are clearly visible in fellow Thakur Digvijays style. Both men have shown the knack for picking up sensitive issues and squeezing them for political gain, and for one-upmanship over party colleagues.        
	For instance, Digvijays latest pronouncements about 26/11 martyr Hemant Karkare having been a Sangh parivar target appear as much aimed at cornering home minister P. Chidambaram as boosting his own pro-minority image.        
	But the big question, according to state Congress functionaries, relates to the perceived gap between the words and actions of Arjun and Digvijay.        
	Arjun, now ailing and irrelevant, had targeted former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao over his poor handling of the Babri Masjid crisis and painted himself as a friend of the minorities. But after the mosque was demolished, he stayed on as a minister in Raos cabinet.        
	A decade before that, in his early days as Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Arjun had set up the Mahajan Commission in 1981 promising a better deal for the backward classes. But when a court stay froze the commissions recommendations, Arjun never tried hard enough to get it vacated, sources said.        
	Later in the 1990s, Arjuns attempts to acquire the halo of a rebel boomeranged. After floating a breakaway party, he returned to the Congress in 1997.        
	Digvijay, during his two terms as Madhya Pradesh chief minister, too had a dubious record in implementing schemes that were supposed to be close to his heart.        
	His Dalit agenda failed to take off and Madhya Pradesh continued to witness the highest rate of crimes and atrocities against Dalits and tribals.        
	Infrastructure remained pathetic, allowing Uma Bharti to lead the BJP to victory in 2003 on the back of a bijli-sadak-pani (electricity-road-water) plank.         
	Digvijay now seems to have chosen Chidambaram as his main target, questioning his handling of the Maoist threat, the Batla House encounter and the various aspects of 26/11.        
	Some party leaders privately describe the tussle as one between Quick Gun Murugan (Chidambaram) and Albela (Digvijay).        
	Quick Gun Murugan is a recent movie whose trigger-happy hero is capable of taking on all adversaries, while Albela, a fifties Hindi film, caricatures a carefree man. In Digvijays context, though, it has the implications of a loose cannon, many state Congress leaders feel.        
	They cite the perception that Digvijays statements on Karkare are part of a strategy to woo the minorities in Uttar Pradesh, a state he is in charge of, ahead of the 2012 Assembly polls.        
	If such a plan exists, these leaders believe that it is fraught with dangers. As the reaction to the recent Ayodhya verdict has shown, the Muslim community has moved on from the old days when such rhetoric could have had a sizeable audience.

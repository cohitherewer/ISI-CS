The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lab study plan for science postgrads

	New Delhi, July 30: The Union science and technology ministry today introduced in the Lok Sabha a bill to create an academy that will seek to usher in a new model for post-graduate education  by drawing students into government laboratories.         
	The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research will open its 37 laboratories for students to pursue masters and doctorate programmes in the sciences and engineering under the bill to establish the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research.         
	The CSIR expects to take in about 1,000 science PhD students, 125 engineering PhDs, 1,000 masters through a combination of research and lessons, and 100 MTech students each year, said Samir Brahmachari, the director-general of the CSIR.         
	The concept of a CSIR-based education academy has been controversial with some academicians questioning the governments decision to create a brand new education system while university science education has deteriorated over the years.         
	The idea is to provide education that is not available through universities, Brahmachari told The Telegraph.         
	These students while studying will also get to work on real-world research problems, he said. For instance, students who join the CSIRs Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Pilani, might get to work on space and satellite projects.         
	Entry for the programme will be through the conventional NET-UGC test that screens candidates for entry into doctorate programmes. Masters students will be charged fees, but PhD students will be paid scholarships.         
	The Centre had approved the creation of the academy as well as an interim academy before enactment of the legislation so that the first set of students could enter the laboratories from September 2010.

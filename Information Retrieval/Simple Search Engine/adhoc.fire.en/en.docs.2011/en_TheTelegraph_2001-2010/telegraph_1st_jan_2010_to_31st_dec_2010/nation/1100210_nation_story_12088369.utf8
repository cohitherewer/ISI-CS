The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amars new calling: minority messiah
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Amars new calling: minority messiah
          CITHARA PAUL                          Amar Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Accused by his former party of alienating Muslims, Amar Singh is trying to reinvent himself  as a crusader for the community.        
	The expelled Samajwadi Party leader will be the chief speaker at a symposium organised by major national Muslim groups, which say Amar will be part of their future plans despite his earlier association with Kalyan Singh.        
	The past is past, said Taslim Rehmani, of the Muslim Political Council, when pointed out that Amar had brought the former BJP leader into the Samajwadi Party. What is important is what he plans to do in the future.        
	Amars former colleagues had, however, not forgiven him for bringing in Kalyan, a key accused in the Babri mosque demolition. He has alienated the Muslim community by that single act of political convenience, senior Samajwadi leader Azam Khan had said.        
	The February 12 symposium  on Prevailing political conditions in the country and Muslims  will be attended by groups like the Jamaat Islami-e-Hind, All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Muslim Students Action Committee and the Muslim Political Council.        
	Explaining Amars presence, the organisers said the Rajya Sabha MP was quite serious about Muslim causes these days.        
	Amar Singh is willing to work for the betterment of the community. He has even said there should be a Muslim Prime Minister in the country in order to apologise to Muslims for the Babri demolition, Rehmani said. No major politician has dared to say that so far.        
	Asked if Amars concern for Muslims was part of his strategy to stay afloat, a community leader said the former Samajwadi general secretary would not be allowed to use us.         
	The organisers of the symposium said it would be the first of several they were planning. We are planning similar meetings across the country and Amar Singhji will be part of our future plans, Rehmani said.

	Calcutta, July 19: The CPM today shed blood, sweat and tears to gun for Mamata Banerjee over the train crash, spying a chance to whip a seemingly unassailable enemy, reactivate a demoralised rank and file and crank up a famed machine in an attempt to reconnect with the masses.        
	If no less than six Left Front ministers were despatched to the accident site, the politburo and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee raised pertinent questions about the railways under Mamata Banerjee.        
	Of late, railway accidents have increased. So, the issues of railway maintenance work and passenger safety should be seriously looked into, Bhattacharjee said in a statement offering condolences to the bereaved families.        
	Like the chief minister, the politburo also responded in a measured tone but member Sitaram Yechury put the ball in the Prime Ministers court.        
	The number of rail accidents has been unprecedented in the last one year. Maintenance of equipment and safety measures are being neglected in the railways. One lakh jobs in safety-related jobs remain vacant. The government cannot keep quiet about the present state of affairs in the railways, a politburo statement said without taking Mamatas name.         
	Yechury was more vocal. The ministers attention is elsewhere. The Prime Minister has to take a call.        
	But the most striking response was the parade of Left Front ministers to the accident site.        
	The CPM leadership despatched finance minister Asim Dasgupta, transport minister Ranjit Kundu and labour minister Anadi Sahoo to Sainthia in the morning itself. Library minister and Suri MLA Tapan Roy, who was in Birbhum, reached the spot on the partys instructions. Relief minister Mortaza Hossain and civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee joined them.        
	On the day the Jnaneswari Express was sabotaged, five minister had gone to the spot and the chief minister had later visited hospitals where the injured were being treated. Over 150 people had died then, that too because of sabotage blamed on extremists. But the CPM could not make it an issue as the May 28 tragedy took place on the very day campaigning for the May 30 civic elections, in which the party fared miserably, came to an end.                
	This morning, instructions were sent from Alimuddin Street to the Burdwan and Birbhum CPM units to arrange for sufficient blood and to stand by the scared people.         
	Accordingly, 120 blood bottles were dispatched from Burdwan to district hospitals in Birbhum. Four blood donation camps at Suri, Rampurhat, Dubrajpur and Sainthia were also organised at short notice.        
	Perhaps to stave off possible charges that the CPM was fishing in a tragedy, the senior leadership did not demand Mamatas resignation. Party MLA, Rabin Mondal, sought her immediate resignation.        
	But pot shots did fly. It appears that our railways ministers focus is on inauguration of trains and laying foundation stones. It seems she is only interested in getting pictures of such programmes printed in the newspapers, state CPM chief Biman Bose said.        
	Citu president Shyamal Chakraborty was more cutting. She is shameless. So many intellectuals have been appointed by her on railway committees and lakhs are being spent on them. But what about passenger safety? Chakraborty asked.

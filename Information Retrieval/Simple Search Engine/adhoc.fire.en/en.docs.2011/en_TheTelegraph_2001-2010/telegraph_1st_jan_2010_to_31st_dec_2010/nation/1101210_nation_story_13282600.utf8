                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Assam varsity honour for Sourav
          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                          Sourav Ganguly                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: Sourav Ganguly will receive an honorary degree from the Assam University, Silchar, for his contribution to Indian cricket.        
	The former captain is among four persons who will be awarded the Degree of Honoris Causa by the central university at a special convocation on February 1, after the President clears the names.        
	The others are Homen Bargohain for his contribution to regional literature and journalism, Irfan Habib for humanities and social sciences and K.G. Subramaniyam for creative arts.         
	In line with the Assam (Central) University Act, 1989, the institution has sent the names to the HRD ministry seeking clearance from the President, who is Visitor of the university.         
	We have received a letter from the university vice-chancellor Prof Tapodhir Bhattacharya for conferment of the honorary degrees on four eminent personalities, including Ganguly. The university has sent the curriculum vitae and profile of these personalities. We will send the list to the Presidents office for clearance, a top ministry official said.         
	The names were approved by the institutions academic council and executive council. The university has informed the eminent persons about the decision to confer the degrees. Today we got an email from Mr Ganguly on his acceptance of the degree. He has conveyed his special thanks, vice-chancellor Bhattacharya said.        
	Asked about the universitys gesture, Ganguly told The Telegraph this evening: I am happy and honoured.         
	For the 38-year-old, who has just been dropped by Kolkata Knight Riders, this will be the second honorary degree after the honorary fellowship he was awarded by the University of Central Lancashire last year.         
	Cricketers Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev have received similar degrees from Andhra University and MGR University in Tamil Nadu in the past.        
	Ganguly is a wonderful player and is one of the best cricket captains the country has produced. He deserves the honorary degree, Bhattacharya said.         
	Prof Madhava Menon, the founder director of National Law School of India University, Bangalore, has consented to be the chief guest, he added.        
	Assam University came into existence through Assam (Central) University Act, 1989, and was established in 1994.

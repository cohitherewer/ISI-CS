	 London, March 26 (PTI): Over 20,000 people in Britains West Midlands have signed a petition, delivered to Union minister for civil aviation Praful Patel, urging him to resume direct Air India services from Birmingham to Amristar.           
	The petition is part of a local Fly India campaign launched by the Birmingham city council, the local airport and Indians living there.

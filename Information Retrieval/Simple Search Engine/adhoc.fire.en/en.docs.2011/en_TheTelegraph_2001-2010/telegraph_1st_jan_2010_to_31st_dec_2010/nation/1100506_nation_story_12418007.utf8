                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Plea to stay entry to 44 varsities 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, May 5: The Centre will tomorrow ask the Supreme Court to stay admissions to 44 deemed universities the government wants to act against after a review found them unfit for the tag and undeserving of time to improve.         
	The apex court is hearing a case on deemed universities and had earlier ordered the government to abstain from taking action against these institutions till it delivers its verdict.         
	Solicitor General Gopal Subramaniam will tomorrow request the Supreme Court to either expedite the case or order a stay on fresh admissions to those deemed universities under the scanner, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The move comes amid concerns within the human resource development ministry that while its hands are tied because of the earlier Supreme Court order, dubious deemed universities continue to lure students.         
	Several of the deemed universities among the 44 of them have been aggressively advertising and conducting admission procedures this academic season, despite the possibility of losing their tag soon.         
	The HRD ministry is concerned that allowing these deemed universities to admit fresh students would be akin to consciously hurtling these students towards an uncertain future.         
	Over two lakh students currently studying at these 44 deemed universities are facing an uncertain future.         
	The government will argue tomorrow that the stay on any action  currently applicable on the Centre  should also bar deemed universities under the scanner from conducting fresh admissions during the course of the case.         
	HRD minister Kapil Sibal had set up a panel of independent experts to review Indias 130 deemed universities. The review panel found 88 institutions unfit for the tag, but divided these into two categories. The panel found 44 of these institutions potentially capable of meriting the tag and suggested they be given a time period of three years to improve standards.         
	The remaining 44 institutions were found incapable of attaining standards required of deemed university status by the panel, which recommended that this status be withdrawn from these institutions.

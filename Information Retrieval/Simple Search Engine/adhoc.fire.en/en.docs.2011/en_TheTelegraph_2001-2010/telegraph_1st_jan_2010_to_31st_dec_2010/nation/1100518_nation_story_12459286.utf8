          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 17: In an effort to strengthen a mechanism to check smuggling of minerals, the state government has prepared a detailed plan to be executed by the Centre.        
	To give it a final shape, senior officials led by chief secretary T.K. Mishra will meet Union cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar in New Delhi on May 20 and apprise him of the needs to implement strict regulations to curb smuggling of minerals through railways and ports.        
	A preparatory meeting chaired by Mishra was held at the secretariat today.        
	After the multi-crore mining scam came to the fore, the state government instituted a vigilance inquiry to arrest the culprits and constituted a high-level committee to suggest measures to check the rampant smuggling.         
	As per the plan, the state government has decided to introduce transit passes from June 1. Only through transit pass, transporters can be recognised properly and minerals where it is going to be sent can be easily recognised, said steel and mines secretary Manoj Ahuja.         
	The commerce and transport department will print the passes, which will have holograms to make it tamper proof. For each consignment, three passes will be issued and it will carry signature of the deputy director of mines. While the railways will keep one pass, the other two passes will be kept by the mines owner and the deputy director of mines.        
	The transit passes also can be scrutinised at various checkpoints and ports.                     
	Based on the transit passes, the port officials can levy custom duties. But all these need co-operation from the Centre, as the railway ministry and port authorities are involved in the entire process. Unless the Centre intervenes, it will be difficult to monitor smuggling of minerals, said a senior government official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dad invoked God to scare daughter 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Dad invoked God to scare daughter 
          VISHVENDU JAIPURIAR                                                Priyabhanshu and Nirupama     
	Koderma, May 4: Nirupama Pathak had put off her marriage to her former classmate after receiving a letter from her father on its eve.        
	Do din ki chandni, phir andheri raat (You might be happy for a while, but it will be short-lived), Dharmendra Pathak had written to his 23-year-old daughter, in love with a man from a lower caste.         
	The letter reached Delhi on March 5 and, a friend said, Nirupama was supposed to get married to Priyabhanshu Ranjan at the Arya Samaj Mandir the day after. But she changed her mind after receiving the letter. She wanted to go home and convince her parents to accept her relationship, the friend said.         
	In the letter dated March 2, and posted from Jhumri Tilaiya post office in Jharkhands Koderma, Dharmendra tried to convince Nirupama why a Brahmins relationship with a Kayasth could never work. I had named you Nirupama, a person who is incomparable. But the step you have taken, or are going to take, is against our religion. When people stick to religion, it saves them from all troubles, but when they go against it, the same religion destroys them, he wrote.        
	Our Constitution, only 60 years old, allows an adult to marry the person of his/her choice, but our religion, sanatan dharma, which is there from time immemorial, says when a girl from a higher caste marries a man of lower caste, the results are devastating.        
	Bank manager Dharmendra had also cautioned his daughter against getting overpowered by emotions and confusing reality with films.         
	The Delhi journalists efforts to convince her family about Priyabhanshu had failed but she rushed home for one last gamble after an SOS about her mothers fractured back. She was supposed to return to Delhi on April 28, but did not. On April 29, Nirupama was found dead.        
	Her mother Subhra, who had initially claimed that she had been electrocuted while cleaning a fan, has been arrested. Police have questioned her brothers and Priyabhanshu is also likely to be quizzed.        
	Priyabhanshu, who works for a news agency, said he was not aware of Nirupama being pregnant. Im sure she herself didnt know it, or else she would have told me, said Priyabhanshu, who was Nirupamas classmate at Indian Institute of Mass Communication in Delhi.

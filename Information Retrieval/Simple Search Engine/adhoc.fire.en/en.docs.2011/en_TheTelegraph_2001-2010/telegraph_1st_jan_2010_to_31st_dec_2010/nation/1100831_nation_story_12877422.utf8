The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Property bill on House shelf
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Property bill on House shelf
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 30: The Centre was today forced to shelve a bill relating to the properties left behind by Partition-era emigrants, despite having extended the Parliament session by two days primarily to get it passed.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram was left with egg on his face as the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal decided to break the secular consensus at the last minute. The ordinance on the subject will now lapse and the bill will have to be junked.        
	Chidambaram told the Lok Sabha he would bring in a new bill next session, including all the suggested amendments. He said the bill had been tailored to weave in certain lobbies concerns but it could not be taken up because some parties wanted more time to study it.        
	Its rare for a bill not to be taken up despite being mentioned on the list of business for over 10 days.        
	The bill looks to amend the Enemy Property Act of 1968 to try and balance the interests of the emigrants Indian heirs against those of the current tenants or occupiers.        
	The home ministry had brought an ordinance in July to block the heirs from going to court to claim the properties.        
	But when the bill was drafted to turn the ordinance into law, opposition from several Muslim MPs and ministers had led to modifications. The bill now says that if the Indian heirs can establish their status in court, they can claim the properties subject to certain riders.        
	The BJP, which supports the ordinance, opposed the amended bill but the Left and the secular parties were expected to see it through today.        
	There was broad agreement on the passage of the bill but Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad got adamant today, insisting this be taken up in the next session, a government source said.        
	They knew the modifications had changed the nature of the original bill but they suddenly decided to play politics. They were keen to tell Muslims they had blocked the bill.        
	Earlier, when Mulayam had accused the Congress of joining hands with the BJP to hurt Muslims interests, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had called him and Lalu Prasad to explain that the modified bill addressed all their concerns.        
	The government had built the secular consensus on the bill after crossing many hurdles, beginning with strong opposition from minority affairs minister Salman Khursheed who felt the bill was anti-Muslim.        
	Farooq Abdullah, Ghulam Nabi Azad, K. Rehman Khan, Mohsina Kidwai, E. Ahmed, Sultan Ahmed and others had met the Prime Minister to complain against the home ministry over the bill.        
	M.A.M. Khan, the Raja of Mahmudabad whose huge assets fate hinges on the bill, had said the home ministry had set a dangerous and undemocratic precedent through the ordinance and the bill.        
	He had also accused Chidambaram of a conflict of interest since the lawyer-politician had represented the Rajas rival claimants in court. However, Khursheed too had participated in the case  as Khans lawyer.

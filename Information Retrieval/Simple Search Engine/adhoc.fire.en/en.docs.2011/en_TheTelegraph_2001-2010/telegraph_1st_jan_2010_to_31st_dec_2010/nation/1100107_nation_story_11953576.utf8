	Hyderabad, Jan. 6: The US government advisory against travel to Hyderabad appears to have had little impact on a group of American students from Kansas State University.        
	Nineteen students of the university arrived in Hyderabad on Monday and made a dash to the epicentre of the Telangana agitation, the Osmania University campus. There they spent a night, interacted with students on the arts lawns yesterday, and expressed solidarity. They left last evening.        
	I feel safer at the university as it has more security, one of the American students said.        
	The group is on a four-day tour of Andhra Pradesh as part of an international students exchange programme, and has been visiting select state universities. They are being led by faculty member Barry Michie.        
	They went around Hyderabad and also the (Osmania) campus and met students, said T. Vijay Kumar, joint director of Osmanias centre for international programmes.        
	The campus lawns, however, were rather quiet and thinly populated since the students have taken a few days off with talks now being held in Delhi. The Osmania students thanked the visitors for their interest in their agitation.        
	We explained how the Telangana region had remained backward for the past five decades because of political indifference, and expressed our resolve to grow independently and separately, said Ajay, a member of the Joint Action Committee.        
	There has been a steep fall in student tourists to Hyderabad this Christmas-New Year season. Almost all educational institutions in southern India used to arrange excursions to Hyderabads research institutes during this period, but the agitation has deterred most this season, said tourism official Venugopal Reddy.        
	Work continues to be sluggish at the state secretariat. It was more so yesterday when the Centre held an all-party meeting in Delhi on the Telangana controversy.        
	With most ministers in Delhi and chief minister K. Rosaiah on a tour of the districts, a holiday atmosphere prevailed at the secretariat. Many IAS and IPS officials were glued to the TV sets in their chambers, watching the developments in Delhi and the districts. Other staff debated the talks possible outcome in the corridors or canteen.        
	Only a handful of the 34 ministers were at their offices. Almost one in three IAS officers who were on Christmas vacation were yet to return to work.        
	About half the government employees, when questioned, appeared to be looking forward to an escalation of the agitation so they could take leave for the Sankranti festival next week.        
	Senior officials expressed concern at the falling revenues. In 1969, the agitation had paralysed the government for over eight months, and it took another four months to get things back on rail. Now we may need several months more because of the increased number of personnel and programmes, said a retired former chief secretary.

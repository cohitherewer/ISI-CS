The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nudge to end student account bias
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nudge to end student account bias
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 26: Firoze Ahmed nearly quit his BPharm course because he couldnt afford the fees  although he is entitled to full reimbursement under a government scholarship.        
	His problem is, he needs to open a bank account to receive the scholarship but hasnt been able to do so despite trying for the past two years. The Bangalore-based student says banks discriminate against him because of his religion.        
	Its a charge echoed by over one lakh Muslim students across the country who say they cannot open bank accounts to draw their scholarships.        
	Theres hope on the horizon, though, with the Reserve Bank of India recently stepping in to help out minority students with a nudge to the banks.        
	Ive been trying to open a bank account for the past two years but every time it is rejected for some flimsy reason or the other, Firoze said.        
	My father had taken a loan from relatives to pay my first-year fees. I almost decided to quit my studies because I didnt want to trouble him again for money.        
	Minority students say banks place hurdles in their path especially when they seek to open an account on nil-balance.         
	Since most of the students who apply for the scholarships are from very poor backgrounds, it is impossible for them to meet these (balance) requirements, Firoze said.        
	But sometimes, a Muslim student just has to mention his or her name and the bank turns extra cautious, said Basheer Pathan, a postgraduate media studies student in Delhis Jamia Millia Islamia.        
	Once they see our names, they will go to any length to create hurdles. Only those with strong determination are able to stick on. Many decide to leave midway, Basheer said.        
	However, early this month, the Reserve Bank issued a circular to all scheduled commercial banks asking them to make available a basic banking no-frills account either with nil or very low minimum balance as well as charges that would make such accounts accessible to vast sections of the population.        
	It added: Ensure opening of no-frills account or other accounts for students from minority community or other disadvantaged groups, when they approach bank, for availing various scholarships or other benefits offered by the government. The nature and number of transactions in such accounts could be restricted, but made known to the customer in advance in a transparent manner. All banks are advised to give wide publicity to the facility of such a no-frills account, including on their websites, indicating the facilities and charges in a transparent manner.        
	The minority ministry had approached the Reserve Bank after receiving more than one lakh complaints from Muslim students, particularly from Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, an official said.        
	First, we wrote to all state governments to take steps to help the students cross these hurdles, but nothing came out of it as no state took any notice, the official said. Our secretary, Vivek Mehrotra, then approached the Reserve Bank.        
	A minority student can apply for one of these scholarships if his annual income, or that of his parents or guardians, does not exceed Rs 2.5 lakh, and he has the requisite marks to be admitted to the desired course.        
	But, along with the application form, he needs to give his bank account details so that the scholarship cheques can be deposited there.

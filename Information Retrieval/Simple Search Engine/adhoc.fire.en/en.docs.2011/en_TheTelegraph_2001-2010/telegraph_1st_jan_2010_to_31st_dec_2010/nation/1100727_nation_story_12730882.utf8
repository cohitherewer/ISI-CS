The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Singh starts on front foot

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	New Delhi, July 26: The government has decided to be firm with the Opposition in Parliament, with the Prime Minister leading the charge before the monsoon session opened this morning.        
	Congress sources said the Centre would not bow before any threat of disruption, even on price rise, emboldened by a conviction that Opposition unity was under strain because of the BJP spotlight on the CBI case against Amit Shah.        
	Manmohan Singh chose to be upfront on the issue, reflecting the governments belief that the BJP was on weak ground on Shah and could expect support only from the Shiv Sena.        
	I refute this allegation that the CBI is (the) Congress Bureau of Investigation. The Centre was not misusing the CBI in former Gujarat home minister Amit Shahs case, Singh said.        
	He said the Opposition knew well enough that the CBI was probing the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter under Supreme Court orders.        
	The government has not tried to influence the investigation process in any way. I repeat categorically, in any way, Singh said.        
	We sincerely hope that this session of Parliament will be peaceful and productive, that Parliament will have the opportunity to debate many important issues. (The) government is ready for every piece of discussion that the Opposition may want.        
	Sources said that to start with, the government would show its tough side by rejecting the demand for an adjournment motion on price rise in the Lok Sabha tomorrow, even if it meant a prolonged disruption of Parliament.        
	We expect them (the Opposition) not to allow either House to run for a couple of days. Even if they continue for longer, there is no question of accepting the demand for an adjournment motion. We can discuss the issue under any other rule, a senior Congress leader said.        
	An adjournment motion entails voting after discussions, and the government does not want the strain of another test of strength after Opposition cut motions forced one during the previous session.        
	Congress leaders believe that the BJP will have to drop the Shah issue sometime soon for the sake of Opposition unity. They are convinced the BJP made a strategic blunder by taking up Shahs cause with so much passion and by linking it with the Prime Ministers lunch invite.        
	Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi today used words like churlish and pettiness to taunt the BJP on the issue instead of appealing to the party to co-operate in Parliament.        
	He said the BJP, if it wanted, should take to legal recourse rather than hold news conferences.        
	Rejecting the demand for an adjournment motion, Singhvi said the government was not obliged to discuss price rise under modalities decided by the Opposition.        
	Price rise is an important issue but there is no point sensationalising (it) or using it to gain political mileage. We can debate it but voting is not necessary, he said.        
	Demands for adjournment motions are accepted on subjects that require urgent attention but the price rise is not a new issue and has been debated several times in the past two years, senior ministers said.

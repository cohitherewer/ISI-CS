The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lost in war, grave traced in cyberspace
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lost in war, grave traced in cyberspace
          E.M. JOSE                           The website through which the grave was found                                  
	Shillong, April 8: A long search spread over two countries and spanning 66 years has finally ended in cyberspace.         
	Family members of sepoy Belford Warbah prayed for the peace of his departed soul on Tuesday night, exactly 66 years to the date he died in Yangon (then Rangoon) in Myanmar (then Burma) on April 6, 1944. Presumed to be missing since World War II, the family managed to trace information about his fate on a website very recently.         
	We finally received information from the war memorial authorities at Yangon where he was cremated by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Warbahs grand niece, June, said here yesterday.         
	Belford was attached to the 1st Battalion of Assam Regiment, which was fighting for the British Army against the Japanese during World War II. He was just 26 when he died, fighting in what is still considered to be one of the bloodiest fronts in the war.         
	As many as 50 members of the sepoys family gathered at the residence of his niece, Bettymon, to observe his 66th death anniversary and pray for his soul.         
	The search had started a few months ago when June and her cousin Jonathan tried to trace information about Belford on the Internet, scrolling through websites dedicated to World War II. They found very little.         
	But we did not stop our pursuit to find out what happened to our granduncle. We even made a trip to the Kohima War Cemetery to find out more about him, June told The Telegraph.         
	They did find his name in the Kohima War Cemetery records but the year and month of his death were not mentioned. He was not buried there either.         
	A month ago, Junes nephew, Jeremiah, who is pursuing medical studies in China, chanced upon a website related to Yangon and finally got the information the family was looking for.         
	We had no clue about what happened to him. For us he was missing, as he could have been taken a prisoner of war, June said.         
	The 66-year-long wait has finally ended for the Khasi family.         
	The family members organised the commemorative prayer meeting at the residence of Bettymon, who is the oldest relative of Belford.         
	Since Bettymon, 76, is the oldest niece of Belford, we agreed that the family members should gather at her residence to pray for the departed soul, June said.         
	Among the relatives, only Bettymon has faint memories of the strapping young man whom she described as very fair and very English-looking, brave and strong.                    
	Bettymon and two of Belfords surviving nieces expressed happiness that they finally knew his fate  that he sacrificed his life during the war  and, secondly, because they could pray for the departed soul in a large family gathering.         
	The family members also met officials of the Assam Regiment at Happy Valley here on Tuesday to share their information about the war hero.         
	We met the adjutant of Assam Regimental Centre, Maj. B. Chakraborty, and he was pleased to inform us that some sort of recognition would be accorded to the soldier.         
	The family members are now planning to visit Yangon where a memorial stands in the name of Belford.

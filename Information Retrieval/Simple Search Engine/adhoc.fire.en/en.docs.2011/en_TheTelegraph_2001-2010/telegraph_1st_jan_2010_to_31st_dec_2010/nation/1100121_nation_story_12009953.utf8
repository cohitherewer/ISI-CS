The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US warning and deadlock
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US warning and deadlock
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 20: US defence secretary Robert Gates has warned that a syndicate of terrorist groups pose a threat to the region and can sabotage India-Pakistan ties, even though New Delhi had acted with restraint after the Mumbai attacks.        
	Gates named al Qaida, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and the Lashkar-e-Toiba as members of the syndicate.        
	Gates was speaking after a meeting with defence minister A.K. Antony this morning and talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and foreign affairs minister S.M. Krishna on Tuesday.        
	He said that it was not reasonable to think that India would continue to be patient if terror attacks were renewed. India has responded with great restraint and statesmanship after the Mumbai terror attacks. But the ability to continue with it after another attack is under question. It is not reasonable to assume that Indian patience is unlimited in case of another attack, the US defence secretary told a media conference.        
	But Gatess two-day visit to India, the first such high-level contact after Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to the US two months ago, has failed to push ahead pending agreements that would facilitate greater American military sales to India.        
	An Indian defence ministry statement said: Referring to the US governments proposal to conclude certain umbrella agreements like Cismoa (Communications Interoperability and Security Memorandum of Agreement), etc. Shri Antony expressed the view that the proposed agreements would need to be assessed from the view-point of the benefits which would accrue to India.        
	Cismoa, which the US believes will facilitate transfers of high-technology equipment, and the Logistics Support Agreement (LSA), which involves replenishing aircraft, ships and troops of either country on a reciprocal basis, have been pending for more than four years.        
	Gates said the subject of concluding these agreements had also figured in his discussions with the Prime Minister. I think we have not done an adequate job in the American side in convincing India of the benefits (of signing the agreements), he said, though the US had such pacts with dozens of countries.        
	The defence ministry said that Antony conveyed to Gates Indian concerns on the denial of export licences for defence-related requirement.

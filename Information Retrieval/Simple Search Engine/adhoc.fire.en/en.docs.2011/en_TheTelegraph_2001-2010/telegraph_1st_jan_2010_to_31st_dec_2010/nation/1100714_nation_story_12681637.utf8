	New Delhi, July 13 (PTI): The National Consumer Commission has said it is unfair for an educational institute to withhold the entire fee deposited by students even after they have left and joined elsewhere.        
	The order came on a petition by Andhra University which had challenged the state commissions directive to refund the entire fee of a student who had taken admission in another institute. The state panel also ordered a compensation of Rs 1,000 to the student.        
	The national commission directed the university to retain only Rs 1,000 of the fee deposited by the student and refund the balance with 6 per cent annual interest.        
	The commission said under UGC guidelines, it was unfair to retain the entire fee deposited by students even after they had taken admission elsewhere.        
	The guidelines, the commission said, made it clear that the money deposited by a student had to be refunded after deducting the processing fee.

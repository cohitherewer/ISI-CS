          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept 27: The Durga Puja at Shivaji Park, which was gearing up for a grand platinum jubilee celebration, has run into a hurdle after municipal authorities refused permission to hold it in the cricket ground that is now a silence zone.        
	Bengal Club, a sporting club that organises the puja, has approached Bombay High Court which in May declared Shivaji Park a silence zone and banned the use of loudspeakers and public address systems between 10pm and 6am.        
	The petition was to come up for hearing today but has now been deferred till Wednesday. We are hopeful that the high court will grant us permission, said Utpal D. Mukhopadhyay, president of the club.         
	The municipal authorities had cited the court ruling while refusing permission. The high court had said only Maharashtra Day, Republic Day and Ambedkars death anniversary would be excluded from its directive.         
	In our application to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, we had voluntarily stated that we will not create noise pollution, and even offered to shift our entertainment programmes to a hall nearby in view of the high court judgment. However, we were told two weeks ago that permission cannot be granted, said Mukhopadhyay, a retired IAS officer who served as environment secretary and additional chief secretary in the Maharashtra government.        
	Our Durga Puja is considered iconic, and during the five puja days, 10 to 12 lakh people visit us. On Ashtami, we hold something similar to a langar organised by the Sikh community and offer prasad to devotees. We had decided to bring artistes from Calcutta to host entertainment programmes, but have put it on hold till the court decision, he added.         
	Bengal Club is an 88-year-old club set up by the Bengali community in one corner of Shivaji Park.         
	Sound levels in silence zones cannot be higher than 40 decibels at night and 50 decibels during the day. The silence zones were based on a World Health Organisation report in 1995. A new WHO report has revised these levels to even lower decibels, said anti-noise pollution activist Sumaira Abdulali.        
	The Shiv Sena, which holds a Dussehra rally at Shivaji Park, is also planning to approach the high court.

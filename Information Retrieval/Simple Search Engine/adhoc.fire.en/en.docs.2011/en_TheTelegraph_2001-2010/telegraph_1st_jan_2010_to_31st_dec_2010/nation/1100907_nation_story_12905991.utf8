	Sept. 6: Homi Nusserwanji Sethna, former Atomic Energy Commission chairman and the guiding force behind Indias first nuclear test, died at his home in Mumbai last night, aged 86.        
	Sethna had plunged into Indias nuclear programme as a chemical engineer tasked with extracting nuclear materials from Keralas sands, but eventually steered it through its most difficult years after Indias first nuclear test in 1974.        
	He was chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) from 1972 to 1983  his tenure the second longest after Homi Bhabhas  when western countries snapped nuclear ties with India and denied equipment and materials to its nuclear effort.        
	The technology denials began disrupting construction schedules for nuclear power stations in Rajasthan and Chennai, and caused operational problems for the US-made reactors in Tarapur.        
	While he was under pressure to explain the delays and difficulties the programme faced, he, by and large, shielded others from criticism, another former AEC chairman, M.R. Srinivasan, said.        
	Sethna was also among a small but influential group of former nuclear scientists who had objected to certain aspects of the India-US civil nuclear agreement in 2006 and forced the Centre to toughen its negotiations. Sethna built Indias first plutonium plant, which yielded material that went into the 1974 explosion.

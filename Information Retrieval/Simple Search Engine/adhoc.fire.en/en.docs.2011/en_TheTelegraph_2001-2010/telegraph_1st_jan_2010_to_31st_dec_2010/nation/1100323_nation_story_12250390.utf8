	Guwahati, March 22: A Bengali tea garden owner in Assam was arrested today after he shot a boy dead while trying to disperse villagers gathered near his bungalow to protest his alleged attempt to molest a woman.         
	The shooting sparked a violent protest from the villagers who burnt parts of the tea garden. Police battled for eight hours to disperse them.        
	The police seized a Winchester rifle and a revolver from Mridul Bhattacharjee, who owns Rani tea estate, 25km from Guwahati, but struggled to bring him out from the bungalow as villagers went on the rampage demanding that he be handed over to them.         
	Trouble began after Bhattacharjee allegedly beat up and molested an NREGA worker, Jogomaya Boro, who was passing through the garden, for trespassing, around 8.30 this morning.         
	Jogomaya was late for work and decided to take a short cut through the garden to her work site, about a kilometre from her house.         
	She was accosted by the proprietor and was beaten up for entering the garden. He also tore her clothes, said Dhireswar Boro, a secretary of a local organisation.         
	Jogomaya reported the matter to the villagers who went to Bhattacharjees bungalow around 9.30am to protest.        
	He (Bhattacharjee) shot at us from inside the house, killing Pradip Murari, a Class VIII student, and injuring four others, Boro said.        
	The police arrived soon after and confined Bhattacharjee to the bungalow along with his wife and a servant as the crowd set fire to his tea factory. They also burnt several vehicles, tea bushes and even set ablaze the animal farm owned by the garden. Several pigs and goats were charred.        
	The crowd did not allow the fire tenders to enter the factory and squatted at the entrance with the boys body.         
	By afternoon, the picturesque Rani tea estate resembled a battle zone with fire and smoke everywhere.         
	All efforts of senior police and district administration officials of Kamrup (rural) and written assurance from the local MLA, Ramendra Narayan Kalita, and deputy commissioner S.K. Roy, to take stringent action against Bhattacharjee, failed to pacify the crowd.         
	The vandalism continued as the largely outnumbered security forces watched helplessly.         
	Around 3.30pm, the police brought Bhattacharjee out of the bungalow, his hands tied with a rope, to prove that he had been arrested but the protests continued.         
	The IGP (central western range), Pallab Bhatacharyya, arrived around 4pm and ordered the final assault of teargas.         
	The police evacuated Bhattacharjee around 4.30pm after teargas shells dispersed the mob. The proprietor was then whisked away in a police vehicle under tight security.

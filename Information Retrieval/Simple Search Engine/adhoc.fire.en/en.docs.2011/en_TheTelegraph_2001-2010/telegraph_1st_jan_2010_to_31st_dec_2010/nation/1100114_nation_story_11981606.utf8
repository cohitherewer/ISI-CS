The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPI threat to Posco land drive
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CPI threat to Posco land drive
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 13: The CPI, an ally of the ruling BJD in Orissa, today threatened to launch an agitation against the proposed steel plant of the South Korean steel major Posco, even as the state government got ready to begin land acquisition next month.        
	Till now, we had been supporting the anti-Posco agitation. Henceforth, we will be forced to launch direct agitation, if the location of the proposed mega steel plant to be set up by the South Korean multinational is not changed and the government starts land acquisition by displacing people, CPI state secretary Dibakar Nayak told reporters here today.        
	Of course, the project has received clearance for diversion of forestland for establishment of the steel plant. But in reality no forest exists on the land identified for the plant, he said.        
	The company may have received forest clearance from the Centre. But the local people have not given their clearance, pointed out the CPI leader.        
	Claiming that the local people have been taking up betel cultivation on the land since the rule of zamindar of Burdwan, Nayak demanded the land be settled in favour of cultivators and not in favour of the South Korean firm.        
	We are not opposed to industrialisation or foreign direct investment as such. But we want relocation of the Posco steel plant, cancellation of clearance for the captive port and sale of raw material through the state-owned Orissa Mining Corporation instead of granting captive mines lease, he clarified.        
	Posco had signed an MoU with the state government on June 22, 2005, for setting up a 12 MTPA mega steel plant.

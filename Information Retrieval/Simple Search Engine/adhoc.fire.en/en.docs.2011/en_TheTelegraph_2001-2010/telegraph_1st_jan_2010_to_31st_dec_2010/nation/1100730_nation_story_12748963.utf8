          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 29: P. Chidambaram reportedly told a closed-door meeting of MPs today that the Maoist problem would be overcome by 2013.         
	 The government is confident that the problem of Left-wing extremism would be met with determination and overcome in the next three years, an official source quoted the Union home minister as telling the meeting of the parliamentary consultative committee for home affairs. He is also said to have stressed on the governments two-pronged strategy of police action and development initiatives in Maoist belts. Ministry sources said it was agreed the two-pronged strategy with development and police action alongside would be the way forward.         
	Over the past 20-odd months since Chidambaram took charge of the ministry, all kinds of time estimates  from one year to seven years  were given regarding the anti-Maoist operations. This is the first time that Chidambaram put a timeframe for resolving the problem that now affects 13 states.         
	One MP, though, has cast doubts on the timeframe set by the home minister. Jhargram MP, Pulin Bihari Baske, said: If work is happening in Bengal, it is not happening in Orissa; it has to happen together. If that does not happen, it cannot be achieved in three years, he said.

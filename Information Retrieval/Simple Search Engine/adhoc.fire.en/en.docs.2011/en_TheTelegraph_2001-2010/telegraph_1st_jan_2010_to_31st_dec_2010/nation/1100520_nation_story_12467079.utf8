The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nepal deadlock before deadline
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nepal deadlock before deadline

	New Delhi, May 19: Nepal is on the verge of losing another opportunity to fulfil the mandate of its troubled transition from monarchy to republic.         
	The deadline for adopting a new constitution, meant to formalise the conclusion of the civil war and enshrine a multi-party democracy, runs out on May 28 with no signs the bitterly divided power players can reach an agreement.         
	The passing of the deadline could well mean the final act of the slow and inexorable frittering of new hope generated by the elections of 2008. The Constituent Assembly would have run out of term and failed its given task of framing a constitution. The political parties would remain in angry deadlock over differences. The nation itself would be confronted by an unprecedented constitutional crisis few in the citizenry would have bargained for when they voted for a New Nepal two summers ago.         
	Whos to be in charge once the Constituent Assembly, of which Prime Minister Madhav Nepal is a creature, expires on May 28? On paper, at any rate, Nepal would have lost the legislature from which its current government draws its authority.         
	Few seem to know whats to follow. Even fewer are agreed on what should. Instead of arriving at clarity on how to proceed two years on, Nepal is confronted with confounding politico-legal tangles that tip the nation back into chaos.         
	We have lost the gains of the peace process and the elections, a seasoned Nepal observer told The Telegraph from Kathmandu. We are now looking at a free for all without agreed rules of play and without umpires.         
	Tagged to the elusive search for political agreement is the unresolved  but critical  issue of integrating Maoist military cadres into the Nepal Army. Little breakthrough has been made on how, and how many, Peoples Liberation Army members are to be absorbed into the Nepal Army. Until the military aspect of the deal is settled, many believe, a political deal is unlikely to work, even if it is somehow arrived at.         
	Kathmandu has been rife with increasingly panicked speculation on what could happen post May 28. The optimists are still pinning some hope on a last-minute deal between the beleaguered Madhav Nepal government and the agitating Maoists that will ensure a pullback from the precipice. But their ranks are few.         
	The Maoists have put what many see as a non-offer as precondition to any deal: Madhav Nepals resignation and the re-installation of Prachanda as Prime Minister.         
	To realists, the options are all worrying and lead to uncertainty. Just a sample of the imaginable scenarios that could unfold in the absence of any political breakthrough before the midnight of May 28:         
	President Ram Baran Yadav declares a state of Emergency on the advice of Madhav Nepal and makes that the basis of extending the Constituent Assembly for another six months. Problem: This will be unacceptable to the Maoists, who will most likely question Madhav Nepals legitimacy in office and intensify protests;         
	Madhav Nepal recommends the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly and seeks fresh elections in view of the failure to draft a new constitution within the deadline. Problem: it is not clear whether Madhav Nepal has his own coalition partners, especially the Nepali Congress, on board. Besides, the Maoists will again question the political and legal sanctity of such a recommendation;         
	The interim constitution itself is amended to sanction a limited extension for the Constituent Assembly to provide more time for political dialogue with the Maoists on the new constitution to conclude. Problem: the Maoists will not co-operate with any such amendment, they want Madhav Nepal out of power as the first step to any negotiations;         
	President Yadav declares an Emergency on his own and assumes power in a soft coup. Problem: constitutional experts are deeply divided on whether Yadav has the right to do this, although many argue he will remain the only legitimate authority once the Constituent Assembly ceases to exist on May 28. Such a move will have to have New Delhis covert backing and will, therefore, open Nepal up to greater internal tumult. Besides, it is unlikely New Delhi will back a move that will have to be supported, at least initially, by the Nepal Army;         
	The Maoists unilaterally release their own Nepal Constitution  as they have threatened  and make that the basis for future negotiations with political adversaries and the Nepal Army. Problem: Well, a unilateral Maoist constitution will be the inauguration of a slew of new problems.         
	Whichever way you look, said a senior Nepali Congress leader, the prospects are troubling. There is a constitutional crisis about to explode, but even if we somehow get over that hurdle, the political tangle in Nepal remains. Instead of tying up the loose ends of a new democratic republic, we have put them into a horrible tangle.         
	The chief sign, to him, that Nepals crisis is alive and kicking is that the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) has just got itself an extended term. Many thought UNMIN would lose relevance after the elections and slowly pack up, he said, but as a collective we have proved that hope unfounded.

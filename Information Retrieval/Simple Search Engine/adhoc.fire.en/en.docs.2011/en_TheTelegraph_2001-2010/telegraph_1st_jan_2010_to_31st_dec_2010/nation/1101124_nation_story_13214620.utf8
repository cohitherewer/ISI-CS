	Durgapur, Nov 23: Officials have halted discussions with villagers to acquire 2,350 acres for Bhushan Steels plant near Asansol as the owners have not been turning up for the sessions demanding higher prices and jobs.        
	The project also includes a power plant and a township for the employees.        
	The land, in the Salanpur area, is mostly barren and single crop. The owners, mostly small farmers, are demanding Rs 12 lakh to Rs 18 lakh per acre. The government is offering Rs 4.5 lakh to Rs 8.5 lakh.

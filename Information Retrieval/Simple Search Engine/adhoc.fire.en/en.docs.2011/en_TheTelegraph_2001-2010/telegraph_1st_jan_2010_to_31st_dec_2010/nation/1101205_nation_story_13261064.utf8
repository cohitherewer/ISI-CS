The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sarkozy UN push, but Delhi wonders
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sarkozy UN push, but Delhi wonders
  - French President pushes for India at high table, then clubs it with other wannabes        OUR BUREAU                          French President Nicolas Sarkozy and First Lady Carla Bruni arrive in Bangalore on Saturday. (AP)                                        
	Dec. 4: French President Nicolas Sarkozy made correct noises backing Indias case for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council upon arrival in Bangalore today but its a moot point how consequential they are.        
	India deserves to be a member of the UNSC, Sarkozy told top ISRO scientists, but quickly bracketed it with Brazil, Germany, Japan, South Africa and the Arab world.        
	US President Barack Obama too had issued open-ended support to Indias candidacy during his visit last month saying the US looks forward to welcoming India as part of a reformed Security Council in the years to come.        
	Probably of greater comfort to India was Sarkozys pointed reference to Pakistan as a hub of international terror. Calling Pakistan and Afghanistan a major source of instability in the world Sarkozy said, France and India are both proud democracies and we should fight terrorism together.        
	Sarkozy, who has brought along big budget N-reactor sales proposal to India, also promised all French assistance to Indias civilian nuclear programme.        
	The French President arrived in Bangalore  accompanied by celebrity wife Carla Bruni, who stepped off the flight in a beige three-piece skirt and top  at the start of a four-leg Indian journey that takes the couple to Agra, New Delhi and Mumbai. Part of their visit, especially the Agra leg, is being described as strictly private and off-media. In passing remarks made to journalists, though, Bruni did say she was really looking forward to seeing the Taj Mahal, the whole reality of it.        
	A night at the Taj has been Sarkozys long-held promise to Bruni; the two could not make it the last time Sarkozy was in India  as chief guest for the R-Day parade in 2008  because although they had made their relationship public, the two were not married. Protocol snags over the uncertain status of Bruni meant she had to stay back in France to await another opportunity.        
	Sarkozy is also accompanied on this visit by several key cabinet ministers and high-level business and entertainment delegations including Oscar-winning actress Kristin Scott Thomas who is not a naturalised French national. There is also a 100-strong French media contingent tagging the French first couple.

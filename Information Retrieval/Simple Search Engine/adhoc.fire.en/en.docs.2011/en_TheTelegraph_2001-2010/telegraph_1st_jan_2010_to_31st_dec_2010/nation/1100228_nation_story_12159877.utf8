          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Tata Steel                                   
	Jamshedpur, Feb. 27: A 28-year-old man from Calcutta was held by security guards while he was clicking pictures inside Tata Steel works late last evening.        
	Narendra Nath Dasgupta was later handed over to the Bistupur police station. The police have detained him for interrogation.        
	Dasgupta had cycled his way from Calcutta to Jamshedpur  a distance of at least 300km  yesterday. He had been clicking pictures at various locations across the city before sneaking into Tata Steel works under the cover of darkness.        
	Police have seized his bicycle and camera.        
	A resident of Pyara Bagan under the Sonarpur police station area, Dasgupta was taking pictures inside the plant premises when securitymen spotted him. He was immediately taken into custody and handed over to the police.        
	We are verifying the details of the man. He has come from Calcutta on his bicycle. We have talked to Dasguptas fiance and her family. Verification is on, an officer of Bistupur police station said.        
	He said Dasgupta was to get married after some weeks and had come to the steel city yesterday. Interrogation of the man revealed that he pedals his way to various destinations to take pictures.         
	Dasgupta has told us that he had also been to Bankura, Midnapore and other districts of Bengal to take pictures. He had come to the city with the same purpose, the police officer added.        
	According to the police, they would also verify Dasguptas details from their Sonarpur counterparts. We have so far not found anything serious about Dasgupta. But we have to conduct more verification to know about his intentions of venturing into a prohibited area. We will release him only after the verification is over and we are satisfied with the details, the police officer said.        
	The police also expressed surprise as to how Dasgupta managed to sneak into the company premises amid tight security.               
	It is all the more surprising that the man managed to take his bicycle inside the works without any security check, he said.

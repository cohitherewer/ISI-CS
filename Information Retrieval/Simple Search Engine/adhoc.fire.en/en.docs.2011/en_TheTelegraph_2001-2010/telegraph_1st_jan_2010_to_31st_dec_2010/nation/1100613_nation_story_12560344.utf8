The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Proposal for medical truce
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Proposal for medical truce
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                            From top: Azad, Sibal                          
	New Delhi, June 12: The health ministry has suggested splitting control over Indias medical education as a compromise with the human resource development (HRD) ministry aimed at ending a turf war splitting the central government and delaying key higher education reforms.         
	The health ministry has proposed sharing control over medical education with the proposed National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER), which was promised as an overarching higher education regulator, government officials have told The Telegraph.        
	The proposal is a consequence of the realisation that the countrys medical community is unlikely to blindly support the health ministry in a stand-off to retain medical education under its control, the sources said.         
	But HRD ministry sources indicated that they remained unconvinced at the health ministrys peace offer and argued that it could complicate regulating medical education which would involve coordination between two regulators.        
	Under the health ministry proposal, for instance, the four years of study in the undergraduate MBBS programme can be governed by the NCHER. But the health ministry or a regulator it is proposing will regulate the final  fifth  year of internship that complete the MBBS programme.        
	Accepting the health ministry proposal will mean splitting the governance of a single course  such as an MBBS programme  between two regulators. That can only complicate co-ordination, and rails against the principle of an overarching regulator, a source said.        
	The health ministrys compromise offer was made at a meeting on Thursday with an HRD ministry-appointed task force formulating the structure and legislation for the NCHER.        
	Different streams of higher education  universities, technical education, legal education, architecture and medical education  are at present governed by norms set by different regulatory agencies.        
	A panel appointed by the Prime Minister under scientist Yash Pal had proposed the NCHER as a single overarching higher education regulator, subsuming the myriad current regulators.        
	Under health ministry pressure, the President last year announced a National Council for Human Resources in Health (NCHRH) to regulate medical and other health-related education, alongside the NCHER to regulate all other higher education.        
	Following the arrest of Medical Council of India president Ketan Desai earlier this year over charges of corruption, the HRD ministry renewed its proposal to include medical education under the NCHER.         
	The perceived inability of the health ministry to stem corruption at the MCI  health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad even expressed his helplessness in Parliament  pushed the Prime Ministers Office to back the HRD ministry proposal.        
	But Azad told the Prime Minister he could not accept losing medical education and the health ministry publicly rejected the proposal to cede control to the NCHER.        
	Less than a week later, the HRD ministry task force  which includes eminent public health experts  iterated its demand that all streams of higher education including medical education be brought under the NCHER.

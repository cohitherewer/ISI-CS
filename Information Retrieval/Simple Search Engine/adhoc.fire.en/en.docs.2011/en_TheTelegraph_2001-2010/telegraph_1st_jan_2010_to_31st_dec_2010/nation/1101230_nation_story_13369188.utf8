The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bare trick in protest season
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bare trick in protest season
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                                    Shruti Haasan (top), Richa Gangopadhyay      
	Hyderabad, Dec. 29: When in trouble, peel down to the bare necessities.        
	The Telangana-hit Telugu film industry has worked out a way to beat the box-office drought: promote new releases with bare-dare public appearances by heroines.        
	So for the past month or so, fans have been getting an unscheduled eyeful. Like last week, when Mirapakai (red chilli) actress Richa Gangopadhyay appeared in a revealing red dress.        
	Earlier this month, the actress who played a homely girl in the film Leader starring producer Rama Naidus son Rana appeared in an out-of-the-way outfit at an audio release.        
	The ploy paid off.        
	The film, otherwise rated placid, set the cash boxes ringing.        
	Critics too have been charmed. Richa and nearly every Telugu film heroine, like Trisha, Samanta, Tapsee, Anushka, Hansika Motwani and Sweta Basu, have been getting rave reviews in local film magazines.        
	While industry bosses are patting their pockets, the heroines say its part of the job.        
	Why focus on us when almost the entire industry in the country is banking on masala for survival, said an actress who didnt want to be named.        
	The pre-release or post-release publicity stunts come at a time the Telugu film industry is trying to put behind the losses it suffered earlier this year when pro-Telangana protesters destroyed sets and disrupted shootings of movies of coastal Andhra producers in and around state capital Hyderabad.        
	That was in September, at the height of the statehood agitation that has also seen several suicides.        
	Among those affected were films of Mohan Babu, Junior NTR and Chiranjeevis brothers. Industry insiders put the total losses at Rs 100 crore, if not more.        
	Now, with some 30 films hitting the big screen all over the state and the focus on first-week collection, which can make or mar a movie, industry strategists dont want a rerun.        
	The Nizam circuit, which includes all the Telangana districts and those of neighbouring Maharashtra and Karnataka, is crucial for the success of big-budget Telugu films, said prominent film producer Bellamkonda Suresh.        
	So enter actresses Shriya Saran, Yana Gupta and Kamal Haasans daughter Shruti in daring dresses.        
	Another reason could be the mercury dip in Telangana, where minimum temperatures are hovering around 10 degrees Centigrade.        
	The logic is simple: more skin, higher (viewer) Celsius.        
	The skin-off  er, spin-off  is the flash of a shapely leg, or a fleeting glimpse of a bit more.        
	Adisheshagiri Rao, a prominent Telugu film producer, says it was the last resort for the survival of the industry.        
	Senior police officials admitted that they had so far turned a blind eye. The Hyderabad police commissioner had, however, made it mandatory for the film industry to obtain permission for all such public appearances. We just want to avert unnecessary and unsavoury incidents, said a senior official.

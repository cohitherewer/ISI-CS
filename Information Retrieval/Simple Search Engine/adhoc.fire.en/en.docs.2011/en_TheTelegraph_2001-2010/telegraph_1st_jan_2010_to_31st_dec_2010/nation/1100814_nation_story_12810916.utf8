	Aug. 13 (PTI): An Infosys human resources manager was arrested in Bangalore today on suspicion of murdering his wife and passing it off as an outcome of a botched robbery.        
	Police feel that Satish Kumar Gupta, 32, was responsible for the death of his wife Priyanka, 30, who was a teacher in Delhi Public School.        
	The Infosys HR manager has been arrested. He was produced before a magistrate who remanded him in police custody, said Bangalore deputy commissioner of police B.N.S. Reddy.        
	Priyanka was found murdered at her home on Tuesday. She was strangulated and her throat was slit. Priyanka and Satish were married three years ago and did not have children.        
	Satish, in his complaint, had said he went for jogging at 5.40am while Priyanka was practising yoga. Some time later, she called him to say that two persons had come to the house and enquired if they could supply newspapers, but she sent them away.        
	When he returned at 6.45am, he found the door locked. He rang the bell but there was no response. Satish had said he then went to Infosys to get the duplicate key from his locker, opened the door and found Priyanka dead.

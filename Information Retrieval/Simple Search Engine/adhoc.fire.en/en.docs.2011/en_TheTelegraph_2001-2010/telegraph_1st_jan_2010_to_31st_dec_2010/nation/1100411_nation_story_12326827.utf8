The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Taliban Indian camp attack
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Taliban Indian camp attack
                            
	Kabul, April 10 (AP): Taliban militants launched a pre-dawn attack on an Indian road construction camp in eastern Afghanistan today, burning vehicles and equipment and sending the crew fleeing, authorities said.        
	No deaths or injuries were reported in the attack in Khost provinces Domanda district, the interior ministry said in a statement. The Taliban, active in the mountainous eastern region bordering Pakistan, attacked the camp around 2am local time.        
	Such raids seek to discourage foreign involvement in Afghanistan and destabilise the central government, which is struggling to bring development to the impoverished countryside and extend its mandate outside Kabul.        
	Elsewhere, two members of a nomadic tribe were killed by a roadside bomb on Friday in Kandahar, the ministry said. No details have been given.        
	The Nato has said it had no information on what caused the crash of a US Air Force Osprey in which three service members and a civilian contractor were killed. It was the first crash of the tilt-rotor aircraft in a combat zone, the US military has said.        
	Several other service members were reportedly injured when the aircraft crashed late on Thursday, 11km from Qalat, the capital of Zabul province about 300km from Kabul. The Taliban claimed it had shot down the aircraft.

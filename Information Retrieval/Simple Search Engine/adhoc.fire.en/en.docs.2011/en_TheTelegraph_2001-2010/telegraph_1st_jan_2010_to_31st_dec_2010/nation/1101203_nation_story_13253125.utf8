	 Islamabad, Dec. 2 (PTI): A Pakistani Sikh plans to file a petition against the security personnel of Lahore High Court after he was stopped from entering the court complex with his kirpan or ceremonial sword. Ajeet Singh had refused to abandon his kirpan and left after exchanging angry words with guards at the court entrance.          
	A security official at the high court later told The Express Tribune that the guards had been instructed not to let anyone enter with weapons, even blades.                   
	 Mumbai (PTI): A Bombay High Court division bench, which was going to hear a petition by residents of the Adarsh housing society, on Thursday recused itself from the case. The petitioners will now have to approach the chief justice.                  
	 New Delhi (PTI): Over 2,400 applications seeking financial assistance to set up food-processing units have been pending with the Centre for the past three years, food-processing industries minister Subodh Kant Sahai has said.

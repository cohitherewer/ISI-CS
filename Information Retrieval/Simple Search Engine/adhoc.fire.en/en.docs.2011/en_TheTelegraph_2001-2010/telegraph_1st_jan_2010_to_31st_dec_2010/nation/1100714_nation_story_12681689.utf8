The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Double bill test for Sonia
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Double bill test for Sonia

	New Delhi, July 13: Sonia Gandhis political will and skill for a more inclusive food security law and a more redemptive legislation against communal violence will be tested when the National Advisory Council meets tomorrow.        
	Sonia is up against formidable odds in the form of agriculture and food minister Sharad Pawar and a vocal section of the panel on the universalisation of food security that would transcend the cast-iron definitions of poverty levels used in the present bill.         
	The campaigners in the council  Aruna Roy, Jean Dreze and Harsh Mander  have insisted that the definitions are superfluous because the experience of BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh showed that a more inclusive public distribution system could function without excessive leaks.        
	On the communal violence (prevention, control and rehabilitation of victims) bill, 2009, council members Farah Naqvi and Mander have proposed far-reaching amendments, including the creation of crime categories other than those listed under the IPC to fill the legal vacuum on which the demand for a new law is based.        
	Some council members argued that communal violence involved the systematic targeting of a community because of its religious/ethnic identity, with the explicit or implicit support and sanction of the state and its functionaries.         
	As such these crimes do not find themselves reflected in the IPC and other extant penal laws, a member said, adding that targeted mass crimes needed to be redefined drawing upon concepts of genocide  killing members of a group, preventing births within a group, forcibly transferring children of one group to another  and crimes against humanity.        
	Among the more radical proposals flagged by the council were about doing away with the immunity allowed to civil and military personnel who have it in their command to prevent the eruption of communal violence. But several riots have shown that those in authority either participate in riots or remain passive.        
	The Sonia-led council is expected to make out a case to incorporate the principle of command responsibility that seeks to pin criminal liability on a person, civilian or military, under whose command the crimes occurred.         
	Crimes of omission  for instance in 1992, when the Babri mosque came down and houses and properties of Ayodhyas Muslims were destroyed almost simultaneously, the police and paramilitary forces did nothing  will have to be classified as culpable inaction.        
	The existing bill does not factor in the accountability of public officials who get away because of the requirement of prior sanction from the government for their prosecution. Government sources maintained that such changes were highly unlikely to see the light of day considering the sense of solidarity that cements officials whenever their interests are jeopardised.

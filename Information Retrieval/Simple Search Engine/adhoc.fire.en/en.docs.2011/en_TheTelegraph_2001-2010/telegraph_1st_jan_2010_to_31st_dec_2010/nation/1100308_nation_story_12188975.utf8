          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 7: The ensuing brief pre-budget session of the Assembly starting tomorrow is likely to be stormy.        
	The pre-budget session will have just nine working days.         
	This will be the first session after the winter session, which was adjourned abruptly with 11 days left. The Opposition had, however, run an unofficial session till the date it was convened. They had also marched to Raj Bhavan and urged the governor to re-summon the session for the rest of the days.        
	However, the cabinet had recommended the governor to prorogue the session and the governor acted on the recommendations.        
	Controversy also awaits the ensuing session. The Congress had alleged that the state government and ruling BJD had summoned a short session, as they were afraid to face the Opposition.        
	Opposition chief whip Prasad Harichandan said the Assembly secretariat had initially submitted a proposal for convening a long session for presentation of the budget. But later, the state government decided to convene a short session on the plea that it would not be able to present a full-fledged budget since the 13th Finance Commission recommendations were not made available.         
	Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh said they would raise several issues, including mining scam.        
	However, the BJD is prepared to counter the Opposition attack. We are ready to discuss any issue raised by the Opposition, said parliamentary affairs minister Raghunath Mohanty.

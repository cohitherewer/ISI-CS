										      - Distinction between enumeration and compilation: PC      ARCHIS MOHAN                      Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and his wife Sadhna give details of their family to census officials (not in picture) in Bhopal on Friday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, May 7: Five years is what it would take to tabulate and verify the authenticity of caste data collected under Census 2011.        
	The 1931 census  the last time castes were enumerated  had thrown up 65,000 caste names. Officials estimate many more in a fresh count.        
	The caste data will be collected in the ongoing censuss second phase  when the population is counted. The population enumeration  or the headcount of each and every resident of India  will be done in February 2011.        
	In the past, population enumeration included questions on religion, nationality and whether the respondent belonged to the SC/ST or general category. In this census, there will now be a separate column for caste.        
	Merely tabulating the responses will take at least two years, said a senior official of the home ministry, which is conducting the exercise. The 1931 census had reported 65,000 castes. This time, we may have a lakh caste names. The challenge will be to classify, tabulate and then verify the claims. It will take two years to tabulate and another three years to verify. Enumerators will only record responses. The ministry of social justice and empowerment will need to verify the authenticity of these responses, said the official.        
	The home ministry and census officials are aware that many respondents may not know whether they belong to the OBC, SC or general categories. There is also the prospect of misuse. Respondents may give false information deliberately. That is the reason the responses will have to be verified.        
	The technical advisory committee, comprising eminent demographers, statisticians, social scientists and senior officers from different ministries and departments of the Centre, will need to devise a plan.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram, speaking in the Lok Sabha today, cited some of the logistical problems in the caste enumeration. He said there was a distinction between enumeration and compilation, analysis and dissemination. He said the 21 lakh enumerators, most of them primary school teachers, involved in the census would only record responses. They would not check the veracity.        
	There is a central list of Other Backward Classes and state-specific lists of Other Backward Classes. Some states do not have a list of OBCs; some states have a list of OBCs and a sub-set called Most Backward Classes. The registrar-general (census commissioner) has also pointed out that there are certain open-ended categories on the lists such as orphans and destitute children, Chidambaram said.        
	The minister also spoke of other problems. The names of some castes are found on the list of Scheduled Castes and list of OBCs. Scheduled Castes converted to Christianity or Islam are also treated differently in different states. The status of a migrant from one state to another and the status of children of inter-caste marriage, in terms of caste classification, are also vexed questions, the home minister added.        
	Chidambaram said the census commissioner had also pointed out that issues regarding methodology, avoiding phonetic and spelling errors, stage of canvassing and maintaining the integrity of the enumeration would also come up.        
	As I understand the honourable members (MPs), what they want is that the question of caste must be canvassed. That means, to the best of my understanding, the enumerator should record whatever answer the respondent gives to the question what is your caste? At that point of time, it is simply collection of the information. According to honourable members, it is desirable to collect the information, the home minister said.        
	The home ministry will now need to prepare a note on the caste enumeration for the cabinets approval.

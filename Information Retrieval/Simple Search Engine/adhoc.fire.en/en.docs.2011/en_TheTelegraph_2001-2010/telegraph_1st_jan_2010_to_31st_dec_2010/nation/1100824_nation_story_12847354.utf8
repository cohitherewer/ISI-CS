The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rail bid to cut out state force
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rail bid to cut out state force
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                        Mamata    
	New Delhi, Aug. 23: Railway minister Mamata Banerjee is ready with a draft amendment to the Railway Protection Force Act that will allow the RPF to investigate all rail-related crimes in the country.         
	The amendment, if cleared by the Union cabinet and passed in Parliament, will strip the Government Railway Police (GRP), which functions under state governments, of its power to probe such crimes.         
	The draft is ready and will be sent to the Union law ministry soon, before seeking clearance from the cabinet. We have spoken to the law ministry and they are very much interested in the draft, a top official in charge of railway security told The Telegraph.        
	The constant disruption of train services by Maoists and the Jnaneswari Express sabotage on May 28 are believed to have firmed up Mamatas resolve to take the step. After the accident, Mamata had said the train disaster was a sabotage and a deep-rooted political conspiracy hatched by some persons (hinting at the CPM).         
	This was the reason why she asked for a CBI probe (into the Jnaneswari accident) to identify those involved as she had no faith either in the GRP or the CID, the railway official added.         
	On July 19, the Uttar Banga Express had rammed into the Vananchal Express at Sainthia in Bengal, the collision claiming over 160 lives. Mamata again said she suspected sabotage.        
	Some state governments might oppose the draft, saying law and order is a state subject. But the proposal will go a long way in solving (railway) crime cases transparently. The bill, if passed, will help us in putting pressure on the RPF, which is not always possible in the case of the GRP, which functions under state governments, the official added.         
	According to the draft bill, all railway-related crimes, such as snatching, robbery, murder or sabotage, will be investigated by the RPF. The GRP will be assigned normal law and order duty. If the bill is cleared, then the RPF will have the sole responsibility of handling railway crime cases, the official said.         
	At present, the RPF can only register an FIR with the GRP in cases relating to damage of railway property. Crimes covered under the Indian Penal Code are investigated by the GRP.         
	The railway ministry pays half of a GRP jawan or officers salary, the rest is paid by the state government.

	Mumbai, April 20: A lion escaped from the Sanjay Gandhi National Park after killing the gatekeeper, triggering a wide search for the animal, reports our special correspondent.         
	Mumbais eastern and western suburbs border the 104sqkm park on three sides.        
	The lion, hiding in bushes, attacked the 27-year-old Ramesh Jindal when he approached the main gate around 6pm after the last bus carrying visitors had left. The animal then fled.        
	The mauled Jindal was declared dead at a hospital in Borivli in western Mumbai.

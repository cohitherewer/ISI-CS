	Vijayawada, Aug. 10: The CPM central leadership has finally rejected the Singur model of land acquisition after a string of poll reverses starting with the 2008 panchayat elections.        
	The realisation has dawned on the party four years after Mamata Banerjee raised the banner of protest in Singur against forcible acquisition, went on a 26-day hunger strike and then won successive elections by using land as her poll plank. Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had then said such takeovers were unavoidable because most of the land in the Gangetic plain was used for agriculture.        
	After a four-day churn at the extended central committee, the CPM today concluded that the 1894 land reforms act that allowed forcible acquisition should be repealed as it did not do justice to those parting with their plots. So, a new law had to be introduced.        
	Bengals Left Front government had abandoned forcible land acquisition since the backlash in Nandigram and Singur, but the central leadership articulated its stand today.        
	Addressing farmers concerns, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said: Land is a critical issue and any government will have to be cautious about the steps to be taken to acquire fertile tracts.        
	He said the Bengal government was now trying to earmark areas in Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore where there was not much fertile land for setting up industry, according to the experience the CPM had gathered.        
	Around 1,000 acres were acquired in Singur for industry initiatives and there were a few who protested against the takeover. But our Singur experience suggests that it would be better to seek the consent of the land owners and farmers rather than use force to take over land as guaranteed by the 1894 act, he said.        
	Karat said the matter had been discussed at the central committee. Our stand is that the archaic act should be scrapped and a new legislation introduced as it is not doing justice to those whose lands are being taken away.        
	There should also be a comprehensive policy on adequate compensation and rehabilitation for those who will be losing land. We must keep in mind that land is both property and livelihood to the farmers. So, they will have to be looked after.        
	The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government had used the 1894 act to acquire land for Tata Motors Nano factory at Singur. But the company left because of continued resistance from Mamata.        
	The Centre is now in the process of making changes to the 1894 act but not much has proceeded because of Mamatas insistence that government role in land acquisition be kept to a minimum.        
	Karat said: Mamata doesnt want government intervention in land acquisition at all. But we are of the view that the government should be in the process of land acquisition for industry initiatives to a certain extent while private investors would manage acres on their own.        
	According to the CPM general secretary, Nandigram after Singur had sullied the Lefts image and sent wrong signals to the people that the Bengal government was out to grab the land of poor farmers.        
	After the Nandigram episode that followed Singur, a big campaign was launched against us and that also caused damage to our partys image, though not an inch of land was taken there, he said.        
	Karat said the party had decided to stand by the poor farmers and protect their interests by not taking over fertile plots. We dont want to dispossess peasants and the tribal people. Similarly, we are against the setting up of special economic zones on hundreds and thousands of acres.        
	Addressing a public rally after the conclave, Karat iterated the partys concern for the peasantry. The land struggle will be taken seriously by the party. We have decided to fight all efforts to take over the land of peasants.

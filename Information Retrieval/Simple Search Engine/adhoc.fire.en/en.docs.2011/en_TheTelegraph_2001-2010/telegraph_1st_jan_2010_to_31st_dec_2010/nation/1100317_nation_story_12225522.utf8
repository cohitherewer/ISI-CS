The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nuke bill crash course for sceptics
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nuke bill crash course for sceptics
          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, March 16: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had staked his governments survival on the passage of the Indo-US nuclear deal in 2008. Now he is set to deploy his best men and women to convince political parties of the need for the nuclear liability bill.        
	Today, Singh fielded national security adviser (NSA) Shiv Shankar Menon to convince senior Congress leaders about the necessity of the bill. Sources said Menon was likely to hold similar classes for UPA partners, particularly the Trinamul Congress, which has expressed reservations.        
	The NSA may even brief the BJP and the Samajwadi Party which, along with the Left, have opposed the bill. Sources said the Prime Minister may even send other envoys to talk to the parties.        
	The Congress leaders given a crash course on the bill by Menon today are among the partys public faces. They included Union ministers Kapil Sibal, Pawan Kumar Bansal and Prithviraj Chavan, and spokespersons Manish Tewari and Jayanti Natarajan, apart from Rashid Alvi, Sandeep Dikshit, Rajiv Shukla and Mausam Noor.        
	The class lasted nearly an hour. Menon explained the need for the bill, its advantages for India and appeared to have convinced the leaders that the Oppositions main criticism  low compensation to victims of a nuke accident  was unfounded. He explained the three-tier compensation mentioned in the bill and said the legislation was culled from best global practices and was consistent with international conventions on the subject.        
	We ourselves wanted to understand the procedure for liability as lot of misconceptions are being created on the bill, said a leader who attended the class. There is no cap on liability, the leader said, as is being alleged by the Opposition parties. Rather the bill provides for a three-tier liability structure, he said.         
	Spokesperson Tewari said it was improper for the BJP to criticise the bill as the process of bringing in the nuclear regime had commenced during the rule of the BJP-led NDA. On the Lefts opposition, Tewari argued that since the communists had opposed the Indo-US nuclear deal, they were now trying to stall every related bill.        
	The Left continued its criticism of the bill today, dubbing it anti-Indian people and appealing to all MPs to oppose it.        
	 This bill caps a time limit of 10 years beyond which victims of nuclear accidents cannot claim compensation. This will prevent successive generations of victims from any right to compensation.         
	The UPA should send a delegation of MPs to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to study how radiation affects even future generations, said CPM general secretary Prakash Karat whose party issued the appeal along with the CPI, Forward Bloc and the RSP.         
	Listing other drawbacks, the parties alleged that the bill was in conflict with Indian laws on fixing liability and was being pushed through to favour and provide hidden subsidies to suppliers based in the US.

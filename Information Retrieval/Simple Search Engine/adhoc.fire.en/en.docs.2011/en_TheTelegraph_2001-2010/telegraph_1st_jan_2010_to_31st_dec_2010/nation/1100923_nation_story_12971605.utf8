The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 72-hour ban on bulk phone messages
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      72-hour ban on bulk phone messages
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: Two days before the Ayodhya title suit judgment, a 72-hour ban was imposed on bulk text messages and Union home minister P. Chidambaram made an appeal for calm.         
	After a series of meetings involving Chidambaram, home secretary G.K. Pillai and national security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon, the department of telecom issued a notification banning bulk SMS and MMS messages for 72 hours with immediate effect.         
	The minister then made a statement appealing for calm after the special bench of Allahabad High Court hands its verdict on Friday. It would be inappropriate to reach any hasty conclusion that one side has won or that the other side has lost, he said.         
	He also suggested that either side could immediately seek leave to appeal in the Supreme Court, thus removing a sensitive time lag during which trouble might erupt.         
	The government has kept paramilitary forces on standby and also sounded the army.         
	Chidambaram made a special appeal to the public and the media to reserve their opinions on the verdict and not make hasty pronouncements.         
	No one needs to have any apprehension, the minister said.

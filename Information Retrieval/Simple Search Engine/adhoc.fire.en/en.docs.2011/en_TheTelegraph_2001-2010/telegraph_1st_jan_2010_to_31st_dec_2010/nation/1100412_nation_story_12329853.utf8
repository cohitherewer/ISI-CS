          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, April 11: Opposition parties are set to meet tomorrow to decide if they would press for cut motions against some budget proposals, but the Congress doesnt seem to be bothered at all.        
	Although the cut motions, if adopted, will mean curtains for the Manmohan Singh government, the Congress leadership was busy planning events to mark 125 years of the party later this year.        
	Even today, a Sunday, the party held a meeting of all state unit presidents to discuss the programmes, oblivious of the possible threat to the government in the second part of the budget session that begins on April 15.        
	The Opposition meeting has generated a lot of curiosity as the Samajwadi Party and the RJD, still UPA allies technically, will break bread with the Left after a long time. The Samajwadi had dumped the Left to support the nuclear deal in 2008, forcing the Marxists to embrace the BSP and its boss Mayavati.        
	Among those expected to attend tomorrows meeting are the CPM, CPI, RJD, the Samajwadi, ADMK, Telugu Desam, Biju Janata Dal, RLD, INLD and the JD(S).        
	But cut motions will prove futile without the BJPs support. Parties like the Samajwadi and the RJD dont want an explicit understanding with the BJP for fear of losing Muslim votes.         
	We are not even talking to the BJP as it has a secret understanding with the government, Samajwadi general secretary Mohan Singh told The Telegraph.

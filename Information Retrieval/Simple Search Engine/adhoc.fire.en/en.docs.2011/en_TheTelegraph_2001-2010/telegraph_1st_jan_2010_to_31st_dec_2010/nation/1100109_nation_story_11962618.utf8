The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Churchill wary after sponsor threat
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Churchill wary after sponsor threat
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jan. 8: Churchill Brothers today sought to isolate the club from the actions of its players, a day after the team sponsors threatened to end what is South Asias biggest football sponsorship deal if the molestation charges against three squad members are proved.        
	Co-owner Churchill Alemao made it clear that the club was more important than individual players.        
	Many players come, players go. Musli Power Xtra (the club sponsors) has come to the club, not to any player. (Okolie) Odafe is the best player in India now. But earlier we had Yakubu who was the best player, Alemao said at a news meet in Margao, Goa.        
	Nigerian Odafe, Indias most valuable player, and his teammates, countryman Ogba Kalu and Indias goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya, were arrested on Tuesday night for allegedly molesting a SpiceJet airhostess on board a flight to Calcutta.         
	The charges prompted Kunnath Pharmaceuticals, the Kerala-based company which makes Musli Power Xtra libido-enhancing pills, to announce it would reconsider its deal with the club if the allegations are proved. Kunnath sponsors the team for Rs 10 crore. Another Rs 8 crore comes from jerseys and players kit endorsement.        
	Caught on the backfoot following the assertion of Kunnath boss K.C. Abraham, Alemao refused to endorse Odafes contention that he was being individually targeted because he was a foreigner.        
	He may be saying what is in his mind. He has to remember that not just him, other Churchill players have also got drawn into this controversy, he said of his team captain who received support from the Football Players Association of India today.         
	Abraham said the company would launch a time-bound private inquiry into the incident. We will speak to the SpiceJet crew, police officers and passengers and complete the inquiry within 20 to 30 days. After that we will meet again and discuss what will happen in the future. We want to know the other side of the story, he said.        
	Alemao felt the controversy had earned him publicity. I am shining. After this controversy, I am shining everywhere, PTI quoted him as saying.         
	He also has a plan to ensure such controversies do not erupt again.         
	I am writing to civil aviation minister Praful Patel to better go for a separate seating arrangement on board airlines. Men and women should sit separately, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court denies bail to Rathore
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Court denies bail to Rathore
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                    S.P.S. Rathore                          
	Panchkula, Jan. 8: A Haryana court today rejected S.P.S. Rathores bail pleas in two cases, clearing the path for the tainted former top cops arrest.        
	Rathore, convicted of molesting teenager Ruchika Girhotra, has been booked for attempt to murder, criminal intimidation, forging and fabricating evidence, wrongful confinement and criminal conspiracy  all non-bailable charges  based on FIRs filed by Ruchikas father Subhash and brother Ashu on December 29.        
	In the normal course of matters, an accused is arrested within 24 hours of a bail plea being rejected.         
	The Haryana government has already recommended that the CBI take over the three cases against the former director-general of police, probably out of fear that the names of several other high-ranking officers could tumble out and complicate matters for the force.         
	It is not easy to go against a senior person from the force. Meetings are being held at the highest level at the moment and nobody wants to take the first step, especially after the revelation that the present Haryana police chief, Ranjiv Dalal, was the Ambala range deputy inspector-general in 1990 when Ruchika was molested, a senior officer said on the condition of anonymity.        
	Although Dalal has not been named as an accused in the case, Panchkula, where the molestation case was lodged, was in his area of operation in 1990.         
	Today neither Rathore, who allegedly drove Ruchika to suicide, nor his wife and lawyer Abha, who had moved the bail applications, was present in the district and sessions court.        
	The anticipatory bail plea of another Haryana police officer, Sewa Singh, a sub-inspector posted at Pinjore near Panchkula, was also rejected. Singh is accused of booking Ruchikas brother Ashu in false cases of car theft, allegedly at Rathores behest.        
	Ruchikas friend Aradhana, the sole witness in the case, welcomed the verdicts and demanded Rathores immediate arrest. I am happy and I have hope that justice will finally be done. We want him arrested immediately, she said.         
	She, however, said she had no faith in the Haryana government. We want the CBI, which is an independent agency, to investigate the allegations made in our complaints and also that of abetment to suicide which was filed later, Aradhana said.        
	The Girhotras lawyer, Pankaj Bhardwaj, alleged the special investigation team set up by the Haryana government was shielding Rathore. We will go to the high court if Rathore is not arrested now, he said.        
	No police officer was available for comment after the dismissal of Rathores bail applications.         
	Lawyer Ajay Jain, who is assisting the Rathores, said the former director-general of police would approach Punjab and Haryana High Court.        
	Asked whether the police were free to arrest Rathore after the rejection of his bail pleas, Jain said it was up to the CBI to make a move. The Haryana government has asked the CBI to investigate the entire case and the matter rests with them, he said.

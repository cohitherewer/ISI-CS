          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Nov. 3: At least 10 people affected in the 2007 police firing in Nandigram today said they had not been included in the list of the injured who will receive compensation.         
	The state government today forwarded a list mentioning 159 people injured in the firing to the block development office in Nandigram. These people will receive a compensation of Rs 1 lakh.        
	The list was prepared by the petitioners in the case, including the Trinamul Congress-backed Bhoomi Uchhchhed Pratirodh Committee. BUPC convenor and Trinamul leader Abu Taher said: There has been a mistake on our part. We will submit a plea in Calcutta High Court and ensure that all affected people receive compensation.        
	Abhijeet Samanta, 34, whose name does not figure on the list, said: I took a bullet in the throat. I remained admitted to SSKM Hospital in Calcutta for eight months. I underwent eight surgeries. My family spent around Rs 2 lakh on my treatment. I am surprised that my name is not on the list, Abhijeet said.        
	BUPC leaders today informed the joint BDO that the names of three persons killed in the firing had been included in the list by mistake. We will verify the names and delete them, Chattoraj said.

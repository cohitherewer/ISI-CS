          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 21: Two associations representing over 17,000 ration shop dealers in Bengal moved the Supreme Court today, demanding better pay and working conditions for their members.         
	The associations demanded a pay commission to fix minimum salaries, protection for the members against mob fury and electronic weighing machines and computers to stop allegations of diversion.         
	The West Bengal M.R. Dealers Association and the All Bengal Fair Price Shop Dealers Welfare Association claimed they were unable to earn enough from ration shops.         
	In fact, a daily earning of a street beggar is more than the monthly income of a dealer, the petition said, claiming that the dealer earned only Rs 3,500 per month. The associations claimed the state government had acted illegally and arbitrarily by not increasing their commission.        
	Below poverty line beneficiaries are entitled to get 20kg of rice and 15kg of wheat each month. However, supplies were not sufficient to meet the requirements.         
	The associations also urged the court to do away with family-based ration cards and instead give cards individually.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Housing graft gun set to turn on BJP   Cong bent on sniffing out rival boss role
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Housing graft gun set to turn on BJP
   Cong bent on sniffing out rival boss role
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Gadkari                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 9: The BJPs agenda to take on the UPA in Parliament on the corruption plank faltered today after the Congress handed pink slips to Ashok Chavan and Suresh Kalmadi.        
	Instead, the party might find the tables turning with the Congress bent on getting to the bottom of BJP boss Nitin Gadkaris alleged role in the housing scam that claimed Chavans chair as Maharashtra chief minister.        
	The Congress has another weapon. When Sushma Swaraj mounted an offensive on the Commonwealth Games, 2-G spectrum and Adarsh housing scams, she was stopped in her tracks by Congress backbenchers hollering that the BJP government in Karnataka had survived by purchasing MLAs.        
	Sushmas anti-corruption campaign is handicapped because she is seen as being close to the Reddy brothers who yank the levers of control over Bellarys iron-ore mines to destabilise the Yeddyurappa government periodically. We have enough ammo in our arsenal to check the BJP, claimed a Congress minister.        
	BJP sources conceded they may not be able to credibly refute the charge that the Karnataka government was allowed to continue after the chief minister openly enticed Opposition MLAs to his fold.        
	Gadkaris name cropped up in the housing scam when it was alleged that he recommended allotment of a flat for Nagpur businessman Ajay Sanchetis chauffeur. Sancheti was nominated to the BJP national executive as a special invitee by Gadkari. His driver, Sudhakar Madke, who earns Rs 8, 500 a month, eventually got an apartment.        
	Paramveer, a cousin of Sancheti, also managed to get a flat for himself. Sancheti told The Telegraph from Nagpur: The BJPs opponents wanted to drag somebodys name from the BJP and they found me. My driver got an allotment under the SC quota and my company funded the purchase. Paramveer applied in his individual capacity, he is not a director or an equity holder in my firm.        
	Gadkari, too, protested efforts to implicate him in Nagpur.        
	Asked if the Congress had taken the sting out of the BJPs offensive, Sushma said: A couple of resignations wont satisfy us. What about Jaipal Reddy and Sheila Dikshits role in CWG? Will they get away scot-free?        
	Sources said the BJP would seek clarifications on why the government left unanswered US President Barack Obamas Iran and Myanmar punches. Foreign minister S.M. Krishna is expected to make a customary statement in Parliament on Obamas visit.        
	The BJP, that was ideologically closer to Washingtons line on Iran, has changed tack. Sources waxed eloquent on Irans civilisational links with India, on Iran being the only mainline Islamic country to consistently back India and how it was ready for the gas pipeline project despite Pakistans opposition.        
	Sources also endorsed the Indian establishments pursuit of a working relationship with Myanmars junta. It has helped dismantle Ulfa operations in Burma, contain Chinese footprint in the region and foster our business interests, a source said.        
	 The US has no business to pontificate to us.

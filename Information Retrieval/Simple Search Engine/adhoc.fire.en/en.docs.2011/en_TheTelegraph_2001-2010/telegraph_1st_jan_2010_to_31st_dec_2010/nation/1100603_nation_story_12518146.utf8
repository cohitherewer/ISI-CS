The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt work on Nirupam lips
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Govt work on Nirupam lips
          BISWAJIT ROY                          Nirupam Sen                                  
	Calcutta, June 2: Nirupam Sen, Bengal industries minister and CPM politburo member, has drawn attention to the state governments performance without directly blaming it for the civic poll debacle.        
	The public may have believed in the Oppositions campaign or people may really think that we committed mistakes and they are not satisfied with our governments work. Its difficult to change the peoples mind within a short time, said Sen.        
	CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim underscored the need to examine the partys success in changing public perception of the governments and partys role in development and whether their moves reflected the peoples aspirations.        
	The hint was apparently to the post-Singur and Nandigram controversies. Other party leaders felt that both may be called catalysts for the catastrophe that was waiting to explode for years, given the accumulated grievances over bad governance and party-people relations.        
	They also felt that it was too late to undo the damage and change the popular perception. But the state party leadership was at a loss to explain the reasons for the extent of the defeat.        
	Asked why the Lefts tirade against the Maoist-Mamata nexus and lack of railway safety and the anti-Centre campaign on price rise had failed to convince voters, state CPM chief Biman Bose said: We have to introspect why our campaign went over the peoples head. We will ponder over our mistakes and take corrective steps after completing our review of the results by this month.        
	The CPM lost not only its capital today but also its trophy ward in Jadavpur, the Assembly seat represented by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	In Ramgarh, the Jadavpur ward that had sent outgoing mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) in 2005, Trinamul won by 591 votes. Such upsets spoiled the CPMs dreams of bagging at least 50 seats in the CMC.        
	In Calcutta, the Left lost most of the 22 wards in which it had a lead in the Lok Sabha polls.         
	Minority blow        
	The chief ministers promise of government job quotas for backward-class Muslims seemed not to have cut much ice among the citys minority voters. The Left bagged four of the 16 minority-dominated wards compared with nine last time.        
	In the Garden Reach-Metiabruz area, which has a mixed population of Bengali and Urdu-speaking Muslims, the CPM had won five out of eight wards in 2005 but managed to retain only two this time.        
	In contrast, it fared better in adjoining Kidderpore, regaining part of the ground lost in the Lok Sabha polls despite the defeat of mayor-in-council member Faiz Ahmed Khan.        
	In Tiljala-Park Circus, the defeat of Trinamuls Javed Khan and Rizwanur Rahmans brother Rukbanur made the CPM happy. But the CPMs mayor-in-council member Abu Sufian lost too.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Former allies snub NDA 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Former allies snub NDA 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 13: The National Democratic Alliances hopes of getting other parties to join its sit-in outside Parliament today were dashed.        
	Only the four parties that constitute the coalition staged the protest. The BJP and the Janata Dal (United) had hoped that the Asom Gana Parishad, Biju Janata Dal and the Indian National Lok Dal would make common cause with the alliance over the corruption scams.        
	The NDA is no longer optimistic about new friends joining its proposed anti-United Progressive Alliance rally in Delhi on December 22.        
	But that will not dampen our spirits. We cornered the government with the Left and the rest of the Opposition, and thats enough, a BJP source said.        
	Our assault will continue, regardless of whos in and whos out. The important task is to ensure that the entire Opposition stays one on the demand for the joint parliamentary committee until the budget session.        
	The less-than-enthusiastic response from the former allies has not deterred the BJP from pursuing its agenda to keep working on them.        
	Last year, around this time, we had been resigned to staying out of power for the next 15 years, a party leader admitted.        
	Having now glimpsed hope in the UPAs mess, the party has conveyed to those who matter that nobody must rake up the issue of who will lead the party in the next election.        
	Such disputes have damaged us enough, a source said.         
	The BJP has also directed its spokespersons to be extra-cautious with their comments and not to stray from the official line.         
	Therefore, they refused to react to a statement from Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohanrao Bhagwat that the Ayodhya land must not be partitioned and that Muslims must give up their claims on the third they are legally entitled to.        
	We didnt raise Ayodhya in our Bihar campaign. It paid off, a source said.

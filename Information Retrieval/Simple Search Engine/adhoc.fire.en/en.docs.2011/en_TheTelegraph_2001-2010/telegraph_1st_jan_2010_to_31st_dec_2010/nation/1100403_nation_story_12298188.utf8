	Gaya, April 2: Armed Maoists today attacked paramilitary forces in a forest in Bihars Gaya district.        
	A PTI report said about a 100 rebels attacked a CRPF camp inside Latua forest, but the figures were not confirmed by police.        
	Anupama Nilekar, the DIG (Magadh range), said the rebels ambushed a patrol party around 9pm. They started firing indiscriminately and the police retaliated. About 100 rounds were fired in one hour. The police have not given any casualty reports.        
	The gun battle lasted 45 minutes, Nilekar said.

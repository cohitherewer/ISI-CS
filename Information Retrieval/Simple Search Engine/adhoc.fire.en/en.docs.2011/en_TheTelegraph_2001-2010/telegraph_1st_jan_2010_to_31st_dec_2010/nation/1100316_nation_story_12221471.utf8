The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP-Left House unity rolls on
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP-Left House unity rolls on
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, March 15: The nuclear liability bill today gave the Left and the BJP another chance to display their vaunted unity, kicked off by the price rise and helped on by the womens reservation bill.        
	The two main Opposition groups, which together outnumbered the depleted Treasury benches in the Lok Sabha today, had braced themselves to block the bills introduction.        
	Each had opposed the nuclear deal with the US, and the BJP had the added motive of partially answering its in-house sceptics who felt it had put itself out to bail the government out over the womens bill.        
	Estranged UPA allies Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad too joined forces with the BJP-Left today.        
	A deflated government, realising what it was up against, deferred the bills introduction. Denied the opportunity for a showdown, the Opposition still flaunted the new-found unity between the strangest of bedfellows.        
	The unity is actually a direct outcome of the nuclear deal that was opposed by the BJP and the Left. The Samajwadi began by opposing it but later changed its stand, said CPM general secretary Prakash Karat. He said the Left would appeal to all MPs on Tuesday to not support it.        
	The poor attendance on the Treasury benches looked out of sync with Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs exertions since yesterday to try and bring the Opposition around on the nuclear bill.        
	On Sunday, Singh had phoned Sushma Swaraj, leader of the Lok Sabha Opposition, and Sitaram Yechury, the CPMs leader in the Rajya Sabha, to urge them to reconsider their resistance.        
	Recounting the conversation, Sushma told journalists: I said we cannot support. He said we will have problems with other countries to which I replied, But we have problems within our own country. The PM asked if he should ask the national security adviser to speak to me. I said there is no point because the NSA already spoke to Arun Jaitley (leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha) a month ago. But our stand remained unchanged. I was polite but firm.        
	Sushma then got in touch with the CPM and CPI floor leaders, and Yashwant Sinha was told to speak to Mulayam and Lalu Prasad to firm up the Opposition strategy.        
	Last week, Mulayam and Lalu Prasad had slammed the Left and the BJP for being in cahoots with the Congress over the womens bill. Today, by participating in the Opposition unity, they gave the government a foretaste of the problems it might now face in Parliament.        
	Government sources admitted that the stand-off was a grim reminder of how precariously the ruling alliance was placed in the Lower House minus the Yadavs.        
	The only short-run tactic we can follow is to avoid business that requires voting, a minister said. The long-term strategy, he said, was to scout for parties that could be counted on in a crisis even if this entails backroom deals.

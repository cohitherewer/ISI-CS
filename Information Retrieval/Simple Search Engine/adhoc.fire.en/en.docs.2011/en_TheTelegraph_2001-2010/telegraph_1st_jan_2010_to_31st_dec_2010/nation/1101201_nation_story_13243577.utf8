The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Uncle and Jagan meet and part 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Uncle and Jagan meet and part 
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                  Jaganmohan (top) and Vivekananda				 								                           
	Hyderabad, Nov. 30: Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy today hit out at nephew Jaganmohan for revolting against Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, saying she was a genuine human being whose capacity for sacrifice had shades of Mahatma Gandhi.        
	Disagreeing with Jagans claim that he had been humiliated by Sonia, Vivekananda  who is set to join Kiran Kumar Reddys cabinet tomorrow said the Congress chief had been very understanding and handled his continued defiance with a human touch.        
	Had Jagan waited a little more, he would have had his day in the Congress, he told reporters at the familys Idupalapaya estate in Kadapa district.        
	Sources said the uncle and nephew met briefly in the estate guesthouse this morning. But within two minutes, Vivekananda walked out of the room silently.        
	Vivekananda made it clear his loyalties were with the Congress, declaring he would not hesitate to contest the Pulivendula Assembly seat if the high command so wished. Jagans father Y.S.R. Reddy had held the seat from 1999 till his death last year, after which his mother Vijayalakshmi became the MLA. She quit the party and the Assembly yesterday, along with Jagan.        
	The Congress has been mine and my brothers family for decades. Nobody, not even Sonia Gandhi, has tried to snap the family link, Vivekananda said.        
	Sources said Vivekananda and Jagan met again late tonight in Kadapa town, but attempts at reconciliation failed. Jagan apparently tried to convince his uncle not to join the Andhra cabinet while Vivekananda tried to persuade his nephew to call off the Odarpu yatra.        
	Last evening, however, Jagan had told reporters on the train to Kadapa that he did not have a problem with his uncle being in Kiran Reddys cabinet.        
	I was only upset that he was working behind our backs and had remained incommunicado for the last four days, he said, in a possible reference to the meeting Vivekananda had with Congress leaders in New Delhi.        
	I am going to Idupalapaya to seek my fathers blessings. I am told my uncle is also in Kadapa. I will talk to him there. I will try for a truce, he said. Then he hastily added: What is there? Let him be a minister, I will have my outfit.        
	Jagan said he wanted to do politics in his own style and did not wish to wait to be expelled by the Congress. I have seen how things work in Delhi and how such things are done, he said.        
	As for launching his own party, Jagan said: The process will take a good month or two. My decision to quit was taken in the last four days.

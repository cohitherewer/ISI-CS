The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Army takeover flutter
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Army takeover flutter
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, Sept. 16: An army statement created a flutter in the Valley today after it was interpreted as suggesting the force would start playing a key role in quelling the unrest.        
	The army later clarified that it had referred only to the call given to the people by hard-line Hurriyat chief Syed Ali Shah Geelani to hold protests outside army camps on September 21.        
	A special core group meeting was held on 15 September which was chaired by the security adviser to the CM, Lt Gen. N.C. Marwah. The meeting was attended by the director-general of police and high-ranking civil and military officials, said the statement, issued last night by Army 15 Corps headquarters here.        
	The meeting discussed the measures to effectively counter the protest calendar issued by the Hurriyat and formulated a detailed joint strategy to restore normalcy in Kashmir. The strategy will be implemented with immediate effect.        
	A senior government official said his office was taken by surprise by the statement. We were flooded with calls... as the announcement appeared to suggest the army had taken over, he said.        
	The state governments decision to requisition the army in July for controlling mob violence in Srinagar, after a decade and a half, had earned Omar Abdullah some of the harshest criticism.        
	Defence spokesperson Lt Colonel J.S. Brar today told The Telegraph: The strategy is about the September 21 programme of the Hurriyat. He would not say what the strategy was.        
	Officials said the strategy involved a three-tier security around army camps, with the police and the CRPF forming the first and second rings. They said the authorities were worried that on September 21, people may target army camps the way they had attacked CRPF and police camps.        
	Yesterdays meeting was held to discuss that, an official said. The army does not have non-lethal weapons like tear gas. If they are attacked, it is natural that they will use bullets.        
	Perhaps realising the gravity of the call, Geelani modified it today. The local elders will hand over a memorandum in a peaceful manner to the army officers at their camps, asking them to leave Kashmir. The people will stay at a fair distance from the camps, he said.        
	JKLF chairman Yasin Maliks cousin Yasir Rafiq Sheikh, who was injured on August 30 in police firing at Maisuma, has died in a Delhi hospital. The police said the Valley situation was largely peaceful today.

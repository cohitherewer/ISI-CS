The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Go back, Indian tenants told in US
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Go back, Indian tenants told in US
                            
	Washington, July 17 (PTI): The US justice department has filed a lawsuit against the owner and management of an apartment complex at Renton in Washington for racial discrimination against Indians who were treated less favourably than other tenants and told to go back to their country.        
	The lawsuit seeking monetary damages and an order barring further discrimination was filed yesterday in the US district court for the western district of Washington. It named as defendants Summerhill Place LLC, the owner of Summerhill Place Apartments; GRAN Inc, the management company; and Rita Lovejoy, the former on-site manager.        
	The suit alleges that the defendants steered Indian tenants away from one of the five buildings at Summerhill, treated tenants from India less favourably than others and discouraged African-Americans, Hispanics and families with children from living at Summerhill.        
	The names of the Indians have not been revealed.        
	Equal access to housing in the United States is a fundamental right, and this nation will not tolerate discrimination in housing, said the assistant attorney general for the civil rights division, Thomas E. Perez.        
	The justice department alleged that the owner and management of the apartment complex instructed employees not to show new or renovated apartments to people from India, Hispanics and African Americans.        
	The company and its employees discriminated against Indian tenants by not replacing their carpets or broken appliances, while providing such services to other tenants, the suit alleged.        
	It added that one or more Indian tenants were told that their children cannot play outside and that they should take them to a park. They were also allegedly told to go back to India, if they could not learn how to operate appliances and faced other derogatory comments about their national origin.        
	Few things are more fundamental to success and happiness than having a safe place to live. Fair and equal access to housing is a cornerstone of our society, said the attorney for the western district of Washington, Jenny A. Durkan.        
	Apartment owners must ensure that their managers treat all tenants and potential tenants in a fair and equitable manner without regard to race, national origin or whether they have children. The US attorneys office will actively pursue these cases with the goal of fairness and equity for all, Durkan said.        
	The petition alleged that two Summerhill employees contacted the King County Office of Civil Rights in 2007 and complained of discriminatory housing practices. The county office then contracted the Fair Housing Council of Washington to conduct an inquiry.        
	After the probe, the county office referred the matter to the housing and urban development department. The secretary of the department determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that discriminatory housing practices had occurred and issued a charge of discrimination.        
	Housing discrimination is illegal and unacceptable, said the assistant secretary for fair housing and equal opportunity, John Trasvina.        
	The housing department and the justice department work to eliminate it, he said.

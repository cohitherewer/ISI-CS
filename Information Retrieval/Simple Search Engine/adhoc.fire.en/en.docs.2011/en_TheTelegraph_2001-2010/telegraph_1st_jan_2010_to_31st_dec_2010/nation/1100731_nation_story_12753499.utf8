  - City girl leaves after alleged assault, Rahul says shes with him        OUR BUREAU                     A file picure of Rahul Mahajan and Dimpy during their marriage on the 
  sets of a reality TV show                                 
	Calcutta, July 30: Calcutta model Dimpy Ganguly, who became Mrs Rahul Mahajan through a televised swayamvar, walked out on her husband yesterday alleging domestic violence but he claimed today she was back in his bed.        
	Right now, she is in my bed, sleeping and I am lying next to her. I gifted her a puppy for her birthday this week and by the time we celebrate our first anniversary next year, I will gift her a Pappu (child), he said. Many channels have approached us for shows where we feature as a couple. You will soon see us working together in a television project, he added.        
	In the early hours of Thursday, Dimpy fled the Mahajan home in Mumbais Worli after she was allegedly roughed up by Rahul, son of late BJP leader Pramod Mahajan.        
	Dimpys cellphone remained switched off on Friday but she was quoted as saying: I received an SMS on my cellphone at about 3am and Rahul suddenly got violent after he couldnt read the message because the phones keypad was locked. He slapped, kicked and dragged me by my hair. I called up a friend who took me away from Rahuls house at dawn.        
	Rahul earlier refused comment. I dont want to say anything right now. I will speak at an opportune time, Rahul, whose first wife Shweta Singh too had walked out on him because of alleged domestic abuse, told The Telegraph.        
	However, loud whispers of the fight being pre-planned to bring an end to the couples so-called contractual marriage is doing the rounds.        
	There have been rumours that Dimpy and Rahul got into the marriage knowing full well that it would last only four to five months, a source said.         
	But Imagine TV, responsible in bringing the couple together through its reality show Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jaayega, dismissed the claim.        
	As a channel, we dont have a role to play in this. As a well-wisher and friend, however, I am extremely concerned for Rahul and Dimpy, especially for Dimpy. I am hoping to have a chat with both of them soon, said Sameer Nair, chief operating officer, Imagine TV.        
	Friends and family of the Mahajan couple appeared divided into Rahul and Dimpy camps. I had met Dimpy in June when she came to Calcutta for her exams. She looked perfectly happy, a city model said.        
	Rahul is a very close friend and I know he cannot do anything like this. I spoke to him last night and both of us were laughing at the news. I know how much he loves Dimpy, said actor Zulfi Syed, who participated with Rahul in the reality show Bigg Boss.        
	Nikunj Mallik, one of the finalists on Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jaayega also came to Rahuls defence. I did hear of problems in their marriage, but we are hearing only Dimpys side of the story. We should also see what Rahul has to say.

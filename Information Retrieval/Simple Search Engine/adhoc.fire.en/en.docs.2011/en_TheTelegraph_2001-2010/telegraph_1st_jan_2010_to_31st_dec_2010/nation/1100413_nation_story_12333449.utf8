	New Delhi, April 12 (PTI): The Indian Navy has ordered a high-level inquiry against a senior officer closely associated with the Gorshkov aircraft carrier deal after objectionable photographs of him and a Russian woman reached it.        
	It will be probed whether the loose moral conduct of Commodore Sukhjinder Singh influenced the performance of his official duties, a navy spokesperson said.        
	Navy officials said that the officials involvement with the lady so far seemed to be on a personal level only, but added the inquiry was expected to be completed within a couple of days.

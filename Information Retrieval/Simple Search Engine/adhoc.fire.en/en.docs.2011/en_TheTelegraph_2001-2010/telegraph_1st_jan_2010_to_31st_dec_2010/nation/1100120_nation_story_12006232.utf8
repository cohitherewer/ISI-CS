	Calcutta, Jan. 19: Jyoti Basu fought the last battle of his life with boxing gloves on.        
	Doctors had to slip the gloves on the ailing leaders hands to prevent him from attempting to pull out the tubes inserted through his mouth and nose to try and keep him alive.        
	We tried explaining to him that the tubes had been inserted to feed him and help him breathe, but he wouldnt listen and we had no other option, said Susruta Bandyopadhyay, critical care expert, who was part of the medical board at AMRI Hospitals where Basu spent the last 17 days of his life.        
	Since January 6, Basu had been on ventilator support, which required putting two tubes into his system. He was fed through a Ryles tube through a nostril and an endotracheal tube had to be shoved in through his mouth to supply oxygen to his lungs.        
	Also, since he was on drip and his blood pressure was being monitored through an invasive procedure, his hands were pierced at several places with needles.        
	All these were painful interventions, but his condition was so critical that we had to do it, Bandyopadhyay said.        
	We used to explain to him that these processes were necessary and he had to bear some pain. But he would still try to pull out the tubes, so we had to use boxing gloves. But from January 12, he stopped making any such effort because he had become extremely weak.        
	Intensive care units keep boxing gloves  they prevent patients from gripping the tubes tightly enough.        
	Before he was put on ventilator, Basu would ask the doctors to send him back home.        
	Aamake bari jete dao (let me go back home), Basu had told the doctors several times between January 1, when he was admitted with pneumonia, and January 6, said pulmonologist Sumit Sengupta, another doctor on the medical board.        
	Sengupta said treating Basu was a different kind of experience. His system kept the fight on and after each crisis he would show some signs of recovery.        
	When he was admitted to the hospital, the blood flow to his organs was inadequate. The doctors decided to give him meropenem, an antibiotic. But he began suffering from respiratory distress and so was shifted to the ICCU on the morning of January 2.        
	The first of many crises took place on the morning of January 6. I got a call from the hospital and rushed in the morning along with others. He was put on ventilator, Bandyopadhyay said.        
	From the same day, Basus blood pressure started fluctuating wildly, prompting the use of inotropic drugs till he died on January 17. Along with this, he developed cardiac problems that became very serious after January 13.        
	He was suffering from tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular failure. This led to significant reduction of blood supply to other organs, resulting in their malfunctioning, said cardiologist Shuvanan Ray.        
	Tricuspid regurgitation is a condition in which there is back-flow of blood from the right ventricle to the right atrium.        
	The second crisis came on January 12 night when Basu developed ventricular tachycardia  irregular rhythm of the heart that can lead to cardiac arrest. His condition improved after he was treated with a defibrillator.        
	As his kidneys, liver and central nervous system began getting affected because of low blood supply and the cascading effects of lung infection, doctors had to change the modes of treatment.        
	Initially, we wanted to avoid a dialysis and were only using diuretics to help his urination. But it didnt work and we were left with no other option but dialysis, said nephrologist Ranjan Sarkar.        
	The first two dialyses didnt yield desired results since enough blood was not being pumped into the system by the heart, causing his blood pressure to fall dangerously. On January 16, we opted for slow, low-efficiency daily dialysis (SLEDD), Sarkar said.        
	On that night, Basu developed irregular heartbeats and doctors rushed in at 11.30pm. That night we knew it was all over, Sarkar said.

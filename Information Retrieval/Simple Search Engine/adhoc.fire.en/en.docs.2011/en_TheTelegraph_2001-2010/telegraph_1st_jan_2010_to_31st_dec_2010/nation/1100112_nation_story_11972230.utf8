	Mumbai, Jan. 11 (PTI): Pakistani gunman Ajmal Kasab will appear in court tomorrow after a break to give his statement on evidence adduced by the prosecution against him.        
	The court, which resumes hearing after Christmas vacations, is expected to question Kasab on the opinion given by ballistic experts and DNA reports that have nailed Kasab in the terror attacks.        
	The ballistic experts have said the bullets fired from Kasabs AK-47 rifle had caused fatal injuries, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said.        
	Nikam added the scientific evidence will falsify Kasabs story that he had not fired at people.

	Ranchi, Feb. 6: Students of government polytechnic institutes from across the state protested in front of the secretariat today.         
	The students blocked the road leading to the secretariat at about 11am, pressing for their various demands.        
	The students were upset with the governments decision to conduct examinations in outstation centres and not home centres where the students had been trained. The students said the move only harassed them and translated into unwanted expenditure.         
	A student from the polytechnic at Koderma said the government institutes were not being run properly and practically no one had landed a decent job after passing out of the institute in the last couple of years.         
	The science and technology department responsible for running the 14 institutes across the state have always neglected the students due to which our career has suffered, said Pramod Kumar, another student of the government polytechnic college at Koderma.        
	The protesters also complained of lack of proper laboratory and library facilities at the institutes.         
	The libraries do not have the latest books on different subjects taught in the institute. There are also very few professors and classes are irregular, said Vishal, another student participating in the dharna.        
	The agitated students wanted a dialogue with education minister Hemlal Murmu, who was not available.         
	The students sat on the road and shouted anti-government slogans while waiting for an opportunity to meet the department secretary.         
	However, no one from the department responded to the demands of the students. The students dispersed in the evening and have decided to continue their agitation till their demands are met.

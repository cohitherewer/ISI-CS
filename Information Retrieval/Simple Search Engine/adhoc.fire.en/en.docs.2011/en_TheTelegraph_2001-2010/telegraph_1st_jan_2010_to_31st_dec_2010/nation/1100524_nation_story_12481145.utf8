	Darjeeling, May 23: Police in the hills fear that the main accused in Madan Tamangs murder have escaped to neighbouring Sikkim.         
	K.L. Tamta, the inspector-general of police, north Bengal, said: We believe that the six named in the FIR for being directly involved in the murder have crossed over to Sikkim. I have spoken to the police there and joint raids will be conducted along the border.         
	The six named in the FIR lodged by ABGL general secretary Laxman Pradhan are Alokkant Mani Thulung, Puran Thami, youth wing leaders of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, Kismat Chhetri and Keshav Raj Pokhral who are Morcha student leaders, and Tenzing Khambachay and Dinesh Gurung, both town committee members of the outfit.         
	Seven others, including Morcha chief Bimal Gurung, have been named in the FIR for alleged criminal conspiracy. The police arrested Sangay Tshering Bhutia, the chief of the Janmukti Hotel Owners Association, last night for one of the three attacks on Friday but he was given bail.

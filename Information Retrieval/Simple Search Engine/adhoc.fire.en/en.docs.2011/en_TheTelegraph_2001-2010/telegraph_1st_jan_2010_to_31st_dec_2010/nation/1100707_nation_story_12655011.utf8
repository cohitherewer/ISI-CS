The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani blog gives CPM blushes and jitters 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Advani blog gives CPM blushes and jitters 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  (From top) Basudeb Acharya, LK Advani, Gurudas Dasgupta                                  
	Calcutta, July 6: Bengal CPM leaders today betrayed fears that L.K. Advanis blog disclosure might cost the Left minority votes in next years Assembly elections.        
	Yesterday, the BJP leader had written in his blog that the CPMs Basudeb Acharya and the CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta had visited BJP leader Sushma Swarajs Parliament office during the last budget session.        
	Advani is the leader of a communal party that is hated by minorities across the country, a CPM minister and state committee member said. In Bengal, we have a 25 per cent Muslim population of which a large section has left us. Nandigram and the Sachar committee report dealt a body blow to our party. After all this, if our party leaders visit BJP offices for parliamentary business or for any other reason, it may lead to further erosion of support.        
	He said the Left should not think our friends among the minorities are fools as they very well knew the difference between a Congress embrace and an Advani one.        
	The Left is all the more worried because Assembly elections are due next year. The results of the 2008 panchayat polls, the 2009 Lok Sabha polls and the 2010 municipal elections have clearly shown that a chunk of the minorities has already deserted the Left.        
	A former CPM minister said the Left had been in a similarly sticky situation when Advani was deputy Prime Minister. At that time, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees visits to Advanis office had caused uneasiness.        
	There was a time when Buddhababu frequently visited Advanis office in Delhi for government work. His visits were absolutely as per constitutional norms. Personally, Advani used to like him and even invited him over to his house. But we had to do a lot of explaining in Muslim mohallas before elections to convince them that the CPM had no truck with the BJP, he said.        
	In New Delhi, CPM pilotburo member M.K. Pandhe tried to allay the misgivings of the minorities. He said Muslims should not be misled by Advanis blog entry.        
	Its clear that Advani wanted to extract political capital out of the visit of Basudeb and Gurudas to Swarajs office. He may welcome us but we have no political understanding with a communal party like the BJP, he said.        
	Pandhe said the minorities should not read too much into the visit as such co-ordination was required for smooth conduct of parliamentary proceedings. There was nothing political in it. Our party always stands by the minorities, he said.        
	The Left is also worried because Advani chose to spill its secret on the eve of the July 5 bandh, which the CPM and BJP had called separately.        
	A Muslim member of the CPM state committee said there was no doubt that the BJP could never be the CPMs friend. But there are people who would say the two parties joined hands to call the July 5 bandh. So, Advanis blog and then a joint hartal will reinforce peoples perception that our party and the BJP are friends.        
	Asked if this would affect the partys prospects in the 2011 elections, CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim said: While boarding a flight, do we enquire who our co-passengers are? The Left parties gave the bandh call first. The BJP gave a separate call later. Why should we be bracketed together?         
	BJP national spokesperson Tarun Vijay said there was nothing wrong with Left leaders visiting Sushma. We have serious ideological differences with the Left. But we dont believe in the politics of apartheid, he said.

	New Delhi, Oct. 28: The Central Reserve Police Force could be split into two  one force that wields lathis and another that wields guns  if a proposal discussed in the home ministry this week is cleared.         
	The countrys largest paramilitary force, which is the mainstay of the governments fight against Maoists, is at present bogged down by structural problems that are eating into its efficiency and resources.         
	K. Vijay Kumar, who took over as director-general this month, had said the force could not do everything under the sun and needs specialised areas to be demarcated for better functioning.         
	Now, the home ministry is considering splitting the two-lakh-strong force into two  one that will deal with law and order and another that will focus only on fighting insurgency. Each force will have its own director-general.         
	If the proposal is cleared, the CRPF Act would have to be amended and another bill passed to establish a new force.         
	The counter-insurgency force is expected to keep the CRPF name. It will be younger in profile, its men will be given commando training and it will have modern combat equipment in its arsenal.         
	The force with policing duties  to be deployed for elections, and to help states in law and order enforcement  is expected to be given a new name and will be trained in modern, non-lethal ways of countering riots, mob control and maintenance of order.         
	The CRPF came into existence as Crown Representatives Police on July 27, 1939. It became the Central Reserve Police Force through the CRPF Act on December 28, 1949.         
	Specialisation was needed and so this was necessary, although nothing has been finalised yet, a source said, speaking of the split plan.         
	At present, the CRPF has 207 battalions, including 10 battalions of the Rapid Action Force for riot control, two disaster management battalions and six battalions of the Special Action Force, better known as COBRA, for counter-insurgency duties.         
	In the 1990s, militancy in Kashmir and the Northeast brought the CRPF into counter-insurgency duties. In 2004, the government looked to the CRPF to fight Maoists who it considered the biggest internal security threat to the country.         
	As the largest force trained in riot control  others are border forces  the CRPF alone was able to fight with guns and spare troops. Today, as many as 30,000 CRPF personnel are in Chhattisgarh alone, fighting Maoists.         
	CRPF sources said things had gone from bad to worse and even equipment like guns and uniforms were not being distributed smoothly. There is no dearth of weapons, distribution is a problem because we have grown very big, an official said.         
	Since they were drawn into the fight against Maoists, CRPF personnel are going through ANOT (Anti-Naxal Operations Training), which includes night-time training in firing and shooting in narrow lanes. Earlier, it was little more than wielding lathis and shooting using the limited range of weapons, a training specialist said. If the split is approved, training will be specialised.         
	Administration would also become easier, officials said. Last year, the home ministry came up with the idea of creating special DGs for three zones  northern, central and northeastern. However, decentralisation was only in name and the CRPF director-general still had to be responsible for day-to-day matters of operations, policy and administration.

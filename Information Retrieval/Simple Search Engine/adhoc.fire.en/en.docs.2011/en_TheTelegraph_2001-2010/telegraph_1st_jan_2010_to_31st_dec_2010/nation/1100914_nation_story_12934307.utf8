	New Delhi, Sept. 13: Pakistani students and teachers at the South Asian University here will not have to report to police every day or seek permission to visit cities not mentioned on their visas.        
	The foreign ministry has begun granting a special-category visa to the students, faculty and staff from the Saarc countries at the university, a brainchild of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that opened last month.        
	The South Asian University (SAU) visa is not city-specific and exempts the holders from a clutch of visa provisions meant for other citizens from their countries. Its of huge significance for the students and teachers from Pakistan.        
	Ordinarily, the visas issued by India and Pakistan to each others citizens are city-specific and require the holders to report daily to the nearest police station. Pakistan had requested India to grant these exemptions to its students and faculty members at the SAU.        
	The foreign ministry has written to the Saarc secretariat that the SAU visa would be issued to all students, faculty and staff from the member states within a month of Indias overseas missions receiving their applications.        
	This newspaper has a copy of the ministry communication, which says: The SAU student visa would be valid for the duration of the pre-specific course/tenure with three entries per academic year. The above information will override all specific visa provisions made for nationals of different countries. Indian missions in Saarc countries are being adequately briefed to facilitate this process.

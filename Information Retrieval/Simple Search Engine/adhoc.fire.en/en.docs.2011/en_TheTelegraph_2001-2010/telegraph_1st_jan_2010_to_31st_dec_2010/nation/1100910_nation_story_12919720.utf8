          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: The Union cabinet today gave its consent to open 1,728 residential schools for girls as well as for street children and those from below-poverty-line homes in a boost to elementary education.        
	The cabinet also approved aligning the norms of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the main elementary education scheme, with the rules of the Right to Education Act.         
	In total, 1,073 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas, residential schools for girls in backward areas, and 655 co-ed residential schools for homeless and street children will be set up.         
	The human resource development ministry had proposed to open the Kasturba Balika Vidyalayas and residential schools at a cost of Rs 3,808 crore. While Rs 2,365 crore would be used to set up girls schools, around Rs 1,440 crore would be spent on the residential schools, a ministry official said.         
	The move is aimed at providing schooling to nearly 81 lakh children who have remained out of the system, the majority being girls.        
	The girls schools will come up in all educationally backward blocks. The co-ed residential schools will be opened in geographically remote areas, small hamlets and certain urban pockets to cater to the requirement of street children, child labourers and children of migrant workers.         
	The government has estimated to spend Rs 2.31 lakh crore for the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in the next five years. The Centre will bear 65 per cent of the cost, the states 35 per cent. The government will also provide free uniforms to all girls as well as Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and below-poverty-line children.

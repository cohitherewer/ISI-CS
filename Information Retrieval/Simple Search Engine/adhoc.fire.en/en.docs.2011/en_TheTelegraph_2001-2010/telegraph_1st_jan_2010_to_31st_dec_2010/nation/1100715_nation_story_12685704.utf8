          OUR BUREAU                                        Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi (left) greets SM Krishna at   an informal dinner in Islamabad on Wednesday. Picture by Jay Mandal/ On Assignment    
	New Delhi/Islamabad, July 14: India expects some movement from Pakistan on terrorism, S.M. Krishna said today on his arrival in Islamabad for a visit taking place against the backdrop of David Headleys revelations on 26/11.        
	The foreign minister, who will hold talks with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi tomorrow, described his visit as the beginning of a new journey for the neighbours. It will be the first time since the 2008 Mumbai attack that the foreign ministers will meet on the soil of either of the two countries.        
	The visit marks nearly a year of consistent confidence-building measures by Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Yousaf Raza Gilani in Sharm-el-Sheikh in July 2009 and reinforced on the sidelines of the Saarc summit in Thimphu in April (this year). This is no mean achievement considering the turbulent nature of our relationship, a government official said in Delhi.         
	Some turbulence was felt today, too. Hours before Krishna flew in, home secretary G.K. Pillai accused Pakistans ISI of overseeing the Mumbai attack, saying this had become clear after the interrogation of Headley, the Pakistani-American Lashkar suspect in US custody.        
	In his meetings with Qureshi and top officials, Krishna is expected to seek Pakistans feedback on Headley-related issues raised by home minister P. Chidambaram during his visit to Islamabad last month.         
	I look forward to receiving feedback on the issues raised by our home minister in the context of the interrogation of David Headley regarding the Mumbai attack, the foreign minister said.        
	 Pakistan, he emphasised, cannot find fault with the interrogation of Headley as it was done by the FBI of the US.        
	Kashmir and Afghanistan are also likely to come up during the Krishna-Qureshi discussions.

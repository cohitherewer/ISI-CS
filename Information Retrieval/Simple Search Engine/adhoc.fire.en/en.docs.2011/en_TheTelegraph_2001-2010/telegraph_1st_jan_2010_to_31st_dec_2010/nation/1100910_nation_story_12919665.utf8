                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CPM targets Rahul with Amethi potshot
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Rahul Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: The CPM today hit back at Rahul Gandhi for his criticism of the Bengal government at this weeks Calcutta rally, saying the Gandhi family pocket boroughs of Rae Bareli and Amethi were worse off than Purulia, one of the states poorest districts.        
	A comparison of the socio-economic indicators of Purulia with those in Rae Bareli and Amethi will tell the real story. The number of people below the poverty line in Purulia is 31 per cent compared to 54 per cent in Rae Bareli and Amethi, said an editorial in the latest edition of CPM mouthpiece Peoples Democracy.        
	Rahul had not specifically mentioned Purulia at the September 26 rally but suggested that the central funds meant for poverty alleviation schemes were not reaching the intended beneficiaries in Bengal. The Amethi MP had accused the ruling Left of taking the state backward and perpetuating poverty.        
	The editorial cites development indicators  such as families with electricity, per capita expenditure, and number of vaccinated children  of Rae Bareli-Amethi and Purulia. Sonia Gandhi represents Rae Bareli in the Lok Sabha.         
	The editorial also criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the Supreme Courts order asking the government to distribute foodgrain rotting in godowns among the poor free.

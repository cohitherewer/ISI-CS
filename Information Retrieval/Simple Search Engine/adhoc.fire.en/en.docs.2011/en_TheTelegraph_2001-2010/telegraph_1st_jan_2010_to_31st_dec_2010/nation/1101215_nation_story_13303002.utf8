The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Brand Royals drool over Liz liaison
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Brand Royals drool over Liz liaison
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                              Liz Hurley and Shane Warne      
	Mumbai, Dec. 14: The Rajasthan Royals may or may not play in the Indian Premier Leagues fourth edition, but the franchises brand managers are gung-ho about Elizabeth Hurleys link-up with skipper Shane Warne.        
	Liz has an association with Rajasthan  she wed Arun Nayar at Mehrangarh Fort and turned it into an internationally sought-after wedding destination. As RR captain and coach, Warnie has led from the front. As a couple they have a huge brand value for Rajasthan Royals, a Royals source said today.        
	Hurley and Warne have been flirting on Twitter since July. Both are PR- proficient and know the impact of Twitter as a PR tool. Hope to see more of brand Liz-Shane at IPL and elsewhere. As canny brand promoters, they are expected to make the most of their couplehood, said a Mumbai-based PR guru.        
	The two were first caught on camera kissing at Sake No Hana, a chic Japanese restaurant in the posh St James Court area in London. The fact that they chose to reveal their intimate kiss at the Sake No Hana restaurant, British paparazzis favourite hunting ground, is an open call for tabloid attention, the professional said.        
	Royals has retained player-captain-coach Warne, 41, on a contract worth 1.14 million a year. The two-year deal, with the option for a third season, will make Warne one of the highest paid IPL players, despite his having quit Test cricket in 2007.        
	For us he is a brand besides being a player  his colourful extra-curricular activities add to his profile and now this association with Liz Hurley can be leveraged too if they are game, said the Royals official.        
	The franchise is, however, in a spot of trouble with the cricket board having shown it the door on October 10 because it was not able to give clear details of its shareholding pattern.        
	But a ray of hope emerged for Royals today with Bombay High Court upholding a six-week stay order by an arbitration court hearing arguments between Royals and the BCCI over termination of the franchise.        
	Earlier this year, Royals had tied up with Hampshire to create a new franchise, Royals 2020, to grow their fan base and commercial strength in major cricketing nations.        
	As the international face of Royals 2020 that would turn RR into an international sporting brand Warnie is crucial to us. Brand Hurley would be an added bonus, the official said.        
	Warnie has already used a Twitter message to Hurley to plug a new McDonald burger he endorses. Whats the harm if their joint presence helps in promoting brand RR? he asked.        
	Both Hurley and Warne are great friends of Royals co-owner Shilpa Shetty.        
	Warnie is expected to be in India when the player auctions happen in January, he said.        
	Royals sources close to Warne say the cricketer is taking Hurley home to Australia after Christmas. She will take part in a TV series he hosts and a cancer charity. If all goes well we may invite Liz for IPL, he said.

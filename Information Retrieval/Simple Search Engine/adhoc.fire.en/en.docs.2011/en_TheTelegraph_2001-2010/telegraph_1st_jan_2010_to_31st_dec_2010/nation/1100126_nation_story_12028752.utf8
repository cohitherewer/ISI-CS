          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: The case had seemed simple enough: a neighbourhood youth kidnapping a 17-year-old girl he had been eyeing when she stepped out to buy samosas.        
	Only, it turned out that the same girl had earlier been kidnapped by another man, who had to pay her father a neat sum to stay out of jail.        
	A Delhi court today acquitted Zakir after his counsel furnished an old FIR to argue that Jaya (name changed) had made a habit of being taken away by young men, whom his father would threaten with jail unless they paid up.        
	The FIR also showed that Jayas age had over the years stuck stubbornly to 17  making her a minor  as she apparently kept repeating her femme fatale trick.        
	Jayas father, a junk dealer, had lodged an FIR in July 2007 claiming his 17-year-old daughter had gone missing and that he suspected Zakir. The police nabbed the duo from New Delhi railway station and arrested the young man.        
	In court, Zakir alleged he had been trapped, as others had been before him.        
	Jaya was involved with another man called Aksar, and she and her father had threatened (to get him thrown in jail) if he didnt pay up. Aksar paid up and the matter was settled. This was in 2004, Zakir told the district judge, according to court documents.        
	Then she made it clear to me that she wanted to have an affair, and when I declined she wrote to me and gave me her photographs. When her father came to know about this, he demanded money from me. When I refused he brought the police and beat me up.        
	Zakir claimed Jaya had virtually dragged him to the railway station.        
	The defence lawyer then furnished the 2004 FIR, in which Jaya had alleged Aksar had abducted her on her way to buy a pen, only to later withdraw the complaint.        
	The judge said Jayas claim of innocence does not inspire confidence in view of her conduct.        
	She was taken from a crowded place to another densely populated railway station but never made any hue and cry.        
	The court added that Jayas school certificate showed she was above 18 when she was allegedly kidnapped by Zakir. If the 2004 FIR was right about her age, she would have been at least 20 by July 2007.

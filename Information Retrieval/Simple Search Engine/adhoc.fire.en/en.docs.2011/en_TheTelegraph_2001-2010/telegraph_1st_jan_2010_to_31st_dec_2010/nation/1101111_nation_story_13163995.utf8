The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangh ends a tradition

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Nov. 10: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat joined a sit-in today to protest the attempt to brand his organisation a terrorist outfit, breaking an unwritten Sangh norm that had so far kept its chiefs away from public demonstrations.        
	Sources said the sarsanghchalaks decision to take part in Lucknows Gandhi Maidan rally was also meant to convey a message to the faction-ridden BJP organisation in Uttar Pradesh, a former bastion where the party has been steadily losing base.        
	The buzz in BJP circles is that one reason Bhagwat staged the demonstration in Lucknow and not Delhi was to inspire the party and tell its leaders to bury their differences.        
	Bhagwat  who joined over 25 Sangh pracharaks at the rally, part of a countrywide agitation against the alleged implication of senior leaders like Indresh Kumar in the Ajmer blast  said he would take the unfounded allegations to the people.        
	I am hitting the road to agitate against the attempt to brand the RSS a terror outfit, he said, though he made it clear public protests were neither the nature nor the work culture of his organisation.        
	For the first time in the history of the organisation, a sarsanghchalak has not only attended a dharna but also addressed the meeting as a conspiracy was being hatched to tag terrorism with the RSS, he said.        
	Sources said the Sangh chief would remain in Lucknow till November 17 to discuss with pracharaks and BJP leaders ways to counter the conspiracy.        
	Todays rally came weeks after Indresh, a Sangh national executive member, figured in the chargesheet in the 2007 Ajmer blast. The chargesheet also said seven other Hindu radical leaders met secretly to plot the Ajmer attack and several other blasts.        
	Early last month, Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi had dubbed the RSS a fanatical organisation that was in no way different from the banned Simi as both held fundamentalist views.        
	Bhagwat bristled at the parallel. I am not going to accept this. We will go to the people and also seek legal remedy, he said. Terror is alien to our culture. We always seek to integrate people.        
	As he spoke, Bhagwat kept looking at BJP leaders Lalji Tandon, Lucknow MP Kalraj Mishra and state unit chief S.P. Shahi who sat a few hundred metres away. BJP sources said Bhagwat was probably trying to convey that they should have started the agitation without waiting for the Sangh chief to come down.

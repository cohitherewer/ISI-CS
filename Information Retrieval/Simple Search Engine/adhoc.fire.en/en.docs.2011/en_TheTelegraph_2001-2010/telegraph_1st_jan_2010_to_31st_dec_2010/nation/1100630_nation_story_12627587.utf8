          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                         Manoj Pradhan      
	Bhubaneswar, June 29: Orissa BJP legislator Manoj Pradhan was sentenced today to seven years rigorous imprisonment over the death of a Christian during the Kandhamal riots, the first conviction of the jailed MLA who had been slapped with 14 cases.        
	The judicial process will take some time to reach a definite conclusion because the MLA has the option of appeal but the conviction will help chief minister Naveen Patnaik feel justified that he dumped his ally before the Lok Sabha polls.        
	A fast-track court convicted the MLA from G Udaygiri in the case involving the murder of Parikshit Digal, who was killed on the evening of August 27, 2008, during the violence against Christians that came to be known as the Kandhamal riots.        
	The communal violence had broken out following the murder of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and four of his associates on August 23 at the Jalespeta Ashram in Kandhamal.         
	Pradhan, who got elected from jail where he is an undertrial, was a disciple of the VHP leader.        
	Delivering the judgment at Phulbani, around 210 km from the state capital, additional sessions judge Sobhan Kumar Dash also imposed a fine of Rs 6,000 on Pradhan.         
	Pradhan, who is lodged in the Phulbani district jail, today denied the allegations. The MLA said he accepted the court verdict but would file an appeal in the high court. An appeal can be filed within 30 days from the date of conviction.         
	As many as 14 cases had been filed against the Pradhan in connection with Kandhamal riots, out of which he has been acquitted in seven. Of the remaining seven cases, three relate to murder and four to torching of churches and houses. Another person named Prafulla Mallick was also convicted and awarded the same sentence.         
	Convictions that carry prison sentences above two years can lead to disqualification. However, according to lawyer Pitambar Acharya, Pradhan will not be disqualified for three months of the appeal period.         
	Politicians usually contend that disqualification should not apply till all legal options, including an appeal before the Supreme Court, are exhausted.        
	State BJP spokesperson Ashok Sahu stressed on the appeal option. Its a fit case for appeal in the high court. We will go in for appeal in the high court, he said.        
	If the ruling BJD, which had parted ways with the BJP over several issues that included the riots, felt vindicated, it did not betray such an emotion.         
	Our party believes that the law will take its own course. We have nothing more to say on this at this moment, said senior BJD leader R.N. Pani.         
	The Archbishop of Bhubaneswar-Cuttack Diocese, Raphael Cheenath, hailed the verdict. This is the judgment which we had been waiting for since a long time. This gives an occasion to repose faith in the judiciary, he said.We will pursue the case with vigour in the appellate court, said government pleader Bijoy Krishna Patnaik.         
	Altogether, 891 criminal cases had been registered against more than 5,500 persons in connection with the Kandhamal riots, out of which 119 cases have been disposed of so far. Nearly 150 accused have been convicted, while 636 have been acquitted.

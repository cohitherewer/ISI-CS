          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 12: The NCP has trumped senior partner Congress in three of four Maharashtra civic bodies, while Raj Thackerays MNS has failed to repeat the damage it had caused to the Sena-BJP in last Octobers state polls.        
	The results of Sundays polls to the Navi Mumbai, Aurangabad, Ambernath and Badlapur municipalities  the first vote in the state after the Assembly elections  were announced today. They created a flutter in the Congress, which heads the states ruling coalition with Sharad Pawars NCP the junior partner.        
	The blow was particularly hard for Raj, who had drawn big crowds at his rallies for the civic polls but did not see the apparent support reflected in the results. In the showpiece Navi Mumbai civic body, his party drew a blank.        
	The Congress too took its hardest hit in Navi Mumbai: it finished third, behind winner NCP and the Sena-BJP. While the Congress and the NCP had a tie-up in the other three civic bodies, the partners fought the polls in Navi Mumbai separately, largely because of the animosity between local party units.        
	The NCP won 55 seats, up by seven from 2005, while the Congress bagged 13, suffering a loss of two seats. The Shiv Sena won 16 but ally BJP could secure only one. Four seats went to Independents.        
	In Ambernath and Badlapur too, the NCP did better than the Congress.        
	The only exception to the trend was seen in Aurangabad, where the Congress put up a better performance than its partner.        
	But here, the Sena-BJP coalition won, retaining its 22-year-old grip on the civic body.

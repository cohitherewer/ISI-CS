The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Turf attacked, BJP stands   by Centre
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Turf attacked, BJP stands   by Centre
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                    
	New Delhi, April 6: The BJP has refrained from playing politics over the Dantewada attack and said it would walk shoulder-to-shoulder with the Congress-led Centre in the fight against the Maoists.        
	The party refused to engage in political grandstanding, aware that its own government in Chhattisgarh was as vulnerable to blame as the Centre if there was an attempt to fix responsibility for failure.        
	The government must launch an all-out offensive. The BJP would like to state that this should be nothing less than a fight to the finish. The political class can debate and discuss the (Maoist) issue in Parliament but there is absolutely no scope for debate and talks with the Naxalites, party spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said today.        
	Addressing the media, Rudy said the BJP would stand by the government and by all measures and steps taken by the Centre, independently or jointly (with the state government).        
	He said that with roughly half the districts gripped by the Naxalite problem, the BJP did not see it as a political issue. A war against India is being waged on its borders. There is a war within with the Naxalites and the country is affected by it. We do not see the (Dantewada) incident as a solitary one. The country is angry about it. We have to hit them (the Maoists) hard, Rudy added.        
	His colleague Arun Jaitley, the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, said the BJPs commitment to its nationalist ideology was evident from its refusal to politicise the attack.        
	Speaking on the BJPs foundation day, Jaitley, however, did try to score brownie points over the Congress.        
	If we wished to politicise it (the attack), we could have criticised the Congresss policy failures. But our nationalist ideology will not allow it because the countrys integrity and unity are directly threatened. Our Congress friends spoke to these people (the Maoists) before the Jharkhand elections. They spoke to them in Andhra. The opposition to (anti-Maoist peoples militia) Salwa Judum was another example of vote-bank politics, Jaitley said.        
	A little later he claimed that while the Vajpayee government, underpinned on nationalist ideology, had reined in the rebels, their strength had kept growing in the UPA regimes that followed. If we were influenced by politics, I would have improvised on P. Chidambarams remark on the West Bengal chief minister and asserted that the buck stops at the home ministers chair, Jaitley said.        
	But there is no need to overstate this at this point. Because, when parliamentary democracy is threatened, the government should be encouraged to take the strongest steps and we will walk shoulder-to-shoulder with them.

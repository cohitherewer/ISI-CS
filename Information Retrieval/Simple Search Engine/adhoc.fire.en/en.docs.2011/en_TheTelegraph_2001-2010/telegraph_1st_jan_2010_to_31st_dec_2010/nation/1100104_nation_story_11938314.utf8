                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Trains run late, Bihar shivers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Delayed by hours                                  
	Patna, Jan. 3: The sun peeped out feebly for a while this noon but failed to counter the chilly impact of icy winds sweeping across Bihar and the Gangetic plains.        
	Long distance trains, battling thick fog and low visibility on the New Delhi-Allahabad-Mughalsarai-Patna route have been running eight to 10 hours late. Shops shut down and traffic goes off roads after sunset every evening, forcing people indoors.        
	Following train accidents at Etawah and Kanpur yesterday, coupled with fog, low visibility and cold wave, the railway traffic on the Patna-New Delhi sector has been badly affected.         
	Sources in East Central Railway said the New Delhi-Patna Shramjivi Express, Sampurna Kranti Express, Lal Quila Express besides several other trains were running eight to 10 hours late.        
	Schools in Bihar, which were scheduled to open on Monday after winter vacations, have been ordered to stay closed for the next two days.        
	The meteorological office predicted that the cold wave would continue for two days. The situation in north Bihar along the river Ganga is worse, with Muzaffarpur and Purnea recording minimum temperatures of six and seven degrees Celsius, respectively.        
	Patna recorded 84 per cent humidity last evening and the situation is not likely to improve in the next couple of days.         
	The director of the meteorological office here, S.I. Lashkar, said: The icy winds from the snow capped Himalayas are entering the northern Indian planes causing debilitating cold wave in large parts of northern India. The clouds in the sky are not allowing sun rays to hit the earth in these parts.        
	The state administration has organised bonfires at several places in the Bihar capital as well as other cities and towns to let street and slum dwellers keep themselves warm.         
	According to reports reaching here, people battling the cold wave in the states hinterlands, too, have suspended work to irrigate their farms for rabi crops. But they are finding it hard to save cattle in what is described as the worst cold wave in a decade.

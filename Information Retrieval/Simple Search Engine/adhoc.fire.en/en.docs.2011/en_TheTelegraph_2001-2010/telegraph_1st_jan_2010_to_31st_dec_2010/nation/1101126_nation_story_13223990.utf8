	Nov. 25: Activists of Assams largest student body stoned and vandalised Vishal Mega Mart malls in four cities today, following up on accusations that the retail chain had leaked to the media the tapes of an alleged extortion demand.        
	Customers were trapped between the vandals inside the stores and the stone-throwers outside.        
	The attacks by the All Assam Students Union (Aasu) came at places far removed from one another  Guwahati, Tezpur, Jorhat and Dibrugarh  suggesting centralised planning.        
	A TV channel had recently aired audiotapes of a phone conversation that purportedly showed Aasu adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya demanding money by way of donation.        
	Aasu had asked Vishal stores to down shutters yesterday and not to open till the retail chain apologised for the media leak. But many of the stores had ignored the diktat.        
	Groups of Aasu activists entered the outlets posing as customers soon after they opened this morning. At a fixed hour, their associates began throwing stones from outside, smashing the glass doors and windows. That was the cue for those inside to start damaging wares and furniture.        
	The attack on the Vishal mall on Assam Trunk Road in Guwahati began around 12.20pm despite a strong police picket outside. Some policemen were seen patting the students to cajole them to leave.        
	Almost all commercial establishments nearby downed shutters immediately but opened later in the day.        
	I was inside the shop with my daughter, said Ritu Hazarika, a homemaker who was trapped for more than half an hour. Suddenly, some youths started damaging whatever they could lay their hands on. I was scared and wanted to run out of the place but some boys were throwing stones from outside too.        
	Vishal sources said senior company officials were heading to Guwahati to hold talks with Aasu. A police baton-charge injured two Aasu youths in Dibrugarh, and 22 student activists were arrested in Tezpur. Aasu said the agitation would continue till Vishal apologised.

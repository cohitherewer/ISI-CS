The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish snub to Modi and Varun
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitish snub to Modi and Varun
          J.P. YADAV                           Nitish Kumar                                  
	New Delhi, May 27: Nitish Kumar has put alliance partner BJP in a bind by refusing to attend the partys Bihar Swabhiman rally next month at Patnas Gandhi Maidan.        
	The Bihar chief minister has conveyed his reservations over sharing the dais with Gujarat counterpart Narendra Modi and Varun Gandhi  the proposed star speakers at the June 13 rally on the concluding day of the BJPs national executive meeting in Patna.         
	Sources said the Janata Dal (United) leader had communicated his reservations to the BJP brass along with a request that in an election year it would be in the interest of the coalition government if the ally didnt hold the rally to be addressed by communal scarred leaders.         
	The BJP has christened the rally Bihar Swabhiman  Bihari dignity being a pet theme of Kumar  and wants him to attend it to showcase the bond between the ruling partners.         
	After Kumars refusal, the BJP is learnt to be looking for a way out as the JD(U) is among the few valued NDA partners.                        Modi and Varun      
	The sources said the options being discussed included cancelling the public meeting or not allowing Modi and Varun to speak at the rally. They said BJP president Nitin Gadkaris dog barb at Lalu Prasad could also be used as an excuse to cancel the rally as the RJD has already threatened to organise a strong protest.         
	Gadkari had said Lalu Prasad and Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav were licking Sonia Gandhis feet like dogs, but later apologised.        
	The BJP leadership had planned its national executive meeting in Patna on June 12-13 in a bid to strengthen the party in Bihar and draw up strategies ahead of the Assembly polls due in October-November.        
	But Kumars reservations are understandable as his government has painstakingly cultivated the support of the substantial  around 16-17 per cent  Muslim population in the state. The NDAs impressive performance in the general election last year was attributed to the support of Muslims and extremely backward sections.         
	In the past, Kumar had successfully used his influence on top BJP leaders to block the entry of the two leaders. In the run-up to the last Lok Sabha polls, Modi had toured the country but kept away from Bihar at Kumars insistence.        
	When Modi had posed before cameras holding Kumars hand at an NDA rally in Ludhiana, the JD(U) leader had clarified: What can I do if he (Modi) grabs my hand?         
	A section in the BJP, however, is not ready to give in to the ally this time. These leaders say Kumar has already dwarfed the party in Bihar and if it succumbs this time, it would demoralise the cadres. We should not succumb. Narendra Modi is among the best chief ministers in the country. Is he going to spread communal riots in Bihar? Nitish Kumar is free not to attend the rally, said a BJP leader.

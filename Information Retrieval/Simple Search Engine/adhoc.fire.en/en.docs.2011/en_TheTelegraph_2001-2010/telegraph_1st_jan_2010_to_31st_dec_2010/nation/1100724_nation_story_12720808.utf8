The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Homemaker a non-worker? Gender bias, says SC

          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, July 23: The Supreme Court has objected to the census listing homemakers as non-workers on a par with beggars, prostitutes and prisoners, and called for laws to quantify their contribution to the economy.        
	This approach of equating women who are homemakers with beggars, prostitutes and prisoners as economically non-productive workers betrays a totally insensitive and callous approach towards dignity of labour and is also clearly indicative of a strong gender bias against women, a two-judge bench said in a judgment yesterday.        
	The apex court expressed the hope that in the on-going census, this will be corrected, and more than doubled the compensation to be paid to the family of a homemaker killed in a road accident. A tribunal and Allahabad High Court had quantified her contribution to the family at Rs 1,250 a month as a non-earning member of the family under the motor vehicles act. On the basis of that, they had fixed the amount at Rs 2.5 lakh.        
	The apex court said the sum was too small and reflective of the gender bias in the system. It enhanced the compensation to Rs 6 lakh and directed the insurance company to also pay 6 per cent interest. The husband will get another Rs 50,000 in legal costs.         
	If we take these (household) services for granted and do not attach any value to this, this may escalate unforeseen costs in terms of deterioration of both human capabilities and the social fabric. We forget that women could study or do a job in the time they devote to their families, the bench said.        
	The bench stressed the need for a separate legislation to ensure parity in such payouts.  Time has come for Parliament (to pass a law) for properly assessing the value of homemakers and householders work and amend the (motor vehicles) act and other related laws to give compensation when the victim is a woman and a homemaker.        
	The court pointed out there was a distinct bias against women in welfare laws and even judicial verdicts despite a clear mandate to all authorities to give up discrimination on the ground of gender. It was time to change this colonial mindset and draw up gender-equal laws, including amendments to marriage laws, the court said.        
	Renu Agrawal, wife of a government employee Arun Kumar Agarwal, died after their car was hit by a truck. The husband filed a petition seeking a compensation of Rs 19.2 lakh. He said Renu was only 39 years old and his life had become miserable after her death.         
	The tribunal quantified the sum at Rs 2,50,000. It took note of the fact that the husbands income was Rs 15,416 per month and that of the wife, as a non-earning member, Rs 1,250  around 8 per cent of the husbands income.         
	The high court, too, dubbed the amount of Rs 2.5 lakh just and fair.         
	But the Supreme Court said Renus annual earnings of Rs 50,000 from handicrafts and paintings had been ignored.         
	It is not possible to quantify any amount in lieu of services rendered by the wife/mother to the family, husband and children. However, for compensation to dependents, some pecuniary estimate has to be made of the services of the housewife/mother, the apex court said. For this, the term services has to be given a broader meaning and must include attention given by the mother to the son and the husband.

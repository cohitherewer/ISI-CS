	Jhargram, May 29: A day before Bengals worst train tragedy, West Midnapore district police had held a meeting with senior railway officials of the Kharagpur division to warn them of a serious security threat during the Maoist black week that began yesterday.        
	A top railway official conceded the police did alert them but pointed out that such warnings were routine.        
	Yes, the district police administration had issued a security alert. But such alerts are sent to us on a regular basis, this one was no exception. They did not mention any specific threat, said A.P. Mishra, general manager, South Eastern Railways.        
	Moreover, law and order is a state subject and it is up to the district police to ensure the safety of railway tracks.        
	While it is the responsibility of the state government to ensure track security, the railways are also accountable for track safety.        
	At the meeting yesterday, additional superintendent of police P. Santosh and other officials met divisional railway manager Anil Handa to warn of possible Maoist activity on or around tracks.         
	During the meeting, the district police administration clearly asked us to step up surveillance on railway tracks, especially at night. The threat perception was high because the Maoists were observing the black week, a railway official told The Telegraph.        
	They categorically asked us to intensify patrolling of tracks by gangmen with the help of armed Railway Protection Force personnel.        
	However, on the night of the tragedy, no patrolling was carried out by gangmen. One pilot engine passed the spot around 10.40pm. Several trains followed the engine after gaps of 30 to 40 minutes.        
	A district police official said it took barely five to 10 minutes for a group of men to remove Pandrol clips that tie the sleepers to the tracks. They simply have to hit the clips with a hammer and chisel them out.        
	Railway officials of the Kharagpur division  under which Rajabandh, the site of the mishap, falls  said gangmen had been facing threats from Maoists who had repeatedly asked them not to patrol the tracks at night with lights.        
	There are not enough RPF personnel to guard the gangmen while they are on patrol. If there was such a serious security threat, the joint forces should have protected the tracks, said a railway official.        
	West Midnapore SP Manoj Kumar Verma said police and railway officials regularly co-ordinated over alerts.         
	We are regularly in touch for co-ordination. When we get intelligence inputs on Maoist activity that can hurt the railways, we convey the information immediately, Verma said.        
	The district police chief said all Maoist-related information in the region is passed on to the railways. During Maoist bandhs or blockades or those called by the (rebel-backed) Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, or during their so-called black days, the railways are specially alerted. There was no exception this time, he added.        
	Verma said over the past few months, Maoist activity around railway property had been restricted to areas around Sardiha, Banstala and Jhargram stations, all near Kharagpur. The tragedy had struck a few kilometres from Sardiha.        
	At these stations we had a lot of police presence, even on that day. The personnel marched down the tracks and had covered all surrounding areas, Verma added.         
	As a result, the Maoists went further down the tracks, far from Sardiha station. This had been an undisturbed area so far, hence there was no special provision for surveillance there.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, March 26: A government doctor accused of fabricating evidence of rape in the Shopian case and later featuring in an MMS clip purportedly showing him having sex in office has been arrested for the second offence.        
	Dr Ghulam Sofi, suspended as chief medical officer of Pulwama last week after the sex scandal broke, has been charged with rape and remanded in judicial custody till April 5. Police have identified the woman as a job seeker.        
	Pulwama police chief Kifayat Hyder said the doctor was arrested yesterday, produced in court and sent to central jail. We have also identified the woman in the (MMS) clip. We are investigating the case further. According to Hyder, if a police officer or doctor has sex at the workplace, the offence amounts to rape.        
	People took to the streets in Pulwama after Friday prayers today, demanding stern punishment for the doctor.         
	The clip surfaced some time back but the police lodged the rape case, under Section 376 (D) of Kashmirs Ranbir Penal Code, last week.               
	The government order suspending Sofi was also issued the same day.        
	The clip was apparently filmed with a cellphone and later circulated among newspersons. There are reports an employee in the health department shot it, and unconfirmed reports said he was blackmailing the doctor.        
	Sofi is among the six doctors chargesheeted by the CBI  they got bail later  for allegedly producing slides not prepared from the vaginal smears of the two women allegedly raped and murdered in Shopian last year. Based on the slides, the forensic science laboratory Srinagar had confirmed that the two women were raped.        
	Kashmir had witnessed massive protests after the bodies of the women, sisters-in-law Neelofar and Asiya, were recovered from a stream on May 30, 2009, amid allegations security forces had raped and killed them. The central probe agency later came out with a report which said that the two had died after drowning.

	New Delhi, Dec. 21: President Pratibha Patil today approved the selection of Amitabh Mattoo as the first vice-chancellor of the Central University of Jammu.        
	The human resource ministry had recommended Mattoos name this April but the matter hung in balance because of opposition from the BJP, Panthers Party and the Jammu Morcha.        
	The parties claimed there had been corruption allegations against him when he was vice-chancellor of a state university in Jammu between 2002 and 2008. They demanded that a person from the Dogra community be made VC.        
	The state government also had opposed Mattoos appointment for fear it might create a law and order problem.        
	The Presidents secretariat twice sought clarification from the HRD ministry on Mattoo. The ministry maintained he had been selected on the basis of academic merit and should be appointed to the post. Mattoo has been a member of the National Knowledge Commission, an advisory panel to the Prime Minister. He teaches international politics at JNU.        
	The Central University of Jammu was created by an amendment to the Central Universities Act, 2009. The original act provided for creation of 15 varsities across the country, including one Central University of Jammu and Kashmir.        
	But the people of Jammu demanded a separate university for the region, after which the Centre promulgated an ordinance to create one.

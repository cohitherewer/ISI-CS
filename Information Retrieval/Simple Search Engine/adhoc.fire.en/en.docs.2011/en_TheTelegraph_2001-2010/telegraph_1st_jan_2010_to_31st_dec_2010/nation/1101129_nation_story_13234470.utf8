          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Jaganmohan Reddy                                  
	Hyderabad, Nov. 28: Y.S. Rajashekhar Reddys younger brother Vivekananda Reddy today met Sonia Gandhi in Delhi to plead leniency for his rebel nephew Jaganmohan but received no encouraging answer.        
	According to state Congress sources who accompanied Vivekananda, Sonia told him: Bahut ho gaya hai (enough is enough); Jagan has become overactive.        
	The sources interpreted this as a signal that Jagan must lie low for sometime if he wished to avoid drastic action. Observers, however, believe that Vivekananda, a Congress member of the state legislative council, would not have been displeased with Sonias response.        
	There is speculation that the Congress central leadership is trying to entice malcontents away from the Jagan camp by offering them berths in the new state cabinet that is to be sworn in on Wednesday. Vivekanandas supporters expect him to be among the picks.        
	Despite being an MP or state legislator for two decades, Vivekananda has never been given any important party post, let alone a ministership, even when his late brother was in power. After the brief afternoon meeting with Sonia today, he went incommunicado, switching his mobile off.        
	New chief minister Kiran Kumar Reddy, whose elevation reflects the high commands efforts to cut Jagan down to size, today told reporters in Delhi that Sonia and Pranab Mukherjee had cleared his cabinet list and he would return to Hyderabad tonight.        
	He, however, refused to confirm a berth for Vivekananda, merely saying all groups had been taken care of. But he was ready with a snub for Jagan, replying to a question: I do not see Jagan as a group leader but only as an MP.        
	Sources said Vivekananda, who is in his mid-fifties, was pressured by Jagans mother to plead her sons case in Delhi. The family has always taken Vivekananda for granted, forcing him to part with his MP or MLA seat from Kadapa whenever YSR needed either.        
	In 2005, Vivekananda, then Kadapa MP, was asked to resign so that Jagan could enter active politics. Sonia had scuttled the move then, sniffing a plan by YSR to project his son as his successor. Jagan had to wait till the 2009 elections to become an MP.        
	Vivekananda, however, was made to resign his MPs post several months before the 2009 elections and was compensated with membership of the state legislative council, a far less prestigious post.        
	Jagan supporters have been lambasting Vivekananda for his newfound proximity to Kiran Reddy. It appears that no Jagan loyalist would be accommodated in the new cabinet, nor would too many senior leaders make it.        
	We dont want him to grumble like (former chief minister) Rosaiah about non-cooperative ministers whom he had to borrow from YSRs cabinet, said a senior AICC member who was part of the exercise to choose the cabinet.        
	The high command has decided that the deputy chief ministers post will be revived, after two decades, and given to a leader from Telangana. The contenders are irrigation minister Ponnala Lakshmaiah, information minister Geeta Reddy and marketing minister Damodar Raj Narasimha.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nobel test for biggest democracy India

          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: India is debating whether it should attend Fridays ceremony in Oslo at which the Nobel Peace Prize will be conferred on Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo.        
	The Chinese government, which has jailed Liu for 11 years for his works that advocate democracy, does not want India to attend the event. It has protested the Nobel Committees decision to award Liu, saying: Liu Xiaobo is a criminal who has been sentenced by Chinese judicial departments for violating Chinese law.        
	The Chinese government has appealed to all countries to boycott the ceremony. A foreign ministry spokesperson claimed in Beijing today that 100 countries had decided to skip the ceremony but did not name them.        
	However, India will have to decide whether, as the worlds biggest democracy, it will support freedom of speech and expression or whether it will give primacy to self-interest.        
	If reports from Oslo are to be believed, New Delhi has already made its decision. PTI quoted Torill Johansen, the secretary to the Nobel Committee, as claiming India was one of 44 countries that had confirmed its participation.        
	Indias envoy to Norway is scheduled to attend the ceremony, the report said. But foreign ministry officials in New Delhi remained tight-lipped.        
	Indias problems are compounded as Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is visiting New Delhi from December 15-17. Besides, the country needs Beijing to pipe down on issues such as the boundary dispute and its views on Jammu and Kashmir.        
	According to the Nobel Committee, 44 embassies have indicated that they will be represented at the ceremony, two (Algeria and Sri Lanka) have not replied, and 19 have for various reasons declined our invitations.        
	It is unclear what the remainder of the 192 UN member states has decided.        
	The 19 countries that have declined the invitation are China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Columbia, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Serbia, Iraq, Iran, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Philippines, Egypt, Sudan, Ukraine, Cuba and Morocco.        
	These countries are either Chinas neighbours, allies or have fledgling democratic traditions. However, if what a Nobel Committee official said is true, India has decided to stand up for democratic traditions with Western countries.        
	But Beijing is taking the issue seriously. We are against anyone making an issue of Liu Xiaobo. Any attempt to challenge Chinas judicial system or change Chinas development path cannot succeed, a foreign ministry spokesperson said today.        
	I would like to say to those at the Nobel committee they are orchestrating an anti-China farce by themselves.

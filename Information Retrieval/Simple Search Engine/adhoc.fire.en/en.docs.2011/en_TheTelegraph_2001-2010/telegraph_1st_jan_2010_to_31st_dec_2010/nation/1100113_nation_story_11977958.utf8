          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi/Ahmedabad, Jan. 12: The Supreme Court today said Gujarat police had been less than honest in identifying policemen responsible for the 2005 fake encounter death of Sohrabuddin Sheikh, before handing over the case to the CBI for a fresh investigation.        
	Sheikh, his wife Kausar Bi and another eyewitness were travelling in a bus from Hyderabad to Sangli (Maharashtra) in November 2005 when they were picked up by the police.         
	They were kept in a farmhouse for a few days after which Sheikh was killed in an alleged staged encounter carried out by the Anti-Terrorist Squad led by now jailed IPS officer D.G. Vanzara on November 26, 2005, on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.         
	It was billed as a joint operation by Gujarat and Rajasthan police. Vanzara had claimed that Sohrabuddin, a dreaded terrorist, had come on a two-wheeler to kill chief minister Narendra Modi.        
	Three IPS officers  Vanzara, R.K. Pandian and M.N. Dinesh  and deputy superintendent Narendra Amin were held responsible for the death of Sheikh. All four were arrested and are lodged in the Sabarmati central jail.         
	Investigation shall be transferred to the CBI authorities for proper and thorough investigation, a two-judge bench said.         
	The court picked several holes in the chargesheet, saying it did not reveal the identity of police personnel of Andhra who were with Gujarat police when Sohrabuddin was picked up and nor did it say what happened to Kausar Bi.

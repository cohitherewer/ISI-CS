The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Coimbatore line to corner Karat after poll rout
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Coimbatore line to corner Karat after poll rout
          J.P. YADAV                                            
	New Delhi, June 6: The CPM politburo meeting that ended today started discussions not only on the Bengal civic poll rout but also on the way Prakash Karat had altered the line adopted by the previous party congress by withdrawing support to UPA I.        
	The second issue, sources said, reflects an attempt by the party general secretarys critics to corner him in an indirect way over the continuing poll debacles in Bengal.        
	The next politburo meeting on July 3-4 will resume discussing both issues. Sources said Karat would be put in the dock not directly over the civic poll outcome but on the wider issue of altering the political line endorsed by the Coimbatore party congress in March-April 2008.        
	That line had spoken of defeating the communal forces led by the BJP while standing beside the Congress to strengthen the secular forces and pressure the UPA into adopting pro-people measures.        
	The Karat camp, which blames the Bengal CPM and its government for the electoral routs in the state, has been triumphantly arguing that national factors cannot be held responsible for the poor civic poll results.        
	Pushed to the back foot for now, the opposite camp hopes the review of Karats dumping of UPA I in July 2008 would show how it had paved the way for an Opposition tie-up in Bengal and therefore the poll setbacks.        
	The politburo has completed the first round of discussion to prepare the document on the review of the implementation of the political line adopted in the last party congress at Coimbatore in 2008, Sitaram Yechury told reporters at the end of the two-day politburo meeting.        
	Sources said that even after intense discussion, the politburo failed to arrive at a consensus on a draft of the review, so it was decided to take it up at the next meeting.        
	The sources said the Bengal leadership was lying low for now and preparing a detailed review of the municipal poll results. It will take on the central leadership at the extended central committee meeting at Vijayawada in August.        
	The party congress, held every three years, cannot take place in mid-2011 because of the Bengal Assembly polls. So, the party will hold an extended central committee meeting that will be attended by nearly 400 delegates, including 85 central committee and 275 state committee members  giving it half the attendance of a party congress.        
	Karats critics are dubbing it a mini-party congress that is likely to be a stormy one.        
	A CPM leader known as a Karat critic said: We failed to pull down the Congress-led government (by pulling out of the UPA), and the third front experiment too failed. Apart from political losses we did not get anything.        
	He added that the central leadership should be held accountable for its mistakes.        
	Barb at Trinamul        
	The CPM today accused Trinamul Congress ministers of inciting post-poll violence in Bengal and asked the Prime Minister to restrain them.        
	The central government should look into the role played by its own cabinet minister in inciting such violence, a politburo statement said without naming anyone. Mamata Banerjee is the lone cabinet minister from Trinamul.        
	Asked to name the Union ministers, Yechury said: Who else but the Trinamul members? They have been supporting the Maoists and now they are inciting violence.

	New Delhi, March 4: Handloom workers need to learn the trade while they are still children, much like many singers who train early in life, Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav said today, offering what verged on a justification for banned child labour.         
	Yadav, who was a textile minister in the NDA government, said: Bismillah Khan and Pandit Ravi Shankar learnt how to sing when they were younger than five. Handloom workers have to start working young when fingers are nimble.

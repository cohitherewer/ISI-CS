The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Signal for Bengal polls on schedule
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Signal for Bengal polls on schedule
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 7: Checks on electronic voting machines (EVMs) to be used in the Bengal polls will begin later this month and end in February, the Election Commission said today, suggesting voting will be held on schedule in May-June.        
	Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee had been demanding that the elections be brought forward.         
	The checks will take 30 to 35 days. If the process begins around December-end, it will not be over before the end of January or early February, said Sunil Kumar Gupta, the states chief electoral officer. Other poll officials said the EVMs being readied by early February is the usual practice for elections around May.        
	The electoral rolls will be published on January 5. Speculation had been rife that the polls could be held between January 7 and February 20 despite assertions by chief election commissioner S.Y. Qureshi that the polls would not be advanced.        
	The basis of the speculation was that elections can be announced 48 hours after the publication of the electoral rolls. The other factor being mentioned was the Madhyamik exams in the state are scheduled to start after February 20. So any early poll will have to be wrapped up before the date.

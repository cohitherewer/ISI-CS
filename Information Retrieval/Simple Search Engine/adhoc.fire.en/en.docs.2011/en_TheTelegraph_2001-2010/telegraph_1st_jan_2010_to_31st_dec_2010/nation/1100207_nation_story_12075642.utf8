	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 6: Church leaders today criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and chief minister Naveen Patnaik for their failure to fulfil their promise of providing adequate compensation to the Kandhamal riot victims.        
	Both of them had promised to provide adequate compensation for the damages caused during the 2008 communal violence. But the victims have not been adequately compensated, archbishop of Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese Raphael Cheenath said here today.        
	Adequate compensation means if a motorcycle has been burnt, the victim should be given a motorcycle. If my house has been destroyed, I need a house. But that has not been done, rued the senior church leader.        
	The administration, he complained, arbitrarily fixed Rs 50,000 as compensation for completely destroyed houses, even though the reconstruction costs of a simple house was a minimum Rs 85,000. Similarly, the administration categorised fully destroyed houses as partially damaged with a paltry compensation of Rs 20,000.        
	At least 5,347 houses were looted or destroyed by fire during the communal riots in Kandhamal. Besides, several churches and prayer houses were destroyed, said the archbishop.        
	The state government has, however, decided not to compensate any riot- affected religious institutions, though the Supreme Court had directed the government to compensate for all damages, he said.        
	This is a national calamity and demands a special package for the affected people which should include land, income generation, education and healthcare, he said.        
	All Indian Christian Council general secretary John Dayal, who had been in Kandhamal for a week, said: We cant have a situation in which the riot-affected people are forced to live a miserable life. Urgent steps should be taken for restoration of peace and the resettlement of affected people        
	Dismissing the claims of the state and the district administration, Cheenath said human dignity, rights and life of the victims of communal violence were far from normal.        
	Fifteen months after they were uprooted, thousands still live in makeshift shanties along roads and in forests with no seeming hope of rehabilitation, he said.        
	Cheenath, who had earlier filed a petition in the Supreme Court, said he would have no hesitation in approaching the apex court again if the misery of the people wasnt ameliorated. They cannot be allowed to live through another summer and monsoon without a shelter over their heads, he said.        
	Expressing concern over the high rate of acquittals at the fast-track courts set up in Kandhamal to try riot cases, Dayal alleged the victims and witnesses were being coerced and threatened.        
	He demanded setting up of a special investigation team and engagement of independent lawyers to assist special public prosecutors.

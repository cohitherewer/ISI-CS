          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Elephants in a sanctuary in Orissa                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 31: Aggrieved over the forest departments move to curb poaching at Kuldiha elephant sanctuary in Balasore district, a number of armed hunters went on the rampage in the sanctuary, ransacking a guesthouse and manhandling the cook of the guesthouse last evening.        
	Armed with guns and traditional weapons, nearly 300 local villagers, mostly tribal hunters, ran riot inside the sanctuary, spreading panic among the forest department staff. They were angry over the governments move to monitor poaching in the forest, said Sarat Chandra Behera, the ranger of the sanctuary, about 240km from Bhubaneswar.        
	Except the cook, no other staff was present at the guesthouse when the attack took place. The cook received minor injuries. The attackers fled after causing damage to the guesthouse, Behera said.        
	The sanctuary is nearly 10km from Maoist-affected Mayurbhanj district.         
	However, police refuted any Maoist hand behind the attack at Kuldiha sanctuary. We do not see any Maoist role in the attack. The attackers were hunters from nearby villages. We will arrest them soon, Sujit Pradhan, the inspector in charge of Nilagiri police station, said.        
	The forest department, although short-staffed, has launched drives against poachers in a number of areas across the state. In Kuldiha, stress was given on the anti-smuggler campaign, as this time of the year witnesses most of the poaching activities in the sanctuary, which is part of the elephant corridor extending from Jharkhand on one part to Bengal on the other. At least 30 poachers were arrested in the past six months. Last month, we detained three hunters. We also seized guns from their possession. We have been the cracking whip on poachers regularly, Behera said.        
	Significantly, hundreds of Maoists launched a series of attacks at Similipal Tiger Reserve in Mayurbhanj district in April last year. The rebels had then set afire forest beat houses and assaulted tourists and forest officials as well. Movement of tourists has since been restricted in the Similipal forest. The tiger reserve is only 27km from Kuldiha sanctuary, a forest official said.

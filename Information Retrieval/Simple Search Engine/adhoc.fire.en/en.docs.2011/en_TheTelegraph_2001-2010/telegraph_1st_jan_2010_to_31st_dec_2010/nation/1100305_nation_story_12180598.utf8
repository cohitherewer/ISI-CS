	Srinagar, March 4: A young captain about to get married was killed in an encounter with militants in south Kashmir today, the second such army officer to die in over a week in an area said to have been rid of insurgents.        
	Deepak Sharma, 26, who hailed from Rohtak in Haryana, was part of the 42 Rashtriya Rifles squad engaged in the 30-hour gun battle with suspected Hizb-ul Mujahideen militants in Pulwamas Dadsara, a densely populated area around 35km from Srinagar.         
	Four militants also died in the encounter, which began yesterday morning and ended this afternoon. Deepak had killed two of the militants, the army said.        
	Army spokesperson Colonel Vineet Sood said, The young officer was to get married next month and was in the process of applying for leave. His fiancee is also in the army.                         Deepak Sharma      
	The family was making preparations for his marriage. But sadly, we had to inform the family about his death today. It was his first posting in Kashmir. Other army officials said Deepak, who had been commissioned in September 2006, was eagerly waiting for his marriage and had even asked some of his friends in the services to come to the wedding.        
	Three of the militants killed today have been identified as Midha, Shabir and Khalid, who is a top Hizb-ul commander in south Kashmir. Midha and Shabir had been involved in terrorist activities for the past 15 years, the spokesperson said.         
	The fourth militant has not been identified yet.        
	On February 23, Captain Devinder Singh Jass and two army jawans were killed in an encounter in Sopore. Militants have been regaining their foothold in south Kashmir, comprising four districts, not long after security forces had declared large swathes of it insurgency-free.        
	 Over 100 militants are said to be active in Dadsara of Pulwama district.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Subrata Mukherjee                                  
	Calcutta, July 18: Subrata Mukherjees three-decade-old reign at Intucs Bengal unit ended today when the Congresss trade union arm did what it had lacked the gumption to do 10 years ago  sack him for defecting to Mamata Banerjees camp.        
	An assessment that Mukherjees utilities are limited and the slot could be used to rehabilitate a Congress leader also appears to have prompted the decision.        
	Mukherjee had been at the state Intucs helm almost as long as the Left Front has ruled Bengal. The trade union wing today removed him as its state president, a post he has held uninterrupted since 1980, and also as a member.        
	Mukherjee had left the Congress to rejoin the Trinamul Congress just before the May civic elections following the collapse of the Opposition poll alliance.        
	Former state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya will take over as Bengal Intuc chief, Intuc all-India president Sanjeeva Reddy told The Telegraph over the phone from Ranchi.        
	 The Intuc working committee today took a unanimous decision to remove Mukherjee at the concluding session of its two-day conference in Ranchi.        
	Although Reddy put Mukherjees removal down to his switchover to Trinamul, he did not explain why the trade union had not sacked him when Mukherjee had first deserted the Congress to join Mamata in 1999. He had continued as state Intuc chief even after being elected Calcutta mayor in the year 2000.        
	However, senior Intuc leaders said the Congresss renewed strength across the country, including Bengal, had emboldened the leadership to act against Mukherjee.        
	In 2000, the Congress was not what it is today. It was then not in power at the Centre. In Bengal, the Congress was in a shambles, with hordes of party workers flocking to Trinamul following in Subratas footsteps, an Intuc vice-president said.        
	So, we did not dare act against him. But things have changed after last years Lok Sabha polls. Now the party is a force to reckon with. We can well afford disciplinary action against Subrata.        
	An All India Congress Committee leader said from New Delhi that Intucs move had followed a diktat from the high command.         
	Since Manas Bhuniyas appointment as Bengal Congress chief a fortnight ago, the high command had been looking for a key post for Pradip Bhattacharya to rehabilitate him. Bhattacharya (who lost his post as state Congress working president after Bhuniyas elevation) too had conveyed his displeasure to central leaders, he said.        
	Reddy too provided several reasons for Mukherjees removal. During Mukherjees tenure as state Intuc chief, its membership in Bengal had fallen from 12 lakh to six lakh. Besides, he was more interested in pursuing his own political career than in the trade union movement, he alleged.        
	Mukherjee said he could not be removed merely through a resolution of Intucs working committee.        
	I was re-elected state Intuc chief only three years ago by a general council. So, I must be allowed to continue till my tenure ends. I may take legal recourse (against the removal), he said.        
	Bhattacharya appeared happy after being appointed state Intuc chief. Its good that the leadership has rehabilitated me, he said.

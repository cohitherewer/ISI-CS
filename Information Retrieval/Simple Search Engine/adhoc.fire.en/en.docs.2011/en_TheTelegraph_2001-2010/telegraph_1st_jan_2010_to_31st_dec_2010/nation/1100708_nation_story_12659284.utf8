The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ranchi gets its 15 minutes
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ranchi gets its 15 minutes
  - A glimpse of Mr amp; Mrs dhoni, but not for all          AMIT GUPTA                       The couple wave at fans from the house rsquo;s terrace                                
	Ranchi, July 7: They stepped out on their first-floor balcony and waved to the crowd of die-hard fans. They disappeared within 15 minutes.        
	And traffic stood still for an hour.        
	The chance to catch a glimpse of birthday boy Mahendra Singh Dhoni and bride Sakshi Singh Rawat was enough to trigger a wave of unrestrained excitement in his hometown today. Complete with a paparazzi-style car chase by journalists from Birsa Munda Airport to Harmu Housing Colony, home to the star couple.        
	The Team India captain appeared before the impatient fans, waiting since morning, exactly at 2.30pm. He wore his trademark casual look in a purple T-shirt. Sakshi looked demure and pretty in a white salwar-kameez.        
	I told you Dhoni bhaiya will not disappoint us. He is looking so handsome and isnt Sakshi bhabi the perfect match for him? Ashish Kumar, Class VIII student of St Francis School, told a class-mate as Mr and Mrs Dhoni waved, smiling.        
	Fans at the airport hadnt been as lucky, though. They had bought entry tickets for Rs 45 and jostled for a glimpse, but were left disappointed as Mahi was whisked away from the tarmac and escorted out through the rear gate to an SUV that drove the couple home.        
	A few fortunate ones, armed with high-end mobile phones, managed to click pictures of the newly-weds from the first-floor waiting hall at the airport.        
	The Air India flight had landed at 1.50pm, an hour behind schedule, triggering a mad scramble. But the journalists, waiting since 10am, were left frustrated.        
	It was a matter of security and we were not supposed to take chances. Dhoni gets Z-plus security, said a CISF inspector who escorted the captain home.        
	Ashokji, one of Mahis drivers, too was disappointed because he could not ferry the cricketer home. The airport authorities had arranged for Dhonis transport.        
	The prayers of a policewoman, on special duty for Sakshi, too went unanswered. The state armed police constable had wanted to be photographed with Sakshi Devi and requested the photo-journalists present for a close shot.        
	The luckiest person, probably, was Mahis co-passenger B.N. Singh, director (research) with Birsa Agriculture University.        
	They (Dhoni and Sakshi) were flying executive class. Their demeanour was humble. Not for a second did I feel I was travelling with a star, he said.        
	Brother-in-law Gautam Gupta ensured a hassle-free journey for the couple from the airport to Harmu. Gupta later promised journalists a big party but refused to say when or where.

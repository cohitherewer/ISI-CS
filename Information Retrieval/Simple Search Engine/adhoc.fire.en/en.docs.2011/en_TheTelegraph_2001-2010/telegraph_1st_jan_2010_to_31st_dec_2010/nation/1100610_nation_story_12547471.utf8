The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish dinner awaits Modi
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitish dinner awaits Modi
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, June 9: The stage is set for chief minister Nitish Kumar and his Gujarat counterpart Narendra Modi to share a meal at the formers 1 Anne Marg residence during the BJPs two-day national executive meeting beginning here this Saturday.        
	Modi and another firebrand leader Varun Gandhi  who have been at the centre of attack from Nitish  are almost certain to be at the dinner, where the Bihar chief minister has invited his alliance partys national executive members.        
	However, Nitish and his party, the JD(U), are no way related to the meet. It is an internal affair of the BJP, Nitish said, while the JD(U) national spokesman, Shivanand Tiwary, said: It is BJPs decision to hold its meeting in Patna. The JD(U) has nothing to do with that.        
	The JD(U) leaders describe the dinner hosted by the chief minister as a courtesy meet in which all the executive party members of the alliance party have been invited.        
	Keeping its eye on the Muslim votes in Bihar, the JD(U) leadership, particularly Nitish, has attacked Modi and Varun on every available opportunity. Cautious of his pro-Muslim image, Nitish has also shied away from getting photographed with Modi or Varun.        
	A few people, however, think that it is part of a well worked-out strategy, according to which Nitish and Modi stay apart in common interest of the NDA for being in power.         
	In fact, by creating a common perception that he is inimical to Modi and Varun, Nitish  a veteran strategist himself  occupies the space of the secular parties despite staying in alliance with the BJP, said a senior JD(U) leader. Nitishs apparent obsession to show himself different from Modi ensures more Muslim votes for the NDA in Bihar.         
	However, RJD general secretary Ramkripal Yadav wanted the media to read between the lines.         
	Their (Nitish and the Sangh Parivar) proximity is not new. Recently, the RSS organised its national meet in Bihar. Now Modi and Varun are going to have dinner with Nitish, Ramkripal said, explaining the politics behind showing the antagonistic postures by the JD(U) and BJP in Bihar.

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                      The traditional Indian martial arts segment (picture above) was a hit. The directors who put together the performance had to plead with security   agencies for months to allow them to carry traditional weapons for the show. (AFP)                                
	New Delhi, Oct. 14: When Saina Nehwal won gold and took India to second spot in the medals tally, P. Chidambaram was cheering in the stands, the joy no doubt mixed with relief that the Games had been safe.        
	The home minister had paid half-a-dozen visits to all the venues to oversee security arrangements in the run-up. They were all surprise visits. Minutes before his visit, venue commanders would be told he was arriving. No one in the ministry was told, an aide said.         
	Chidambaram and his security team cannot relax just yet: although the Games are over, most foreign teams wont leave until Saturday and the Games Village will close only on October 20.        
	The threat perception to the Games was high as the CIA and European intelligence agencies feared attacks from the Lashkar-e-Toiba and even Sikh militants. On top of that, the organising committee was disorganised and untidy and had failed to integrate with the security apparatus till the last minute.        
	Anticipating problems, the ministry in May 2009 set up an international security liaison group  a first at any Games  which included representatives from the organising committee and the intelligence agencies RAW, Intelligence Bureau and the National Technical Research Organisation, as well as the joint secretaries of the ministries of home, defence and external affairs. Delhi police were represented by a joint commissioner in charge of Commonwealth Games security.        
	The liaison group kept security officials from all participating nations in the loop. It remained a 24x7 single-window mechanism to keep people informed. The security liaison officials were apprehensive but at least assured there was a mechanism for dialogue, a source said.                    
	In addition, as the Intelligence Bureaus Multi-Agency Centre in Delhi and its subsidiaries in the states specifically discussed Games security, any relevant intelligence inputs were shared.        
	With intelligence pouring in from all the states, the liaison group was the central agency that handled security for the event.        
	A 1-lakh-plus force of police, paramilitary and intelligence officials worked to beat the threat to the Games. Gun-toting policemen were posted all over the city. The 2,500 personnel of the CRPF and more than 4,000 of the CISF were especially trained to be polite but the sight of AK-47s cannot be unobtrusive. Army commandos and Indian Air Force technology, too, were at hand to secure the event.        
	The organising committee and its unprofessional lot only added to the confusion, very unlike how professionals in Vancouver or London would perform, a senior government official said. The job was difficult in such a vitiated environment, the official added.        
	That foreign teams, especially New Zealand, Canada, Australia and Britain, had made a lot of noise over security could not have made things easier.

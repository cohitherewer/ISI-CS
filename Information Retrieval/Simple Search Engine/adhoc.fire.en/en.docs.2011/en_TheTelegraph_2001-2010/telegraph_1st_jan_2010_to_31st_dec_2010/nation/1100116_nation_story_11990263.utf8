          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The Congress core committee today cleared a few names for governors posts, including that of national security adviser M.K. Narayanan for Bengal. A formal announcement is expected tomorrow.        
	Sources said former Union home minister Shivraj Patil would be made Punjab governor. Both Patil and Narayanan have apparently given their consent.        
	Shiv Shankar Menon was discussed for the post of national security adviser, a berth filled by Narayanan for the past five years.        
	Shyam Saran too is a contender, but the sources said Menon might be preferred. The name of Sati Lamba, the special envoy to Afghanistan, is also doing the rounds.         
	Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh had discussed the probable names for governors posts separately before the core committee meeting began.        
	One new name that cropped up in the discussions was that of Urmila Patel, for Himachal Pradesh. The incumbent in Shimla, Prabha Rau, is being transferred to Rajasthan.        
	Chhattisgarh governor E.S.L. Narasimhan will be shifted to Andhra Pradesh full-time.        
	 The government feels he has handled the Telangana crisis well after being given temporary charge, and the Prime Minister has decided to continue with him. K. Padmanabhaiah is a contender for Chhattisgarh.        
	The sources said Jharkhand governor K. Sankaranarayanan was likely to receive a huge promotion  he might be sent to Maharashtra. However, leaders from Maharashtra disputed this, saying they had no such intimation and claiming the matter had not been settled.        
	M..H. Farooq, a former Union minister whose name had figured prominently along with that of Santosh Mohan Dev, might replace Sankaranarayanan in Jharkhand.        
	The Congress leadership had been waiting for the auspicious period after Makar Sankranti to take some important decisions.        
	The exercise has started with the governors since the vacancies have to be filled before the January 26 parade.        
	Many governors now hold dual charges  and cant obviously be in both states for the Republic Day flag-hoisting.

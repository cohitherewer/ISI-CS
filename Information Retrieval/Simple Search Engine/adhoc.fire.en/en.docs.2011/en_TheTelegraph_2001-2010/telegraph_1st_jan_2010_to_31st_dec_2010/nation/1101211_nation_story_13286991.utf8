	New Delhi, Dec. 10: Air India today took back six of the 57 employees who were sacked after a flash strike called days after one of its jets crashed at Mangalore in May.        
	The airline also revoked the suspension of 27 others after they apologised.         
	In Calcutta, five Air India employees were suspended and the jobs of three were terminated. The five suspended employees were reinstated around one and half months back after they apologised, an airline spokesperson said in Calcutta. The three employees whose jobs were terminated have not been reinstated.

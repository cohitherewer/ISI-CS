          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 29: Sacked cop Arun Borude, who was accused of raping a 16-year-old girl in suburban Powai and was dodging a 50-member special squad, was today found dead close to the railway tracks near Shirdi, police sources said.        
	The former inspectors body was found with severe injuries at Shrirampur, about 70km from hometown Ahmednagar.        
	According to Krishna Prakash, the Ahmednagar district SP, a railway driver spotted the man and informed the Shrirampur station manager. He was rushed to a super speciality hospital in Shirdi, but he died on the way, he said.        
	Preliminary investigations suggest it is a case of suicide, but we are conducting a probe, government railway police commissioner Tukaram Chavan said.        
	A finger was pointed at Borude after the girl filed a complaint that she was taken to an isolated flat in Powai and raped by four-five men, including a senior cop, over a period of time. The case made headlines in October when the girls family admitted her to a hospital to deliver a baby.        
	The girl then told her family their neighbour, Shantabai Gaikwad, had taken her to a flat at Emerald Court housing society in Powai on the pretext of offering her a job, where she was raped.        
	During questioning, Gaikwad named Borude as the cop who violated the girl. The police arrested Gaikwad and two agents  Mohanchand Shyam, 45, and Satyanarayan Gupta, 45  from Chandigarh in connection with the case.        
	Borude has been absconding along with his wife and daughter since November 9. Embarrassed by his disappearance, state DGP D. Sivanandhan used special powers under Article 311 of the Constitution to dismiss him. Under this section, a policeman can be dismissed without a departmental inquiry.

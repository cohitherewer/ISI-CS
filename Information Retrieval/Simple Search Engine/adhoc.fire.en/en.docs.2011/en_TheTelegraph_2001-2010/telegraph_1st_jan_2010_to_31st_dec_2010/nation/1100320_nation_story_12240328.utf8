          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Rahul Gandhi                          
	New Delhi, March 19: Having shattered Mayavatis exceptional axis with Brahmins, the Congress has now drawn up an ambitious plan to make inroads into her Dalit vote bank. The plan will be unveiled on April 14, the birth anniversary of Dalit icon B.R. Ambedkar.        
	That day, Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi will flag off 10 yatras which will cover the entire Uttar Pradesh and carry the message of the states abysmal decline under different regimes that the party believes didnt focus on development.        
	The yatras will also dwell on the welfare programmes of the UPA and stress that the Centres ruling coalition is primarily driven by inclusive politics.        
	Rahul will reach Ambedkarnagar, near Faizabad, on April 14 to flag off the yatras, each of which will cover 40 Assembly constituencies and culminate on November 10 in Allahabad, where Congress president Sonia Gandhi will be present. The Congress is also keen to rekindle the glory of the freedom movement through the yatras. A programme has been lined up at Allahabads Anand Bhavan, the Gandhis ancestral home.         
	AICC general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, Digvijay Singh, and secretary Avinash Pandey will coordinate the yatras, to be in two phases  first from April 14 to May 31 and the second from September 15 to November 10.         
	Each yatra will have a chief co-ordinator who, in turn, will appoint co-ordinators for each Assembly constituency. Senior leaders, central ministers and even chief ministers of Congress-ruled states will be invited to address the meetings.         
	The 10 chief co-ordinators are Jagdambika Pal, P.L. Puniya, Zafar Ali Naqvi, Shekhar Bahuguna, Rajeshpati Tripathi, Rajendra Sharma, Pradeep Mathur, Ranjit Singh Judeo, Bhola Pandey and Praveen Aaron.

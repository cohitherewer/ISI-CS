          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, Jan. 3: Alert classmates, a prompt headmaster and more than 50 people in a Harischandrapur village caught four traffickers fleeing with a 13-year-old yesterday, blocking the road to Chandipur with tree trunks and refusing to hand them over to police till late in the night.         
	The villagers of Premabhaktipur damaged the white Ambassador, in which the abductors were fleeing, before setting it on fire.         
	While a section of villagers beat up the gang members and were reluctant to hand them over to the police, others were against the law being taken into ones own hand. In the end, the four abductors  one had fled  were locked up in a house till the police arrived. The police suspect that the four  Rustam Ali, Rakib Sheikh, Maqbul Hossain and Faridul Islam  had been working in the area for sometime.         
	All four, residents of Harischandrapur, were finally arrested at 10pm after the girls father, a resident of Premabhaktipur, filed an FIR alleging abduction with an intention to sell her and the villagers agreed to hand over the criminals after an almost six-hour persuasion by the police.        
	Witnesses said around 3.30pm yesterday, the girl, a student of Class VII of Premabhaktipur High Madarsa, was getting ready to go home after a unit test when the white Ambassador pulled up. It stopped so suddenly that for a moment we were scared it would ram into us. Four men got out and dragged our friend inside. We heard her screaming as the car disappeared down the Harishchandrapur-Chandipur road, a classmates said. The madarsa had emptied out by then and there were only five to six girls on the school grounds. The girls informed the headmaster who in turn rang up the panchayat pradhan of Rashidabad.         
	The call was taken by the pradhans deputy who realised that the car would go past the panchayat office, 2km from the madarsa. He swung into action and set up a blockade by placing tree trunks and bamboo on the road.        
	The car arrived within 10 minutes and was forced to stop, as there were no side-lanes leading out of the main road. The villagers rushed to the car with sticks and sickles and found the girl gagged and tied to the floor of the car. In the melee, one of the kidnappers fled. The others were beaten up and the police informed. The mob also damaged the vehicle and set it on fire, the police said.        
	The superintendent of police of Malda, Bhuban Mondol, said there were five persons in the car. The Harishchandrapur police went to the spot immediately and arrested the four. We are looking for the fifth person. We are also trying to find out if the four are linked to a trafficking gang, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In JEE, risk of zero for correct answers
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      In JEE, risk of zero for correct answers
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                            
	New Delhi, May 25: Marking correct answers will fetch some students a zero in this years IIT Joint Entrance Examination because of ambiguous instructions in the test papers that have triggered a debate on what should be labelled correct.        
	The IITs have told Delhi High Court that students who marked a single incorrect option while answering questions with multiple correct answers have earned zero marks, even though the instructions specifically said there would be no negative marking for these questions. (See chart)        
	This means students who marked all the correct options will still receive zero for the question if they also marked an incorrect option, IIT-JEE organising chairman T.S. Natarajan confirmed to The Telegraph today.        
	The IITs will declare the JEE results tomorrow morning.        
	The institutes have already explained they will not allow any ambiguity in the instructions to be misused by students who blindly marked all four options, using the absence of negative marking. But the explanation to the high court represents the first articulation of how the IITs marking policy for these questions may hurt students who genuinely misunderstood the instructions.        
	Many students may have interpreted the no negative marks part of the instructions as saying that the marks gained by marking one or more correct options would not be cancelled out by their marking any incorrect option as well.        
	They may have darkened - apart from the options they were sure about  bubbles they were not completely sure of.        
	Consider a question with two correct options among the possible four. A student who correctly darkened these two options after several minutes of calculation may have also darkened a third  and incorrect  option he was unsure of, thinking he had nothing to lose because of the absence of negative marking.        
	Natarajan argued the instructions were obvious and that the IITs had stuck to their interpretation of these instructions throughout the controversy.        
	Questions with multiple correct answers offered a maximum of 93 marks to JEE candidates.        
	Rajeev Kumar, a computer science teacher at IIT Kharagpur, had argued in an affidavit before the high court that the instructions could be misused by students to blindly darken all bubbles and earn the maximum marks. The case is on but the court has allowed the JEE results to be published.        
	Apart from Kumar, an NGO had unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a stay on the declaration of results.        
	The moment a student darkens an incorrect bubble, his answer is wrong, and not partially correct even if he has correctly darkened the legitimate answers, said Natarajan. This is a needless controversy.        
	But critics argue that the IITs did not specify this marking policy in their instructions and so cannot deny marks to students who genuinely misunderstood these instructions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Talks call to Maoists
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Talks call to Maoists
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Sept. 2: Nitish Kumar today exhorted Maoists to come forward for a dialogue to end the hostage crisis, assuring them there would be no police action against them if they came for talks.        
	We are ready for talks with them (Naxalites) and we assure them that there will be no police action against them if they come to us for a dialogue, the Bihar chief minister said.         
	It has been the state governments policy that no Naxalite should either be subjected to torture or killed in a fake encounter if the police catch them as we adhere to the principles of human rights and expect the same reciprocity from them (the Maoists), Nitish said.         
	Nitish said the killing of officer-in-charge Abhay Kumar Yadav by the Maoists was an inhuman act. The rebels have demanded the release of eight captured Naxalites.         
	The chief minister also appealed to those who found fault with the system to contest and win elections and run the government. Nitish has had differences with the Centre on how to deal with the Maoists.        
	In a meeting with the Prime Minister on July 14, Nitishs views on tackling the Maoist problem were clearly at variance with Union home minister P. Chidambaram.         
	At the meeting, Nitish had said: My views on how to resolve this may be at variance with the perception of some of my other friends present here. Naxalite elements are a part of our society even though they have been misled into following the path of violence.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 27: The Bengal government has allowed 307 Bengali-medium Madhyamik schools to be upgraded to higher secondary in order to encourage the study of science in district schools.        
	We have found that these schools are fit to conduct science and commerce courses from the current academic session from July, education minister Partha De said today.         
	The government has found that interest among district students to study the sciences is declining and one reason for this is the shortage of Bengali-medium schools teaching science at the Plus-II level.        
	The one condition that the 300-odd schools have to fulfil is to teach science and commerce in Plus II, not just humanities. There are nearly 4,300 Bengali-medium higher secondary schools and nearly 80 per cent of them offer only humanities, De said.        
	The government will also allow 59 Bengali-medium schools to simultaneously run English-medium units at the Plus-II level from July. These units will have only science and commerce streams.

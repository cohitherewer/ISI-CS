The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Spark scare at Forum
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Spark scare at Forum
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 24: Sparks flew out of an Inox glow signboard on the outer wall of Forum tonight, causing a brief scare a day after the Park Street blaze, but the malls fire-fighting system extinguished the fire swiftly.        
	Three fire engines arrived within minutes of the incident that occurred around 9pm at the popular Elgin Road address, but the sparks had been put out by then. Within two-and-a-half minutes, the sparks were put out. There were a few hundred people inside and movies were being screened. We did not have to evacuate people, a Forum official said. But an Inox employee denied the fire and said it was a rumour.        
	Swapan Majumdar, the officer in charge of the fire station at the headquarters on Free School Street, said the sparks seemed to have been caused by a short circuit or overheating of the wires in the signboard. By the time we reached, only some smoke could be seen. The in-built fire fighting system in the mall doused the sparks, Majumdar added. Other mall officials said a water hydrant on the terrace was used.         
	But as word spread, many shoppers rushed out, the images of the Stephen Court fire fresh in their minds. I got so frightened when I saw those images of fire victims on television yesterday. As soon as I heard about the fire tonight, I rushed outside with my three-year-old daughter. I thank God that this fire did not acquire similar proportions as Stephen Court, said Anjana Chatterjee, who was shopping in a kids store at the mall.         
	But an employee at the Inox ticket counter said:There was no fire. It was a just a rumour. At Starstruck, the lounge adjacent to Inox, it was business as usual, too. A staffer said: It wasnt anything serious. By 9.45pm, everything was normal.

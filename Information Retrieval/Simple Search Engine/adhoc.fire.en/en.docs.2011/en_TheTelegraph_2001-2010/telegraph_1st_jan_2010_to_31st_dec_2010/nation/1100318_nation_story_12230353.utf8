The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Money Mala II around neck, Maya gives critics a headache
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Money Mala II around neck, Maya gives critics a headache
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY              MONDAY            WEDNESDAY            Mayavati being presented with the money garlands on Monday and Wednesday. Pictures by Naeem Ansari                                 
	Lucknow, March 17: Branded daulat ki beti, a brazen Mayavati today turned Double-Act Lady.        
	Attacked country-wide for accepting a cash garland from supporters on Monday, she threw a dare by sticking her neck out again  to have a second Money Mala slipped around it by her party.        
	Unlike the first, crafted by experts over seven days to give it the camouflage of a flower garland, todays was a slapdash job and looked every inch the chain of cash it was.        
	It was smaller too  a patchwork assortment of vertically folded notes of varying worth and colour, in contrast to the original that had only Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes.        
	The chief minister teased her political rivals, tax authorities and the Reserve Bank  which has been campaigning against money garlands  by inviting news photographers and TV crew into her party office and posing with the garland triumphantly before them.        
	Yet three hours later, on her day of double acts, she had expelled the BSP general secretary in Karnataka, Y.N. Sharma, for spilling the beans on Mondays garland. Sharma had been the first party leader to admit it was made of currency notes.        
	He has been expelled from the party for indulging in anti-party activities, a BSP release said.        
	Sharma denied allegations that he had revealed too many details about the Money Mala to the media.        
	I never crossed the limits. I tried to defend the party line, he told The Telegraph. There is no inner-party democracy in the BSP; I was made a scapegoat.        
	The days events appeared well planned. As Mayavati arrived at the party headquarters, ostensibly for a BSP executive meeting, a handful of leaders swathed her in the garland. She didnt look surprised.        
	As the cameras clicked away, Mayavati smiled and BSP leaders held the garland up around her neck for about a minute for better display.         
	Eighteen party units contributed Rs 1 lakh each. The garland has been made with this money, BSP minister Naseemuddin Siddiqui said. He reiterated that Mondays mala was worth only Rs 21 lakh, also collected through donations from party members.        
	The twin claims raised a doubt: how could have Mondays garland been worth just Rs 3 lakh more with its larger size and uniformly big-denomination notes?        
	RBI powerless        
	The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had issued a public notice in March 2008 banning the use of bank notes for making garlands, decorating pandals and places of worship or for showering on personalities in social events.        
	It had warned that such acts reduce the notes life span and violate their sanctity because bank notes carry the national emblem, which is a symbol of Indian sovereignty.        
	Banking sources, however, said that the RBI lacked the powers to act against violators.        
	BSP sources said that with her cash garland shows, played out before the public and the media, Mayavati might be looking to buttress her case before tax officials in the future that these were mere gifts.        
	Income-tax sources said they had started a re-survey of the chief ministers assets. The survey will assess the expenses on both garlands and Mondays (BSP silver jubilee) rally. It will then issue a notice to the party chief, a tax official said.        
	The states Congress, Samajwadi Party and BJP units have threatened street demonstrations. The Congress plans mock money-garland shows for its leaders to ridicule Mayavati.        
	BSP state president Swamy Prasad Maurya, however, said: So many times politicians have been weighed against silver and gold. Why this hue and cry now?        
	Lawyers attached to social organisations in the state are considering moving court against the BSP. Some of them have already filed an RTI application with the state government for details on the cash garlands.        
	Advocates practising in Allahabad High Court too have demanded action against the chief minister.

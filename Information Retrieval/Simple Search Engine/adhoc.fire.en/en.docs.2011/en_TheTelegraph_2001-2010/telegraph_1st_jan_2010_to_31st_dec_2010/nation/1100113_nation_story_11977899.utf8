          RASHEED KIDWAI                                          The hoarding that got Chauhan's goat      
	Bhopal, Jan. 12: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan today got a spa hoarding removed on the grounds of obscenity and indecency.        
	Chauhan was passing by a prominent girls college when he spotted a hoarding that said Spa Treat Chocolate Massage Rs 500.         
	The normally mild-mannered Chauhan lost his cool and said: Meri betiyo ke college ke saamney is tareekey se ashleel pradarshan nahi hone doonga (I will not allow such obscenity in front of a college for our daughters).         
	The next moment Chauhan was on his mobile, admonishing Bhopal Municipal Corporation commissioner Manish Singh. Within an hour, civic authorities had swung into action to remove the hoardings or blacken them with paint.        
	By evening, an FIR had been registered against Nikki Bawa, a beautician who runs Spa Treat.        
	Bawa, a BJP sympathiser, apologised and praised the chief minister. He has a keen eye. We stand corrected and apologise for hurting his sensibilities, she said.        
	She declined to confirm if Chauhans wife Sadhna was her client. We do not reveal the identity of our clients, Bawa said.         
	Speaking on the condition of anonymity, Spa staff said both Sadhna and Bhopal mayor Krishna Gaur, who belongs to the ruling BJP, were regulars at Bawas parlour.        
	The spas project manager, Beena, sounded a lot more agitated. I fail to figure out the obscene part in our hoardings. Similar photos are appearing regularly in local newspapers. There are far more provocative ads on television and on hoardings across the country, she said.

	New Delhi, Jan. 18: Amar Singh today declared he had become a samajwadi (socialist), days after quitting posts he held in the Samajwadi Party.        
	Abhi tak toh Mulayamwadi tha. Aaj se samajwadi ban gaya hoon (All this while I was a Mulayam loyalist, now Im a socialist), the former Samajwadi general secretary said, a day after party boss Mulayam Singh Yadav accepted his resignation from the posts of general secretary, spokesperson and parliamentary board member.        
	In his first news conference in Delhi after quitting, Amar attacked the very Samajwadi policies in which he had supported Mulayam earlier. He was now liberated from the bonds that had shackled his speech, he said.         
	The man who was once Mulayams confidant endorsed his rival Mayavatis stand of carving smaller states out of Uttar Pradesh. Earlier as a decision-maker in the party, I had officially opposed the formation of smaller states but now, I feel as long as Poorvanchal, Bundelkhand and Harit Pradesh are not formed, no development is possible, Amar said.        
	He advised the Samajwadi boss to move with the times and added that he might agitate, demanding the smaller states.        
	Amar also criticised Mulayams move to remove English from primary schools  chief minister Mayavati brought English back after coming to power  and his discouragement of computer education.        
	Lohia (Mulayams socialist guru Ram Manohar Lohia) would have definitely supported them (the use of computers). Children in villages should learn English and computers to be on a par with their urban counterparts, Amar said.        
	While Amar spoke, a member of his self-professed Bollywood family was by his side. Actor Sanjay Dutt who joined the Samajwadi at Amars insistence said he would go where his bada bhai went. He would be an Amarwadi, he said.

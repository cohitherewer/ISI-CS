          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Yechury                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 1: Mamata Banerjee has received a compliment from an unexpected source, and its not entirely left-handed.        
	CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury has appreciated her political skill while saying his party had bungled in Singur, and added the Marxists are sorely missing Harkishen Singh Surjeet who led them at a time you couldnt have any government at the Centre without the Lefts support.        
	This situation ended when current CPM general secretary Prakash Karat withdrew support to UPA I in July 2008, a factor the Bengal unit holds primarily responsible for its recent poll defeats, but Yechury was categorical Singur should have been handled better.        
	Her (Mamatas) political skill is that she has been able to marshal the discontent. She has shown skills in decapitating the Congress altogether. She has turned out to be the real political adversary, Yechury said in an interview to the Indian Express.        
	He attributed Mamatas emergence as a political force to the CPMs mistake of including people without any ideological commitment from 1978 onwards. It took us time to identify them (such people). We are trying to clean up but that is the problem. And Mamata Banerjee got the advantage of that, he said.        
	Yechury said in Singur, the party had failed to carry out the land acquisition process properly. Elsewhere, the process of the acquisition was accompanied by very thorough homework. Committees were formed and we went from village to village explaining why this land was to be acquired, what the compensation would be, etc. In Singur, this process of carrying the people with us should have been done.        
	He conceded that the 2011 Bengal elections are going to be tough.         
	Yechury said the CPM missed Surjeet. The party was well-off under Surjeet. Under him, it came into national politics and it was a unique situation where you couldnt have any government at the Centre without the Lefts support.

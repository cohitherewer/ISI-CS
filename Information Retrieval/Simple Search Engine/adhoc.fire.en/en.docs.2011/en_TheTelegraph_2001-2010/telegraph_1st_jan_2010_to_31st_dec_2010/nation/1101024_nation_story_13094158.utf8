The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | J amp;K team runs into dispute
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      J amp;K team runs into dispute
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                             Academic Radha Kumar and journalist Dileep Padgaonkar, two of the three interlocutors appointed by the Centre to find a solution to the Jammu and Kashmir issue, arrive in Srinagar on Saturday. (PTI)                                 
	Srinagar, Oct. 23: The first visit of a three-member team of Kashmir interlocutors to the Valley today began on a controversial note with a top Pandit group objecting to the use of the word dispute by team head Dileep Padgaonkar.         
	Panun Kashmir president Ashwini Kumar Chrungoo said Padgaonkars reference to Kashmir as a dispute went against Delhis stated position on Kashmir.         
	Where Kashmir is being referred to as a dispute or a problem by the interlocutors beforehand is an invitation to political blackmail by anti-India forces, Chrungoo said.         
	Journalist Padgaonkar, academic Radha Kumar and information commissioner M.M. Ansari arrived in Srinagar on a four-day visit amid calls for a boycott by separatists.         
	Our main focus is to address the political angle of the Kashmir dispute. We are here to talk to every shade of opinion and we are here to listen to the people, Padgaonkar told reporters.         
	Chrungoo said Padgaonkars remark transgressed New Delhis stated position on Kashmir. His remarks that the focus of this dialogue is to seek as large an area of agreement as you can to get to arrive at a comprehensive political settlement of the Kashmir dispute is against the unanimous parliamentary resolution of 1994 on Jammu and Kashmir, Chrungoo said.         
	Kashmir is officially described as an issue and not a dispute. Separatists describe it as a dispute.         
	Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who is spearheading the ongoing protests in the Valley, has asked the people to stay away from the interlocutors and described their visit as an eyewash and purposeless exercise aimed at buying time. The moderates, too, are against meeting them.         
	The interlocutors, however, said they were not losing hope.         
	We will try to meet the separatists. I have said it earlier also that if they wish us to call on them, we will do it, Padgaonkar said, adding he had done some work on this already. We will be meeting students, civil society and womens groups. We will listen to the youth and try to find out what they want. Those who want to meet us are welcome.         
	Padgaonkar stressed that dialogue was the only way forward. Without dialogue we cant move ahead. We have enough time to talk with the people, he said, adding that they were planning to meet students on Monday.         
	The interlocutors will visit the state at least once a month to continue the dialogue with the people of the state and submit their recommendations after each visit.         
	The decision to appoint the interlocutors was taken at a cabinet committee on security meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on September 25. Official sources here said the Omar Abdullah government had asked the Centre to appoint a prominent political figure as a fourth interlocutor to give the exercise more weight.

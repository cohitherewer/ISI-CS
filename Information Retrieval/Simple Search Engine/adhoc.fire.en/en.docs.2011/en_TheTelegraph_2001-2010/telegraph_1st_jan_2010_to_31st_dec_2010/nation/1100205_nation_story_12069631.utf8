	Calcutta, Feb. 4: The Bengal government today set the ball rolling for a Greyhounds-like force to combat the Maoist menace by sanctioning Rs 27 crore for raising it.        
	The jawans will be fresh recruits, not men drawn from the police on deputation, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said today. The army will provide training to officers and jawans of the special combat force but the details havent been worked out. He added the BSF and CRPF would also work on the training aspect.

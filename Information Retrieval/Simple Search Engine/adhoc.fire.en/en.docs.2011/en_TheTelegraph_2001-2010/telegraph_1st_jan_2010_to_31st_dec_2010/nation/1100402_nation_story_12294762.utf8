The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amar clean chit to Sonia in Big B row
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Amar clean chit to Sonia in Big B row
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Sonia Gandhi, Amitabh Bachchan				                                 
	New Delhi, April 1: Amar Singh today did the balancing act on the Congress-Bachchan row, absolving Sonia and Rahul Gandhi of blame over their partys attacks on Amitabh while defending the actors association with the Gujarat government.        
	The expelled Samajwadi Party leader said he was fully convinced that the Gandhis had nothing to do with the anti-Bachchan campaign, and claimed it was a mistake to suggest the attacks were driven by differences between the two families.        
	The Gandhis are a family whose daughter was forgiving towards her fathers assassins. They cannot be merciless towards the Bachchans. The proof of this lies in the fact that the UPA government conferred a Padma Shri award on Aishwarya Rai and the President Pratibha Patil gave away a national award to Amitabh, he wrote in his blog.        
	Amar also tried to distance Amitabh from Narendra Modis politics, writing that being a brand ambassador for Gujarat tourism did not amount to endorsing Modis communal politics.        
	The Congress didnt cut off its links with Shah Rukh Khan for making a film on Atal Bihari Vajpayee along with Bollywood producer Yash Chopra, Amar wrote.        
	He cited how actor Salman Khan had campaigned for various parties candidates in the 2009 elections, from the Congresss Annu Tandon and Krupa Shankar to the BJPs Vinod Khanna.        
	Amar declined to say if he was making his statements on his own or in consultation with Amitabh. Let us not mix the personal with the political. The Bachchans are family to me, he told The Telegraph.        
	Asked if his appearance at a function with Amitabh on Tuesday was meant to clear the air on his relationship with the Bachchans, Amar said: It was a pre-scheduled function and was not meant to send any kind of signal.        
	Amar had made it apparent last week he did not approve of Jaya Bachchan continuing in the Samajwadi Party after his expulsion.        
	Nothing of that sort. She said she missed me in the Samajwadi, I reciprocated the sentiment, he said today.        
	He bent over backwards to please the Congress, saying that during his political interactions with its leaders, he never thought they were petty enough to get after one individual. He claimed the Congresss chief spokesperson had directed the other spokespersons to stop attacking Amitabh.        
	Amar, however, slammed the BJP for its sudden love for Amitabh. He recalled that the actor had been attacked by RSS workers during the shooting of Main Azad Hoon in Pune at the height of the Bofors controversy.        
	When Amitabh sponsored a Miss Universe contest in Bangalore, Uma Bharti (then in the BJP) had tried to scuttle the show, Amar alleged.

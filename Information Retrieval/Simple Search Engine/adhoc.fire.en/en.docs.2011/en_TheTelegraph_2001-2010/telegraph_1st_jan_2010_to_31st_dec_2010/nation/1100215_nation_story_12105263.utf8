          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Students protest against coaching institutes in Patna on Wednesday. File picture                                  
	Patna, Feb. 14: At a time when agitation by students against what they describe as fleecing by private coaching institutions has spread in other districts, too, the state government has decided to bring about a legislation to control and regulate the institutions.        
	Giving a political dimension to the stir, the Lok Janshakti Party, supported by the RJD, observed black day on Friday to protest the killing of a student in firing by a coaching tutors bodyguard on Wednesday. The protesters also staged demonstrations and violated security norms in the districts, including Motihari and Darbhanga in north Bihar and Nalanda in central Bihar.        
	The students charged that the coaching institutions were charging hefty amount as tuition fees but they were not completing the courses.         
	Human resource development department principal secretary Anjani Kumar Singh said the government had decided to frame laws to regulate the coaching institutions. A legislation to this effect will be brought out in the Assembly session beginning February 22, he said.        
	So far, the government had little idea about how many private coaching institutions are operating in Patna and elsewhere for it had no mechanism to maintain records. But according to rough estimates, there are about 5,000 coaching centres in Patna.        
	Anil Parmar, the director of Parmar Classes, a coaching institute guiding IIT aspirants, however, objected to the governments idea. He said: The coaching centres have played a big role in creating awareness among the Bihar students about IIT and IIMs. If the very high number of students are today qualifying in the IIT-JEE and other competitive exams, the credit obviously goes to these institutions.        
	Parmar feared that the governments excessive control might lead the flight of Bihar students to others states and subsequently might lead to loss of revenue and loss of quality institutions and teachers in the state.        
	Government officials, however, said that the bill would be the first of its kind in the country ensuring that the students were not fleeced and the institutions got registered and declare the standard of the teachers, their salary and the strength of their classes.                                
	Students and others in the education sector said it was primarily the failure of the government schools, which despite having highly paid teachers and logistics to impart quality education, has resulted into the mushrooming of coaching centres in Patna and elsewhere in the state.

	Chitradurga (Karnataka), May 30 (PTI): Thirty people, including 15 women and 10 children, were charred to death today when a Karnataka roadways bus packed with migrant labourers and their families overturned and burst into flames.        
	Another 25 were injured in the 2.30am accident, which state transport minister R. Ashok has blamed on the driver saying he had probably dozed off and hit a barricade.        
	Police said most of the overcrowded buss 60 passengers were poor villagers travelling to Bangalore in search of livelihood following suspension of rural job scheme projects in Surapur, Gulbarga district, from where the bus began its journey.        
	The reason for the suspension of the job scheme, a flagship programme of the UPA government, was not clear.        
	Surapur MLA Narasimha Naik, who belongs to the states ruling BJP, held the authorities responsible for the disruption in the projects which, he said, was forcing villagers to migrate in search of jobs ahead of the monsoon.        
	We will look into the matter and see what went wrong, chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa said.        
	The high casualties were the result of the vehicles diesel tank catching fire after the accident in Challakere, about 40km from Chitradurga, the police said.         
	Efforts are on to arrest the two drivers, Siddaswamy and Shetty, and conductor Nandagowda, who jumped off the bus and saved their lives, officers said. Four of the nearly 60 passengers too managed to leap to safety.        
	One of the four, Manappa, who has lost his wife and daughter in the tragedy, said: A sudden jolt woke us, and we saw the bus rolling down. I and some others managed to jump out.        
	The 25 injured, of whom three are critical, have been admitted to hospitals in Challakere and Chitradurga. Nine bodies have been identified, and DNA tests are being planned on several that are charred beyond recognition.        
	The North-Eastern Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation has announced Rs 2.5 lakh for the family of each of the dead. The chief minister has promised an additional Rs 1 lakh for each bereaved family and Rs 25,000 for each injured.        
	The transport corporations managing director, Shankar Patil, had earlier said the driver had hit a barricade while trying to avoid another bus. As per norms, we had kept two drivers. One of them, Shetty, has 20 years experience and always drives on that road. The second driver had five years experience, Patil said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong puts rebel fight onus on states
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong puts rebel fight onus on states
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Chidambaram                                  
	New Delhi, May 19: The Congress leadership has finally moved to draw a distinction between the Centres responsibility and the states duties in fighting Maoists after realising that Union home minister P. Chidambarams pro-active engagement with the problem had almost obliterated the dividing line.         
	Having held the fire for so long, the party today slammed Chhattisgarhs BJP government for its abject failure in recent rebel attacks. To begin with, the Union home ministers limited mandate remark was interpreted ingeniously to suggest he was only referring to the primacy of states role in law and order problems. That is the constitutional scheme.         
	Chidambaram was obviously referring to some other mandate which can be enlarged or downgraded by the Union cabinet.        
	The party did damage-control by giving this spin to his indiscretion and swiftly moved to scrutinise the Chhattisgarh governments role. Spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi claimed the party did not want to indulge in political warfare, but still made it clear the action on the ground has to be taken by the state government.        
	The Constitution, Singhvi said, does not give unlimited powers to the Centre and only the state government can take operational decisions with the assistance being provided by the Union government.         
	Asked if the Chhattisgarh government had failed in its duty, he refused to get into the blame game.        
	Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh did not mince words, though, and declared that the state government was squarely responsible for the spurt in the violence. He said the media should not mix up issues by criticising Chidambaram for the failures of chief minister Raman Singh. If Andhra could solve the problem, if Maharashtra can contain it, why cant Chhattisgarh do the same? Now he (Raman) sees an LeT (Lashkar-e-Toiba) link with Maoists what a statement to come from a chief minister, he said.        
	Digvijay questioned Raman Singhs apparent conviction about the need for a military solution. What was the state police doing when 6,000 Maoists were roaming in the forests? Why was the CRPF not alerted? Where was the police when the Dantewada attack happened? How many times has the CM visited Dantewada and 800 villages vacated by the people now living in refugee camps? Is there any dispute that it is the duty of the state to protect the citizens? the Congress leader asked.        
	The strong criticism betrays the dormant anger among Congress leaders over the political bungling that put the party in the dock for the failure of the BJP government. The party has countered suggestions that it wants to pass the buck as the scene gets murkier by arguing that solving the problem without an effective state government is very difficult.        
	It has also rejected the possibility of slowing down the anti-rebel operations, asserting that nobody in the Congress had opposed strong action. The call for a holistic approach, the party says, should be seen in the larger context of socio-economic problems in the neglected areas.         
	The Congress is also not keen to see the Centre usurp a larger role in the offensive by setting up something like a unified command.         
	It would like the Centre to only coordinate and assist, as it is doing now. Digvijay explained the point by saying: Every state has its own unique problems, different communities, different ground realities. Every state should draw up its own strategies, a common strategy will not work.        
	Asked if the party was now suggesting Naxalism was a state problem, altering the Prime Ministers view that it was the gravest internal security threat, Digjvijay said: It is a national problem but it cannot be fought without the state taking its responsibilities.         
	Another Congress leader, former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi, echoed the criticism. Raman Singh must explain why hospitals, schools, patwari offices and aanganwadis are closed for five years. We talk of Andhra model where intensive development is done in the affected areas. Raman Singh has withdrawn whatever little support the tribals had in those areas. His failures and complete neglect of the needs of those areas have complicated the problem, Jogi said.

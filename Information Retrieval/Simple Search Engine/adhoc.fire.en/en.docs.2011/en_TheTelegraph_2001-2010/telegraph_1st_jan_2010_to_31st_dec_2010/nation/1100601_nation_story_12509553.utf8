The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ally support for Sharma
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ally support for Sharma
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Satish Sharma                                  
	New Delhi, May 31: The Congress has nominated Gandhi family loyalist Satish Sharma as a Rajya Sabha candidate from Uttar Pradesh, the party confident of seeing him through with the support of prospective allies.        
	The Congress has only 20 MLAs in the Assembly but has struck deals with Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ajit Singh for the remaining 14 votes it needs to get Sharma elected.        
	Sharma is considered close to the Gandhis, and Sonia Gandhi would not have thrown him into an uncertain situation. So the decision to field him was taken only after tying up the loose ends.        
	While Mulayams Samajwadis have 18 surplus votes, Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal has 10 votes. The two parties have not fielded an additional candidate, which could ensure Sharmas election.        
	Mulayam is keen to become part of the UPA. Ajit had almost decided to join the Congress-led ruling coalition at the Centre until the prospective deal got stuck in a dispute over portfolios.        
	But the RLD chief continues to be in talks with the Congress, and the support for Sharma in the Rajya Sabha elections is being seen as a major step towards an alliance.        
	Mulayam had helped the Congress when the BJP and the Left moved cut motions against the budget proposals during Parliaments last session. He has been telling Congress leaders informally that his party will step in to prop up the Centre if Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress creates a crisis. Mulayam has close personal relations with Sharma too.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      EU stings honey exports 
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 1 (PTI): The government today informed Parliament that the European Union (EU) has banned imports of honey from India on account of the presence of heavy metals in the consignments.        
	The EU is the second largest destination for Indian honey exports after the US. India exports honey to over 60 nations. Indias honey exports totalled $32.39 million in 2008-09, a quarter of which went to the EU.        
	The EU has banned the export of honey from India on account of positive detection of heavy metals and other contaminants... minister of state for commerce and industry Jyotiraditya Scindia said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.        
	Following the ban, an action plan was prepared by the Export Inspection Council and communicated to the European Commission.         
	The action plan addresses all the issues raised and puts into motion a system to ensure that honey exported from India to the EU is free of contaminants, Scindia said.        
	The steps undertaken include rigorous testing of samples, educating bee producers on the contamination arising from lead tins, discouraging the use of tetracycline and sulphonamides at the primary level, he added.

	Chicago, Jan. 7 (Agencies): Terror accused Tahawwur Hussain Rana today told a US court he was a Pakistan army deserter, seemingly opening up a new Pakistan angle in the November 26 Mumbai attack case.        
	Rana is accused of knowing about the 26/11 plot in advance and of accompanying Lashkar-e-Toiba operative David Coleman Headley on one of his recce trips to India.        
	However, the Pakistani Canadian businessman, arrested by the FBI along with Headley in October, has been formally charged only with plotting an attack on a Danish newspaper.        
	Rana claimed in his bail plea he would not risk fleeing to Pakistan because he might be arrested as an army deserter and court-martialled. But he failed to get a reprieve from the Chicago district court.        
	Rana told the court he had been a military doctor and had deserted after developing high-altitude sickness during deployment in Pakistans Northern Areas.        
	His plea said he was sent to the Northern Areas without proper acclimatisation and suffered from high-altitude cerebral oedema, which later led to high-altitude pulmonary oedema. He was granted leave to seek medical treatment and flew to England and, when he was denied extended leave, had to desert the army.        
	Defendant has not returned to Pakistan since, and any attempt to flee to Pakistan would be met with incarceration and court-martial proceedings. As such, Defendant presents no risk of fleeing to Pakistan because to do so would only change the location of his detention, the plea said.        
	Rana, 48, appeared in court wearing an orange jump-suit. District judge Matthew Kennelly refused to hear the plea after prosecutors said they expected an indictment by January 14, which could send the case to a different judge. Kennelly set a status hearing for January 21.        
	Last month, Rana had been denied bail by a magistrate who said there was a risk he might flee the country if released on bond to escape a possible 30-year jail term. Rana, who ran an immigration service, may use his financial resources and knowledge of immigration laws to flee the US, the magistrate had said.

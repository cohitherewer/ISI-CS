          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, May 21: Madhya Pradeshs BJP government has made approval from the top brass in Bhopal a must for visits by Union ministers from the state, prompting the central leaders to allege it amounts to curbing their movement.        
	The diktat has come in the form of an internal circular that says collectors and department heads must seek such a nod before extending hospitality, security and other protocol-related courtesies to the central ministers.        
	At present, the Union ministers only inform top district officials before visiting the area, not the brass in Bhopal.        
	Kanhaiyalal Agarwal, general administration minister in the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government, justified the order, claiming some of the Union ministers had performed bhoomi poojan or laid foundation stones for projects yet to receive state clearance. This put the state government in an awkward situation. We want prior information of their tours.        
	Central ministers Kantilal Bhuria, Jyotiradtiya Scindia, Pradeep Jain and Arun Yadav dubbed the move ridiculous. Congress general secretary and former chief minister Digvijay Singh called it a gag order.        
	Bhuria, the Union tribal affairs minister, said he had written to the Prime Minister asking him to freeze central funds till the curbs were lifted. As elected representatives and Union ministers, we have a right to serve the public anywhere. What does the Madhya Pradesh government want to hide from us? he said.        
	Chauhan said the order had to be issued after Jain, Union minister of state for rural development who hails from neighbouring Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, was found to be visiting Madhya Pradeshs Tikamgarh and participating in programmes in which state government representatives had been kept out. Jain had also alleged corruption in rural job scheme NREGA, the UPAs flagship welfare scheme, in Madhya Pradesh.        
	Digvijay echoed the concern and claimed the state government had a dismal record in central schemes. The public representatives have a right to inspect any scheme and check its misuse, the Congress leader wrote in a letter addressed to chief minister Chauhan.        
	Scindia, the Union minister of state for commerce and industry, also expressed outrage, saying he had a duty to monitor central programmes in his constituency as an MP from the state. (Even ) as a Union minister, I am empowered to inspect the implementation of programmes that come under my jurisdiction. Any attempt to restrict the discharge of my responsibilities is undemocratic, he said.        
	But another state minister wondered why the central leaders were agitated. First, it is an accepted norm that visiting VIPs inform the state government. Second, if Scindia, Bhuria, Jain and Yadav are so concerned, they should explain why Guna, Jhabua, Khargone and Jhansi (their areas) continue to be the most backward regions despite the Congress winning these seats.

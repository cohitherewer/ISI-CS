	Mumbai, Feb. 24: They made Rahul Gandhi look like an aam aadmi. Today Mamata Banerjee made Mumbai locals look special.        
	The railway minister brought the smiles back on the faces of Mumbais harried commuters by announcing 101 more locals, weeks after Rahul hopped into one such train.         
	Mamatas announcement came as a welcome break from the rail budgets of previous years, when the commuters complained that they had been ignored. Of the 101 additional services, 32 will run between Thane and the distant suburb of Khopoli. New trains and facilities were announced for the rest of Maharashtra, too.        
	Todays budget also focused on an old demand: linking the central and western railways to ensure seamless commutes. Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan dubbed the moves a big relief. The UPA has given the highest priority to aam aadmi.

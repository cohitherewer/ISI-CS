The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | From Indira outhouse to governor house   Errand boy who followed yoga guru

	New Delhi, Oct. 12: Hans Raj Bharadwaj, whose actions as Karnataka governor have triggered a storm, has been a magnet for controversy most of his life. But he has cared little, building his career on patronage and loyalty and happily fulfilling a role that somehow seems tailor-made to suit the Congress.        
	The lawyer, who rose to become the countrys law minister despite many people doubting his legal acumen, learnt the art of finding benefactors early in life. He picked up lessons in backroom politics and self-promotion under the tutelage of the late Dhirendra Brahmachari, the religious-cum-yoga teacher of Indira Gandhi who wielded enormous political clout during her rule.        
	The association with the yoga guru allowed Bharadwaj to reach out to Sanjay Gandhi. He turned into a Nehru-Gandhi errand boy and even began living in the outhouse of Indiras prime ministerial residence.        
	Bharadwajs importance grew after Indira lost the 1977 election, when he became an assistant to senior Congress leader P. Shiv Shankar, a Supreme Court lawyer who handled the cases she faced during Janata Party rule.        
	He used this opportunity to cement his place as a family loyalist. After the deaths of Indira and Sanjay, he latched on to Satish Sharmas coattails to stay close to Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi.        
	The continued patronage he received from the family was reflected in his long Rajya Sabha tenure. First nominated in 1982, the native of Haryana received four terms from Madhya Pradesh, remaining in Parliament for over two decades without having to fight elections.        
	His elevation to law minister surprised the legal fraternity and during his stint, the Manmohan Singh government was repeatedly pulled up by the Supreme Court on issues such as the constitutional crises in Bihar and Jharkhand. Many blamed the governments predicament on wrong advice from the law ministry.        
	Bharadwaj also angered the Opposition, which accused him of allowing Bofors-accused Ottavio Quattrocchi to get away. Manmohan opted for Veerappa Moily as law minister in UPA II, and Bharadwaj was sent to Karnataka as governor last year.        
	Many viewed Bharadwajs choice as governor with suspicion. The buzz was that the Congress was upset at the BJPs southern success and wanted a strong occupant at the Bangalore Raj Bhavan.        
	The recurring bouts of political instability in the state provided Bharadwaj enough opportunities to make his presence felt. The BJP saw all his interventions as politically motivated and repeatedly demanded his recall even before the latest controversy.        
	Many in the Congress and the Centre too feel that his direction to the Assembly Speaker not to disqualify the 16 dissident MLAs who had dumped the government was questionable.        
	His recommendation for Presidents rule (which Bharadwaj today denied making) has, therefore, been shelved for now and the nod given to a fresh headcount on the floor of the House.

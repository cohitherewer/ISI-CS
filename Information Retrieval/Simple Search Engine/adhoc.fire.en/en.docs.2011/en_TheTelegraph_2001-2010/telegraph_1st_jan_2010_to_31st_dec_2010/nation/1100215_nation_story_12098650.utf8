          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 14: Villagers at Satabhaya and Kanhupur on the coast could be shifted to Bagapatia under a resettlement scheme but the people fear that they would lose agricultural lands once rehabilitated.        
	According to official records, the Satabhaya gram panchayat  spread over 350sqkm in Rajnagar block of Kendrapara district  had lost nearly 60 per cent of its area. In the process, five of the seven villages  Badagahirmatha, Chintamanipur, Govindpur, Kharikula and Mohanpur  vanished into the sea.        
	Sources said the Naveen Patnaik government wanted to move the 711 families in the two villages under Rajnagar block in Kendrapara district to Bagapatia to help with their rehabilitation.        
	But the villagers fear that they will be at risk of losing their agricultural lands under the proposed resettlement scheme. They are concerned that upon moving to Bagapatia, they would be given just enough land to build their houses.         
	The Kendrapara district administration had announced the plan recently and clarified that providing agricultural lands to all the villagers would be impossible. The villagers have the option of continuing cultivation in their lands in Satabhaya and Kanhupur after shifting to Bagapatia which is not very far off, a senior official said.        
	But we are worried about the proposal and fear that we will be left with no agricultural land, as we have already been losing portions of our lands to the sea during the past decade, said Sudarsan Rout, 54, of Satabhaya.                          
	The relocation plan has earmarked only 78 acres of land for the 711 families of the two villages. We have demanded at least two acres of cultivable land for each family, said Sasmita Das, the sarpanch of Satabhaya.

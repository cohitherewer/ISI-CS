                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bengal quota rush
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 11: Bengals junior minority affairs minister had obliquely advised caution to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee before the chief minister announced a 10 per cent job quota exclusively for the disadvantaged among backward class Muslims, according to sources.        
	Another minister who deals with backward classes had earlier suggested expanding the entire backward class quota, instead of confining the additional benefit to just one community, the sources added.        
	The sources in Writers Buildings said backward classes minister Jogesh Burman was in the dark till the chief ministers announcement on Monday.         
	Junior minority affairs minister Abdus Sattar had alerted the chief minister to the Andhra court order that set aside a 4 per cent quota in jobs and education for sections of backward class Muslims in the southern state. The Andhra court order was issued around noon, while the Bengal announcement was made a little after 1pm.        
	Jogeshbabu was not consulted by the chief minister or the CPM despite the fact that his department would have to handle the entire matter. He didnt favour the idea of such a Muslim quota on religious grounds. So he was not consulted, a source said.        
	Sattar had sent a note on the Andhra verdict to the chief minister before Bhattacharjee made the reservation announcement to keep him posted on the issue and caution him so that he didnt act hastily. He had also urged Buddhababu that when the quota is announced, the Muslim quota should be made 12.5 per cent, which wasnt done.        
	Bengal already had 7 per cent reservation in government jobs for Other Backward Classes (OBCs).         
	On Monday, the chief minister said his government had taken a policy decision to increase it to 17 per cent, of which 10 per cent would be exclusively for the disadvantaged among backward-class Muslims whose yearly family income did not exceed Rs 4.5 lakh.        
	An official of the backward classes welfare department said Burman had told CPM leaders the OBC quota should be increased but a separate quota for Muslims shouldnt be created.        
	 The minister wanted an increase in reservation from 7 to 17 per cent and had proposed that more Muslim communities be identified and brought under the OBC ambit. But he didnt like the idea of a separate Muslim quota. He felt a Muslim quota could be challenged in court, the official said.        
	The Bengal government has insisted that the quota is not based on religion, which is unconstitutional, but only an extension of an already existing formula.        
	However, others have pointed out that the extended quota is being given only to a particular community. The Andhra court did not go into the question whether the quota there was based on religion but struck it down because an order to carry out a survey to identify backward groups among Muslims was not complied with fully.        
	Former Calcutta High Court judge Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee said the Bengal governments decision would not be legally tenable. It violates Article 14 that grants equal protection of law and Article 16 that gives protection in respect of employment. The Constitution has no place for reservation on the basis of religion.        
	Asked about suggestions that he wasnt consulted by the chief minister, Burman said: Whats the big deal about it? There is still time to hold discussions.        
	I wont talk about these aspects, Sattar said. I dont think there would be any legal problem in implementing the policy decision.

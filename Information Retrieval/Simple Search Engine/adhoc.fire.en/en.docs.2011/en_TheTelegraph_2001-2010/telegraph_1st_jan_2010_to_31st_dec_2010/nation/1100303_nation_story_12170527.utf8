          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, March 2: A local court today jailed two men for life for killing a gay couple, saying even if one of the victims was obsessed with photographing his friends in the nude, sexual perversity couldnt justify murder.        
	Nobody gets the right to eliminate a human being whatever injustice has been caused to him. If this attitude is given sanction, what will happen to the civil society which is governed by law? the judge said while handing down the punishment in the 2004 case, four days after convicting the duo.        
	The February 26 conviction is possibly the countrys first in the murder of a homosexual that exposed the active gay network in the capital long before Delhi High Court last July ruled that adult consensual gay sex was not a crime.        
	UNDP employee Pushkin Chandra was found murdered along with his partner Kuldeep at his residence in an upmarket south Delhi locality late in the night of August 13, 2004.        
	While Chandra, 38  found lying naked in the bathroom  had been stabbed at least 11 times, Kuldeep had 30 injuries on his body.        
	Rajesh Rekhwar, an HIV-positive patient, and Moti  both 27 and acquaintances of the gay couple  were arrested soon after.         
	The two, in jail since then, later claimed that Doon School alumnus Chandras obsession with photographing his young friends in the nude cost him his life and also that of his long-time partner Kuldeep.        
	The defence counsel had earlier pleaded for lenient punishment, saying Chandra was a sexual pervert who used to indulge in sexual fantasies.        
	He was in the habit of catching poor people and then used to sexually exploit them and make blue films which he supplied abroad, the lawyer had said, arguing that anger against their exploitation led to the murders.        
	Additional sessions judge A.K. Kuhar said photographs placed on judicial files showing him indulging in unnatural sex with boys did reflect Chandras lifestyle.        
	Still, the judge added, the accused were in the company of this man who was indulging in such type of activities.        
	Then, referring to the murders, he said: I put up a question whether the convicts had any justification in killing in such a brutal fashion? The answer is no.         
	The court said though there was enough evidence to show that Chandra, son of a retired IAS officer, used to indulge in unnatural sexual activities, it wasnt reason enough for murder.        
	In the video cassette he is shown indulging in unnatural sex with boys. This is an indication of sexual perversity. But at the same time, no material could be gathered to show that he used to blackmail anyone. Therefore to say that the accused were being blackmailed by Chandra and that is why they planned to eliminate him under provocation has no evidential value in the eyes of law, the judge said.        
	The February 26 conviction is possibly the first in a gay murder case, though many similar cases have since been reported from across India.        
	In a recent case, Mahadevan Padmanabhan Iyer, a 48-year-old scientist with the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, was found murdered in his quarters. Police claimed they found evidence of a strained homosexual affair that could have led to the crime.        
	In another case in 2008, a 50-year-old man in south Delhi was found stabbed to death in a semi-naked condition in his shop. Delhi police officials said they suspected that the murder was a fallout of homosexual relations.        
	The cases are still being investigated.

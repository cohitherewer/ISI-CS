The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish basks in growth glory
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitish basks in growth glory
          NALIN VERMA                          Nitish Kumar                                  
	Patna, July 9: Staying away from caste calculations and political mud-slinging, chief minister Nitish Kumar opted to stay put on the development plank, reeling off growth figures to reply to his political rivals in the poll-bound state.         
	The state has registered a whopping growth 16.59 per cent on fixed price and 24.33 per cent on the current price during the year 2008-09, according to the central statistical office (CSO) report, the chief minister said today. Nitish was presenting the 5th and final report card of his governments present tenure, scheduled to end on November 24.        
	He even threw in a witticism: Our opponents who spent a lot of time denying CSOs earlier report which showed 11.3 per cent growth during my rule will not sleep peacefully now after learning this (the latest figures).        
	Conspicuously, Nitish made it a point not to get dragged into political controversy, steadfastly refusing to answer questions related to Narendra Modi or Lalu Prasad.        
	 Instead, he chose to focus on change backed by facts. The 112-page report card is in your hands. Now it is open to the media, academics and people to evaluate it. I have done the work for which I got my mandate.        
	The chief minister claimed the state has not undergone a change only in terms of data, but also mindset. The rule of law replaced the rule of anarchy.It is not a mean achievement in the context of Bihar, described as an incorrigible state before we came to power on November 24, 2005, he said.        
	To buttress his point, the chief minister dwelt at length on how as many as 49,612 criminals were convicted by various courts during over 55 months of his rule. The conviction rate in the state is believed to be on an all-time high, higher than other states. This became possible by setting up fast track courts and ensuring speedy investigation into pending cases, he said.        
	 Ridiculing the Centres claim that state roads were built only with central funds, Nitish Kumar said the state government repaired 1657km of national highways passing through Bihar from its own funds, something which the central minister concerned admitted to, in reply to a query in Parliament.         
	The Bihar government has built 23,606km of roads and 1,671 bridges in the state. We also bridged the gap between warring castes and communities. Caste wars history and there is complete communal harmony. People take pride in calling themselves Bihari there is a sense of Biharipan, added the chief minister.

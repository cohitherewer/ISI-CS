          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, Feb. 9: Basketball players from a Chennai university were allegedly told their corpses would be thrown into the Ganga if they didnt throw their matches at a national inter-university tournament in Varanasi.        
	Sathyabama University eventually withdrew midway through its January 31 semi-final against Varanasis Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidya Bhavan after spectators attacked its players in the toilet and on the court, Sathyabama sport official Ravikumar said.        
	Officials of the tournaments hosts, Banaras Hindu University (BHU), said the charges were baseless.        
	Ravikumar alleged that players of host Banaras Hindu University (BHU) and Vidya Bhavan, the two local teams, kept asking the Sathyabama players to tank their matches as soon as the squad arrived in Varanasi for the January 27-February 1 tournament.        
	He said this was because the Chennai team was the winner in 2008 and a title contender this time, and added that teams from Delhi and Rajasthan too were threatened.        
	Once we reached the semi-finals, we were not allowed to even practise in peace. Their players and coaches would threaten us openly in Hindi, saying if we played our normal game our corpses would be thrown into the Ganga, vice-captain Manish Sherangi said.        
	Still, we reached the semis and took an 18-point lead against Vidya Bhavan in the first two quarters. Then they sent in two substitutes whose mission was to foul openly with the collusion of the referees. By the third quarter they were leading 28-27, said player Aditya Biswas.        
	During the break, two of our players were attacked with dumbbells in the toilet and our coach was kicked by spectators. Soon, the spectators stormed the court and started abusing and assaulting our players. We hurriedly declared we were walking out as our lives were more important than winning the match.        
	Ravikumar said the organisers were intent on getting the two local teams in the final because that could fetch the players PSU and bank jobs. We learnt that all the team members who featured in the final would walk into Northern Railway jobs.        
	Hosts BHU later got Vidya Bhavan to virtually throw the final by resting five key players, Biswas alleged.        
	Ravikumar said Sathyabama officials had complained to the Union sports minister and the national basketball and Olympic associations, and might move court to have the tournament result scrapped.        
	BHU sports board general secretary Vidyasagar Singh, however, said: If the Chennai teams players were intimidated, why did they not go to the police or write a complaint to us in specific format after the match?         
	Singh asked why Sathyabama had kept silent so long, adding: We think the charges are baseless and intended to malign us.

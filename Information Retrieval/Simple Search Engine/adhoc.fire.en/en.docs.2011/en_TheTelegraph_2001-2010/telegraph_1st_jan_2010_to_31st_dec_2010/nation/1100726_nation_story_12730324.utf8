The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Calcutta brains pitch in for global study on stars

          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, July 25: An experimental facility in Germany where physicists hope to create conditions that simulate the interiors of dead stars and the cores of the solar systems gas giant planets may have a strong Indian signature.         
	India is likely to formally join a consortium of nations later this year to participate in building the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany, a machine to accelerate subatomic particles for basic physics research, project scientists said.         
	The Indian government has pledged about 36 million Euros -- 3 per cent of the estimated cost of FAIR -- under a pact between India and the European Union announced more than three years ago. Scientists from the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Calcutta and about a dozen other institutions from across the country will build components -- power supplies, magnets, detectors of subatomic particles -- for use in experiments at FAIR.         
	 quot;We expect the first experiments at FAIR to begin by 2015, quot; said Subhashis Chattopadhyay, a senior physicist at the VECC who is among more than 120 scientists from India who are likely to help build the components for FAIR.         
	 quot;This will provide another opportunity for Indian scientists as well as students to join a major international research effort, quot; said T Ramasami, secretary in the Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi.         
	Scientists plan to use FAIR for a wide range of experiments some of which will probe the properties of matter at extreme conditions. One experiment will aim at creating extreme high densities found inside so-called neutron stars -- stars that have exhausted their fuel and collapsed into a superdense ball of neutrons.         
	But among the first experiments likely to be taken up at FAIR may be an effort to study water molecules trapped deep within the cores of the solar systems gas giants such as Neptune or Uranus, said Chattopadhyay.         
	A team of Chinese, European and Russian scientists has proposed the experiment named Laboratory Planetary Science [LAPLAS] to simulate the compression of water in the latest issue of the New Journal of Physics.         
	 quot;The cores of the gas giants are believed to have water -- but no one knows how water behaves at such extreme pressures, quot; he said. Some scientists have suggested the water may exist in a hybrid state where oxygen is in crystal form and the hydrogen is liquid. Scientists hope to use beams of ions at FAIR to expose water to pressures 15 million times higher than the atmospheric pressure found on Earth and observe its response.         
	Indian physicists have in the past participated in a number of international physics experiments, helping build components and analysing data at subatomic particle accelerator laboratories in the US and at the Large Hadron Collider in Europe.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangh hunts for BJP point man
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sangh hunts for BJP point man
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Nitin Gadkari                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 3: Having installed a BJP president of its choice, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has turned its attention to picking the right man for party general secretary (organisation), the main interface between the BJP and the Sangh.        
	A Sangh official said the organisation was keen to restore to the post the primacy it had in the 80s and 90s when the likes of S.S. Bhandari and K.N. Govindacharya held their own against their bosses and sometimes had their way on crucial matters.        
	Actually, it was not so much about having their way as enforcing the Sanghs will on the BJP, clarified a BJP national executive member who is close to the Sangh.        
	The post, however, fell into disuse when the BJP was in power, and was further undermined with individual party leaders developing their own Sangh links bypassing the general secretary (organisation).        
	In the end, the post was disgraced by Sanjay Joshi, who got enmeshed in a sex scandal.        
	The Sangh is giving the matter priority because Nitin Gadkari is expected to announce his team soon  after the party national council formally ratifies his appointment as BJP president in mid-February.        
	The Sangh sees current general secretary (organisation), Ram Lal, as nice but ineffective. He is likely to return to his parent outfit.        
	His replacement could be the tried, tested and trusted Dattatreya Hosabale, Sangh joint secretary.        
	Hosabale was apparently a success as an organising secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the Sanghs student wing, and was later put in charge of its thinkers cell.        
	He combines organisational prowess with strong ideological commitment, a swayamsevak said.        
	However, Hosabale, who is in his early 50s, has told close associates that the job is a bed of thorns and not something he is looking forward to. More so because he is considered a prospective Sangh chief. He perhaps doesnt want to blot his record, the swayamsevak said.        
	One of the clearest instances of how the Sangh can control the BJP through the general secretary (organisation) came after the 1996 general election. The BJP was then inching towards a decision to lead a coalition at the Centre even if that meant shelving its core issues.        
	The Sangh used Govindacharya, then general secretary (organisation), to scuttle the plan. He publicly stated the BJP would not renounce the Ayodhya, common civil code and Article 370 planks, thus turning away possible secular allies.        
	The Sangh has made it clear that Gadkaris team will be youthful and socially inclusive.         
	Among the youths on the Sanghs radar are Uttar Pradesh MLA Raghav Lakhanpal Sharma and Lok Sabha MPs Anurag Thakur and Anant Kumar Hegde.

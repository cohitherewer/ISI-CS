The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | After blunder, BJP keeps mum 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      After blunder, BJP keeps mum 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Sushma Swaraj                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 7: The BJP has decided not to comment any further on President Barack Obamas trip till it comes to an end, having blundered yesterday by hastily criticising his silence on the Pakistani role in the 26/11 attacks.        
	A top-level party meeting this morning decided that the BJP would not react to the remarks Obama made today on Pakistan and Afghanistan at a question-answer session with Mumbais college students.        
	Rather, at the end of the visit, the BJP will come up with a statement on how New Delhi had tackled such sensitive issues and whether it had succeeded in extracting concrete assurances from the US.        
	The focus will be on our government and not on Obama, a source said.        
	Therefore, when Sushma Swaraj calls on the US President tomorrow, she would be unlikely to dwell on Islamabads role in fomenting terror in Kashmir and elsewhere in India, the source added.        
	The leader of the Opposition will tangentially touch on Pakistan-instigated terror, but only in the larger context of instability in South Asia, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistans northwestern frontier.        
	The BJP has been left ruing spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudys attack on Obamas speech at the Taj hotel, where the President paid homage to the 26/11 victims and condemned the attack without mentioning Pakistan.        
	Rudys statement has been seen both within and outside the BJP as premature, coming within hours of Obamas arrival in India, and as probably being in bad taste.        
	The party is rattled by the thought of the harm it might do to its US ties in the longer run, especially because it projects itself as having been Americas original friend in India in the years the Congress government had a pro-Soviet tilt.        
	BJP spokespersons, therefore, have been asked to keep mum, at least until the Sushma-Obama meeting is over.        
	This morning, a small group of party leaders, including Sushma, Arun Jaitley and Yashwant Sinha, met at L.K. Advanis home to chalk out the issues Sushma would raise with Obama.        
	She is expected to bring up the subjects of protectionism and US investments in India and underscore the need for better trade terms for India.        
	Matters concerning Pakistan and Afghanistan, the prospective pullout of the US military from Afghanistan, and its ramifications for the region are best left to the Prime Minister to raise, a source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mission Mine in rebel fight 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mission Mine in rebel fight 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, May 24: The Centre is thinking of raising a new agency entirely devoted to detecting and removing the Maoists landmines, and may explore tie-ups with countries such as South Africa and Israel to make the plan a success, sources said.        
	The proposed agency is expected to have crack de-mining teams, probably drawing experts from the Indian Army as well as foreign security agencies. South Africa has some of the best de-mining experts.        
	De-mining has now emerged at the focus of the governments renewed efforts at fine-tuning its anti-Maoist strategy, over which home minister P. Chidambaram is set to meet the chief ministers of seven rebel-hit states from next week. He is expected to visit Chhattisgarh capital Raipur and then Calcutta in the first leg.        
	Well-hidden mines or improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have become the Maoists most potent weapon, with which they have been blowing up security forces vehicles, including mine-protected ones, and inflicting heavy casualties.        
	A series of recent reverses has convinced the government that the policy of just rushing more and more forces to the Maoists killing fields, spread across 200 districts, isnt working without a machinery in place to clear these huge areas of landmines.        
	There will be a new de-mining strategy that will need approval from the cabinet committee on security (CCS), a senior home ministry official said. We cant keep operating in this kind of (mined) environment; so theres need for some fine-tuning.        
	The CCS approval may be sought next week, he said.        
	Sri Lanka and Afghanistan have already witnessed similar strategies before, with whole companies of de-mining experts being assigned the job of clearing battlefields.        
	The proposed de-mining agency will have the expertise and resources to detect and defuse mines across huge areas. The strategy will be finalised after receiving inputs from the state police forces, but the sources said areas in Chhattisgarh and Orissa had already been identified for the first phase of the de-mining exercise.        
	The Maoists have been planting their mines more than three feet beneath pucca roads whereas the best equipment available with the forces can detect mines only up to six inches under the ground, Bureau of Police Research and Development sources said. A road-opening party had failed to detect the mine that killed eight paramilitary jawans on a crowded Chhattisgarh highway on May 8.        
	This year, 79 CRPF personnel had been killed till April 6 while the rebels reportedly suffered just 12 casualties. Last year, the fatalities were 58 on either side.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: Bengal is the only state that has demanded a caste-based census as part of the 2011 population count set to begin this April.        
	March 1, 2011, will be the cut-off date for the exercise held every 10 years.        
	Minister of state for home Ajay Maken told the Lok Sabha in a written reply today that preparations for census 2011 had started with the Centres notification and that the government had received representation/requests for conducting a castebased count from various organisations. Bengal, however, was the only state that had requested a caste-based census.        
	The others include several associations for Other Backward Classes and Most Backward Classes.        
	Bengals request comes in the backdrop of the state governments recent announcement of a policy decision to reserve 10 per cent government jobs for disadvantaged sections of backward class Muslims, prodded by allies to spring a potential vote-catcher ahead of key elections.        
	Census operations are conducted in two phases. The first phase involves house-listing and housing census. It precedes the population enumeration by about eight to nine months.        
	The main purpose of house-listing is to prepare the frame for the population count, apart from collecting data on housing stock, amenities and assets of each household.        
	This exercise will be conducted from April to September 2010. The time schedule for each state is being notified.         
	The second phase will include population enumeration and gathering data on various socio-economic and demographic parameters like age, sex, literacy, religion, languages known, economic activity and migration. The survey, to be conducted in February-March 2011, will involve collection of data on each individual.         
	As has been the practice during past censuses, a full dress rehearsal called Pre-Test of the Census was conducted from June 28 to August 5, 2009, at 1,181 blocks across the country.        
	Based on the feedback of the pre-test, the questions to be asked during the house-listing and housing census in 2010 have been finalised by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). The government has approved the final set of questions.        
	The questions to be asked during the population enumeration will be finalised by the TAC at its next meeting.         
	The census covers every area, including tribal zones. Special tables on Schedule Tribes are also brought out.

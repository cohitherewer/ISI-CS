                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rahul bats for student polls
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul Gandhi at an election rally in Bihars Jamalpur on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 30: Rahul Gandhi today met human resource minister Kapil Sibal and urged him to intervene with authorities of three central universities in Uttar Pradesh where students union elections have not been held for the past few years.         
	The Congress general secretary led a delegation of student representatives from Aligarh Muslim University, Banaras Hindu University and Allahabad University and urged Sibal to take up the matter.         
	Students union elections have been suspended in BHU, Allahabad University and AMU since 1997, 2004 and 2007, respectively, following incidents of violence on campuses.         
	There is no platform for us to express our views, Mushtaq Ahmed, a student of AMU, said.         
	Students of AMU have been on strike since October 11 to press for their demand for holding elections soon. Vice-chancellor P.K. Abdul Azis has assured the agitating students that elections will be held after January 26.         
	Students of BHU and Allahabad University, too, are unhappy that elections have not been held for the past few years.         
	Sibal later said he had told the delegation that participation of students was necessary for building the future of universities and his ministry would take up the matter with the varsities.         
	The students, along with Rahul Gandhi, met me and explained the aspirations of students that they should be an integral part of the democratic process of the universities to take forward academic excellence, he said.        
	We certainly feel that students should be an integral part of the democratic processes of the universities (and) those concerns would definitely be conveyed to the universities concerned... Sibal said.

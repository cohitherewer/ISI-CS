          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The damaged railway tracks near Naddaul station. (Reuters)                                  
	Patna, Jan. 18: Maoists blew up tracks in Jehanabad district this morning, disrupting train services on the Patna-Gaya section of East Central Railway.        
	The rebels blew up the tracks near Naddaul railway station, which, according to police sources, falls in the Maoist den. They carried out the action to protest the arrest of their senior leader, Subodhji, alias Anand, and also observed a daylong bandh in the state.        
	The guerrillas first forced railway officials on duty in the cabin on the outer signal of the Naddaul railway station to leave the place. They then blew up the tracks, superintendent of railway police (Patna) Jitendra Rana said.         
	A railway official in Jehanabad, about 70km from here, said repairs were underway and likely to be completed by the evening.        
	The Maoist bandh evoked a mixed response as urban areas remained normal but villages were partially affected with only a few vehicles plying and bazaars staying closed.        
	Home department sources said the bandh evoked little response in Patna, Gaya, Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur and Purnea. But it hit rural areas of Aurangabad, Jehanabad, Arwal and Gaya districts  considered Maoist strongholds.        
	The rebels had also torched a truck in Amas police station in Gaya district late last night and blew up a cellphone tower in Sherpur in Gaya district.        
	Subodhji, alias Anand, was the Bihar-Jharkhand special area committee member of the outlawed outfit and was arrested by the special task force and district police on Friday.         
	Rebel quiz         
	Saswati Panda, the wife of top Maoist leader Sabyasachi Panda, would be quizzed over the next few days in Orissa.        
	Saswati was rejected bail at the Banpur court on Saturday where she was produced along with three other Maoist associates  Jena Kishore (alias Kishore Kanungo) Jaya Krushna Champati and Sanjay Bhol, driver of the vehicle from where propaganda material were seized.        
	She would again be produced before the court tomorrow.

          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 11: By the time companies wrap up hiring fresh recruits for 2010-11, Andhra Pradesh could have some 4.5 lakh engineering graduates still roaming the streets without a job.        
	According to a study released last week by Nasscom, only 12 per cent engineering students from Andhra qualified in campus recruitment in the previous year, while the figure for the current year showed a further fall.        
	Andhra technical education minister Damodar Raja Narasimha confirmed the gloomy trend, saying only 6-8 per cent graduates from the state had been hired since campus recruitment started in November.        
	The minister said the backlog for the last two years was 3.2 lakh engineering graduates. This year, another 1.3 lakh students are likely to be added to the backlog as campus recruitment, which began since November, have shown only 6-8 per cent recruitment.        
	It is not just Andhra that needs to worry, though the state accounts for 2.6 lakh of the 8.25 lakh engineering seats in the country. The report by the software industry body says 75 per cent engineering graduates in the country will remain unemployed this year. A break-up for individual states wasnt immediately available.        
	But the study is a concern for Cyberabad, a sobriquet Hyderabad has earned as a leading infotech hub. Sources in Andhras academic circles said one reason for the bleak picture was the declining quality of education for lack of proper faculty in most of the states 700-odd engineering colleges.        
	Of the 22,000 lecturers required in engineering colleges, we have only 9,200. As for professors, we have only 1,100 or even less though the requirement is 3,200, said a member of the apex body of engineering institutes in the state.        
	Sources said nearly one lakh engineering seats remained vacant in 2010-11 because of lack of tutors and also the unrest over Telangana.        
	Sources in the government blamed the privatisation of higher education during the Telugu Desam regime as the root cause of the current problem. Andhra accounts for 25 per cent of the engineering colleges in the country (700 of 2,800) but only 7 per cent of qualified academic staff, said a source in the state higher education council.        
	A recent report by a legislative panel, set up when chief minister K. Rosaiah headed the government before he resigned last month, said 60-72 per cent of engineering colleges lacked basic infrastructure.

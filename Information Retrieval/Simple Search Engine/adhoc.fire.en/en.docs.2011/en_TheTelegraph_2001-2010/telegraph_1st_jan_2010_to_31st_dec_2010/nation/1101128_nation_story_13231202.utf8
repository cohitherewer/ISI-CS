          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 27: A Delhi court today ordered police to register a complaint of sedition against Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, writer-activist Arundhati Roy and five others.         
	The Patiala House Courts asked Delhi police to register the FIR in the case and conduct an investigation and submit the report on January 6, 2011.         
	On October 28, petitioner Sushil Pandit had approached Tilak Marg police station seeking an FIR against Roy, Geelani and the others for their alleged anti-India speech at a seminar in the capital on October 21.         
	The police did not take any action, prompting Pandit to move court. He sought a directive to the police to register an FIR on charges of sedition .         
	At the seminar, Roy had allegedly said: Kashmir has never been an integral part of India  it is a historical fact. Even the Indian government has accepted this.         
	A couple of days later, home minister P. Chidambaram said Delhi police not filing a case against Roy was in accordance with the letter and spirit of law. Section 124(A) of the Indian Penal Code (related to sedition) is for deterrence and punishment. The spirit of the law and true interpretation of law is that unless there is direct incitement to violence, the state must show tolerance and forbearance, he said.         
	In its status report in court today, Delhi police took the line that registration of FIRs against the seven would not stand because no violence followed the seminar where they allegedly made anti-India statements.        
	A senior police officer said they would now approach the home ministry on the issue.         
	We have also asked our men to examine video recordings of the seminar, he said.

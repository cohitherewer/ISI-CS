          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Pro-Telangana protesters shout slogans against the Srikrishna commission at Osmania University in Hyderabad on Friday. (AFP)                          
	Hyderabad, Feb. 12: The statehood movement has stirred back to life with the Centre today including an option of a united Andhra Pradesh in the terms of reference for the commission set up to look into the issue of Telangana and giving the panel time till December 31 for submitting its report.        
	The committee, headed by former Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna, has been asked to consult all sections of the people, especially the political parties and recommend a plan of action.        
	The Telangana Rashtra Samiti, which has been spearheading the agitation, ridiculed the terms of reference and announced that its MPs and MLAs would resign immediately. The students of Osmania University, the nerve-centre of the agitation, have called a Hyderabad bandh tomorrow.         
	Under the seven-point terms of reference, the committee will examine the impact of the recent developments in the state on the different sections of the people such as women, children, students, minorities, Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.        
	It will examine the situation in the state of Andhra Pradesh with reference to the demand for a separate state of Telangana as well as the demand for maintaining the present status of a united Andhra Pradesh, the terms of reference said.         
	TRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao, whose fast-unto-death had spurred the Centre to announce it would act on Telangana, has directed all his party legislators to resign from their posts immediately in protest against the betrayal. The Centre has betrayed us again, he said.        
	TRS MP Vijayashanti and I will go to Delhi and submit our resignations (as Lok Sabha members), Rao said, alleging that the Centre had given in to pressure from leaders of the rich coastal Andhra. Maheswar Reddy, the Praja Rajyam legislator from Niamal in Adilabad, has also resigned his seat from the Assembly.        
	Rao said one of the terms  that the committee would go into the issue of continuation of a united Andhra  was reprehensible. Where is the question of looking into a united Andhra Pradesh when it already exists now? he asked.         
	Rao pointed out that in 1953, a committee was set up to divide Andhra from Madras state. It took only the opinion of the people of Andhra and the report was submitted in 30 days.

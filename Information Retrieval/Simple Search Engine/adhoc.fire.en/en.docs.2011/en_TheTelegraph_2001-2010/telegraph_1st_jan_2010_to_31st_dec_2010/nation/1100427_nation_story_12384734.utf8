          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 26: The E.N. Rammohan committee that probed the Maoist massacre of 76 CRPF jawans in Dantewada is believed to have raised questions on leadership and co-ordination between the state and central forces.         
	Home ministry officials are tight-lipped as Parliament is in session but sources said that the lack of leadership in the CRPF and poor co-ordination between the force and police are part of the report.         
	Rammohan submitted his 25-page report to home secretary G.K. Pillai today. Pillai passed it to Union home minister P. Chidambaram who will table it in Parliament.         
	On April 8, the home ministry constituted the committee headed by Rammohan, a former BSF director general.         
	The committee has probed whether the CRPFs decision to go for an area domination patrol was justified. Sources said the officer posted in command apparently did not carry out a survey before risking the lives of his men.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ambani probe bias rap on police 
                            
	Mumbai (PTI): The Mumbai police crime branch has come under fire from a special court for its biased probe into the alleged sabotage of Anil Ambanis helicopter.        
	In a 40-page judgment, special judge M.V. Kulkarni criticised the police probe and said the entire investigation was biased and one-sided to suit the management of Airworks Indian Engineering Ltd.        
	The management has created a false case by tampering with the helicopter belonging to Anil Ambani and thereby created media sensation which is evident from the report of the directorate general of civil aviation, the judgment, which was made available to lawyers today, said.        
	The court had on November 30 acquitted two persons, employed as helpers with the Ambani-owned Airworks, because of lack of evidence.         
	Uday Wanekar, 32, and Palraj Thevar, 38, were accused of planting pebbles and gravel in the combined gear box of the helicopter on April 23 last year while it was parked in the hangar.         
	The prosecution argued the duo had tried to sabotage the helicopter to cause damage to Airworks following a dispute with the management.        
	The court, however, remarked enmity is a double-edged weapon. While the helpers had a motive to commit the mischief, it was also possible for the management to stage manage such an incident and use it as tool to terminate the services of the helpers.         
	The court also came down heavily on the police for not investigating into the death of Airworks technician Bharat Borge who was the first person to notice the pebbles and gravel.        
	Four days after registration of a complaint, Borge died after coming under a local train.

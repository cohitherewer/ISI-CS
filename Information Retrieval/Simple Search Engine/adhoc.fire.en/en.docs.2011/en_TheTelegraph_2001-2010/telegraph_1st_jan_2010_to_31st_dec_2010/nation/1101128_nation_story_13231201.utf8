The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Veil off holes in anti-ragging project 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Veil off holes in anti-ragging project 
          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                           Rajendra Kachroo                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 27: The father of Aman Kachroo, a medical student who died because of ragging, has alleged irregularities in the award of the countrys first anti-ragging project to EdCIL (India) Ltd, the only education PSU.         
	In June last year, EdCIL was given the job of starting a call centre to register complaints of ragging and creating a database of institutions to help in quick action when a complaint was received. These were part of preventive measures prescribed by the Supreme Court.         
	The Union HRD ministry, which awarded the project, had not issued any tenders but went with EdCIL because the UGC had nominated it.         
	Rajendra Kachroo, whose son Aman died last year, has complained to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) and the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) that the project was awarded to EdCIL illegally. The PSU has messed up the project, he further alleged.         
	Kachroo has cited the CVC order of July 23, 2007, on transparency in works/purchase/consultancy contracts. The order states that the tendering process or public auction is a basic requirement for the award of contract by any government agency. Any other method, especially award of contract on nomination basis, would amount to breach of Article 14 of the Constitution guaranteeing the right to equality.         
	But EdCIL gets a number of projects from the HRD ministry and organisations under it through nomination, he alleged.         
	I asked MHRD, UGC and EdCIL if they are exempted from orders and directions of the CVC? I did not receive any response. If UGC and MHRD are not exempted, then I beg CVC to kindly put a stop to this illegal arrangement between the ministry and EdCIL, Kachroo wrote.         
	My complaint is that the UGC has ignored this order. They nominated EdCIL (India) Ltd for the project on prevention of ragging. In the prevention of ragging project there were no proper contracts drawn, no evaluation of costs was done, no technical evaluation was done and no deliverables were defined. The project has failed and a golden opportunity is lost, he added.         
	Since all EdCILs revenue is generated through projects secured from the ministry through nomination, its technical competence and ability to deliver have never been put to test, Kachroo said.         
	Kachroo has also questioned the transfer of the entire project money to EdCIL. As the project management consultant, the PSU was only entitled to its fees of Rs 13,44,855 but the entire sum of Rs 112,07,961 had been transferred to its account, he said.         
	The consequence is that the entire sum of money that should have been examined by the CAG using civil audit procedures is now examinable by a chartered accountant using commercial audit procedures. MHRD has cleverly eliminated both the compliance as well as performance audit of the Comptroller Auditor General for all the funds that they have transferred to EdCIL, he alleged.         
	Kachroo has demanded that the accounts of EdCIL be subjected to a civil audit.         
	The PSU has denied the allegations. The Supreme Courts directive came on 8th May, 2009, ordering the ministry to implement the anti-ragging project. Due to paucity of time and to implement the project immediately before the commencement of the academic session, the ministry selected EdCIL through nomination, chairperson and managing director Anju Banerjee said.         
	Banerjee said that in 2008-09 EdCIL completed 102 projects, of which six were from the HRD ministry, 25 were foreign projects, three were private projects and 68 were awarded by other government departments. In the year 2009-10, out of 110 projects only 10 projects belong to the HRD ministry. This shows proven competencies of EdCIL in government, private and international markets, she said.         
	Banerjee further said that the entire accounts of the company are audited by the statutory auditor appointed by CAG and further subject to supplementary audit by CAG.

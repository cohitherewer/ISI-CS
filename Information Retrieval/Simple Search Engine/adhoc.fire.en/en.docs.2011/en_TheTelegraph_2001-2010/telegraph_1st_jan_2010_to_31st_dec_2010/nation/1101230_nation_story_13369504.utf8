The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CM evasive, says Mamata
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CM evasive, says Mamata
  - Trinamul chief finds Buddha reply casual North Block splits hairs         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee in Calcutta on Wednesday. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Calcutta, Dec. 29: Mamata Banerjee today broke her silence on the letter controversy, describing Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees reply as evasive and defending P. Chidambarams use of harmad.        
	Referring to the word whose current, controversial usage owes to her, the Trinamul Congress chief said: History promotes a word during a point of time. Those killing people, looting them, what are they? Are they not harmad?        
	Asked what she expected from Delhi now, she said: The Centres letter to the state government signifies that the situation merits Article 355. But we are not pressing for Presidents rule since the state has already come under the Election Commissions purview.        
	She did not explain the last bit; also, Presidents rule is imposed under Article 356.        
	Mamata said Bhattacharjees casual reply had dodged the questions Chidambaram had raised and instead raised a stink over the leak of the letter.        
	The chief minister has suppressed the truth.... He must say whether armed camps exist or not. Why are so many people being killed? He should not wait for elections but immediately seek fresh mandate.        
	She attempted a point-by-point rebuttal of Bhattacharjees letter, which said: The Trinamul Congress, which was earlier maintaining secret contacts with Maoist leaders and outfits, are now openly organising meetings with them.        
	Mamata said it was the CPM that was using the Maoists as a mask.        
	To the chief ministers claim that Trinamul was the only party not cooperating with his efforts to stem political violence, Mamata cited how Trinamul had attended meetings called by Jyoti Basu and Forward Bloc leader Asok Ghosh during the Singur and Nandigram crises. She also mentioned her meeting with the chief minister at Raj Bhavan.        
	Four times I wrote to the government... there was no response. An agreement was signed between a state minister and the leader of the Opposition.... It was hurled to the litter bin. Why should we respond? The government hasnt called a single meeting on law and order.        
	If Bhattacharjee said only 32 Trinamul workers had been killed in clashes (against Chidambarams mention of 96), Mamata put the figure at 246. She alleged the CPM victims (69 according to Bhattacharjee and 65 according to Chidambaram) were mostly armed goons silenced after an armed operation.        
	Governor M.K. Narayanan, asked to react to the controversy, said: I have not seen any of the letters but read about them in newspapers.

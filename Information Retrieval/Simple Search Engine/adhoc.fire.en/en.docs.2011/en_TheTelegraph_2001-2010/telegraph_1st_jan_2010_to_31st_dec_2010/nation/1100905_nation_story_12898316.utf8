The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat drives to PM door 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Karat drives to PM door 
          J.P. YADAV                            Manmohan Singh (top), Prakash Karat	                                
	New Delhi, Sept. 4: Prakash Karat called on Manmohan Singh today in the first meeting between the two since the Congress returned to power last year without the Left.        
	The CPM general secretary, who had withdrawn support to the previous UPA government in July 2008 overriding concern within his own party, drove alone to the Prime Ministers residence for the half-hour meeting.        
	With the Indo-US nuclear deal, over which he had clashed with Singh, now a shut case, Karat sought to advise the Prime Minister on how to handle the Kashmir crisis.         
	The CPM boss was in the Valley last month.        
	Prakash Karat had a meeting with the Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, today to apprise him of the serious situation prevailing in Kashmir and what needs to be done immediately, a statement from the CPM headquarters, AKG Bhavan, said.        
	PMO sources hinted Karat did not get easy access to the Prime Minister.         
	His (Karat) request (for an appointment) had been pending for some time, a PMO official said.        
	The CPM and the PMO chose to keep the meeting low-key.         
	Unlike other such meetings, the media was not informed in advance by the party so TV crew did not get any visuals. The governments publicity department did not put out any pictures or media release.         
	After the meeting was over, the CPM headquarters issued the statement, which underlined concern for Jammu and Kashmir.         
	The statement indicated Karat was trying to emerge out of Bengal and Kerala now that he was firmly in the saddle after the extended central committee meet at Vijayawada.        
	Karat had got the Vijayawada meeting to endorse the withdrawal of support to UPA-I and also his aggressive anti-Congress line by yielding some ground to the Bengal unit, which had misgivings about his stand.         
	The general secretary stands unchallenged till the next party congress, which can be held only after the Assembly polls in Bengal and Kerala next year.        
	Although todays was widely perceived to be the first significant meeting between Singh and Karat after the withdrawal of support, sources said the two had met to discuss the Amarnath land row the same year.         
	That meeting, CPM sources said, was sought by the Prime Minister.

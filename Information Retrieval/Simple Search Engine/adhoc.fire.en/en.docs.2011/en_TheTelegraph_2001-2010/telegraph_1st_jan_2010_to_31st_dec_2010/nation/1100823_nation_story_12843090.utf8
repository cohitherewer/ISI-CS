          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Relatives of a Kashmiri who was wounded during a protest at a hospital in Srinagar on Sunday. (AP)                                  
	Srinagar, Aug. 22: Forty-eight hours to go, then 48 more companies.        
	Kashmirs embattled government is waiting with bated breath for Tuesday, when the two-month long Amarnath yatra draws to a close.        
	For chief minister Omar Abdullah, it would mean thousands more police and paramilitary personnel to tackle the unrelenting street violence that has left more than 60 dead since mid-June.        
	The Omar government has been finding it tough to contain the protests that began on June 11, one reason being it had to divert thousands of CRPF and police personnel for the safety of the yatra that began on July 1.         
	CRPF sources said some 5,000 men, or 48 companies, would be relieved of yatra duty in addition to hundreds of state police personnel.        
	They will now be deployed for law and order duties, a CRPF officer said.        
	The Jammu and Kashmir government had to requisition 21 CRPF companies and three companies of the Rapid Action Force early this month to fight stone-throwing protesters. They were in addition to tens of thousands of CRPF and police personnel already on the job.        
	In Srinagar city alone, some 35,000 CRPF and police personnel have been deployed to contain the unrest.        
	Sources said no CRPF personnel had been brought from outside for yatra duty, though 3,000 BSF troopers were airlifted to the Valley ahead of the pilgrimage to guard the devotees.         
	The BSF is not involved in counter-insurgency and law and order duties and there is no word on whether these 3,000 men will remain in the Valley.        
	The street protesters, urged by separatists not to harm Amarnath yatris, have spared the pilgrimage, which has remained peaceful so far.         
	Officials said more than 4.5 lakh pilgrims visited the holy cave. The beleaguered Omar can draw some solace if no untoward incident mars the yatra in the next couple of days. Life remained paralysed today in the Valley, with many areas under curfew and a shutdown in other places.        
	Police sources said six persons were injured, two of them seriously, after cops used force to quell protesters in Baghyas in Srinagar.        
	The sources said all six were hit by pellets when clashes broke out after an objectionable flag was noticed in the area.         
	The flag was removed. Some miscreants threw stones at the police, who conducted a cane charge and used tear smoke to chase them away. Six people have got pellet injuries and were shifted to hospital, a police officer said.

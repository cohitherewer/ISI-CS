The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhis turn to dish out prose 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhis turn to dish out prose 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 9: If Barack Obama knows his Mahatma, New Delhi flaunted its familiarity with the Book of Genesis today.        
	Hours after the US President left India for his former childhood home, officials in Delhi were drawing a Biblical parallel to his promise of a defining partnership.        
	The purple prose  matching the lofty praise dished out by the President yesterday in the Central Hall of Parliament  made some wonder if the officials really meant what they said or were playing to the gallery the same way the US President did.        
	 It (the India-US partnership) is a work in progress. The world has not been created yet. It is the second or third day of creation, said a source.        
	Morning has broken, another source said. It is just the beginning, the source added, alluding to Obamas support for Indias quest for a permanent Security Council seat, relaxation in export controls on high-tech trade, and lifting of space and missile project barriers.        
	The initiation has taken place. The door that was shut for all these years has opened, the key turned. The future is waiting for us, one of the sources said, denying that any of these relaxations had come attached with new conditions.         
	But what about the blunt reminder on Myanmar or Irans nuclear brinkmanship?        
	An official said Indians shouldnt get too prickly about Obamas comments as these were part of the terms of engagement and the two sides have been having healthy debates and understood each others compulsions.        
	The officials said Washington would realign its rules for India as it does for its other friends and allies in high-tech trade and also seek to change membership norms for Delhis entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group.         
	The sources said Obamas backing for a permanent Security Council seat was an explicit political statement of unequivocal support that was both symbolic and substantive and no bargaining was involved.        
	The sources cited Obamas open reminder to Pakistan to punish the 26/11 attackers and crack down on terror safe havens as proof of his sensitivity to Indias concerns.        
	They welcomed Chinas statement that it understands Indias aspirations to play a greater role in the UN.        
	Pakistan said Indias conduct with its neighbours and in Kashmir discredited its claims to a permanent Security Council membership. India retorted it did not need lectures in morality from Pakistan.        
	Correction        
	The Telegraph report on Obamas address had erroneously said the reference to the world itself is their family was from the Gita. The phrase figures in the Hitopadesha as well as the Panchatantra. We apologise for the mistake.

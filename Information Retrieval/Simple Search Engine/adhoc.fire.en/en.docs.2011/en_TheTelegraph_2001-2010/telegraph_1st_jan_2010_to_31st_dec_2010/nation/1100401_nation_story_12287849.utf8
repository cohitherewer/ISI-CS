The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu swipe at politician guru
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lalu swipe at politician guru
          NALIN VERMA                          Lalu Prasad at a meeting of the extremely backward classes in Patna on Wednesday. (Deepak Kumar)                                  
	Patna, March 31: Politicians practise yoga, but when yoga gurus preach politics, it unnerves many.        
	Lalu Prasad today targeted Baba Ramdev for defrauding the faithful and trying to enter politics by using tools of attaining spiritual salvation used by sages like Gautam Buddha.        
	Yeh baba sab baura gaya hai (These gurus have turned mad), the RJD boss said in his inimitable style, explaining how Baba Ramdev fools people on the TV.        
	He (Ramdev) asks a person in the crowd to stand up and tell that he has got rid of cancer. The gullible people in the crowd do not understand that the one who stands to raise his hands and tell that his cancer is gone is actually Ramdevs dalal (agent), Lalu Prasad chuckled, taunting: The medical experts across the world are yet to find out the cause and cure of the disease. But Ramdev tries to fool people by saying that his exercises will enable them to get rid of various life-threatening diseases.        
	Addressing a meeting of the extremely backward classes, the RJD chief said: Ramdev dhong kar raha hai (Ramdev is indulging in fraud). Saints like Patanjali and Gautam Buddha developed the tool of yoga for spiritual salvation and well-being of the people. But he is using the yoga to achieve his political ambitions.        
	Baba Ramdev launched his political party, Bharat Swabhiman Party, in Lucknow on March 17. He said he would not contest the polls himself, but would field candidates across all the Lok Sabha seats. I am entering politics not to rule but to cleanse the political system from corruption and weakness, the yoga guru said.        
	But Lalu Prasad asked the people to stay away from fraudulent yoga gurus and study and practise what Gautam Buddha and other great sages had preached.         
	Observers said Lalu Prasad specifically picked up Baba Ramdev because the latter belonged to the Yadav community and the RJD boss being a Yadav chieftain would hardly like another Yadav making a foray into politics. In fact, Lalu Prasad made it clear also: Ramdev was born in a Yadav caste. Now he is fooling the Yadavs.         
	Ramdevs original name is Ramkrishna Yadav.        
	Lalu Prasad reiterated that he would not allow the womens bill in its current form to be passed in Parliament. Colleagues from numerically preponderant parties in the Lok Sabha taunt that I have only four MPs and as such I can hardly do anything. My reply to them is only four people are needed to carry a body to its funeral pyre.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UK court scraps cap on migrants
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      UK court scraps cap on migrants
                            
	London, Dec. 18 (PTI): The UKs high court has nullified the governments decision to introduce a cap on the number of skilled workers immigrating from India and other non-EU countries, saying the limit imposed without parliamentary scrutiny is unlawful.        
	Home secretary Theresa May had introduced the cap as an interim measure before a permanent cap is put in place from April 2011.         
	The measure was challenged on the ground that the minister had sidestepped parliamentary scrutiny before announcing the temporary cap.        
	The legal challenge to the cap of 24,100 until April 2011 was brought by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and English Community Care Association, and was upheld by the judges.        
	The home office said this did not imperil its flagship immigration policy but the opposition Labour Party said the policy was in chaos after the court ruling.        
	The ruling has nullified the current temporary cap, meaning it is no longer in force.        
	The cap was one of the first measures of the coalition government that promised to bring down immigrations from hundreds of thousands every year to tens of thousands.         
	In the ruling, Lord Justice Sullivan and Justice Burton concluded that the home secretary had not gone through proper parliamentary procedures before implementing the cap, which took effect without a vote in Parliament.        
	The judges said: The secretary of state made no secret of her intentions. There can be no doubt that she was attempting to side-step provisions for Parliamentary scrutiny set up under provisions of the 1971 Immigration Act and her attempt was for that reason unlawful.        
	As a result, it said no limits were now in place for Tier I and II applicants from abroad.        
	The home office said it was still firmly committed to reducing levels of net migration.        
	I am disappointed with todays verdict, immigration minister Damian Green said, adding: We will do all in our power to continue to prevent a rush of applications before our more permanent measures are in place.

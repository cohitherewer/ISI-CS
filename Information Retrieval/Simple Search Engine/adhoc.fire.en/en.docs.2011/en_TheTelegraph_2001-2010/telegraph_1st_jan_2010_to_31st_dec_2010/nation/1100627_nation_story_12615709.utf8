	Srinagar, June 26: Stone-throwing protesters defied curfew and forced a train to turn back as Sopore erupted over the death of two youths in police firing yesterday and an embattled Omar Abdullah shrugged off accusations of rights abuse.        
	My government is concerned, conscious and vigilant, the Kashmir chief minister said. The National Conference government has ordered a judicial inquiry into the killings of the two civilians in Sopore.         
	The government has been battling a fresh wave of violence since June 11 after the death of a teenager in firing by security forces.

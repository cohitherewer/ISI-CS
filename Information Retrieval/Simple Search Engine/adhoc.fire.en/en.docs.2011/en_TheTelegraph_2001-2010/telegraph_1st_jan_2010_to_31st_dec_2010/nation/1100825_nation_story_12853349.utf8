The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shouted down, Meira moves to regain voice

          SANJAY K. JHA                                    Brothers in din: (From top) Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh and Sharad Yadav				                                 
	New Delhi, Aug. 24: Speaker Meira Kumar has called an all-party meeting at 9.30am tomorrow to discuss with senior leaders the growing problem of parliamentary misbehaviour in the Lok Sabha.        
	Sources said Kumar had been upset over the trend for a while but was extremely disappointed after Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav held a mock Parliament session in the House last Friday.        
	Through the ongoing monsoon session, the Lok Sabha has been witnessing a sharp erosion in the Speakers authority. While defiance of the Chair has become routine and junior members have behaved irresponsibly, some senior leaders have brazenly tried to guide, or even dictate to, Kumar on how to run the House.        
	Down the years, Speakers have been concerned about unruly behaviour in the House and have sought co-operation from senior leaders to ensure smooth functioning. But the problem has now taken on a different dimension as some frontbenchers have repeatedly tried to dominate proceedings. These leaders have not only hijacked the House to push their political agenda, they have gone to the extent of directing the Speaker on how to conduct proceedings.        
	Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad, who has barely four MPs, has performed in this session as though he were the leader of the Opposition. He has spoken whenever he has wished to and, at times, even shouted down the Speaker.        
	A senior UPA minister said: The Congress leadership might have committed a blunder by breaking parliamentary norms to seat Lalu in the front row. Now he behaves as if the RJD has 100 MPs. Except the late Chandra Shekhar, who got a seat in the front row because he was a former Prime Minister, no leader has dominated House proceedings as Lalu has done without the back-up of numerical strength.        
	What has attracted the ire of several Congress MPs is the routine domination of the Yadav troika  Sharad, Mulayam and Lalu Prasad  in the House, be it during question hour or debates. Mulayam and Lalu Prasad intervene on every subject. Then one will invariably tell the Speaker to give time to the other. This has never been seen in the House, a senior MP said.        
	There have been occasions when Mulayam has told the Speaker: Laluji ko bolne dijiye.         
	Kumar, not generally the type to berate MPs, is often heard pleading: Laluji aap itna jor se kyon bolte hain, dheere boliye (Why do you speak so loudly, speak mildly). The Yadav troika has even accused her of bias on many occasions, which is believed to have hurt her.        
	One of her aides told The Telegraph: Did anybody behave with Somnath Chatterjee in this manner even as he repeatedly accused the members of destroying democracy and even questioned their suitability to be in Parliament? We dont know why she is being treated like this. Because she is a woman? Because she does not have the stature of Somnath Chatterjee? Or because these leaders care too little for parliamentary decorum?        
	He said Kumar had often felt anguished because of the deliberate attempt to pull her down.        
	Sources said the Speaker was angry because disruption of question hour was now being considered a legitimate tool of political protest. She also felt that holding a mock session was the ultimate insult to the great institution of Parliament.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 11: A former model was found hanging from a ceiling fan in her Andheri apartment this morning, two weeks after Viveka Babajee killed herself.        
	Natasha Padbidris maid saw the 31-year-old hanging by her dupatta around 11am when she peeped through the keyhole after repeatedly knocking on the door.        
	She did not open her bedroom door till 10.30am and did not respond to repeated knocks by the maid. The servant then peeped through the keyhole and found her hanging. She called Natashas brother who lives in another flat in the same building. He broke open the door and called the police, said assistant commissioner Amitabh Gupta.        
	Police have sent Natashas body for post-mortem and are questioning her friends and family. Depression and a crumbling relationship seem to be the reasons behind the suicide.        
	A Mumbai restaurateur-cum-fashion designer said Natasha had been in a relationship with a debonair nightclub-owner from Bandra. She had expected the relationship to culminate in marriage. She confided to me three days back that her boyfriend had rejected her. She was distraught, the restaurateur, a friend of Natashas, said.        
	On Natashas Facebook account was a quote from Jamaican musician Bob Marley: The truth is everybody is going to hurt you; you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for.        
	Natasha studied at St Xaviers High School and Junior College in Mumbai and came from a well-to-do family living in Delhi.         
	The restaurateur said Natasha had lived with her family in Delhi for a while after failing to make it big as a model in Mumbai. She had acted in some Doordarshan serials before returning to Mumbai two years ago to try her luck in Bollywood.        
	Things did not work out well for her but she did not really seem hugely affected by it, though she wanted success. And despite being out of work she did not seem to be in financial trouble. Her family has various businesses and she used to drive a Mercedes, her friend said.        
	Though relatively little known compared to Viveka Babajee, also a former model, Natashas death has sent ripples through Mumbais glamour circles.        
	Viveka and Natashas stories could be straight out of Madhur Bhandarkars Fashion  it is a scary case of real life imitating reel life, Natashas friend said.

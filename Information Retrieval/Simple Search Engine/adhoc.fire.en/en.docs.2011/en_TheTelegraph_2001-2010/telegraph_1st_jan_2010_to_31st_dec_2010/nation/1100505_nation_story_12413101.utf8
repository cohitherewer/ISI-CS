The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cracks in RJD, Left unity before polls
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cracks in RJD, Left unity before polls
          NALIN VERMA                          Lalu: Friendship over with Left?                                  
	Patna, May 4: The RJD-Left relationship is apparently in trouble in the state with the Lalu Prasad-led party voting against the Opposition-sponsored cut motion and, thus, siding with the ruling UPA in the Lok Sabha recently.        
	State CPM secretary Vijaykant Thakur accused the RJD boss of resorting to political opportunism by siding with the Congress-led government on the issue of price rise. CPI secretary Badrinarayan Lal also said: The Left will review its relationship with the RJD after it voted against the cut motion.        
	In fact, the Left came closer to Lalu Prasad after he broke ties with the Congress during the last Lok Sabha polls. The RJD, subsequently, contested the Jharkhand Assembly polls in alliance with the CPI and CPM.        
	There were enough indications that the RJD-LJP combination would contest the Assembly polls, scheduled to take place in October/November in Bihar in alliance with the Left. Besides, the RJD and the Left were also expected to have a tie-up for the Rajya Sabha and state legislative council polls due next month in the state.        
	However, with Lalu Prasad going against the Left on the cut motion, the CPI and CPM leadership have turned bitter towards the RJD. The CPI and CPM have altogether four members in the Assembly. Given the numerical calculations in the House, the Left MLAs support is crucial for sending RJDs second candidate in the Rajya Sabha.        
	Lalu Prasad, however, pleaded that he had no basic differences with the Left. The RJD cannot have voted with the communal BJP on the cut motion, he said, while his party strategists were optimistic that eventually, the Left and the RJD would contest the polls together.        
	Their optimism is based on the logic that the Left can neither go with the coalition, which has BJP as its partner, nor the Congress, which has Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee with it. The RJD and Left have no option other than contesting the polls in Bihar in alliance, said a senior RJD leader on condition of anonymity.

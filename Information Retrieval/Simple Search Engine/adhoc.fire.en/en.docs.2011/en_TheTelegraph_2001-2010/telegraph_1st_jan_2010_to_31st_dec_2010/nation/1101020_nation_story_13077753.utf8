The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kasab spits at camera, walks off video hearing
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Kasab spits at camera, walks off video hearing
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ajmal Kasab                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 19: Ajmal Kasab threw tantrums, made rude gestures at the policemen guarding him and then spat at the web camera. Then he walked off.        
	A day after grinning and yawning away before a court that would decide the fate of his death sentence, the Pakistani gunman was back to his antics today.        
	But he got away lightly.        
	The Bombay High Court division bench warned the 26/11 convict to behave but didnt initiate contempt proceedings against the terrorist considering his mental condition.        
	But the judges, Ranjana Desai and R.V. More, made it clear that his behaviour was not acceptable and directed the authorities of Arthur Road jail, where Kasab is lodged in a bombproof cell, not to bring him from his barracks for video-conferencing unless he wished to depose.         
	They also rejected Kasabs demand to be physically present in the courtroom for the daily hearings.        
	The hearing on the confirmation of Kasabs death sentence began yesterday with the court allowing the 22-year-old to depose via video-conferencing from a makeshift courtroom near his cell.         
	The gunman, reprimanded more than once by 26/11 judge M.L. Tahilyani for smiling and chatting with his co-accused during the trial, grinned and yawned several times yesterday.        
	Today, the bench made it clear to Kasabs lawyers that the gunmans behaviour was violent and unruly and spitting was not acceptable.        
	For us he is just like any other accused. No special preference can be extended to him. He is not open to a dialogue, the judges told defence lawyers Farhana Shah and Amin Solkar.        
	The court then asked jail officials to ask Kasab, in prison for nearly two years now, if he wanted to depose via video-conferencing or continue to remain in solitary confinement.         
	After the hearing began today, Kasab said he wanted to be physically present in court. Minutes later, even as government counsel Ujjwal Nikam was speaking, the gunman was seen on the video screen making angry gestures and arguing with the prison officials. However, his words were not audible as the sound system developed a technical glitch.         
	When the court rose for lunch, Nikam asked the jail authorities about Kasabs gestures. The officials then informed the court that Kasab had spat at the web camera installed in the jail for the videoconference and so they had switched it off.        
	When the hearing resumed Kasab said: I want to come to the court. The bench told Kasab he wouldnt be allowed to attend the hearings in person for security reasons.         
	Kasab then asked the judges to send him to America. Aap mujhein America bhej dijiyen. Wahan human rights court mein case chalein (Please send me to America where my case could be heard in a human rights court). Then he walked away from the video camera.        
	The judges later said: Spitting is not expected and as Kasab has walked out on his own, the court cannot help it.         
	Kasabs lawyer Solkar tried to defend his client, saying the gunman had behaved like that because he wasnt being able to listen to court proceedings. The judges said there was no requirement in law that a death-row convict should be physically present in court.

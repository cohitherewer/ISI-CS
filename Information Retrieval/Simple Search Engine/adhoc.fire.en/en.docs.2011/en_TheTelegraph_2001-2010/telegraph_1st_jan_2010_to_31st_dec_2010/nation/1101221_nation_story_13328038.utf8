The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM wakes up with difficulty on lips
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CPM wakes up with difficulty on lips
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 20: The Bengal CPM has decided that preparations for the Assembly elections next summer should start immediately as the pre-poll scenario is difficult, party sources said.        
	The assessment, made at a meeting of the partys state committee today, is seen by a section of the CPM as a reflection of the failure to set the house in order even 18 months after the debacle in last years Lok Sabha elections.        
	The state committee meeting concluded that we will have to begin preparations for next years polls immediately. The party leadership feels that there is no question of wasting time as the pre-election scenario is difficult and much work needs to be done. Till now, things are not smooth in the districts, a source said.         
	State secretary Biman Bose admitted the going appeared tough but still nursed hopes of a turnaround. The situation before the elections is certainly difficult but our party has the potential of making a turnaround. But we need to work on it immediately.        
	But one leader, sizing up the challenges, did not appear to share Boses optimism.         
	Since we were routed in the Lok Sabha elections in May 2009, efforts were made to regain lost ground in different parts of the state. But we slipped further in districts such as Hooghly, Burdwan, Birbhum, North and South 24-Parganas. The condition in parts of Jungle Mahal is also not that good.         
	This years municipal polls also dealt a blow to our organisation. We cannot but accept it as a failure on the part of our party leadership as we couldnt do much in one-and-a-half years since the parliamentary elections, the leader said.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who attended the meeting, is learnt to have stressed the need to avoid complacency.         
	We have got reports from the districts that participation in our party programmes has increased significantly. This is a good sign. But we cannot afford to be complacent. We will have to go to the people, admit our mistakes and convey our views, Bhattacharjee was quoted as saying at the meeting.        
	Some leaders felt a rally should be held in early February at Calcuttas Brigade Parade grounds to highlight what they said was Mamatas silence on the Congress-led UPA governments corruption and rising prices of essentials.        
	Before any such big meeting, we will take to the streets to protest price rise, especially as Mamata Banerjee is mysteriously silent on this issue, secretariat member and former MP Mohammad Salim said after the meeting.         
	A Front meeting is likely tomorrow to take a decision on the rally.

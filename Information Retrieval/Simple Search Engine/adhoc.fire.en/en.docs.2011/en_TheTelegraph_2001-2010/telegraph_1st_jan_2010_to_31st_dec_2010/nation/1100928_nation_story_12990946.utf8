The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Governor as chancellor, panel frowns

          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 27: A government panel has questioned the appropriateness of appointing governors as chancellors of state universities and suggested that they be relieved of the responsibility.        
	In its report on Constitutional Governance and the Management of Centre-State Relations, the commission on Centre-state relations has said that making such appointments routinely has lost relevance with the change in times, but did not elaborate.        
	Making the governor the chancellor of universities and thereby conferring powers on him which may have had some relevance historically has ceased to be so with the change of times and circumstances, the report said.        
	The report, which has been submitted to the government, is not binding in any way. It will now be sent for inter-ministerial consultations and be forwarded to states for their feedback.        
	The role of a governor, laid down in Article 163 (1) of the Constitution, makes no mention of his/her role as university chancellor. That is defined under the State Universities Act, which provides that by virtue of his/her office, a governor shall be the chancellor of a university and endowed with powers, including appointment of vice-chancellors.        
	The report has been prepared by a panel comprising former Chief Justice of India M.M. Punchhi, former secretaries Dhirendra Singh and V.K. Duggal, academic N.R. Madhava Menon and former CBI director Vijay Shankar.        
	One of the questions the panel discussed before making the final recommendation was whether the governors function as university chancellor should be brought under the purview of Article 163 (1). That would mean the governor is bound to hold consultations with the state council of ministers but free to take an independent decision.        
	The commission said though governors were not obliged to act on ministerial advice, there was an obvious advantage if he/she consulted the chief minister or other state ministers.        
	To be able to discharge constitutional obligations fairly and impartially, the governor should not be burdened with positions and powers which are not envisaged by the Constitution and which may expose the office to controversies and public criticism. Conferring statutory powers on governors by state legislatures has that potential and should be avoided, the panel suggested.        
	The commission said that as the state council of ministers would be interested in regulating university education, there was no need to perpetuate a situation where there would be a clash of functions and powers.        
	The commission is also of the view that governors should not be assigned functions casually under any statute. His role should be confined to constitutional provisions only, the report said.

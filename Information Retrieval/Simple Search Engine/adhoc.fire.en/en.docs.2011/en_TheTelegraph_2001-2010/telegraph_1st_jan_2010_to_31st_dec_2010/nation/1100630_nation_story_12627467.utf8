The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Measles shot in ministry knot

          G.S. MUDUR                               
	New Delhi, June 29: A proposal to deliver a second dose of the measles vaccine to children in India through the free immunisation programme is entangled in health bureaucracy despite concerns that India is the worlds laggard in measles control.         
	The Union health ministry has not implemented the second dose of the measles vaccine that has been introduced by all other countries and has been available in India for years only through private sector medical care.         
	It is sad  India is the only country in the world with not even a plan yet to introduce a second dose to protect children from this life-threatening infection, said a member of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), a body of experts advising the health ministry on vaccines.         
	The group had last year recommended the introduction of a second dose by early-2010.         
	India accounts for 1,60,000 of the worlds annual 1,97,000 estimated measles deaths.         
	But Indias health bureaucracy, instead of acting on NTAGIs advice, established another committee of experts  called the core committee  to determine whether a second dose is really necessary.         
	This core committee met twice this year  on January 27 and April 26  and endorsed NTAGIs recommendation, pointing out that the proposed shift to a second dose is supported by well-established scientific facts.         
	The World Health Organisation had recommended the second dose of the measles vaccine for all countries in 2008 as a strategy to protect 15 per cent of children who do not get protected with a single dose.         
	After the WHO advisory, several countries with large measles fatalities, including Angola, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, and Vietnam, implemented the second dose.         
	The proposal for a second measles dose has come up in the health ministry time and again  but it has not been taken up, a member of the core committee told The Telegraph, speaking on condition of anonymity.         
	The measles vaccine is very effective in protecting children, but one dose protects only about 85 per cent of infants vaccinated.         
	Without a second dose, the number of unprotected children can build up year after year, the member said.         
	But some public health specialists believe the health ministrys slow pace towards the second dose may raise apprehensions about sustaining the programme.         
	It will mean great operational and logistical challenges, said Manish Kakkar, an infectious disease expert at the Public Health Foundation of India. At present about 8.5 million infants in India do not receive even the first dose.         
	Members of NTAGI are questioning the health bureaucracys decision to set up a core committee to revisit the bodys recommendations. It is almost as if NTAGIs credibility is under suspicion, said one member.         
	A panel of technical experts (NTAGI) had examined the issue, but it wasnt good enough for the non-technical bureaucracy. It set up a second body of experts (core committee) which has agreed with NTAGI, the member said.         
	This exercise has delayed the implementation of the second dose  and India continues to lose children to measles. And its hurting the poor the most as rich children will get the vaccine anyway, the member said.         
	A core committee member said it is still unclear when the second dose will be implemented. Two officers in the health ministry who had spent years in the immunisation programme have been transferred to other divisions.

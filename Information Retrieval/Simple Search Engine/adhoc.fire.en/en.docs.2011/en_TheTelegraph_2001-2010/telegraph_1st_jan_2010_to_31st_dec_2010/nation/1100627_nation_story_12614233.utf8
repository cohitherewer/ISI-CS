The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Washington will watch White House Michaeles entrance in August 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Washington will watch White House Michaeles entrance in August

	Washington, June 26 (AP): I love to just make an entrance, declares one of the new Real Housewives of DC on the reality shows debut episode, set to air in August.        
	Quick, guess which one!        
	Of course, that grimace-inducing line, given what we all know, comes from Michaele Salahi, whose uninvited entrance into the White House when it was hosting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last year, threw Washington into a tizzy.        
	It raised serious questions about presidential security, caused major fallout at the Secret Service and led to the departure of the White House social secretary.        
	And it is not over: A federal grand jury has been conducting a criminal investigation of Michaele and Tareq Salahi and how they got into the White House. But for now, all that trouble seems SO last year.        
	Because, judging from a sneak peek at the first episode of Real Housewives, Michaele is the unquestioned star of the new franchise. In fact, on a show that sets out to profile well-connected players in Washington  well, rich, beautiful, catty well-connected players in Washington  the newly famous Salahi is perhaps the closest to a player they have. Heck, at least she has met the President!        
	Let us pause for a little history. It was back in May of 2009 that TV network Bravo, already home to the Real Housewives of Orange County, California; Atlanta, Georgia; New York City and New Jersey, let it be known that it was coming to the US capital.        
	Immediately, tongues started wagging in Washingtons social circles. Who would the show find to equal the wealthy, colourful, surgically enhanced, backbiting, table-flipping heroines of those other cities? Was the wonky capital interesting enough? Some were horrified the show was coming, others a little proud, some both.        
	A production company, Half Yard Productions, meanwhile, was searching for women who, in Bravos words, have their hands on the pulse of whats going on culturally and politically. They knew, of course, that it would be tough to get to the centre of political power. I imagine it would be a challenge if we were trying for, say, (social secretary) Desiree Rogers, Bravo programming executive Andy Cohen said at the time, a comment that seems a bit eerie now.        
	In a secretive process  candidates were not told initially what show they were auditioning for  camera crews followed women into parties, leading to talk that they might be Housewives. The buzz led to more invitations, making their notoriety rather a self-fulfilling prophecy.        
	Enter Michaele Salahi (excuse the pun).         
	After she and her polo-playing husband from Virginia wine country made their way into the November state dinner, Bravo said they were being considered for the show but that the cast was not yet set.        
	What they did not say then was that shooting already was almost finished, as Cohen said last week when the cast was announced. There was no way at that stage, Cohen said, to replace her, and during editing, it had become clear how connected Salahi was to the other characters stories.        
	And how important she would be to ratings, he might have added.        
	The Salahis are the golden egg, says Carol Joynt, who writes a column on Washington society for the New York Social Diary.        
	Especially because prominent Washington players would not go near the show, she says.        
	In fact, Joynt, who interviewed the Salahis last week for her local cable interview show, had never heard of any of the five chosen women until Bravo started shooting the show in September, two months before the White House incident. If people in America think these are players in Washington, theyre delusional, she says.        
	Cathy Merrill Williams, publisher of Washingtonian magazine, agrees. They tried hard to get political women, to capture the politically powerful part of Washington, Williams says of the show.        
	Did they do it? No. Because in Washington, the currency is not money, its not exposure. Its brains and reputation, and powerful women are very protective of their reputations. Theyre not going to turn their lives over to a television editing room.        
	Of course, getting powerful, accomplished women might be boring, Williams adds. You could follow Nancy Pelosi around for a year, and nothing would happen, she says. Washington is full of really smart women who are making the country better. They just dont make good television.        
	Clearly, the biggest draw is Salahi  44, blonde, willowy and fashion-model thin. When you first look at me, you think I have no substance, she says, assuring viewers that isnt true. At her polo charity event, she runs about the room hugging everyone in sight.        
	Im a hugger, she explains.        
	The show hints that her White House foray will be, like her role on the show, front and centre. A coming-attractions shot features the couple in back of a car on the way to the state dinner, her in that famous red sari, and then, on the audio track, her voice at a congressional hearing, saying: I respectfully assert my right to remain silent.        
	It is not hard to imagine that the gate-crashing episode will be a huge ratings draw, even for those not already fans of the show.        
	But will Salahi and her cohorts be enough to carry a full season?        
	That remains to be seen. In Washington, at least, Joynt predicts people will be watching  albeit quietly.        
	They claim they have no interest, Joynt says. But I imagine most will watch. Itll certainly be something to dine out on. And really, who wants to talk about BP?

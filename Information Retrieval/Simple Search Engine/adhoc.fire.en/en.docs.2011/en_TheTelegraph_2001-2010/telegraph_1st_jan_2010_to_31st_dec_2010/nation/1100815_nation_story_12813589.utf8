The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | OBC decider in census demand

	New Delhi, Aug. 14: Call it a case of OBC.        
	OBC, as in Okay, But (no) Choice.        
	Days after a group of ministers (GoM) recommended inclusion of caste in Census 2011, sources in both the BJP and the Congress concede  despite internal divisions  that the government has no choice but to approve an exercise that has been interpreted differently.         
	After all, it all boils down to how the issue at the heart of it  the empowerment of the Other Backward Classes or OBCs  is interpreted.         
	Some see it as an overdue task, considering that no caste headcount has been taken after 1931. Others fear it would unleash the sentiments and passions the Mandal Commissions proposals triggered in 1989.        
	But both camps admit that the OBC factor has left their parties with little choice.        
	In its August 11 recommendation to the Union cabinet, the GoM not only suggested an OBC headcount but also a comprehensive caste-based enumeration in which every citizen will be asked which caste he or she belongs to.         
	The GoM also proposed that the caste enumeration be done at the biometric stage that will cover photographing, fingerprinting and iris mapping of all citizens above 15 years for the National Population Register. This data will then be tabulated and analysed since caste groupings are classified differently in different states.        
	For instance, a person from the Nat caste is listed as a Dalit in Uttar Pradesh but as an OBC in Rajasthan.        
	Supporters of a caste-based count say the endeavour will serve its main purpose of helping the intended beneficiaries of reservation only if it is linked to quality of life measured according to education and occupation.         
	If the projected database confirms the perception that certain segments had prospered from quotas and their numbers were indeed smaller than those classified extremely or most backward, it would buttress the case for doing away with or minimising the advantages enjoyed by the creamy layer, said an Uttar Pradesh minister.         
	He hoped the decision would help enforce better the principle of social justice. Otherwise, the whole thing will be reduced to a heap of numbers, he said.        
	It will lead to a churning in north Indian politics, said a BJP MP from Bihar. The hunger for a substantial space under the sun of the EBCs is bound to go up once it is established that their numbers surpass those of the better-off OBCs.        
	On the flip side, opponents of a caste census say it will play into the hands of the Mandalites.        
	This is not the 21st century India we want, we are setting the clock back by 70 years, a Congress MP from a north-western state said.         
	The BJP couldnt resist indulging in some grandstanding. We asked for the caste enumeration and the government accepted it. It was (Gopinath) Munde (the deputy Lok Sabha leader) who set the ball rolling in the debate, claimed Lok Sabha Opposition leader Sushma Swaraj.

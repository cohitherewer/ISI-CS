                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Snub to Amin jail shift plea
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, July 27: A CBI special court today rejected a request by Narendra Amin, the jailed ex-cop who sought to become approver against Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, to be shifted out of the Sabarmati jail here.        
	Amin had made the request saying he feared for his life because the other accused in the case were in the same jail. The court will hear his application for turning approver on August 3. The approver plea was to be heard today but was put off because the father of Jagdish Ramani, Amins advocate, passed away.        
	CBI counsel Ajaz Khan said the agency had no objection if Amin was shifted from the prison but the jail authorities opposed the request saying adequate security would be provided and he (Amin) need not be relocated.        
	Amins decision is bad news for former Gujarat minister Shah. The two men were reported to have had telephone conversations during the week preceding the killing of Sohrabuddin and his wife Kauser Bi.         
	The other accused, including IPS officer D.G. Vanzara, have decided to oppose Amins plea.        
	The order came on a day the CBI arrested Rajendra Jirawala, 47, the owner of the farmhouse where Sohrabuddin and his wife were kept for a few days before being killed in November 2005. Jirawala, the brother of a BJP councillor and a real estate player, had ignored the agencys summons earlier.        
	Yesterday, the CBI had secured arrest warrants for two of Shahs aides, Ajay Patel and Yaspal Chudasama, and declared them absconders.

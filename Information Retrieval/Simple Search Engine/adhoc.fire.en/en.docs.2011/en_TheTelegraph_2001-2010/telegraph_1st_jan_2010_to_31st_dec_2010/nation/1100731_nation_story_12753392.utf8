          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, July 30: The Telangana agitation today got a boost after the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) retained six of the 12 Assembly constituencies and appeared headed for victory in five others.        
	The ruling Congress suffered a major setback as state president D. Srinivas lost from Nizamabad Urban and party nominees from other seats were defeated by huge margins. All Telugu Desam candidates lost their deposits.        
	Soon after counting began this morning, it became evident that the contest was one-sided. TRS candidates won impressively in Siddipet, Dharmapuri, Vemulawada, Chennur, Mancherial and Sirpur constituencies.        
	This is a victory of the Telangana sentiment. We dedicate this victory to all those who sacrificed their life for the sake of a separate Telangana. This should be a message to the Centre. They should immediately form a separate Telangana state, Harish Rao, the Siddipet TRS candidate and nephew of party president K. Chandrashekhar Rao, said.        
	Trends showed that TRS candidates were leading in five of the remaining six seats  Warangal West, Yellareddy, Huzurabad, Sircilla and Koratla.

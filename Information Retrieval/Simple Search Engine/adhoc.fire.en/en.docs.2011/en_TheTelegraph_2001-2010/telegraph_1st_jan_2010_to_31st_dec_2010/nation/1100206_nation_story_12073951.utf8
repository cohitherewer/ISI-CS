The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advanis club of 4 at play, Gadkari at sea 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Advanis club of 4 at play, Gadkari at sea 
										      RADHIKA RAMASESHAN              NEW BOSS                Nitin Gadkari				                                 
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: The RSS may have a serious problem on its hands because the Dilli 4 cabal it wished to marginalise is digging in its heels while BJP president Nitin Gadkari appears to be at sea.         
	Venkaiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley, Ananth Kumar and Sushma Swaraj  who have little in common apart from being L.K. Advanis protgs and spending long years in the BJP in senior positions  are parcelling out whatever states they can among themselves so that even if Gadkari formally appoints prabaris (minders) when he forms his team, they can control the turfs by proxy.            OLD FAVOURITES                              (From Top) Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu and Ananth Kumar      
	Certain territories controlled by regional chieftains like Narendra Modi are strictly out of bounds. But Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which figure on the A-list of states, are considered fair game because there is no Modi to keep them out.        
	Gadkari was therefore advised to hold his first meeting on Uttar Pradesh today at Naidus residence against the wishes of former BJP president Rajnath Singh. He was told that when Naidu was the BJP president, he took special interest in Uttar Pradesh and knew every district and kasba (hamlet) like the back of his hand.         
	Rajnath, who like Naidu is unemployed, is trying to recapture his moorings in his home state. But a Rajnath aide admitted his boss had been trumped by Naidu who had Jaitley, Sushma and Ananth on his side in expanding his reach in north India.         
	Sushma and the rest have an interest in keeping Naidu out of the south, specifically Karnataka, from where he was elected to the Rajya Sabha.         
	Jaitley and Sushma have engaged themselves substantively with Karnataka in the past. The former had delivered for the BJP its first southern state. Sushma had fought against Sonia Gandhi in Bellary.         
	Although she lost the election, she maintained her association with the Karnataka BJP networks.         
	Jaitley is trying hard not to let go of Bihar, of which he was in charge when the BJP-Janata Dal (United) won in 2005. As an Opposition leader in the Rajya Sabha, he cannot hold a formal party position.         
	His Bihar backers are, therefore, clamouring to let him oversee the elections in the state again this year on the plea that he has a rapport with chief minister Nitish Kumar.         
	As the battle on the power chessboard spills over from the Centre to the states, other players like Ananth and Sushma have also set their sights on Bihar. They have visited the state often in the past.         
	A former Uttar Pradesh BJP president said if the intrusions from New Delhi got aggressive, the state leaders would do what they had done in the past to stave them off: bury our differences and build a wall against such leaders.

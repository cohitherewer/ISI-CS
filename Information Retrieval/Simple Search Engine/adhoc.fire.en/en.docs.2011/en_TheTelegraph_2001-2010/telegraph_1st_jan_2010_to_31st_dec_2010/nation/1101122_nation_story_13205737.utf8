The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Indira query from Advani
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Indira query from Advani
                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 21 (PTI): Along with Bangladesh, Indira Gandhi may have also had plans to liberate Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, said BJP leader L.K. Advani who today sought deeper research by historians to get an Indian perspective on various aspects of the nearly four-decade-old war.        
	A question that had been on my mind since some weeks was when in 1971 Indiraji decided to help Sheikh Mujibur Rahman carve out an independent Bangladesh for Bengalis of East Pakistan, was she also simultaneously thinking of an operation in West Pakistan aimed to achieve two major objectives to Balkanise West Pakistan and to liberate Pakistan occupied Kashmir? Advani asked in his blog post.        
	I wish some objective Indian historian does research into Indian source material and Government of India documents to give the country a version of events as seen from our side... he said.        
	Referring to B.Z. Khasrus book Bangladesh Liberation War: Myths and Facts published in September, Advani said: This book carries ample data to show whether or not Gandhi actually contemplated to achieve these objectives.         
	Washingtons top leaders of those times, President Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, the Presidents national security adviser, were both convinced that Gandhi was seriously thinking of action in that direction, and that the Soviets were likely to help India in achieving its objective, Advani said, quoting from the book.

          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            (Top) Shah Rukh arrives at Mumbai airport on Saturday; security outside the actors Mumbai residence. (PTI)                                
	Mumbai, Feb. 6: Shah Rukh Khan and the Shiv Sena today hinted at a thaw, the actor making conciliatory remarks after his return to Mumbai and Bal Thackeray saying the screening of My Name is Khan would not be stalled.        
	Sena cadres too stayed away from Shah Rukhs home despite earlier threats to protest there against the actors expression of regret at the IPL auction rebuffing Pakistani players wholesale.        
	I have just heard I will have no problem with the release of my film any more, Shah Rukh said this evening as he announced a sponsorship tie-up between the Kolkata Knight Riders and Lux Cozy, an underwear brand owned by Rizwanur Rahman suicide case accused Ashok Todi.        
	SRK added he did not think he had been targeted by the Sena for being a Muslim.        
	Soon, a text message was going around Mumbai saying MNIK  All Izz Well. Still, certain irritants remained.        
	Thackeray, as he issued the all-clear to MNIK through party mouthpiece Saamna this morning, had called Shah Rukh a traitor.        
	Then, as the Sena suggested he go and meet Thackeray, the actor appeared to hedge. Sometime later, Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray said his fathers comments did not mean the party had given up opposing Shah Rukh.        
	Uddhav had earlier said: If he (SRK) feels he has made a mistake he can come and place his views before Balasaheb.        
	But after the Bollywood star arrived at Mumbai airport at 1pm, his rather disjointed remarks failed to clarify his stand on this. He, however, underlined his personal ties with Bal Thackeray and claimed his comments on the Pakistani cricketers had been misconstrued.        
	I think there has been a misunderstanding. If Balasaheb calls me, I will go to meet him at Matoshree (the Thackeray home)  he is such a senior leader. We have a personal tie  I have been there so often. Yes, I would like to go and have (a) drink with him. But on this matter, I dont see  there is no reason for going and asking  yeah, but if my stand needs to be explained to someone then I will  I have already done it. I dont think there will be an issue on that front, the actor said.        
	He added: I think what I said has been misconstrued. I am pro good relationship with countries. I am not pro some other country and not my own country. How is it possible. I am what I am today because of Mumbai. I am pro-Mumbai.        
	Some 500 police and Central Industrial Security Force personnel had kept tight vigil and 50 private security guards provided body cover to the Bollywood star after his flight landed. A convoy of two dozen cars, including two police vehicles, took him to his Bandra home 12km away. Security ringed the house but there were no Sena storm-troopers in sight.        
	In Saamna, Bal Thackeray had written: Let Shah Rukh release the film with the blessings of the Italian woman (Sonia Gandhi) and her yuvraj (Rahul) without any protection and let it run in any theatre anywhere in the country. The Sena will not oppose it.        
	He had added: A Khan named Shah Rukh tells us to love Pakistan but nobody feels suffocated due to his treachery. Traitors, do whatever you want. Sena wont stop you.        
	After SRKs conciliatory statements, the Sena held a meeting at Matoshree. Later, Uddhav said the party had not stopped opposing Shah Rukh, but would plan further action only after the actor had made his stand clear.        
	Shah Rukh, asked why the KKR had ditched Pakistani player Abdul Razzaq, said: There were some injury issues with Razzaq. There was only one slot available and you cannot take more than that. We wanted Abdul Razzaq but there are rules.        
	An IPL source had said the KKR had first given a letter of invitation to Razzaq, then backtracked and forced him to stand in the auction, and finally desisted from bidding for him.

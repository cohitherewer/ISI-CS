The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UGC boss backs off
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      UGC boss backs off
          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: A rap from the human resource development ministry has prompted the University Grants Commission chairman S.K. Thorat to cancel a controversial job interview he had called tomorrow, sources said.        
	The ministry apparently asked Thorat to explain the allegations of irregularities in the process to recruit a commission secretary, levelled by two MPs.        
	After HRD minister Kapil Sibal spoke to him last evening, Thorat asked his staff this morning to immediately inform the 16 short-listed candidates by telegram and telephone that the interview had been postponed.        
	I got a call from the UGC office this morning saying the interview had been deferred. I was not told whether it would happen in future, a candidate told The Telegraph. Sources said the recruitment process had been shelved for now.        
	The two MPs had alleged that Thorat had violated norms, first by delaying the recruitment by over a year since the September 2009 advertisement for the post, and then by hurriedly setting up a selection committee a fortnight ago and calling an interview on October 29.        
	The MPs, one of whom is the son of former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, also claimed that Thorat was keen to appoint a preferred candidate and was therefore conducting the interview in haste just three months ahead of the end of his tenure.        
	Thorats tenure as UGC chief ends on February 5 next year. Under government rules, the head of an institution cannot appoint anybody in the organisation during the last three months of his tenure.        
	Yesterday, Thorat had met higher education secretary Bibha Puri Das and argued that he had three months and nine days of his tenure left. However, he failed to explain convincingly why the selection process had been delayed so long after the advertisement, sources said.        
	The selection panel set up by Thorat included one representative each from three deemed universities that have been found deficient in standards by an expert panel set up by Sibals ministry.        
	Earlier, a screening panel had shortlisted the 16 candidates, who include three UGC officials: officiating secretary Niloufer Kazmi, joint secretary Pankaj Mittal and additional secretary K. Gunasekharan. Mittal is serving as vice-chancellor of the Bhagat Phool Singh Womens University in Sonepat on deputation.        
	The UGC has been without a regular secretary for almost five years, except for a two-month period when Raju Sharma was appointed to the post in February 2008.        
	Sharma, who raised questions over the way the commission was recommending deemed university status for institutions, was repatriated to his parent Uttar Pradesh cadre in April 2008.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          JJ Singh in Chandigarh on Tuesday                                  
	Chandigarh, Sept. 14: A group of retired generals today had a message for the Centre: think carefully before you scrap or dilute the Armed Forces Special Powers Act.        
	The act gives the military extraordinary powers to detain, grill or shoot at people in disturbed areas while its personnel remain virtually immune from prosecution.        
	Will scrapping or lifting the act solve the problem in Kashmir or the Northeast? It will simply mean giving in to the terrorists demands, said Lt Gen. S.K. Sinha, former J amp;K governor. The mere discussion (about repealing the law) is hurting army morale. The law is needed to control insurgencies.        
	Sinha was here with eleven other former Western Command GOCs-in-C to attend the Commands 63rd Raising Day. The group included two former generals: Gen. J.J. Singh, now Arunachal governor, and Gen. S.F. Rodrigues. The government must not hurry through a decision that will cripple the soldier on the ground, Gen. Rodrigues said.        
	Gen. J.J. Singh said the governments decision to hold an all-party meeting on the subject tomorrow was the right step and whatever decision the meeting arrives at should be welcomed.

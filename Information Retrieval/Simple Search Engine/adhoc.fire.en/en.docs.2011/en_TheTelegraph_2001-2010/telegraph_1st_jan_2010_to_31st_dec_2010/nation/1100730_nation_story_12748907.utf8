The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Voting fixation hits House 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Voting fixation hits House 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 29: The Oppositions fixation with voting today led it to demand a debate in the Lok Sabha on price rise under rule 184, which entails voting much like the adjournment motion rejected by Speaker Meira Kumar yesterday.         
	The government, determined not to allow voting, didnt take the bait, triggering protests that paralysed the House for the fourth consecutive day even as the ruling combine viewed it as an insult to the Chair.        
	The Speaker somehow allowed the statutory resolution seeking parliamentary approval for Presidents rule in Jharkhand to be passed in the din without discussion and adjourned the House for the day. The government has given up hope for tomorrow too, but expects the Opposition to relent on Monday if it realises that the waste of a full week is enough to make a point.        
	Parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal said rule 184 automatically got knocked off after the Speaker disallowed adjournment motion as the two were almost similar. Although the adjournment motion involves an element of censure of the government, rule 184 acquires similar effect through the voting outcome.        
	In the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition persisted with its demand and for discussion under rule 168, which also requires voting.

          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                       Safety first                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 13: A New Zealand Olympic Committee team will arrive in Delhi to assess whether it is safe to participate in the Commonwealth Games even as the panels chief kept options open on the countrys athletes boarding the flight to India.        
	If the New Zealand government cant advise us that our athletes (will be) secure then we wont go, Mike Stanley reportedly told the New Zealand media in Auckland today.        
	The comment came barely a month after New Zealand said it was undecided on participating in the October 3-14 Games, saying a time might come when a difficult decision might have to be taken following security concerns and shoddy preparations.        
	Persistent rain has left several areas around Games venues flooded, while reports of a possible terror strike during the showpiece event have led to concerns in several countries. As if that wasnt enough, rising cases of dengue have added to the fears.        
	New Zealand athletics federation chief Robert Nichol said the Olympic committee team would reach Delhi this week. They will be able to make important assessments of the situation on the ground in respect of the facilities and venues, security and the issues of dengue fever. We are in constant communication with the NZOC on this matter, Nichol said in a letter to The Telegraph.        
	He said the teams assessment would be very important and they were waiting for the update with great interest.        
	Nichol, who last month had talked about the possibility of having to make a difficult decision, was responding to a specific question: Whether there is still doubt in your mind about participating in the Games?         
	Sources in the Games organising committee said the NZOC teams visit would be very important.         
	They might pull out of the Games if they are not satisfied with the security arrangements and other key issues raised by the NZOC. We are keeping our fingers crossed as anything can happen and thats why we are doing everything possible, said an official, voicing concern over Stanleys comment.         
	While security worries and missed deadlines have clouded the run-up to the Games, already hit by allegations of corruption, this is the first time that a participating country has voiced fears over the rising cases of dengue fever in the capital.        
	Delhi has reported five dengue deaths, while 1,788 people have been affected so far. Civic bodies blame the incessant rain and stagnant water at Games construction sites for the rising number of cases, 530 in the last eight days.        
	It is important to be thorough, to be calm and deal with facts as best we can, Nichol said, responding to a questionnaire sent to him by this paper last week.        
	A source in Delhi police said despite the Indian governments efforts to remove the misgivings, participating countries had remained unconvinced. Canada, Australia and England have all raised concerns but the Kiwis have been vocal about it. The rain has delayed preparations and the threat of dengue looms large over the Games village. We have drawn up security plans but they want their own security personnel, said an IPS officer.         
	Nichol said the athletics federation had not been given a copy of the security plan but the Olympic committee and the New Zealand government had both said they had had a look at the plan.         
	Based on the information the NZOC and the New Zealand government have provided us, we have been able to conduct a limited assessment of the measures that are being proposed. We do have some concerns and continue to work with the NZOC and their security advisors in order to get these addressed, he said.        
	In this context, he added, we want to ensure we have specialist security personnel imbedded within the team who are focused on the safety and security of our team members if something happens.

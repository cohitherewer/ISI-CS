The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM Telangana huddle before report
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      PM Telangana huddle before report
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              Manmohan Singh    
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today called top ministers to discuss possible options on the demand for a Telangana state, a day before the Srikrishna committee is due to submit its report.        
	The five-member committee is likely to submit its report to home minister P. Chidambaram tomorrow, a day before its term expires. Apart from the immediate fallout in Andhra Pradesh, the Centre is worried about the repercussions the report could have in Bengal where the Gorkhaland agitation is under way.        
	The meeting was attended by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, defence minister A.K. Antony, home minister P. Chidambaram, law minister M. Veerappa Moily and senior government officials.        
	Sources said the government discussed various possibilities the report may throw up, although the home ministry is said to be clueless about its contents. It is learnt that Justice Srikrishna has not yet written the operative part of the report to maintain secrecy.        
	The sources said the government did not expect the committee to recommend immediate bifurcation of Andhra and the normal course would be to suggest a periodic, step-by-step plan to address the demands of the region.        
	The government has made up its mind to deliver economic packages that could be part of the recommendations to address the grievances of the people living in the Telangana region.        
	Other significant options before the committee is recommendation of an autonomous regional council, as in Assam, to guarantee allocation of resources and ensure development of the earmarked area.        
	The recommendation may also include a review after a specific period and reconsideration of the statehood demand if targeted measures fail to improve conditions in neglected areas.        
	The Centre is treading cautiously as it is aware of the sensitivities on both sides of the divide in Andhra. The Congress has asked all senior leaders to engage with the people and try to prevent any violent reaction.        
	Chidambaram is understood to have briefed the meeting about steps the home ministry has taken, including sending 5,000 central paramilitary force personnel and keeping more on standby for any emergency.        
	The meeting also discussed the Gorkhaland situation where concerned parties have threatened protests in response to the Telangana decision.        
	Since the Bengal elections have to be held by June 2011, the government is keen to prevent any deterioration in law and order in hill areas. The meeting felt no other statehood demand was strong enough to get ignited by the Telangana decision.        
	Information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni met Chidambaram and discussed the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) advisory to news channels to be sensitive while covering the release of the Srikrishna committee report.        
	The NBA has asked all editors, who are members of the association, to ensure that the telecast of any news related to the report is not sensational, inflammatory or provocative. Sources said Soni has suggested to Chidambaram that a nodal officer in the home ministry be appointed to disseminate information.

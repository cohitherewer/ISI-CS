   Focus on footage, injured witness 
          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                      Vinita Gadani, a software engineer from Mumbai, who died in the Pune blast				                                       
	Feb. 14: Investigators probing the Pune bakery bombing are pinning hopes on CCTV footage and an injured eyewitness to help make headway in the case.        
	Police have obtained footage from , a five-star hotel near the Osho Ashram, whose cameras apparently also covered the front portion of German Bakery at the time of the blast.        
	The anti-terrorist squad (ATS) has taken possession of the footage, said inspector-general Rashmi Shukla.        
	The bakery has no CCTVs. The hotel, which has CCTVs, is located opposite the bakery. The ATS is now analysing the footage, she said.        
	Four ATS teams have been formed to investigate the case. One team is expected to pursue leads in other states.        
	Sketch plan        
	The police are trying to prepare a sketch of the suspected bomb carrier on the basis of the account of a witness. Pune police commissioner Satyapal Singh said one of the injured eyewitnesses was being treated under police protection.        
	Singh issued an appeal-cum-warning to journalists not to interview the injured in the hospitals as it could hamper investigations.        
	Nepali waiter        
	The injured witness is said to be a Nepali waiter. The Nepal Mazdoor Union today disclosed his name to a news agency and demanded adequate security for him.        
	Adequate security should be provided to (the waiter), who was working in the bakery and the police are treating him as an eyewitness in the case, the Nepal Shramik Mazdoor Union president Raj Thakur Master Thapa told PTI.        
	The Nepal embassy is not responding to our request (to intervene) in the matter. Altogether, 65 Nepali people were working in the bakery, Thapa said. One Nepali died while six others, including the witness, were injured, he said.        
	Thapa today met the waiter at Sassoon Hospital. I could only speak to him for a couple of minutes and the police asked me to leave immediately, he said. The police said he is an eyewitness and cannot be released while all the other Nepali workers have been discharged by the hospitals, he added.        
	Two foreigners killed        
	IG Shukla said all the deceased had been identified. They are Sayyed Abdul Gani (26) from Iran, Nadia Macerini (37) from Italy, Ankik Dhar (23), Anindyee Dhar (19) and Shilpa Goenka (23) of Calcutta, Sundari (22) of Bangalore, Vinita Gadani (23) of Mumbai, Shankar Pansare (40) and Gokul Nepali of Pune.         
	Among the 60 injured, 12 are foreigners  five from Iran, two from Nepal, one each from Taiwan, Germany and Yemen and two from Sudan. Twenty have been discharged while the rest are undergoing treatment at different hospitals in Pune.        
	Kanpur alert        
	The Centre has sounded a red alert in Kanpur and Indore in the wake of the Pune blast.         
	Indore has been picked out for heightened vigil because of the BJP national executive meeting there from Wednesday.         
	A Kanpur parallel has been found in Pune. A home ministry official said forensic teams had found ammonium nitrate and traces of RDX at the Pune blast site  similar material were used in a bomb in Kanpur in October 2008.         
	Kanpur has been a base of terror outfit, Indian Mujahideen (IM), as has been Pune. Several IM cadres had either lived in or had been arrested from Pune in 2008, including the groups cyber expert Mansoor Asghar Peerbhoy, who is expected to be questioned again.        
	Security drills were carried out at New Delhis Major Dhyan Chand Stadium that will play host to the hockey World Cup this month.         
	Access to Headley        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram said in Pune that the government was pursuing an effort to gain access to David Headley, who is being tried in the US.        
	We want an access to Headley for interrogation, said Chidambaram. However, he added that there were legal difficulties. Headley is believed to have stayed at the Osho Ashram, located near the blast site in Pune.        
	According to sources, Headleys legal rights make it difficult for India to interrogate him, except in the presence of his lawyer who can advise him to remain silent.

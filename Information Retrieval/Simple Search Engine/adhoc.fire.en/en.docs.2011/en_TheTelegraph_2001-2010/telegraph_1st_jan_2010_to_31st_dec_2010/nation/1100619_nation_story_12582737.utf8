	New Delhi, June 18 (PTI): Raavan has just conquered an evil, with some help from a free-market watchdog.        
	The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has directed the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce not to prevent theatres from showing the Abhishek-Aishwarya starrer. According to sources, regional film chambers impose such unofficial bans on Hindi movies to promote regional films. The CCI said the move was an abuse of influence.        
	The panel passed the order late last night on a complaint filed by the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Big Pictures, the nation-wide distributors of the Mani Ratnam-directed movie that also features south star Vikram.        
	The CCI has asked its director-general (investigation) to probe the practice of discrimination against Hindi films.

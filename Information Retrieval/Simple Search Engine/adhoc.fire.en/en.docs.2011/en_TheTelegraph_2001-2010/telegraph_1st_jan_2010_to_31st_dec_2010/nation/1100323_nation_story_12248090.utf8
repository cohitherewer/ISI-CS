          JOHN MARY                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, March 22: A Kerala government panel has recommended that Coca-Cola be made to pay Rs 216.32 crore as compensation for the multi-sector damage its factory in Plachimada caused to residents.        
	The recommendation has to be approved by the state cabinet to be implemented.        
	The 14-member committee, headed by additional chief secretary K. Jayakumar, handed its report to state water resources minister N.K. Premachandran today, coinciding with World Water Day. The minister said he would take it to the next cabinet meeting.        
	The committee has also asked the government to set up a tribunal for the benefit of Plachimada residents instead of leaving them to sue the company individually in what might be a long-drawn-out legal battle.        
	Sources said the sum of Rs 216 crore was the minimum damages recommended and, according to the panel, the tribunal could order additional compensation after going through each individual case.        
	Some 1,000-odd families living near the now-closed plant in Palakkad district, about 150km from Kochi, are said to have suffered damage to their health, water, crops and livelihood from the factorys operations between 1999 and 2004.        
	Once the government decides on a suitable mechanism and it (the tribunal) comes into being, individual claims will have to be assessed and actual compensation decreed and the polluter company made to pay it, the report said.        
	The panel assessed the compensation on several counts: agricultural loss (Rs 84.16 crore), pollution of water resources (Rs 62 crore), impact on health (Rs 30 crore), cost of providing drinking water (Rs 20 crore) and wage loss and cost to job opportunities (Rs 20 crore).        
	Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt Ltd said in a statement: It is unfortunate that the committee in Kerala was appointed on the unproven assumption that damage was caused, and that it was caused by Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages. In these circumstances, there is little for us to comment upon given the deliberations of a committee appointed with such a mandate. We will comment further at a more appropriate time.        
	The company said it should be determined first through a process of scientific evidence and legal adjudication whether any damage was caused to Plachimada residents and, if so, who was responsible.        
	Numerous investigations sponsored by the government of Kerala and others had examined the operations of the plant which, based on scientific evaluation have not been shown to be the cause of local watershed issues, it said.

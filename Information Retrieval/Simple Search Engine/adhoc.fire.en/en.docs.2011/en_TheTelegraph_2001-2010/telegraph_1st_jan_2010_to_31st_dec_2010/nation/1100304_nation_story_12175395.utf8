          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 3: The weak Manmohan Singh repeatedly locked horns with iron man L.K. Advani in the Lok Sabha today, giving delighted Congress members a chance to take a cue from Sonia Gandhi and thump their desks.        
	Manmohan, who had had a running battle with Advani during the last Lok Sabha election campaign, took on Advani more than once today.         
	 The first tiff came about when Advani accused the government of betraying the military personnel on their one-rank-one-pension demand. The BJP leader said the government did not fulfil the promise made by Manmohan from the Red Fort.        
	Manmohan got up to say that all promises had been fulfilled, prompting Advani to question his claim. Advani said the defence personnel were extremely unhappy and were planning to agitate.        
	 Manmohan responded: It does not behove any member of the House to create a rift between the government and the services.         
	The BJP members were stunned as Sonia led Congressmen in thumping the desk. Advani had by then already attacked the government for naming every project after Nehru, Indira and Rajiv.        
	Advani swiftly moved to another uncomfortable topic, asking the Prime Minister to disclose the progress in unearthing the black money stashed away in Swiss banks and tax havens. The Prime Minister ignored him.        
	Advani charged the government with mismanaging the price situation. He then moved to relations with Pakistan and pointed out the blunders in Sharm-al-Sheikh.         
	The BJP leader also claimed that back-channel talks were being held for a secret deal on Kashmir. Advani asked the Prime Minister to take Parliament into confidence. The Prime Minister should reveal all details of official and unofficial talks.        
	The Prime Minister replied: I ask you one question; how many times did Jaswant (Singh) meet Strobe Talbott? What did he discussed with him was it discussed in Parliament any time? How do you expect me to answer hypothetical questions.        
	Advani responded: Because it has been reported.        
	Advani claimed that the American policy had shifted after the exit of George W. Bush. Manmohan reacted angrily: You are using this forum to sow seeds of  I will not say. What you are attributing to President Obama is certainly not true. In my discussions with President Obama, he has unambiguously said that there is no change in the US policy towards India and Pakistan.        
	This too evoked frenzied clapping from the treasury benches.

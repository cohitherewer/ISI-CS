          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today assured a delegation of eminent musicians that he would look into their demand for a dedicated TV channel on the classical arts and tax-free donations from companies to fund dance and music projects.        
	Sources said Singh met the 15 eminent musicians from the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions of classical music as part of efforts to promote the living heritage of the country and wanted to know how the government could help in spreading classical art forms.        
	The Prime Minister said the development of a dedicated television channel on culture could be examined, a culture ministry official said.         
	The delegation included Ajoy Chakrabarty, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Zakir Husain, Rajan Mishra, Shivkumar Sharma, Ravikiran Chitravina, T.N. Krishnan, Sudha Raghunathan and U. Shrinivas.        
	The delegation suggested that companies should be encouraged to fund projects on music and art as part of their corporate social responsibility.        
	Singh, who is also the minister for culture, asked ministry officials to look into whether the mandate of the National Culture Fund scheme, under which companies get tax exemption for supporting heritage structures, could be expanded. The sources said the scheme might be restructured to include living heritage.         
	Singh also assured the delegation that the culture ministry scheme for professional groups and individuals engaged in the performing arts might be revisited to carry forward the guru-shishya tradition.         
	The Prime Minister also told the delegation that he would discuss with chief ministers ways to strengthen state academies of art and culture and preserve dying gharanas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Threat from stone throwers
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Threat from stone throwers
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, July 24: Kashmirs stone-thrower brigade today threatened to kill anybody attempting to break the ongoing cycle of shutdowns in a signal to Pakistan-based separatist leader Syed Salahuddin who has called for an end to hartals.         
	A group of masked youths today surfaced in Srinagars old city with the blunt warning hours after the Muzaffarabad-based United Jehad Council said continuous shutdowns were not practical.         
	Those who break hartals will be responsible for their deaths. The shutdowns will continue till we achieve the desired goal, the masked youths told reporters in Srinagar.        
	Last night, in a telephone interview, Salahuddin, the United Jehad Council chief, said: It is not practical to keep a state under constant hartals and curfew. The strategy should be that the movement and the education of youths should not suffer. Schools and colleges should function and the economy should not suffer to the extent that people are starved.        
	The UJC chairman said the separatists must jointly plan a programme whereby the struggle against India continues and people do not suffer. Calls should be given for district-level marches. And when one district is holding a march the people in other areas should be allowed to continue with their normal work. This will not affect the economy and education.         
	Salahuddin is a rare voice from the separatist camp to have opposed weekly protests.         
	But the stone throwers who have engaged security forces in bitter clashes in the past six weeks have refused to relent.         
	The government and its forces have unleashed terror on the masses by killing innocents, so we have no alternative but to observe shutdowns, one of the masked youths said.         
	The youths are supporters of the Quit Kashmir programme led by Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani.         
	We respect him (Salahuddin) but he is not here. He is in Pakistan and we are the sufferers, one of the youths said.         
	The governments iron-fist policy has not yielded any results in the past six weeks.         
	The United Jehad Council chief, who also heads the Hizb-ul Mujahideen, has announced suspension of militant activities in areas where protests are taking place.

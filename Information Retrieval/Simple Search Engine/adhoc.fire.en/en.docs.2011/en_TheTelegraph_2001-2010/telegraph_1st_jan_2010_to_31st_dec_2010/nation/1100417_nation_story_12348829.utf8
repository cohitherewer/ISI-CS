          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, April 16: A promising young Danish painter drowned in the Ganga at Varanasi, the end ironically coming in a city he loved and a river he had celebrated through his works.        
	Reco Resmusen, 36, went for a dip to escape the 44 degrees Celsius heat at one of the citys famous ghats on Wednesday evening and drifted away, his wife watching from the edge of the river with their two-month-old daughter in her lap.        
	I cried for 10 minutes. There were people around but no one came to help. My cry didnt attract the attention of a soul , Serrah, 28, told police .        
	Ranjan Lal, an eyewitness and a local boatman, said the police arrived around 8pm, a few minutes after the incident at Assi Ghat, but didnt have divers. Two cops went into the waters but came back empty-handed.        
	It was only after an hour that the police got divers, who fished out a lifeless Reco following a two-hour search, eyewitnesses said.        
	Of course, the painter died from drowning but we are trying to examine if he had been under the influence of any intoxicant for he went down in a stretch of water that wasnt too deep, said police officer D.K. Trivedi.        
	Officials from the Danish embassy in Delhi arrived this afternoon and, with the help of local officials, completed Recos funeral.        
	Amarnath Shastri, a saint in Varanasi who knew Reco, said the painter had come to complete two of his paintings on the Ganga which he had started during one of his earlier visits. Unfortunately, he could not do that.         
	Peter Abraham, a friend of the artist who reached here today, couldnt bear the irony of it all. Reco had drawn some splendid images of the ghats of Varanasi but, ironically, that is where he had to die, he said.        
	Reco  who was from Copenhagen and had visited Varanasi twice before had been on a tour of India for the past five months, according to Serrah.         
	Their daughter, Estavia, was born two months ago when the couple were in Andhra Pradesh.         
	They had arrived in Varanasi from Chennai on April 7 and had put up at Shiva River View Guest House in Shivala Ghat, a riverside locality only around a kilometre from the spot of the tragedy at Assi Ghat.        
	India  its economic boom as well as its spiritualism  fascinated Reco, as did Varanasi with its old-world charm.

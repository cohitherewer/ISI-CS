The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sena fumes at SRK Pak gala
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sena fumes at SRK Pak gala
  - Star invited to london dinner by TV channel           AMIT ROY                          Shah Rukh Khan                                        
	London, Nov. 27: Shah Rukh Khan is a professional guy who will definitely honour a contract to appear at a Pakistani gala dinner in London on Sunday evening, organisers said today.        
	Whether the Bollywood superstar eventually keeps his promise to appear at the event being promoted by Prime TV, a Pakistani channel in the UK, remains to be seen in view of the attack mounted on him by the Shiv Sena.        
	It is inappropriate for Khan to be part of the event when India is observing the second anniversary of the 26/11 terror attacks, the report in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna said.        
	Approached by The Telegraph, those selling tickets to the event called the Shiv Sena comment unfortunate.        
	But tickets were still being sold today with no indication that Shah Rukh has reconsidered his decision to make an appearance.        
	He will come 110 per cent, said a man from a call centre selling the tickets. He will not come only if his plane crashes.        
	The event, promoted as a gala dinner with Shah Rukh Khan, is due to be held at the Park Plaza Westminster Bridge, one of Londons newer hotels located by the Thames a short distance from the Houses of Parliament.        
	Platinum seats are being offered for 176, gold for 141 and silver for 118, including value added tax.        
	Shah Rukhs presence would certainly add a great deal of value to proceedings for diners would demand their money back were he not to appear.        
	A fashion show is promised on promotional posters but no mention is made of fundraising. However, given the floods in Pakistan, it would be odd if money was not raised on such an occasion for victims.        
	This is not the first occasion when the Sena has targeted Shah Rukh but the actor, who appeals as much to Pakistanis as he does to his Indian fans, could argue that November 26 is the right time to try and bring India and Pakistan closer together.        
	He can help bridge the gap between the two sides, one of the ticket sellers said.        
	Not everyone takes such a generous view of Prime TVs intentions.        
	A senior executive on a rival television channel said: They have been struggling to sell tickets but it is a money-making exercise. Shah Rukh will make a brief appearance for which he will be paid a fee. This kind of event will also attract a lot of girls wanting to meet him.        
	A show business source told The Telegraph: Shah Rukh does not come cheap  (his fee will be) not less than 30,000. The reason why it wont be difficult for him to come is because he is filming in Germany. He can pop over. I cant see him not coming because so many people have bought tickets. This is basically a meet and greet.         
	But there is no transparency over whether this is a fundraiser or not. To be a charity, the organisers have to be registered with the Charity Commission, otherwise its illegal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP against water for Posco
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP against water for Posco
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 8: The BJP today strongly opposed the decision of Naveen Patnaiks government to supply the Mahanadis water from Jobra barrage to the proposed mega steel plant of Posco to be set up near Paradip port in Jagatsinghpur.         
	Describing the decision as anti-farmer and anti-people, senior BJP leader and former irrigation minister Bijoy Mohapatra accused the state of favouring big industrial houses and not farmers.        
	At a news meet here today, Mohapatra said the state had decided to allot water to the Posco plant without water management or route plans. Jobra barrage feeds water to Taladanda canal which is used by farmers of Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapara districts, he said.         
	We are not opposed to industrialisation. But we certainly oppose the diversion of water meant for irrigation, said BJP state president Jual Oram.

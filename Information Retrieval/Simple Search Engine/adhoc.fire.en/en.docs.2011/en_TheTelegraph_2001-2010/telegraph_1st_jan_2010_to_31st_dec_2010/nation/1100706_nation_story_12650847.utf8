	Thiruvananthapuram, July 5: All work and all play. Thats always been the motto at the football-crazy coastal village of Nainamvalappu in northern Kerala, which hasnt witnessed a single shutdown in two decades.        
	While life was paralysed in the rest of Kerala  by the second hartal in 10 days against the fuel price hike  fishermen in Nainamvalappu hauled in the monsoon catch, vendors sold them, and carpenters and mechanics plied their trade. Youths mended broken power lines and TV cables in preparation for Tuesdays World Cup semi-final.        
	No political party dares enforce hartals there  old-timers recall how they had brandished logs to drive away CPM workers trying to enforce a bandh 30 years ago.        
	Most of us are Muslims but we did not shut down even after the Babri demolition, said resident N.V. Subair. Two occasions when the hamlet had downed shutters spontaneously were the assassination of Indira Gandhi and the death of a local Muslim cleric.

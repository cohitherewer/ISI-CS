          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, April 28: The Supreme Court has let a man who killed his wife in a fit of drunken rage over her drinking get away lightly, converting the murder charge against him into culpable homicide not amounting murder.        
	Pundaliks life term of rigorous imprisonment, awarded by a trial court and later upheld by Bombay High Court, has been reduced to an eight-year jail term.         
	The top court accepted his lawyers contention that the farm labourer and father of three was entitled to leniency as he had committed the crime in the heat of passion.        
	It was also pointed out that Deepa, one of Pundaliks two daughters, hadnt supported the prosecutions case and that there was no other evidence on record to bring home an offence under Section 302 of the IPC (murder).         
	The apex court accepted the argument of Pundaliks lawyer that the case could at best be treated as culpable homicide not amounting to murder.         
	 Even if the prosecution version is accepted in its entirety, a case under Section 302, IPC, is not made out because the occurrence took place in the course of a sudden quarrel in the heat of passion, a bench of Justices D.K. Jain and Deepak Verma said. The judgment was delivered last week.        
	The court also took note of the fact that the couple used to have frequent quarrels and on the day of the crime, Pundalik got infuriated seeing his wife Rukhmabai in an inebriated condition and assaulted her with the wooden handle of an axe.        
	She died the same day. The autopsy report said shock from the haemorrhage following the fracture of the left femur (thigh bone) led to her death.         
	In the doctors opinion, such a fatal injury could be caused by an axes handle.        
	Pundalik lived in a one-room tenement near the fields of his employer in Maharashtras Akola district with his family  comprising his wife, daughters Jyoti and Deepa, and son Santosh. Pundaliks mother also stayed with them.         
	The prosecution had said that he was in the habit of beating his wife over petty matters after consuming liquor.         
	On the day of the incident, June 2, 2002, Pundalik and his wife had visited Yaolkhed town in Akola from where both returned drunk.         
	At home, Pundalik asked Rukhmabai why she had consumed liquor, sparking a verbal duel. He then assaulted her in front of their daughters.        
	Pundalik had gone to the police station and lodged a report saying his wife had died from excessive drinking. However, another report was filed by a neighbour of Rukhmabais parents accusing Pundalik of murder.        
	During the course of the investigation, the accused led the police to the axe, his bloodstained shirt and a piece of sari.        
	Pundalik was tried  he had pleaded innocence during the proceedings  and convicted of murder by the Akola sessions court.         
	The prosecution, in order to establish Pundaliks guilt, examined as many as 13 witnesses, including daughter Deepa who didnt back the case against her father.        
	Pundalik appealed to Bombay High Court but his hopes of getting any relief were dashed.         
	The court upheld his conviction and sentence on October 23, 2008.

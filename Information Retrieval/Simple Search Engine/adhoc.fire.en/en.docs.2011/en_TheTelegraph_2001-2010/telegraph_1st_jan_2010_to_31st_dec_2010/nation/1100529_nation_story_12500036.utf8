	Jhargram, May 28: For close to 12 hours, twins Shireen and Sarmin clung to life  screaming, sobbing, struggling to stay awake  as rescue workers rummaged through the mangled mass of metal with gas-cutters.        
	Amra aschi tomader jonyo aar kicchu khon (we are coming for you just a few minutes more), shouted one of the workers on finally sighting the six-year-olds around 1pm on today, trapped under a broken bunk barely three feet away from him.        
	There was no answer this time.        
	They were calling out to us just 20 minutes ago. They must have passed out, said the worker to a colleague, reaching out to pull the two from under the bunk with a pile of bodies on top, including their parents.        
	Aunt Naseem Ahmeds cry of despair as the two bodies were laid out on the ground next to the tracks moments later confirmed the worst fears of everyone who had been waiting there since morning to see the twins being rescued.        
	Ye kaise ho sakta hain? Abhi to zinda tha (How can this happen? They were alive a little while ago), Naseem said, beating her hands on her chest.         
	Shireen and Sarmin were accompanying their parents  teachers Syed Javed Alam, 35, and Sabiya Alam, 30  grandmother Mehsar Jahan and aunt Zohar Jahan to Mumbai on their first big holiday when the trip ended tragically on Maoist-sabotaged tracks.        
	Mehsar and Zohar were the only members of the family to be brought out alive from coach S4. Both are critically injured.        
	Naseem, who had reached Jhargram from Calcutta in the morning after hearing about the train being derailed, told The Telegraph that she hadnt give up hope of seeing her nieces alive until the rescue workers brought them out.         
	You heard their voices, didnt you? Both of them fought through the night and the entire morning. Its a shame we couldnt save them, she cried.        
	The twins were not the only ones in coach S4 not to pull through after waiting to be rescued for almost 12 hours.         
	Sirajjul Sheikh of Kandi in Murshidabad was heard shouting for help throughout the morning even as rescue workers and villagers frantically removed the debris to find him. When the rescue team finally located and extricated him from the coach around 1pm, the middle-aged Sirajjul was dead.         
	Nephews Hassan and Pier Sheikh, who were also on the train, escaped through an opening in the damaged coach but couldnt trace their uncle despite hearing his cries.        
	The trio were part of a group of six who had boarded the train at Howrah to travel to Mumbai to collect work permits for a stint as construction workers in Saudi Arabia. This was to be a trip to a better future for all of us and look how it ended up, said Hassan, who suffered minor injuries in the crash.

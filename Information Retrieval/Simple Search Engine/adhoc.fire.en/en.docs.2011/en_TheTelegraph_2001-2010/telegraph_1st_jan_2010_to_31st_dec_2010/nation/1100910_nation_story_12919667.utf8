          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: India is not in any rush to send a team to China as part of a cultural exchange programme after Beijing said delegates from the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir should not be included, government sources revealed.        
	An Indian delegation of professionals from various fields was to visit China later this year as part of an annual exchange programme.         
	A Chinese delegation had visited India last year on New Delhis invitation. However, even as the dates were being finalised, the Chinese government sent an email requesting India not to include delegates from the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir. A flurry of e-mails later, the Chinese continued to stand their ground.         
	India made it clear to the officials that they could not dictate terms on the composition of the delegation, the sources said.        
	What offended the Indian side most was that this time Beijing was making an issue not just of Arunachal Pradesh but the entire Northeast. The Chinese attitude has been offending in the extreme to us, a top government source said.        
	India has decided not to send the delegation till such time as China relents.

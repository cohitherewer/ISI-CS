The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoists on military mind 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Maoists on military mind 
          SUJAN DUTTA                                              A.K. Antony      
	New Delhi, June 1: Defence minister A.K. Antony today met the chiefs of the armed forces to be briefed on force levels and projections if the militarys involvement in the offensive against Maoists is deepened.        
	Antonys meeting with the chiefs of staff committee and the defence secretary comes ahead of a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) later this week. Last week, home minister P. Chidambaram also called the army chief, Gen. V.K. Singh, for his assessments and inputs as the security establishment carries out a review of the counter-Maoist operations.        
	Currently, the Indian Air Force has deployed six helicopters in the rebel zones to transport police forces and evacuate casualties. The armys role is limited to training special units of central and state police forces.        
	The CCS will be meeting to review the situation in the counter-Maoist drive in the wake of the killing of civilians and policemen in Dantewada. There is also a deep suspicion that the Maoists or a front propped up by them had a hand in sabotaging railway tracks in last weeks disaster in West Midnapore in which 150 people were killed.        
	Although Antony had in the past ruled out deploying the army or committing military assets in the offensive, he has been calibrating his position after successive strikes by the rebels took a heavy toll in the last two months.        
	At the National Defence Academy in Khadakvasla near Pune on Monday, the defence minister, asked if there was a difference of opinion in the government on the use of the military, had said: There is no split mandate. The issue of the use of armed forces will be discussed threadbare.        
	He said the government was examining the pros and cons of deploying the army in anti-Naxalite operations. Todays meeting with the chiefs of the armed forces is part of the assessment and policy-making exercise.        
	The decision will be taken by the CCS that comprises, apart from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, Chidambaram, external affairs minister S.M. Krishna and Antony. Krishna may not be present at the CCS because he is scheduled to visit the US.        
	The armed forces will also accept whatever decision the government takes and implement it with vigour and commitment, Antony had said.         
	Defence ministry sources said that in todays meeting Antony reviewed all dimensions of the security situation in the country. The meeting lasted an hour and a half.         
	The chiefs of staff committee comprises Air Chief Marshal P.V. Naik, who is its chairman, army chief Gen. Singh, and the navy chief, Admiral Nirmal Verma. Defence secretary Pradeep Kumar was also there at the meeting.

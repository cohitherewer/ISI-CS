The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal brain behind UP rail racket
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bengal brain behind UP rail racket
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, April 24: A man from Calcutta ran a railway job racket in Lucknow over the phone posing as a senior Trinamul Congress leader and swindled over a hundred youths out of about Rs 4 lakh each, police said today.        
	Abhijit Banerjee and his local operatives used an elaborate plan involving a fake Northern Railway website, a note carrying a forged signature of Mamata Banerjee, fake appointment letters and even medical tests at a private Lucknow hospital, officers said.         
	Abhijits name as ringleader spilled out after Lucknow police arrested two local gang members  brothers Ravi Prakash Tiwari and Brijesh Tiwari  last evening.        
	We are not sure if Abhijit ever visited Lucknow. He seems to have spoken to the victims over the phone, an officer said.        
	Trinamuls Bengal president Subrata Bakshi told The Telegraph in Calcutta: We have no office-bearer called Abhijit Banerjee.        
	The racket had a second outstation leader  Mohammad Anwar from Bihars Siwan  who claimed proximity to a former railway minister from his state.         
	The (Tiwaris) mentioned Abhijit Banerjee and even showed his visiting card and a copy of his identity card. They also showed relevant papers of Anwar, said Rajiv Krishna, deputy inspector-general, Lucknow range. Abhijits I-card apparently showed him as a Trinamul national general secretary.        
	Krishna said Abhijit had an office in Calcuttas Burrabazar and probably stayed in Howrah. Uttar Pradesh police have sought the help of Calcutta police to arrest him.        
	After the Tiwaris arrest yesterday, scores of their victims laid siege to Lucknows Hazratganj police station. They said the racketeers had shown them what they thought was the Northern Railway website, featuring their names as candidates selected for recruitment. Anup Singh of Lucknow said: I paid Rs 4 lakh; I am ruined now.        
	The tricksters also used a letter on a fake railway ministry pad, carrying a forged signature of Mamata, that said the ministry would hire over 300 people.

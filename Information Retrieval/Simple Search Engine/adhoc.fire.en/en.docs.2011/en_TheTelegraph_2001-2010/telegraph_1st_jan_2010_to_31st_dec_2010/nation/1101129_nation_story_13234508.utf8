          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 28: The government today told the BJP the Prime Minister would personally respond to questions in Parliament on the telecom scam and the Supreme Court would supervise the CBI investigation but the Opposition party stuck to its demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe.        
	Chances of Parliament resuming normal work tomorrow are remote now.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, the Congresss chief trouble-shooter, today called up NDA chairperson L.K. Advani and leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj to convince them that their obstinate position was unreasonable and a middle path would have to be found to allow Parliament to function.         
	Mukherjee made two additional offers  the Prime Minister would personally respond to the Oppositions queries in both Houses, and the CBI would investigate all aspects of the scandal under the supervision of the Supreme Court.         
	But the BJP leaders said nothing less than a JPC probe would do.         
	They said the spectrum scam had already been discussed in Parliament in the past and there was no point talking about it again.         
	Mukherjee is believed to have cited examples from the past to buttress his arguments that the Opposition and the government always struck a compromise in a democracy.         
	Sources said Mukherjee reminded Advani and Swaraj that the Congress too had scaled down from a similar demand on the Tehelka and coffin scandals when the NDA was in power and had allowed Parliament to function.         
	Mukherjee said the UPA government was not trying to block the investigation or a debate unlike the NDAs stubborn refusal to listen to the Opposition on the Tehelka scam. He repeated that the public accounts committee was looking into the 2G scam.         
	The BJP leaders wanted to know how the government would ensure Supreme Court supervision of the CBI probe into the 2G scam. But they added that even if that happened, a JPC probe was required.         
	Mukherjee then told them the Opposition should explore other options.         
	Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar may now call an all-party meeting tomorrow to find a way out.         
	Tata backs PM        
	Tata group chief Ratan Tata has said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh did not deserve to bear humiliation over the spectrum scam.        
	I want to say that it has hurt me to see what he (Singh) has gone through in the past weeks... in Parliament... the pressure... the innuendoes and the pressure he has been going through to resign and so on, Tata told NDTV.        
	Complimenting Congress president Sonia Gandhi for supporting Singh publicly, Tata said: And here again I think this is the responsibility of the parliamentarians to transact, to govern the country and not to adjourn Parliament every day.

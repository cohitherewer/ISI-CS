          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 1: The Assembly today passed a bill to impose a cess on commercial vehicles to create a welfare fund for transport workers.        
	The cess, which will not cover private vehicles used by households, is expected to be not more than 10 per cent of the road tax.        
	For the benefit of motor transport workers, the West Bengal Motor Transport Workers Welfare Cess Bill, 2009, seeks to levy a cess on commercial vehicles carrying passengers or goods, state labour minister Anadi Sahu told the House while presenting the bill.         
	Commercial vehicles include private buses, minibuses, trucks, matadors, taxis and autorickshaws, Sahu said.         
	The bill will cover only commercial vehicles. We dont have plans to levy the cess on non-commercial vehicles, state transport minister Ranjit Kundu said.         
	The minister said the cess would help a create fund that would be spent on welfare schemes for 14 to 15 lakh people working in the commercial transport sector. They include drivers, helpers and those working in garages.         
	The list of benefits will include provident fund, medical and education allowance, and financial help for workers injured in accidents as well as the families of the victims.        
	Sahu told Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim that no decision had been taken yet on whether the cess would be imposed on commercial vehicles from other states plying in Bengal.         
	The government is yet to decide whether migrant workers would come under the security cover.

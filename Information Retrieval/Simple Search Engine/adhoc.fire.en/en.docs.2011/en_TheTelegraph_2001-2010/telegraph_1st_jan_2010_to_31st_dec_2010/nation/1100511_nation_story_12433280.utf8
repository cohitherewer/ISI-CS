          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Subhas Yadav                                  
	Patna, May 10: Lalu Prasads brother-in-law and Rajya Sabha member Subhas Yadav is in trouble.        
	While the RJD chief is believed to have made up his mind not to give a second Rajya Sabha term to Suhbas, a Patna court today ordered lodging of FIR against the MP, his wife Renu Devi and three others in connection with abducting a liquor shop employee here.        
	Patna civil courts chief judicial magistrate S.P. Singh took cognisance of a complaint filed by Umesh Singh, an employee, who alleged that the five, including Subhash, had kidnapped him when he had gone to demand payment of dues for liquor bought by them.        
	The court asked senior superintendent of police (Patna) to direct the Jakkanpur police station here to lodge an FIR for kidnapping against them and submit the investigation report to the court as early as possible.        
	On April 28, Umesh moved the court, seeking a probe into the charges levelled by him against Subhash and others.        
	Sources in the RJD revealed that Lalu has no space to accommodate Subhas this time in the Rajya Sabha. Given the numerical strength, the RJD-LJP combination, at best, can claim only two seats of the Upper House.        
	The sources revealed LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan, who lost Hajipur seat in the last Lok Sabha poll, was all set to be the first candidate from the RJD-LJP combination.         
	And Lalu might go for a non-Yadav on another seat in a bid to rope in other castes, which have shifted their loyalty to the NDA in Bihar.        
	In a bid to please Lalu, Subhas had virtually pounced on Vice-President A.H. Ansari snatching copies of the womens reservation bill and tearing it when it was presented in the Rajya Sabha in March.         
	Lalu has been opposing the bill tooth and nail. But Subhass bravado is apparently not sufficient to please the boss this time.

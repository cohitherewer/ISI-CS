	West Sayville (New York), Aug. 17: Without doubt, many more people line the sidewalks to see the St. Patricks Day Parade in Manhattan than to watch the St. Mary Malankara Indian Orthodox Churchs annual Assumption Day Parade which began here on Sunday with the usual blowing of the kumbu horn and the dancing of the koladi by the congregations teenage girls, dressed in saris and banging sticks.        
	But the Indians parade has its long-time devotees: neighbourhood residents, mostly, who say they look forward to the procession because it is practically the only time when the people of the congregation venture outside, not counting getting in and out of their cars.        
	None of St. Marys 100 or so parishioners live in West Sayville, a predominantly white, middle-class community on Long Islands South Shore where in the last few decades a surfeit of empty church buildings has attracted various religious communities on wheels.        
	The Indian congregants drive in from Queens, Brooklyn, western Nassau County and even New Jersey and Staten Island, to worship in a former Dutch Reformed Church building they bought in 1992.         
	Inside, they speak Malayalam, and they worship according to an Orthodox Christian liturgy that traces its origins to the teachings of the apostle Thomas.        
	At an hour or more, their road time is longer than the average trip to church but national surveys show that most Americans travel farther to religious services than they used to, just as they journey farther to work. Except for Orthodox Jews, who are required to do so, hardly anyone walks to a house of worship anymore  a shift in the landscape that may be best illustrated by the now-unimaginable tableau of Norman Rockwells 1953 work Walking to Church.        
	In West Sayville, the congregation and its parade have assumed a mysterious, almost mythical status, despite the processions official permit and the three Suffolk County police cars assigned to traffic control.        
	If you didnt actually see this with your own eyes, and some people around here havent, you might think I was making it up, said Christopher Bodkin, a local historian and a former town councilman. I mean it is so rococo, wonderful, Hindu-esque, with the flower petals, the girls holding the decorative parasols  everything but the elephants.        
	On Sunday, people watched with a mixture of fascination and neighbourly nonchalance as the procession made its way around the block, marking the annual observance of Marys ascent into heaven.         
	At the front was a float with posters of Mary and Thomas and other saints perched on cottony white clouds. Then came the men playing the Indian kumbu horn and chemda drums, the women keeping time with little brass cymbals called Ilathalam, then the littlest girls in angel wings and then the teenagers dancing.        
	The congregations women followed behind, pastel-coloured saris billowing in the breeze as they flung paper flowers of red and blue. Bringing up the rear was a car carrying the Paulose Adai, the parish priest, whose plaintive singing of the devotional hymns was greatly amplified from a loudspeaker on the vehicles roof.        
	Usually, theyre very quiet people, said Kathy Ahern, a neighbour, shouting to be heard over the din. I mean, this is the only day we hear anything from them at all.         
	Across the street, some people sat on their porches, glancing occasionally over the tops of their newspapers at the passing parade.        
	Malankara Christians trace their origins to the first century AD, when St Thomas is said to have taken the heavily travelled trade route from the eastern Mediterranean to Kerala, where today about 20 per cent of the population is Christian. They have had churches in the US since the early 20th century, but have grown significantly since the 1970s, when immigration policy opened the doors to many nurses trained in the Christian hospitals of Kerala. Nationwide, there are about 100 parishes.

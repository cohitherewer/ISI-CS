          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          A notice in Hyderabad saying the Charminar in Hyderabad would remain closed on Thursday. (PTI)     
	Lucknow, Sept. 30: Archaeological evidence gathered from Ayodhya seven years ago could not go far in settling the dispute over ownership of land, with each judge interpreting it differently today.         
	One of the questions in court was whether the pillars inside and outside the disputed mosque had any images of Hindu gods. The temple petitioners had claimed that human and animal figurines on the pillars belonged to the age of Ram.         
	The three-judge bench of Allahabad High Court had on March 5, 2003, said that archaeological evidence is important to decide the issue if there was any temple on the disputed land.         
	But on the basis of reports submitted by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the three judges today held different views on the issue.         
	Justice Dharam Veer Sharma ruled that the relics and figurines culled from the excavations were proof that the land belonged to Ram.         
	Justice Sudhir Agarwal did not go that far but said the excavations formed a bulk of indirect evidence suggesting Hindus had used the land.         
	Justice S.U. Khan held that from the material evidence on record, including that from excavations, both the parties (Hindus and Muslims) have failed to prove commencement of their title (that the land belonged to them).         
	The ASI had begun excavations on March 12, 2003, on the courts orders. Earlier, in February that year, a radar survey of the land had been conducted.         
	Under court-appointed observers, including Faizabad district judge H.S. Dubey and another judge from the same district, M.A. Siddiqui, the ASI submitted reports in two volumes on August 7, 2003. The first volume contained 10 chapters on the interpretation and the second volume had site photographs and 235 items found during excavations. These included 62 human and 131 animal figurines, an advocate said.         
	Seven ASI witnesses deposed for the Muslim side, including Ashoke Datta, senior lecturer of archaeology from the University of Calcutta, and Jaya Menon of Aligarh Muslim University. Four archaeologists, including R. Nagaswami and Jayant P. Srivastava, deposed for the Hindu side.         
	An advocate for the mosque had argued that the archaeological evidence was coloured by interpretative scenarios which might not constitute convincing material evidence.         
	Zafaryab Jilani, an advocate for the Sunni Central Wakf Board, said there was no need for one to go for interpretative archaeological evidence to prove the land dispute when we have over 400 years of recorded evidence in support of the mosque.         
	On the other side, Ranjana Agnihotri, an advocate for the Akhil Bharat Sri Ramjanmabhoomi Punrudhar Samity, said: The archaeological evidences should hold the key to the settlement of the dispute.        
	Besides archaeological evidence, the court could refer to other historical documents, including the Gazetteers Travel Accounts, Babarnama Baqi Tashkhendi, East India Gazetteer 1828 and Gazetteer of the Territories 1858.

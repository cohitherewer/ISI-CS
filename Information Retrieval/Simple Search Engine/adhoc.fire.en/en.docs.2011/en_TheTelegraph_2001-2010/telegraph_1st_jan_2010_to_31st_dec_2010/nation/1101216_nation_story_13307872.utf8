          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 15: This time round, the stunts on the sets are for real.        
	A fight has erupted between stuntmen of the Telugu film industry with those from Andhra insisting that colleagues from Tamil Nadu should go back to their own state to free up jobs for local artistes.        
	The discontent boiled over on the sets of Kandireega last week when some 50 drunk artistes got into a physical fight with stuntmen performing with the film unit. I dont know where those people came from, said actor Ram Charan. They simply barged in and started fighting.        
	But what started as friction between stuntmen in early December has now snowballed into a much bigger protest that has paralysed the Telugu film industry. Over the past seven days, producers, directors, technicians and other staff have boycotted shooting to express solidarity with local artistes.        
	The net effect is that since December 8 the industry has been losing up to Rs 5 crore a day, sources said. The shooting of over 30 films has stopped midway. Some 100 more in various stages of production have run into scheduling problems.        
	The fate of at least a dozen films due for release before December 31 is hanging in the balance. Some of the big-budget films with stars in the lead are Venkateshs Nagavalli, a remake of Rajnikanths Chandramukhi, Nagarjunas Ragada, Ravitejas Mirapakaya and NTR Juniors Shakti.        
	A prominent producer and financier, Bellamkonda Suresh, said: Earlier, many of our films were scheduled for Sankranti release in January. But we brought it forward to beat the political unrest expected over Telangana when the Sri Krishna committee report comes out on December 31.        
	The boycott of all shooting and production work has also hit thousands of junior actors, technicians, craftsmen and ancillary staff who are generally very busy in the run-up to the new year. I used to work two shifts of seven hours a day from October because many producers and directors aim to finish films by December first week. Now, I am jobless, said Sai Gopal, a studio technician.        
	Prakash Chowdhury, a caterer who had seven teams working at city studios, said: We anticipated a big bonus from production houses this year-end. Now everything looks gloomy.        
	Taking advantage of the industry shutdown, the producers council has stepped up its long-pending demands. It has threatened not to resume work till actors are paid less and made to work for the whole six hours of a single shift  many work only three  and budgets are downsized.        
	Meetings between the Andhra Pradesh Film Chamber of Commerce, Telugu Film Producers Council, Movie Artistes Association and the Andhra Pradesh Film Employees Federation have ended in heated arguments and walkouts.

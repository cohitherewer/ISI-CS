The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi relief for couples from all states
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi relief for couples from all states
                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 13 (PTI): Couples facing problems in getting their marriages registered in their home states have reason for cheer.        
	The Delhi cabinet today decided to allow couples from anywhere in the country to get their marriages easily registered in the city provided the marriage takes place in Delhi.        
	Under the new rules, the marriage will have to be solemnised in an area of the city that falls under the jurisdiction of the registrar who is approached for the registration.        
	But the couple will no longer have to prove that either of them or the parents of at least one of them have been residents of the city for at least a month.        
	We have decided to simplify the rules for registration of marriages in the city, Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit said after the cabinet meeting.        
	The decision comes in the backdrop of several honour-killing cases in the city and neighbouring states, which prompted a city court to urge the government to relax the rules. A clause in the Delhi Hindu Marriage Registration Rules, 1956, has been a hurdle in the way of couples from other states.        
	After a notification is issued, couples from anywhere in the country will be able to easily get their marriages registered in Delhi, an official said.        
	The marriage has to take place in the area that falls under the jurisdiction of the registrar who is approached for the registration, he added.

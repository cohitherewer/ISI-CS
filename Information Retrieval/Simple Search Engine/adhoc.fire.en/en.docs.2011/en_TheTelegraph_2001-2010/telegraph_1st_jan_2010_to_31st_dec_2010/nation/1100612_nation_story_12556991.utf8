          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 11: A young software engineer set to tie the knot next week was found dead in her apartment today, apparently killed by her fianc who police said felt he was being pressured into getting married.        
	South Delhi additional DCP S.K. Jain said Monica Jaiswals boyfriend Ravi Mishra, also a software engineer, had confessed to killing her.        
	The two were to have got married on Monday.        
	Monica, an employee of IBM in Gurgaon, had come to Delhi three years ago from Kanpur. She met Ravi a year later and fell in love with him.        
	Police sources said the 22-year-old recently told her parents she and Ravi, who is from Gorakhpur, wanted to get married. The family had planned a November wedding, but the couple were all set to tie the knot in a Delhi court on June 14.        
	Monicas father Ravinder Jaiswal, who came over from Kanpur, said he decided to visit his daughter after repeated calls to her phone went unanswered. When he reached her rented flat this morning, he found the door locked from outside. The police later broke open the door to find her body on the mattress.        
	There were injury marks on the girls forehead. We came to know she had called up her mother two days ago and seemed normal at that time. The girls family has informed us that while they were agreeable to the marriage, Mishras family wasnt too keen. Mishra has confessed to the murder and it seems that he killed her because he felt that he was being pressured into getting married, DCP Jain said.        
	Monicas father Ravinder said both Ravi and his daughter had seemed happy.        
	We were also happy with her choice. She was a kind girl. I cant believe she was murdered by the man she loved.        
	Ravinder said he didnt know Monica and Ravi had planned a court marriage on Monday. The date for the November wedding hadnt been set yet, he said, breaking down.

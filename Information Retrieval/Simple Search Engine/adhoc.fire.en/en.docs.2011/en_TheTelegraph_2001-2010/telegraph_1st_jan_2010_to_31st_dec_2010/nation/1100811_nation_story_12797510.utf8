The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Happy to be alive, say Bengali tourists
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Happy to be alive, say Bengali tourists

	New Delhi, Aug. 10: Shanti Ranjan Ray shuddered. In his 80-year-old life, he said, he had never seen anything as monstrous as the cloudburst that reduced picturesque Leh into a canvas of devastation.        
	It was dreadful. So many people died and most of the bodies are yet to be traced. I have never been witness to such a large-scale tragedy in my lifetime, he said in the conference room at Banga Bhavan. He is one of the 49 Bengali tourists who had just flown down from Ladakh on Monday.        
	A resident of Uttarpara in Hooghly district, Ray and 23 others had been holed up all day in hotel KSAR on Ladakhs Fort Road the night the killer cloud burst. Fortunately, as it turned out in hindsight, a landslide on August 5 had forced them to cancel their trip to Tso Morari Lake.        
	Thank God, we are safe. We are happy to be alive but feel very sad thinking about those who lost everything, he said.        
	The oldest among the tourists, Ray said the experience had been so terrifying that people in Leh had begun to get twitchy whenever they saw dark clouds gathering in the sky.        
	The people there are very scared. They begin to run in panic and try to find high ground whenever they see dark clouds. They anticipate the flash floods will happen again, he said.         
	Another member of the group, Anup Das, said it was divine providence that they were still alive. Had the landslides not forced them to cancel their trip to Lake Tso Morari, there was no knowing what would have happened, he said.        
	It was raining heavily and we had to return midway because of landslides. It was nothing major but we decided to go back, said Das, 45, a resident of Tollygunge and an employee of the Bengal labour department.        
	It was divine intervention that we came back. Otherwise, anything could have happened.        
	The morning after the cloudburst, the tourists were stunned by what they saw. Overnight, the water had risen to about 4 feet on the streets. In some places, mounds of stones and slush had begun to form.        
	The local people told us they had never seen anything like this in 30 years, said Tultul Mukherjee, 50, of Dum Dum, accompanied by husband Akhil Mukherjee and son Arup, who works in a private firm in Calcutta.        
	As most telephones had gone dead, the tourists could not call their families back home, Tultul said. For a while, we were totally cut off from the world. Everyone was frantically looking for phones that were working. With none in sight, we could only pray.        
	Sparing a good word for people who helped them, Tultul said: Many guides risked their lives to lead the tourists to safety. Monks and hotel owners made extraordinary efforts to help us.        
	Her husband, Akhil, said he had found it difficult to make himself eat the hot meal that the Banga Bhavan staff had served them. We dont feel like eating because the devastation flashes before our eyes. It was terrible. We escaped from the jaws of death.        
	But 80-year-old Ray said he would go to Leh again. My wife and son asked me not to go there at my age but I did not listen. Its such a beautiful place. I would love to go there again as I love adventure. Death can wait.        
	The group left for Calcutta by Duranto Express around 8pm on Monday.

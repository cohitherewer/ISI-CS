          STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 18: A wet Sunday has been forecast for Calcutta and its neighbouring areas.         
	Today, the city and its fringes received medium to heavy rainfall. Calcutta got 61mm of rain till 5.30pm. The showers brought the maximum temperature down to 28.2 degrees, four degrees below normal. The minimum temperature was 25.2 degrees, a degree below normal.         
	The weather is likely to stay cool and comfortable, said an official of the India Meteorological Department.        
	Meteorologists said a low-pressure trough had formed over the Bay of Bengal. The well-marked low-pressure trough now lies over the Orissa coast, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore. The city was likely to receive more rain in the next 24 hours, he added.        
	This relatively heavy rain could help reduce the deficit this year by 4 to 7 per cent, said a scientist at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida.

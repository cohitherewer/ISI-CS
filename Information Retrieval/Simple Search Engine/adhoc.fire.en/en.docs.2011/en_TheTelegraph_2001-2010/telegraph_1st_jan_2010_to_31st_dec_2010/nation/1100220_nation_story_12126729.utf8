                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      ESMA scare works in Puri
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Puri residents can hope for a clean town again                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 19: The governments threat to invoke the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) against striking workers of Puri municipality worked this evening with the staff calling off their agitation.        
	For five days today, the pilgrim town of Puri, 50km from here, has been stinking with litter.        
	The civic body workers stopped work from February 14 demanding pay hike according to the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations, payment of arrears and regularisation of long-serving temporary employees.        
	The agitating staff  comprising sweepers, scavengers and other municipality staff  said the Puri municipality did not implement the new pay scale unlike the 83 urban local bodies in the state.        
	Puri municipality chairperson Shantilata Pradhan blamed it on paucity of funds, resulting in arrears. We have already written to the government for special allocation of funds, she said.        
	As hygiene went for a toss with filth lying all over roads and drains overflowing with waste, causing hardship to tourists and local people alike, the civic body on Monday attempted to clean the roads with the help of NGOs. However, the striking workers had a scuffle with the authorities against engaging outsiders to clean the town.         
	While the agitators were continuing strike outside the municipality office this morning, the government sent a word that it would invoke the ESMA, if the strike did not end by this evening.         
	The ESMA can be invoked against the striking employees of Puri municipality, urban development secretary Arun Panda said in the morning.

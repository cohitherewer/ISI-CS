The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Safety stress but with cut in funds
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Safety stress but with cut in funds
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: The news of the train robbery started trickling in as Mamata Banerjee got ready to present the railway budget.        
	Hours later in Parliament, as she unveiled her plans for the next one year, the minister said security was one of her top priorities but added that safety wasnt the sole responsibility of the railways.        
	The general impression of the people is that the railways is solely responsible for this task. Law and order being a state subject, security cannot be ensured without the wholehearted co-operation of state governments. In fact, railways bears 50 per cent of the cost of state government railway police, she said.        
	Despite the stress on security, the allocation for the railway safety fund  a Rs 17,000-crore corpus set up in 2003 for a period of 10 years  has been slashed by Rs 579 crore from what had been set aside last year. This is in spite of 120-odd accidents last year.        
	The special corpus had been set up by then minister Nitish Kumar, on whose turf todays early-morning robbery took place. Sources said at least eight robbers boarded the Delhi-Howrah Janata Express near Jamui station in Bihar.        
	Mamata said the very visible railways was a soft target as she pointed out how frequent rail-rokos hit revenues. We lose substantial revenue due to frequent rail-rokos on various issues where these is no connection with the railways. If any local issue happens, grievances find their outlet on railways. As a result passengers suffer, business suffers and our economy suffers, she said.        
	The message may have also been intended at Maoists who, two weeks ago, blew up tracks in the Asansol division of Eastern Railway.        
	Mamata said there was a need to strengthen the railway protection force and to modernise it. The railways will raise 12 companies of women RPF personnel to be named Mahila Vahini, she said.        
	Sources said she was looking to recruit as many as 1,000 women for this force, to be deployed at important stations as well as on trains for ensuring the safety of women passengers. The railways also plans to raise crack women commando units from this battalion. Safety and security never sleeps and zero tolerance for accidents is our vision and mission, Mamata said.        
	The Trinamul chief said the railways were developing coaches with an automatic fire-and-smoke detection system on 20 pairs of long-distance trains as a pilot project.        
	Mamata said accidents at unmanned level crossings were a source of deep concern. Even now, there are about 17,000 unmanned level crossings, she said, adding that manning of around 3,000 level crossings was approved in 2009-10 and a further 1,000 would be taken up during this year. A special drive is being launched so that in the coming five years, all the unmanned crossings are manned, she said.         
	Mamata said the railways would spend about Rs 70 lakh per kilometre for implementing safety devices like the train protection warning system and Rs 22 lakh per kilometre for installing an anti-collision device.        
	Since the safety scheme was started seven years ago, the number of collisions has come down from 30 in 2001-02 to 13 in 2008-09. Derailments, too, have dropped sharply from 280 in 2001-02 to 85 in 2008-09.

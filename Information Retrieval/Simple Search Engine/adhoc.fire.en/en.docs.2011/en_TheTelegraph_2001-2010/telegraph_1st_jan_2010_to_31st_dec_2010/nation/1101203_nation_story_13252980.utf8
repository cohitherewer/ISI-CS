The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Munni stings Pak Munnis
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Munni stings Pak Munnis
                            
	Islamabad, Dec. 2: Munni has got a bad name, and Malaika is to blame.         
	The item number Munni badnaam hui... that was hot on the dance floor even before the film Dabangg set the record for the biggest Bollywood opening is proving a headache for Munnis across the border.         
	One Munni, a mother of two, is not able to open her little shop in Lahore thanks to the song. First it was the boys and then the men in the neighbourhood started coming to the shop and breaking into Munni badnaam hui, darling tere liye.         
	Every now and then, someone will come to my store and say Munni badnaam hui darling tere liye in front of my customers. First I didnt pay much attention and tried to ignore it, but then it became a routine and I started to get irritated, Munni told The Express Tribune newspaper.         
	Dabangg , which had an Id release in September, was a huge hit in Pakistan as in India and the song that Malaika Arora Khan grooves to in the film that her husband Arbaaz produced is playing everywhere. It played in the background when Geo News channel ran a montage of former US ambassador Anne Patterson in a segment on embarrassing disclosures in her diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks.         
	Even sober and reserved people have sung this song loudly while passing by my store. I have scolded many of them but they just laugh and run away. Finally, I couldnt take this behaviour any more and closed my shop for several days. Now its been two months and either I dont open my store or if I do open, then I dont sit at the counter myself, Munni said.         
	But even away from her shop, there is no running away from the song that is alleged to be a copy of the Pakistani number Ladka badnaam hua tere liye from a 1992 film.         
	Many times, they (boys) play it on tape to tease me. This song has really become a nightmare for me, she said.         
	Another Munni who wishes the song had never been written is a Lahore school principal, Shahida Munni, who is having to deal with students singing it when they sight her.         
	While walking in my neighbourhood, I am always scared that someone will start to sing the song. Most of the time my fears become reality as many boys either sing the song loudly or play it on the stereo, she said. They do it for fun. I dont understand how teasing someone can be fun for people. I am sick of this now and want this to come to an end, Shahida said.         
	This is not the first time women have faced problems because their name figures in a popular song. Punjabi singer Abrarul Haq was once directed by Pakistans Supreme Court to change the lyrics of a song because the use of the name Parveen embarrassed many women with the name.         
	Last month, three police officers were arrested and 30 others suspended after they forced three women to dance to the Munni song for five hours in a police station in Punjab province.                     WRITTEN WITH A PTI REPORT

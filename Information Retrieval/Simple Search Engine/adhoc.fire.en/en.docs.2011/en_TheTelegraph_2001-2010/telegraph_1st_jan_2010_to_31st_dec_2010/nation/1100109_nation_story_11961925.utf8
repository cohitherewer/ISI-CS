          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Jan. 8: Andhra Pradesh police have arrested Tushar Kant Bhattacharya, the most feared Maoist leader after Kishanji and a teenaged participant in the historic Tappalapur village raid 33 years ago.        
	Bhattacharya alias Srikant, 50, was produced in a Warangal court today following a plea by a human rights body, with police claiming he had been nabbed in Warangal.         
	Sources said the rebel was arrested in Hyderabad city two days ago but the police had kept the news under wraps till this evening.        
	Bhattacharya, a Bengali from Andhras Adilabad district, is chief of the Triple U unit, the CPI (Maoist) militant wing that operates in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Uttar (north) Bihar. He is also a member of the Maoist outfits international forum, which interacts with foreign rebels and rights groups.        
	The Tappalapur killings is a landmark event in the history of the revival of the Naxalite movement. In 1976, a group of Naxalites adopted Kondapalli Seetharamaiahs line of annihilating landlords. A squad of 16 killed several people in Tappalapur and a neighbouring village and burnt wads of promissory notes at landlords homes in another village.         
	The raid had prompted scores of landlords in Adilabad and Karimnagar to flee their homes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delta on flood alert
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delta on flood alert
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, May 26: With the monsoon  running ahead of schedule  set to hit the Kerala coast by June 1, at least 400 patches along the embankment of the Mahanadi delta system remain vulnerable to breaches that could flood huge swathes of land.        
	Pre-flood surveys detected the vulnerable patches on the entire network of the delta system last week, sources said.        
	The Mahanadi delta region has a network of nearly 4,000km of river embankments of the Mahanadi, Luna, Chitrotpala, Kathajodi, Daya, Bhargavi, Kushabhadra and Devi spread over Cuttack, Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur, Puri, Khurda and Nayagarh districts of coastal Orissa.        
	Meanwhile, as Laila triggered rains in coastal Orissa bringing respite from sweltering heat, the states special relief commissioner N.K. Sunderay met top officials and legislators in Cuttack on Monday for a pre-flood management session.        
	At the meeting of the natural calamity committee for the region, Sunderay took stock of the condition of the points of river embankments categorised as vulnerable.        
	Presenting reports by different irrigation divisions, Cuttack collector K.K. Mohanty said 61 river embankment points in the district had been identified as vulnerable.        
	He promised that the vulnerable points would be strengthened by June 15.         
	Mahanga MLA and school and mass education minister Pratap Jena underscored the need for flood control measures to prevent crop loss due to inundation of large tracts of farm land following floods in Sangenguti and Gobari rivers.        
	Barabati Cuttack MLA Debashis Samantaray called for effective measures to address rainwater drainage from within the city during floods in the Mahanadi and Kathajodi and strengthening of the ring road embankment that encircles it.        
	Sunderay said: Since drainage is a complex problem in the city it will receive priority in the flood control plan.

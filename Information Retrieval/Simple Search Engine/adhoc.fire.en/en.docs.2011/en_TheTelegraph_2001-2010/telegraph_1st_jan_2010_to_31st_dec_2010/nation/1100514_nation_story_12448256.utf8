	Hyderabad, May 13: Fourteen people died today from heat strokes across Andhra Pradesh, where the mercury has hit 49 degrees Celsius in some places with little sign of relief over the next few days.        
	Todays deaths have taken the toll in the past three days to 34. The casualty count for the entire season stands at 142, officials say.        
	Most of those who succumbed to the scorcher today and in the recent past were women, elderly persons and the homeless, the officials added.         
	The average temperature in most parts of the state, including Hyderabad, since Sunday has been around 45 degrees Celsius.

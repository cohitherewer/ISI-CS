The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rail rudder test for Mamata
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rail rudder test for Mamata

	July 19: Tragedy struck a note of irony for Mamata Banerjee this morning: after months of complaints that the railway minister was rarely in Delhi, she was in the capital when the train crash took place in Bengal.        
	But sources said Mamata was in Delhi over the weekend rather grudgingly. She was booked on a flight to Calcutta on Saturday but had to cancel the ticket on Pranab Mukherjees insistence, the sources said.        
	The finance minister, who is also the leader of the Lok Sabha, was learnt to have told her the monsoon session of Parliament starting July 26 was crucial. Her presence, he is said to have appealed to her, was needed at this evenings UPA meeting to discuss strategies to counter the Opposition onslaught over price rise and other issues.        
	That didnt eventually happen, with Mamata having to rush this morning to the train accident site in Bengal.        
	Mamata reached Sainthia around 11am in a special train and got down at Platform 3. Rescue operations were over by then.        
	A grim Mamata went to Platform 4 and looked at the mangled compartments of the Vananchal Express. After spending about 20 minutes at Sainthia, Mamata drove to the Suri Sadar Hospital in a convoy around noon.        
	When Mamata entered the male surgical ward, around 70 supporters, waving party flags, shouted: Mamata Banerjee zindabad. Annoyed, Mamata scolded them. What is going on? Dont do like this, many people have died, she shouted at them. The supporters fell silent but only for some time.        
	When Mamata approached Asraful Haque, a 12-year-old boy who suffered a head injury, the supporters crowded around the minister and pushed so hard that she knocked her knees against the bed, making it roll a few inches. It is impossible to stay here. Let us go out, Mamata told her supporters and led them out.        
	Asked if she would resign as railway minister, Mamata said: I will answer that later.        
	Mamata then drove to Suri railway station and took a train to Calcutta.        
	The challenge before Mamata now is to fashion a credible response to charges that her long absence from the capital has left Rail Bhavan rudderless  a word used by an officer of the utility itself.         
	In July so far, Mamata was seen in her office only since last Monday. But she devoted her attention to affairs of the Trinamul-run Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).        
	The sources said she spent much of last week seeking the finance ministers help to get an Asian Development Bank loan for the CMC. Mayor Sovan Chatterjee came to Delhi, too. He and Mamata met Mukherjee and Sam Pitroda over the loan and civic plans related to Calcuttas development.        
	Under normal circumstances, a ministers presence is not indispensable for the railways, for which Mamata had found some professionals.         
	However, her absence from cabinet meetings and whispers about tantrums ensured that any adversity to the utility would be tied to her way of functioning.        
	Mamata has to choose between the railway ministry and Bengal politics. She cannot do both, former railway minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.        
	Finance minister Mukherjee appeared to defend Mamata half-heartedly. An accident is an accident. How can one predict it?        
	With inputs from Barun Ghosh, Soumi Bhattacharya and Abhijeet Chatterjee

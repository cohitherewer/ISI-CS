The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Telangana unrest takes IPL out of Hyderabad
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Telangana unrest takes IPL out of Hyderabad
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA      
	Hyderabad, Feb. 13: The champions will have to fight to retain their crown without home support.        
	For the second year in a row, Hyderabad wont get to host an Indian Premier League match with the organisers today shifting all matches scheduled to be held in the state to Nagpur and Mumbai out of concerns over the Telangana agitation.        
	Defending champions Deccan Chargers first game, the tournament opener against Kolkata Knight Riders on March 12, had already been shifted to Mumbai. The six remaining games  four in Hyderabads spanking new Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium and two in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam  have been distributed between Navi Mumbai and Nagpur.         
	IPL commissioner Lalit Modi confirmed the move on his Twitter page. Hyd games have moved as follows  opening  DY Patil, Next 3 Nagpur 19, 21, 28 March, 5, 10 and 12 aprl at DY Patil, he posted. The matches on March 19 and 21 were scheduled at the Visakhapatnam District Cricket Association Stadium.        
	The decision is a setback for the Congress government which had pleaded with Indian cricket bosses not to take any such step.         
	Chief minister K. Rosaiah had himself written to former Indian cricket board chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday asking him to intervene and ensure that the matches are not taken out of Andhra.         
	Sports minister K. Venkata Reddy had gone a step further and asked the Deccan Chargers to boycott the tournament if its home games were moved out.        
	A furious Venkata Reddy, who hails from the Telangana region, gave the IPL organisers 24 hours to reverse their move, but did not specify what he planned to do if the decision was not rescinded.         
	How can he (Modi) do that? the minister said. How can the IPL insult the chief minister who wrote to them personally on the issue a few days ago?        
	Venkata Reddy also reiterated his earlier call to the Deccan Chargers to boycott the tournament if the IPL persisted with the decision.         
	The Chargers said they could not possibly boycott the IPL and accepted the decision to play its home games in Nagpur and Mumbai.         
	How can we as defending champions and after investing so much in a star team walk out at the last minute for no tangible reason other than a political agitation, which has no connection with cricket? said a spokesman for the IPL team.        
	G. Vinod, president of the Hyderabad Cricket Association, said they had not been consulted by either the IPL or the Indian board about the move.         
	We have not received any official information, neither HCA nor the chief ministers office. How and why should we take a Twitter message as official confirmation? he said.        
	Sources said Pawar had called up Rosaiah and expressed helplessness in view of the Union home ministry alerts regarding Hyderabad, but offered to help ensure some matches at Visakhapatnam if the government could gear up for the occasion.        
	Rosaiah, the sources said, had offered all support and assured Pawar that he would appoint two senior IPS and IAS officials to co-ordinate with the IPL and the Board of Control for Cricket in India on the infrastructure needed.        
	Concerns over the law and order situation in Andhra had resulted in the shifting of an ODI between India and Sri Lanka from Visakhapatnam last December.         
	Two ODIs slotted in Hyderabad during the England womens teams tour of India have now been split between Bangalore and Mumbai.         
	Spectators were barred from entering the stadium for the first two days of the Duleep Trophy final between West Zone and South Zone in Hyderabad because of a perceived security threat.         
	The Chargers practice T20 matches in Hyderabad last month were disrupted by Telangana agitators who barged into the grounds and scared away the players and umpires.

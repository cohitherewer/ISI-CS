  - SSC to have authority to overrule schools rejecting candidates        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                  
	Calcutta, April 1: The state government today got the West Bengal School Service Commission (SSC) Act, 1997, amended to ensure that state-aided high schools cannot challenge the candidature of SSC-recommended aspirants while filling teaching posts.        
	The amendment empowers the government to direct the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education to overrule the managing committee or the administrator of a state-aided school if it refuses to appoint an SSC-recommended candidate.        
	The managing committee of a high school comprises the headmaster, six elected guardians representatives, three teachers, one nominee of the state education department, a person from the locality with an interest in education, a donor and the founder if he or she is alive.        
	Under the amendment, schools will have to appoint a candidate within two months of the SSC sending the recommendation.        
	The amendment will ensure smooth functioning of schools, school education minister Partha Dey said during the discussion on the amendment bill before it was passed.        
	Dey said several courts in the state had suggested that such a provision be included in the amendment bill.        
	Many teaching posts lie vacant because of schools refusal to accept SSC-recommended candidates.         
	The SSC was set up in 1997 to conduct recruitment tests for appointing teachers to nearly 10,000 state-aided Madhyamik and higher secondary schools in Bengal.         
	There was no provision in the original act to stop schools from challenging the candidature of SSC-recommended aspirants. Many schools reject SSC-recommended candidates, taking advantage of the absence of such a clause, Dey said.        
	To deal with the problem, the state government had initially decided to punish schools that refused to take commission-recommended candidates by stopping their grants and withdrawing their recognition.        
	This move failed as most schools that were punished challenged the governments decision in court.        
	Many of the schools cited the absence of a clause in the act debarring them from challenging the SSCs recommendation and got court orders in their favour.        
	The government too realised that the decision to punish schools by de-recognising them or stopping their grants was flawed because it inconvenienced the students, teachers and other staff members even though they were not at fault.        
	It is not the students or the staff who reject the SSC-recommended candidates. Such decisions are taken by the school administration. So why should we punish the whole school? After the amendment, the government will be able to punish only the person or the committee who is responsible, Dey said.        
	However, some headmasters feel the amendment is an infringement on the powers of school managing committees.        
	Several hundred managing committees are controlled by the ruling party and they have not allowed SSC-appointed candidates to join because they are not party sympathisers. The government should punish those school managing committees instead of curbing the powers of all the managing committees by passing a law, said Ashok Maity, the general secretary of the West Bengal Headmasters Association.

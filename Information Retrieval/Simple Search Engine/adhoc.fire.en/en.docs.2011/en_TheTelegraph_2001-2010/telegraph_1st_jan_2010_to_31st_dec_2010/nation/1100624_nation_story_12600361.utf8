          CITHARA PAUL                                            
	New Delhi, June 23: The boundaries of all the 2.65 lakh panchayats in the country will be redrawn to bring in a semblance of uniformity in their populations, which now range between 1,000 and 35,000, creating a headache for central administrators.        
	The government hasnt decided what an ideal population for a gram panchayat should be but is toying with the figure of 5,000, a panchayati raj ministry official said.        
	Sources said the current disparity in area and population among gram panchayats  the smallest unit of rural self-government  had spawned an administrative ordeal, especially during the planning and sanctioning of funds.        
	We are planning a delimitation of panchayats to ensure better devolution of power and uniformity of structure across the country, the ministry official said.        
	Curing the administrative headache will, however, involve embarking on a logistical nightmare.        
	A delimitation commission will need to be set up at the Centre and subordinate panels in the states for the mammoth exercise, which will include visits by commission members to every panchayat to listen to suggestions and objections.        
	The exercise is expected to start next year after the census ends, and may take three to four years to complete.        
	The plan is to redraw the boundaries largely on the basis of population, but geographical compactness will also be a factor.        
	The ministry official said: The population of an average panchayat in Kerala is more than 35,000 but in Uttar Pradesh or Madhya Pradesh, some panchayats populations vary between 1,000 and 1,500.        
	He added: Various committees set up by various governments over the years have advocated smaller panchayats for better administration. The recommendations for the ideal population vary from 2,000 to 5,000. The government believes that 5,000 would be a realistic option, but a final decision has not been taken.        
	The exercise is likely to change the total number of panchayats in the country, but the official was not willing to hazard a guess about the post-delimitation figure.        
	In the individual states, the number of panchayats may go up or down drastically. In certain states like Kerala that have high population densities, the number of panchayats may rise sharply. In states like Madhya Pradesh, their number may fall, he said.        
	The number is likely to skyrocket in Bengal, where the average population for a gram panchayat is 19,500, according to the states panchayat department.        
	The official said panchayati raj minister C.P. Joshi had mooted the proposal for delimitation at a recent Planning Commission meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	The Prime Minister and the Planning Commission are all for the delimitation drive because that will be a prudent move in administrative and financial terms, he said.        
	The delimitation will help the panchayats fulfil their constitutional role of functioning as small units of self-governance with certain executive and judicial powers to deal with all types of local issues.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 13: A lawyer who moved court against the decision to close the case against Bofors accused Ottavio Quattrocchi today requested the Supreme Court to order a probe into the alleged IPL largesse for Union minister Shashi Tharoors friend Sunanda Pushkar.        
	 This honble court may be pleased to direct the CBI or any other agency which this court deems fit, or a special investigative team constituted by this court, to investigate this matter Ajay K. Agrawal said in his PIL.        
	Pushkar allegedly got a stake worth around Rs 70 crore for free in the IPL Kochi team which was bought by a consortium led by the company Rendezvous Sports World Ltd.         
	Agrawals petition claimed that IPL sources had confirmed that 5 per cent free equity was given to Pushkar in the Kochi franchise, and named the Centre, the ministries of sports and personnel, the CBI, BCCI and the IPL as parties. The petition said it was shocking that some influence was exercised by a Union minister and which was evident from the fact his fiance got a stake of around 70 crore free.

	New Delhi, March 28: In Parliament, the difference between brain and brawn is so little.        
	Adhir Chowdhury, the Congress leader known for his muscular exploits against the communists, does almost what the CPI veteran, Gurudas Dasgupta, has been doing in the current Lok Sabha. If Gurudas has excelled as a parliamentarian by participating in 23 debates and asking 114 questions, Adhir is almost there with 26 debates and 92 questions.        
	Sadly, the other vital category  beauty  has fallen way behind. The Trinamul Congresss glamorous Satabdi Roy has participated in one debate and asked no questions at all. This is not an exception  the Congress MP Mausam Noor has neither debated, nor asked even one question. Bad news in this season of womens reservation?        
	Not exactly, it would seem. In fact, 14 of Bengals 42 Lok Sabha members have asked no questions.         
	A private institution, PRS Legislative Research, has listed the states MPs who havent utilised the most powerful parliamentary instrument, Zero Hour, so far. They are Subhendu Adhikari, Sudip Bandopadhyay, Ambika Banerjee, Kalyan Banerjee, Abu Hashem Khan Choudhury, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, S.R. Haldar, Abdul Mannan Hossain, Nurul Islam, Mausam Noor, Tapas Paul, Satabdi Roy, Jaswant Singh and Kabir Suman.        
	The data show many low-profile MPs are very active. Those who have asked maximum questions and participated regularly in debates are: Narhari Mahto (questions 113/debates 14), Prabodh Panda (137/38), Prasanta Majumdar (124/34), Nripendra Roy (105/8), Saidul Haque (55/16), Manohar Tirkey (59/8), Deepa Das Munshi (77/2), apart from the known performers like Basudeb Acharya (52/43), Gurudas (114/23) and Adhir (92/26).        
	None of the 42 MPs except Acharya, Adhir, Prasanta Majumdar and Prabodh Panda have so far introduced any private member bill. Attendance-wise, the MPs from the state didnt fare badly, with 12 of them logging over 90 per cent.         
	While Gurudas is the only MP from Bengal with 100 per cent attendance, those above 90 per cent are Acharya, Sudip Bandopadhyay, Ambika Banerjee, Pulin Baske, Sushmita Bauri, Ramchandra Dom, Sucharu Haldar, Saidul Haque, Sakti Mohan Malik, Prabodh Panda and Anup Kumar Saha.         
	Gurudas is among the 10 MPs in the entire country to have registered 100 per cent attendance. From Bengal, Adhikari and Jaswant have less than 50 per cent attendance.

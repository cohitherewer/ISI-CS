	March 1: Talks will resume in New Delhi tomorrow amid hopes of an early solution to the long-drawn impasse in Nagaland. In Manipur, Nagas in the four hill districts today vowed to live together with our brethren in Naga-dominated areas of neighbouring states.        
	A highly placed source in the NSCN (I-M) said the talks would resume with meetings between Naga leaders and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister P. Chidambaram tomorrow. Thuingaleng Muivah will meet Manmohan Singh tomorrow. This will be followed by a meeting with the home minister, a senior functionary of the NSCN (I-M) told The Telegraph at Camp Hebron near Dimapur.        
	The leaders will also hold discussions with the Centres new interlocutor, R.S. Pandey, tomorrow and the day after. A former petroleum secretary, Pandey has also been Nagalands chief secretary.        
	NSCN sources based in Nagaland and those who are in Delhi said the talks this time would be crucial as they have reached a deadlock.         
	While the Centre said there would be no discussion on sovereignty and Naga integration this time, Muivah said in Delhi yesterday that the NSCN (I-M) would not compromise on sovereignty.        
	The Centre has prepared a 29-point counter proposal, which includes financial sops and greater autonomy. The government had in 2006 offered a Mizo Accord-type solution to the NSCN (I-M), which was rejected. We have been told that the government has arranged some proposals from their side... I dont know how far that is... acceptable to us, Muivah told a television channel.

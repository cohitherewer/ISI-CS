	New Delhi, July 5 (PTI): The railways have decided to bar web-based ticket agents from getting access to Tatkal bookings from 8am to 9am.          
	Passengers have been long complaining of the railway website crashing as soon as online booking starts in the morning. There are complaints that the agents corner tickets during this period and the Tatkal quota gets exhausted within minutes, said a railway official.                   
	New Delhi (PTI): An Andaman-based army major who came under the scanner after his computer was accessed from Pakistan has been cleared by the National Investigating Agency of any involvement in espionage. The agency is unlikely to proceed against the major under the Official Secrets Act but he may face departmental action for allegedly procuring documents of sensitive nature.                  
	Udhagamandalam, TN (PTI): Statues of Infant Jesus and Mother Mary have been found desecrated here with their heads broken, triggering tension among residents, police said.                   
	Muzaffarnagar (PTI): On a police plea, a local court here issued non-bailable warrants against three persons on Monday but it turned out that they had been killed in separate police encounters a few years ago. Irshad and Shamsad were killed in an encounter five years ago, while Sarfaraz was killed in 2002, police said.                  
	Meerut (PTI): An eight-year-old girl allegedly shot at her younger brother, seriously injuring him in the head, while they were playing with their fathers country-made pistol in a village here on Tuesday, police said.                   
	Surat (PTI): Forty children were injured on Tuesday when a school bus fell into a roadside canal near Vesu village here, police said. The bus of Agrawal Vidhya Vihar was negotiating a curve on its way to the school. The driver fled the scene.

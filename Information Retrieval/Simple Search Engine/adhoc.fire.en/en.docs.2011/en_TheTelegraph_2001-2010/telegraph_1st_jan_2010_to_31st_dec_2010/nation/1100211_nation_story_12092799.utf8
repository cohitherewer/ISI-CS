          MUZAFFAR RAINA                           Zahid Farooqs mother breaks down during his funeral on the outskirts of Srinagar on February 6. (Reuters)                                  
	Srinagar, Feb. 10: Police today arrested a BSF constable for being allegedly involved in the death of a 16-year-old Srinagar boy who was killed in police firing.         
	Zahid Farooqs death on February 5 had triggered protests in Kashmir and had pushed the state into an undeclared curfew.         
	The BSF today admitted that constable Lakhwinder, who has been suspended, was prima facie involved in the incident. The force had earlier denied its role in the killing.         
	We have arrested the constable. He is the culprit and the lone accused so far. But we are also investigating whether anybody else was involved (in the killing), Srinagar police chief Riyaz Bedar said.         
	Zahids death came amid large-scale protests in Kashmir over the death of another teenager, Wamiq Farooq, in tear-gas shelling by the cops on January 31.        
	Locals had said the BSF had fired at Zahid after a group of youths jeered at them.         
	BSF special director-general P.P.S. Sidhu said: Constable Lakhwinder has been placed under suspension. He has been handed over to Jammu and Kasmir police for further investigation.         
	Sidhu said Lakhwinder was travelling in a Gypsy which had separated from the main convoy while going for a medical check-up at the BSF headquarters in Nishat.         
	Sidhu refused to comment on the motive of the killing, saying the police would answer these questions.         
	Sources said the police were investigating whether the officer who Lakhwinder was reporting to on that day had any role in the killing. We are investigating whether Lakhwinder killed the boy of his own or at the direction of his officer, a source said.         
	The Omar Abdullah government, under pressure from protests over the death of civilians at the hands of security personnel, had taken up the issue of Zahids killing with home minister P. Chidambaram.         
	Omar today said his government had cracked the case in the shortest-possible time.         
	We will ensure that there is a water-tight case against this individual and he gets the strongest-possible punishment, the chief minister said.         
	The state government had found it difficult in the past to act against the army and the paramilitary forces because they enjoy impunity under laws like the Armed Forces Special Powers Act.         
	But this is not the first time that action has been taken against the armed forces. Last March, an assistant commandant and three constables of the CRPF had been suspended for killing a carpenter in an alleged fake encounter in Pulwama district.

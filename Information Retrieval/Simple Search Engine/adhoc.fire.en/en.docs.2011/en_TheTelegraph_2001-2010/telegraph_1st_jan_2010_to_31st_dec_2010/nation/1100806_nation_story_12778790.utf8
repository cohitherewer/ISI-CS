The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trinamul to complain
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Trinamul to complain
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 5: The Trinamul Congress has said it has no unit in Tamil Nadu and would approach police for action against fraud that has resurfaced in Tiruchy district.        
	Party general secretary Mukul Roys statement came in response to the August 4 report in The Telegraph on a job swindle in Tiruchy using forms that mentioned the railway minister. Roy said his party would approach the Tamil Nadu chief secretary and director-general of police besides Delhi police.        
	There is no union, supported by the All India Trinamul Congress, by the name of Southern Railway Trinamool Congress Employees Union, Roy added.        
	The alleged union, whose office-bearers had been selling the forms, is an organisation promoted by persons not known to us and neither permitted by our party, Roy said.        
	The persons are defrauding innocent job-seekers by charging some amount of money for the forms and giving an impression that it is an organisation or a union promoted by Trinamul, he added.        
	Sitting under a tree at Tiruchy, the purported union members had been charging Rs 25 for each form and collecting them for future processing.        
	Roy said similar fake railway job forms had been used last year to dupe aspirants by one K. Rajendran alias Iyappan, who posed as secretary of the All India Trinamool Congress Nilgiri District. The forms carried the Trinamul symbol and Mamata Banerjees photograph.        
	The party had taken the matter up on October 22, 2009, with Tamil Nadu chief secretary K.S. Sripathi, state police chief K.P. Jain and also filed a complaint with Delhis Parliament Street police station, Roy said.        
	After initiating action, such fraudulent activity was suspended for some time. However, it appears that the same activity has now resurfaced at Tiruchy.

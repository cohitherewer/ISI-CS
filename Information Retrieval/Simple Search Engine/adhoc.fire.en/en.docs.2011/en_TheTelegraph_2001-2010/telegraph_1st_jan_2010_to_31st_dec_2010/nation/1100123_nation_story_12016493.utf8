          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Jan. 22: Congress legislators have decided to distance themselves from both the Telangana and the Samaikya (United) Andhra forums, caught between the party high commands directive not to quit and the Telangana Joint Action Committees (JAC) pressure to resign.        
	The legislators stayed away from todays JAC meeting in Hyderabad. Nor did the partys MLAs from coastal Andhra, opposed to the creation of Telangana, attend the Samaikya (United) Andhra meeting in Vijayawada.         
	We plan to float our own platform as we feel suffocated and often threatened by other political partners (in both the forums), said a senior minister.         
	The pro-Telangana camp is peeved at JAC convener M. Kodandarams diktat to resign. The move by the 54 MLAs from the region to skip the JAC meeting is being seen as their way of sending a signal to the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS), the statehood spearhead and the JACs driving force, that the committees unilateral actions were not acceptable to the ruling party.        
	The MLAs are upset with Kodandarams remarks that those who dont resign will be termed traitors of Telangana, the hardening of position coming after over a month of domination by non-Congress leaders, including the TRS, in the JAC.

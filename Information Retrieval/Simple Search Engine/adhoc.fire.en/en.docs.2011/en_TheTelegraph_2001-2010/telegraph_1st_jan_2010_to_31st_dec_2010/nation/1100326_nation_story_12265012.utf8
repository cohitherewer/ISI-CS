The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong, ally split on Buddha
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong, ally split on Buddha
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 25: The Stephen Court fire has not only embarrassed the CPM but also revealed fissures in the Congress-Trinamul alliance on how to deal with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee after his admission of the existence of a vicious circle in real estate.        
	The Congress legislature party chief, Manas Bhuniya, and veteran party MLA Gyan Singh Sohonpal today held meetings with Trinamul legislature party leader Partha Chatterjee and chief whip Asoke Deb to persuade them to end their partys boycott of Bhattacharjee and the Assemblys budget session. But the Congress leaders failed.         
	A week ago, the allies had walked out of the Assembly to protest the chief ministers barbs against Chatterjee as well as his description of the Congress as spineless for allying with Trinamul.         
	However, the Congress ended the boycott and joined the debate on the budget as Bhuniya felt that it was imperative to defend the Congress- led Centre and Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee against the barbs aimed at them in the state budget.         
	Bhuniya declined to divulge the outcome of his mission with Trinamul but made it clear that the Congress did not favour the continuance of the boycott.         
	In a democracy, the Opposition cant boycott the government and legislature endlessly as it is our responsibility to expose the governments misdeeds, half-truths and lies on the floor of the House, Bhuniya said.         
	After I demanded his statement in the House today, the chief minister admitted his governments and the Left-run Calcutta Corporations connivance with an illegal construction racket, Bhuniya claimed.         
	He felt that a united Opposition should go full steam against the government on the Park Street fire inside and outside the House.        
	But Chatterjee was not convinced. We are not interested in the chief ministers efforts to save his own skin by blaming lesser apparatchiks like the CMC mayor for the fire and illegal construction. This government must go so that more lives are not lost. We will continue our boycott of the chief minister and the House until he apologises to us.         
	While the Congress is worried that its anti-CPM credentials would be dented if it continued to attend the House without Trinamul, both parties leaders said it would not lead to a rupture in the alliance.         
	CPM sources said the chief minister was also keen to end the Trinamul boycott as finance minister Asim Dasgupta would reply to the debate on the budget before the House approved it tomorrow. But Trinamul leaders said Bhattacharjee was still not in a mood to apologise to Chatterjee.

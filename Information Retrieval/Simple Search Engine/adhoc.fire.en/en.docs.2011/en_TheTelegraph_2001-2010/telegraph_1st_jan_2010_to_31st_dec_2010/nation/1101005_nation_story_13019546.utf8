	Oct. 4: Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi could be in trouble as the party leadership has taken a grim view of his appearance in a Kerala lottery case.         
	The state Congress, which believes the lawyer has single-handedly undermined the partys prospects in the panchayat elections by appearing for dubious lottery agents in the high court, has demanded action against him.         
	Congress spokespersons Janardan Dwivedi and Jayanti Natarajan said today the party had taken a serious view of the matter.         
	Kerala Opposition leader Oommen Chandy said Singhvi has breached organisational propriety and action will follow soon.         
	The lottery row had become a political issue in the state, and the Congress had successfully cornered the Left government, clubbing CPM politicians with lottery agent Santiago Martin.         
	The CPM found a godsend when Singhvi appeared in court on behalf of the lottery mafia.         
	Later, Singhvi withdrew from the case on the high commands orders.

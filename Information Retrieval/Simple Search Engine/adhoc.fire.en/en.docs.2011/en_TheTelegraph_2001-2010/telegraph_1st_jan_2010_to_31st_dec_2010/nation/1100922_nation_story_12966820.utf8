	Lucknow, Sept. 21: Tourists trapped in Uttarakhand since Sunday have been frantically working the phone lines as fresh landslides triggered by heavy rain have hobbled rescue and evacuation.        
	Sources said the tourists from Bengal, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh  have been dialling family back home and complaining that rescue work was painfully slow and debris on roads was not allowing them to move an inch.        
	Four tourists from north Calcuttas Baranagar, stranded in a village near Shivpur in Pauri Garhwal district since Saturday, have told their family they were worried what might happen to their 66-year-old father if they were not able to move out soon. All roads were blocked by debris.        
	Among those injured in Chamoli district were two tourists from Bengal, one from West Midnapore and the other a monk from Belur Math. Both were treated at a local hospital and are out of danger. Two locals were killed.        
	In Gopeswar, also in Chamoli district, a 35-member team from Sainik School in Haryana was stranded near Bagri glacier. Police sources said they had been put up in relief camps.        
	As many as 67 people have died in landslides, floods and cloudbursts and thousands rendered homeless in the past few days in Uttarakhand, disaster management officials said.        
	Army officers killed        
	A Lieutenant Colonel and a Major on a mountaineering expedition to Mount Kamet were killed on Sunday after their camp was hit by an avalanche near Ghastoli in Chamoli district, reports PTI.

	The last time the two countries had inked such a deal was in 1972 when they signed the Cultural Co-operative Agreement, and the new Cultural Exchange Programme (CEP) is the first follow-up on that 38-year-old pact.        
	According to the CEP  signed by culture secretary Jawhar Sircar and Bangladesh foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes during Sheikh Hasinas visit  Indian and Bangladeshi scholars and academics in the fields of art, culture, literature, dance, music and theatre will exchange visits.        
	The cross-border co-operation would include mime shows, exhibitions and visits by jatra groups to meet local demands for exposure to each others cultural traditions.         
	Under the CEP, the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) and its counterpart academic institutions or museums will exchange one scholar each to identify areas of collaboration. Both sides will exchange students in the field of theatre.        
	They will also exchange library personnel, while the National Library of India and the department of Public Library in Bangladesh will swap reading material, including books and microfilms. Both sides will hold handicraft exhibitions in each others country on a reciprocal basis along with live demonstrations.        
	The CEP says India will send two officials of the Archaeological Survey of India to Bangladesh for a study-cum-lecture tour and in return will host two officers of the Bangladesh Department of Archaeology and Museums.        
	The ASI will lend expertise required by any archaeological surveys that Bangladesh may require to undertake.         
	Both sides will exchange writers in the field of culture. The Sahitya Akademi will publish an anthology of poetry from Bangladesh in return for a reciprocal gesture from Dhaka.        
	The neighbours will exchange childrens paintings, dolls, books and works of creative arts. India will invite Bangladeshi children to participate in an international childrens competition.         
	A decision was also taken to exchange rare publications that are not otherwise available in the open market to enrich libraries in both countries. For India, the Salarjung Museum, Hyderabad, will facilitate the exchange of publications and catalogues.        
	Both sides will exchange one senior science professional or museologist for two weeks each.

	They have also agreed to exchange two journalists each, including those engaged in dissemination of government information.

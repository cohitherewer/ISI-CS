                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pak leader sorry for Ranjit slur
                            
	Islamabad, Sept. 1 (PTI): A top Pakistani politician who described Maharaja Ranjit Singh as the epitome of mismanagement and corruption has apologised, saying he has had a change of mind after he read a book on the 19th century Sikh ruler by Indian journalist Khushwant Singh.        
	Leader of Opposition in Pakistans parliament, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, used to frequently refer to Ranjit Singh while highlighting issues of mismanagement and corruption.        
	Yesterday, he surprised fellow lawmakers in National Assembly  as Pakistans lower House of parliament is formally called  when he tendered an apology for frequently quoting his (Ranjit Singhs) name in meetings for wrong reasons.        
	I was wrong. Ranjit (Singh) was a great administrator of Punjab, he said, while chairing a meeting of the House public accounts committee, an anti-corruption watchdog.        
	The Pakistani leader said his views on Ranjit Singh changed after he read the book by Khushwant Singh.        
	Khan told the panel that he was sorry for developing a wrong perception about Ranjit Singh and his rule.        
	The book had been sent to Khan by another panel member, Khwaja Mohammad Asif. Both Khan and Asif belong to the main Opposition party, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz).         
	Ranjit Singh, who was born in Gujranwala, was the first Maharaja of the Sikh empire. Known as Sher-e-Punjab (Lion of Punjab), he ruled till 1839, with Lahore as his capital. However, many Pakistanis consider him a ruthless ruler who killed Muslims in wars.

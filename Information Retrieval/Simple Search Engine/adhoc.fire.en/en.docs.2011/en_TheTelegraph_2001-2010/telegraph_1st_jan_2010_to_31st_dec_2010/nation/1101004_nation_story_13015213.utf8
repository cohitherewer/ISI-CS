The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ayodhya, a reluctant Congress story
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ayodhya, a reluctant Congress story
          RASHEED KIDWAI              1949-2010: six festering decades, no arbiters                               (From top) Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajiv Gandhi, Narasimha Rao and Sonia Gandhi                                 
	Oct. 3: The Ayodhya dispute has from the beginning been the Congresss Achilles heel, which explains Sonia Gandhis and Manmohan Singhs perceived lack of enthusiasm in acting as peacemakers following the title suit verdict.         
	Indias first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was quickly dragged into the Ayodhya imbroglio in December 1949 when idols were surreptitiously placed inside the 16th- century Babri mosque.        
	Nehru had asked then Uttar Pradesh chief secretary Bhagwan Sahay to restore status quo. But then deputy commissioner of Faizabad K.K. Nayar wrote lengthy letters ruing that he had failed to find any Hindu even among Congressmen who was ready to support the administrations move for removal of the idols.        
	The ICS officer said each time he went to the site, he was greeted with the slogan: Nyaya anyay karna chhor do, Nayar bhagwan ka phatak khol do (Stop talking about justice or injustice, Nayar, open the door towards the deity).         
	Nayar later became a Lok Sabha MP of the Jan Sangh, the forerunner of the BJP.        
	Decades later, in 1986, when Rajiv Gandhi was Prime Minister and the Congress was in power in Uttar Pradesh, the fast-paced events leading to the opening of the lock surprised even the BJP, which highlighted the Congresss role in a White Paper published after the Babri Masjid was demolished.        
	Under the heading The case for opening the lock  a contrast, it asked sarcastically: How is it this case moved at such a speed? How did the government acquiesce in this case? How did the Faizabad court allow the appeal (to open the lock) in two days when the Hindus had been pleading for 37 years? How did the Doordarshan cameras click the opening of the lock within an hour of the court order? All these questions have one answer, the government is not against such things and they can, and do, happen.         
	Through 1986-1989, Rajiv Gandhi, his home minister Buta Singh, the then Uttar Pradesh chief ministers Veer Bahadur Singh and N.D. Tiwari kept trying to occupy the Ayodhya centre stage, coming up with plans. In 1989, the government even allowed the shilanyas (foundation ceremony) at the site. Somehow, each of these measures boomeranged.        
	P.V. Narasimha Rao, who watched this period from close quarters before becoming a central figure himself, articulated his dilemma in a book, Ayodhya 6 December 1992, published a year after his death in 2006. Reflecting how the BJPs pseudo religious movement could not have sustained itself on a purely religious plane, Rao said it needed a political reaction to flourish. I cannot escape the uneasy feeling that we Congressmen (while in the Congress) supplied it with just that.         
	He also suggested the shilanyas Rajiv Gandhi had allowed took place on disputed land, citing several government records and statements.        
	Since becoming Prime Minister in 1991 till August 1992, Rao was in constant touch with the RSS leadership to attempt to resolve the Ayodhya dispute amicably. Party leaders like V.N. Gadgil and Vasant Sathe acted as his emissaries. Rao also sought the help of apolitical seers, such as Jain Muni Acharya Sushil and his spiritual guru based at Ramtek in Maharashtra, to prevail upon the Sangh parivar to work out a solution.        
	After the Babri demolition, Rao became disillusioned and wrote with an air of dejection that while the Kalyan Singh government and the BJP were largely responsible for the wanton vandalism, his Congress colleagues in the ministry, too, had been guided by political and vote-earning considerations. They had already made up their mind that one person had to be made historically responsible for the tragedy. They got a stick to beat me with. I understood it.         
	Brave words were uttered after the demolition and some Congress figures tried to look like sages who knew everything beforehand, Rao said. I must say that this is a pose because, having been authors of the crisis and enacted the whole drama of destruction, they wanted to have some specific role assigned to themselves in history, something even wrongly to be proud of, he wrote without naming party leaders who, he claimed, had a vested interest in holding him responsible for the Babri outrage.        
	With such a history, the hesitation of Raos protg Manmohan Singh in acting as an Ayodhya arbitrator is not without reason.         
	The Prime Minister would be wary of the VHP-BJP designs, too, recalling what Rao had written about them a year before his death: Their demand is not for just one temple. More have been lined up, so that the agitation can be kept alive even if the issue of one or two specific temples is settled. In the unlikely event of all the three temple issues (Ayodhya, Mathura, Kashi) being settled amicably (unfortunately for them), there was a never-ending store of more than 3,000 controversial temples lined up all over the country!

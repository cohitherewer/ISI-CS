The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dont move, the PM is here
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Dont move, the PM is here
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                     
	Srinagar, June 7: When Manmohan Singh came to Kashmir today, Kashmiris were put behind shutters courtesy the combined efforts of sharply contrary forces  the separatists intent on imposing a Valley-wide protest bandh and the security forces determined not to let so much as a bird flap in the Prime Ministers path.         
	What the separatists hadnt disrupted with their hartal call, the jawans did with their batons and cordons. In the process, they reinforced the freeze on dialogue and kept the prospect of normality stuck to its sorry perch on the bayonet.         
	It was bouquets for the Prime Minister on his arrival at Humhama airport, barbed wire for the city he had arrived in. Srinagar retreated indoors from every erected fence and became a ghost town shivered in the grey daylong rain. Its bazaars and offices remained bolted, its neighbourhoods wrapped in sinister silence, its many tourists stranded in hotel rooms and lobbies.         
	The Prime Minister had come, there was nowhere for anyone to go. Speedboats mounted with gunmen established occupation of the waters of the Dal; its foreshore and boulevard, normally an eruption of summer picnickers, was a ripple of khaki and steel.         
	But it wasnt just that you couldnt venture out, your voice couldnt either  jammer switches were thrown to paralyse all local telephony. Standard operating procedures, explained a senior officer laconically, they are to remain in place until the VVIP leaves. It wont be far to say theyre praying for that hour.         
	Why does he (the Prime Minister) need to come at all if he must go about under such protection and at such cost to daily life? asks Junaid Ahmed, a young resident of the commercial district of Qamarwari in downtown Srinagar. As it is our lives are a daily tumult, this is a double imposition, so avoidable. It is not as if the Prime Minister is opening himself to any interaction with us, so why?         
	Close to where he stood, at the mouth of a narrow lane, a truck was disgorging jawans in riot gear and an officer was announcing his version of restrictions that are to be in place until Singh has taken off tomorrow afternoon: There is no curfew but there is to be no movement outside your localities unless absolutely necessary. No movement, no assembly, no announcements or calls no movement no curfew but no movement no movement.         
	Kites swooped overhead, cutting through wind and rain, dogs swapped flies, and more trucks droned into the alleys with more jawans. What are we to make of when the Prime Minister comes? Junaid asks, That we are to be interned in our own homes?         
	Qamarwari is a good dozen kilometres off the Sher-i-Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC), where the Prime Minister led the 5 th annual convocation of the agriculture university but nowhere seemed too far for nervous security details to secure. Even though Singh has no public meeting scheduled. Even though he has no plans to venture into town. Even though he is motoring no more than eight sanitised kilometres during his trip, from the governors residence on the Zabarwan slopes to the SKICC on the eastern edge of the Dal Lake and back.         
	You only have to glance at the Prime Ministers schedule and the bandobust and you will know where the government of India stands in relation to the people of Kashmir, remarked a retired bureaucrat. It is a relationship governed by security concerns and moated by security forces.         
	Singh, of course, renewed his call to separatists to step forward for talks but it was lost on none that the invitation was dead well before it was invoked at the SKICC lectern this afternoon. Separatists  hardliners and moderates alike  have spurned negotiations, overt or covert, for months now and political activity in the Valley betrays no signs of going beyond the local coalition of the willing, comprising the National Conference, the Congress and Mehbooba Muftis PDP.         
	The separatists are the ones who have a problem and until there is movement on talks with them, no progress can really be said to have been achieved in political terms, said a local Congressman, adding, It will probably take a courageous, even radical, initiative to break the political deadlock and I do not see that on any table at the moment.         
	Syed Ali Shah Geelani, chief spokesperson of the hard-line sentiment in the Valley, was typically blunt responding to the Prime Ministers latest offer. Ah, he said, But what is this other than putting a gun to the Kashmiris head and wanting them to surrender? They say they want to talk but look what happens when the Prime Minister arrives here, they suspend phone connections and one Kashmiri cannot talk to another. That has been their way of doing things, what do you want me to say?         
	Geelani remains unmoved, roosting, hawk-like on his secessionist dream; and Srinagar, for the time, quite paralysed.

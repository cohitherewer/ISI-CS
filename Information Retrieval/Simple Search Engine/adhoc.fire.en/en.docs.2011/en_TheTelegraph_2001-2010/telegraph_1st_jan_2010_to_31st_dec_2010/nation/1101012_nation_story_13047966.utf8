          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                                    
	Oct. 11: Karnataka Speaker K.G. Bopaiah today took a rare step to control a chaotic House: he called police.        
	Legal experts said a Speaker was empowered to do so but added that most presiding officers of legislatures had avoided such a move, keeping the sanctity of the House in mind.        
	Opposition members today attacked and injured 16 House marshals when they tried to prevent five disqualified Independent MLAs from entering the Assembly hall, Bangalore police commissioner Shankar Bidari said.        
	He said the police then received a written request from Bopaiah to come and control the situation. Assembly officials said this was the first time the police had entered the House.        
	How can the police enter the House, that too wearing uniform? leader of the Opposition Siddharamaiah screamed, getting into a long argument with Bidari. At one point, Opposition members chased Bidari and his force out of the House.        
	The commissioner later said: The civil police entered the Assembly hall and prevented any untoward incidents. The police discharged their duty as per the law of the land and... instructions of the Speaker.        
	Thirteen years ago, however, Uttar Pradesh Speaker Kesrinath Tripathi couldnt bring himself to call the police even after one of the worst brawls seen in an Indian legislature left 24 MLAs injured.        
	While debating a trust motion sought by Kalyan Singh, the MLAs threw chairs, slippers and punches  even microphones that they had wrenched off their desks  at one another.        
	It was my sense of propriety that prevented me from calling the police, Tripathi today told The Telegraph.        
	In 1980, however, the police had indeed entered the Assemblys outer corridors in Lucknow to remove a squatting MLA, sparking a controversy.        
	Uttar Pradesh additional solicitor-general Ashok Nigam said: In any Assembly, the marshals perform the polices job. But if the situation turns grave, a Speaker can call the police.        
	On July 21 this year, some Bihar Opposition members had alleged that the state military police was summoned to evict MLAs after a fight with chairs and tables in the Assembly. But the Speaker denied this, saying only marshals were used.        
	The same day, however, women police constables were seen removing a woman Congress member from the states legislative council building after she had smashed several flowerpots.        
	Today, the Bangalore police chief said a case had been registered against violent Opposition members who had injured 16 watch-and-ward staff. He said the MLAs had also damaged the glass at the Assembly halls entrance.        
	The Speaker had disqualified five Independents  P.M. Narendraswamy, Shivaraj Thangadagi, Gulihatti Shekhar, Venkataramanappa and D. Sudhakar  along with 11 dissident BJP members ahead of a trust vote.        
	Some members had perched themselves on the Speakers podium. Many shouted slogans against the chief minister, accusing him of goondaism.        
	When Bidari led his force into the House, Opposition members began protesting, charging up the atmosphere further. Later, their leader, Siddharamaiah, accused the commissioner of locking the Assembly halls gate and preventing him from entering.        
	Bidari said the audiovisuals available with the media would prove that he had done nothing of the sort.        
	He said the Speaker and Assembly staff had designated one particular door for Opposition members but they wanted to enter through another door that had been closed on the Speakers orders.        
	The Opposition members were trying to break the door open. I tried to persuade them to enter through the designated door, the commissioner said.        
	When the members refused to budge, Bidari said he went up to the Speaker and told him there was no harm in opening the other door too. The Speaker then allowed the door to be opened.

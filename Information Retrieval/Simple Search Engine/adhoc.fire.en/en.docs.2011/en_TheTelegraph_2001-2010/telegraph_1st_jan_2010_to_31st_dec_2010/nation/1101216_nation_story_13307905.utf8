The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MPs plenary duty: pitch tents
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      MPs plenary duty: pitch tents
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: The Congress has asked its MPs to put up tents in their homes to host delegates who will arrive in Delhi from all over the country for the three-day plenary starting on Saturday.        
	Over 20,000 delegates, at least a thousand Seva Dal volunteers, hundreds of uninvited party leaders and their sidekicks are expected to attend the first party plenary in the capital in 32 years.        
	Accommodation for around 5,000 has been arranged at the venue  Burari, a village on Chandigarh Road just outside the city and the Congress has booked all available hotels, guesthouses and dharmashalas, but there is still a huge shortfall.         
	So, MPs have been asked to put up tents at their official residences to accommodate workers at least from their own states, the partys chief spokesperson Janardan Dwivedi revealed today.         
	Five MPs The Telegraph spoke to were not aware of the diktat, but said they would happily abide by it. A few, however, wished this had been planned earlier.        
	It is a given that the MPs will have to bear the expenses for the delegates stay, never mind that the party constitution says the Pradesh Congress Committee has to generate funds to host such events and arrange food and accommodation.         
	The Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee is setting up a tented town in Burari with a makeshift hospital, a post office, railway and air ticket reservation counters and rows of tents in party colours to put up 5,000 delegates. The main conference hall will seat 14,000, while the rest of the invited 20,000-plus delegates will view the session on large television screens outside.         
	Separate food courts are being set up for senior leaders, delegates and the media.        
	Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh will have small offices at the venue, to which they will travel by helicopter to avoid disrupting traffic.         
	All Delhi ministers have been assigned specific tasks, including taking care of food, accommodation, cleanliness and medical facilities, to ensure there are no glitches. Roads outside the venue are being re-laid.        
	The last plenary in Delhi was presided over by Indira Gandhi in 1978, when the Janata Party was in power. Before that, the capital had hosted the Congress plenary in 1951, 1932, 1923 and 1918.         
	The last Congress plenary was held in 2005 in Hyderabad and the late Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy turned a huge stadium and its neighbourhood into Rajiv Nagar to put up a grand show. Bangalore had played host in 2000.         
	The main slogan this time will be 125 years of dedication and service. There will be a separate resolution on the partys history in addition to the political, economic and foreign affairs resolutions.

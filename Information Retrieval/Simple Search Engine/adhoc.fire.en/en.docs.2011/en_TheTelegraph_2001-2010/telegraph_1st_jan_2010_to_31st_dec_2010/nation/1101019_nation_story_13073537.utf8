          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 18: Mamata Banerjee will lead a Trinamul Congress padayatra from Salt Lake to Beliaghata on October 23 demanding removal of the joint forces deployed in West Midnapore to counter Maoists.        
	I have been saying over the past few months that the joint forces should be pulled out of Jungle Mahal and its nearby areas as the CPM has been using them to recapture turf. I have explained this to the Union home minister and the Prime Minister. Every day, the CPM is capturing a village with the help of the joint forces who are still camping there, she said.        
	To renew our demand for their withdrawal, I will take part in a padayatra from Bidhannagar to Beliaghata on 23.        
	Let there be an operation against the Maoists. But thats not happening. The CPM is spreading political terror, killing people and then blaming the Maoists. How long can we tolerate this drama? she asked.

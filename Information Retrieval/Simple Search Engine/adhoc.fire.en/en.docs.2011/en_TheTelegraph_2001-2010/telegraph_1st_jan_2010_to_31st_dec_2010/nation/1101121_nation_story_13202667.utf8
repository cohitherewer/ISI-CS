The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PIL against Chavan over Mumbai flat
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      PIL against Chavan over Mumbai flat
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Prithviraj Chavan                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 20: A Pune-based social worker has filed a petition in Bombay High Court accusing Prithviraj Chavan of withholding information that he owned a 1,032sqft-flat in central Mumbai while filing his nomination for the Rajya Sabha last year.        
	Filed yesterday, the PIL could spell trouble for the new Maharashtra chief minister whose 40-member cabinet met for the first time today since he took over after a housing scam had felled his predecessor.        
	A Right to Information query had earlier revealed that Chavan had in 2003 bought the flat in Wadala allotted to him by then chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde from the discretionary quota for MPs and MLAs.        
	In his petition yesterday, Hemant Patil alleged that Chavans affidavit before the Election Commission when he filed his nomination for the Rajya Sabha had disclosed a Delhi flat but not the second-floor apartment at Venus Co-operative Housing Society in Wadala.         
	Patil, who claims to be the president of an anti-corruption organisation, alleged that the flats in Venus Co-operative Housing Society were meant for economically weaker sections.         
	Assuming that the respondent (Chavan) is (from) an economically backward (background), even then he has not been exempted from not disclosing the said fact that he owned a flat in Mumbai. It appears  that the flat situated in Venus Co-operative Housing Society has not been shown in the list of immovable property in the affidavit annexed to his nomination form the petition said.        
	Chavan, the petition added, thus suppressed the vital and important information from the Election Commission and thereby committed breach of rules of (the) Code of Conduct established according to the provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951.        
	Patil said Chavans Rajya Sabha election should be declared null and void and demanded that the chief minister  who replaced fellow Congressman Ashok Chavan after the Adarsh housing scam  should be barred from holding a public office till the petition was disposed of.        
	The petition is likely to come up on Monday.        
	After the controversy over the flat broke earlier this month, the new chief minister had offered to return the apartment but sources close to him said much of his time has been taken up shuttling between Mumbai and Delhi to finalise his cabinet.         
	The 40-member cabinet, expanded yesterday, settled down to business today with its first meeting. Briefing reporters, Chavan and his deputy Ajit Pawar said the new government would give Vidarbha, the under-developed eastern part of Maharashtra that has seen over 5,000 farmer suicides since 2001, its due.

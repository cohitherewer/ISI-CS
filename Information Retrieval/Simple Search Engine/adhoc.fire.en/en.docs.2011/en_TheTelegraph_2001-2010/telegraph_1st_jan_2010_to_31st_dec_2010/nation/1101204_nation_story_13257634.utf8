          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: A communication lacuna has forced the Congress leadership to constitute a high-level panel to interact with the media, particularly to participate in television discussions.         
	The step has been taken against the backdrop of the partys perceived failure in confronting the Oppositions high-voltage propaganda on corruption despite alleged skeletons in the BJPs own cupboard.         
	Although the Congress media department shortlists leaders for appearances on television, a change has been brought about by including senior cabinet ministers in the panel for presenting the partys views.        
	The cabinet figures on the 15-member panel are health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni, parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal, environment minister Jairam Ramesh and rural development minister C.P. Joshi.         
	The other members are Girija Vyas, Abhisek Singhvi, P.C. Chako, Raj Babbar, Renuka Chowdhary, Sanjay Nirupam, Jayanthi Natrajan, Manish Tewari, Mohan Prakash and Shakil Ahmed.        
	Although all party spokespersons figure on the list, media department chairperson Janardan Dwivedi has kept himself away. Dwivedi never takes part in television debates, no matter how battered the party feels in times of crises.        
	The inclusion of Mohan Prakash, who recently embarrassed the leadership by comparing Rahul Gandhi with Jaiprakash Narayan, has raised some eyebrows in the party.        
	Cabinet ministers  many of them are holding the dual post of AICC general secretary  have been doing party work, showing scant regard for established norms but purists frown at the blurred line between the government and the party.        
	Even the choice of the ministers has intrigued many in the party. One senior leader said: If ministers have to be picked for party work, why are some of the most articulate ones?  like Salman Khursheed, Kapil Sibal and Anand Sharma  are not on the panel?        
	This list also triggered speculation about the possibility of these ministers eventually getting shifted to the organisation. But removing five big faces from the government at one go might not be easy.        
	The inclusion of Vyas, Chacko and Chowdhary does indicate that they may be given some organisational assignments in the pending AICC shuffle.         
	Another feature that has drawn the attention of some leaders is the presence of outsiders on the list. While Mohan Prakash was a socialist, Raj Babbar joined the Congress after leaving the Samajwadi Party and Sanjay Nirupam was earlier with the Shiv Sena. Does this point to the lack of homegrown talent? a leader asked.        
	Sources said such a panel had been formed because the leadership was worried over unimportant, ill-informed or incompetent leaders making TV appearances and making a mess of the partys image.         
	The list of names has been sent to all channels with a request that only these leaders should be contacted for the partys views.        
	The previous list of 24 persons made before the 2009 general elections included P. Chidambaram, Kapil Sibal, Salman Khursheed, Digvijay Singh, Veerappa Moily, Satyavrat Chaturvedi, Kamal Nath, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot and Rajiv Shukla.         
	Most of these leaders rarely appeared on television programmes, but Satyavrat was a familiar face on the screen.        
	His omission has left the party grapevine abuzz as Janardan Dwivedi, who made the list, does not share a good rapport with him.

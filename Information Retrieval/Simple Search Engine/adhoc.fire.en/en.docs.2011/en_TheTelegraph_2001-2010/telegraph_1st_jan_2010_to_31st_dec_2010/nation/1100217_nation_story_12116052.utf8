The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sushma betrays BJP-RSS strain
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sushma betrays BJP-RSS strain
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sushma Swaraj                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 16: The RSS might have ensured that the BJP is blessed with a new leadership. But the fact that the Sangh continues to be restive and unsure about its political offspring has come across in an interview of Sushma Swaraj by R. Balashankar, the editor of RSS mouthpiece Organiser, in the magazines latest issue.        
	In the Sangh, the interview has set off a buzz not so much for the hard-hitting questions shot off to Sushma but for her inability to field them with her usual panache.         
	Asked why the BJP had lost its brand equity and its USP of being a party with a difference, her reply was that unlike the Congresss dynastic hierarchy, the BJPs distinctiveness came from its collective thinking and collective decision-making.         
	Its party presidents, she said, did not have to come from an identified family. Even a person who has started his political career from the mandal level can aspire to become the national president. From Atalji (Atal Bihari Vajpayee) to Nitin Gadkari, there is a great line of presidents who come from humble backgrounds, said Sushma.        
	Although the weekly is considered a mouthpiece of the RSS, the latter has been coy about owning it up as one.         
	To the cadres, Organiser and its Hindi counterpart Panchajanya are gospels from Nagpur, the headquarters of the RSS. Their editors and senior staffers are handpicked by the RSS chief, the sarsanghachalak. It is given that without his nod, nothing contentious or provocative goes in the publication.        
	Asked by Balashankar how the Congress was successfully creating captive voting constituencies by selling schemes like the rural job scheme NREGA and crop insurance while the BJP was not only losing old stakeholders but also not reaching out to new ones, Sushmas answer was a rhetorical, We consider the entire nation as our constituency. She cited Gujarat as an example of how the BJP didnt necessarily win elections on emotional issues. Development was the only plank on which we won Gujarat. So dont say we dont have stakeholders or people dont look up to us, she said, almost as a put-down to the interviewer.        
	Undeterred, Balashankar mentioned that contemporary political street-talk was about how the BJP had taken on itself the job of keeping the inept UPA government in power for any number of terms.         
	He asked: How has this impression gained (ground)? Sushma remonstrated by saying: There were occasions when the government had to withdraw its proposals. We have shown that we are a very, very serious Opposition. You will see it in the budget session how we will gherao the government.        
	The Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha also demurred when it was pointed out that the BJP was preoccupied with rules, regulations and doing everything like old Congress Gokhaleites, and not being able to take a clear stand, whether it was small states or the Shiv Sena-MNS brand of politics.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Graft bypassed, Cong rues blunder
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Graft bypassed, Cong rues blunder
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: An overwhelming sense of dismay has descended on the Congress over a good AICC meeting being overshadowed by the cloud of corruption and the message the party wanted to send out getting lost in the process.         
	Many leaders feel this could have been averted by accommodating a general reference to corruption in Sonia Gandhis speech.        
	Expressing disappointment at the absence of discourse on corruption, a senior leader told The Telegraph: What was the problem in saying that the Congress was not the party to tolerate corruption and anybody found guilty of misdemeanour would not be spared? We cannot ignore the backdrop against which the session was being held. Why were the strategy-makers not conscious of this, how was this blunder possible?         
	The leader said what was particularly hurting was the indisputable fact that the partys image had been tarnished at a time Sonia and Manmohan Singh had provided a leadership that was clean and sensitive to public perception.         
	We have made sacrifices on corruption charges. From Natwar Singh to Shashi Tharoor, we are not known for brazening it out. Parties like the BJP, BSP, DMK, Samajwadi Party and the RJD were much less clean in public perception, and suddenly the Congress is being put in the dock. This is poor management, he added.        
	Many other leaders share the view and blame the managers and Sonias speechwriters for the mess-up. They point out that the party had nothing to fight shy of after ordering an extensive investigation into the Commonwealth Games cases and forcing the Maharashtra chief minister to offer to resign over the housing scandal.        
	The government and the party had taken swift action. There is no parallel in any party or government to such a decisive step and still, we are being battered for protecting corruption. What else is this if not sheer mismanagement and suicide? a junior central minister wondered.        
	Several younger leaders expressed shock at the turnaround in fortunes, pointing out that the Congress was on the defensive despite sacking chief minister Ashok Chavan at a time the BJP pulled out all stops to save its government in Karnataka where charges of loot are flying around.        
	A young Congress leader said: We are sad that Rahuls (Gandhi) categorical message that the party is for the poor got lost. We thought he gave the most crucial direction to the party at a time elitist forces were trying to dominate the government.         
	Some leaders did say there was no need for discussing corruption cases at the meeting meant for organisational formalities. But they pointed out that the meeting did debate topical subjects like Jammu and Kashmir, Naxalism, communalism, inflation and economic liberalisation.        
	Officially, party spokesperson Manish Tiwari pointed out that Sonias appeal to not forget the values on which the party had been built was the clearest possible pronouncement on corruption. He, however, added swiftly: Anything subtle is lost on the media.

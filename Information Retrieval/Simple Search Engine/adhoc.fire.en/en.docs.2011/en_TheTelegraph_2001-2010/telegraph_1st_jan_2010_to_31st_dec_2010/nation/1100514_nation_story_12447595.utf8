          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Strict stand                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 13: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today asked the district collectors to ensure prevention of distress sale of paddy by farmers and personally monitor paddy procurement after Orissa High Court took cognisance of the matter yesterday.        
	It must be ensured that farmers are not harassed and they get the minimum support price, Naveen told the district collectors through a video-conference. At the district level, you should coordinate with state agencies to ensure that they procure paddy against the given target, he added. Complimenting the collectors of Bargarh, Bhadrak, Ganjam and Sonepur for successfully achieving procurement targets during kharif season, Naveen directed others to follow suit.        
	Yesterday, the high court pulled up the government for its failure to abide by its last weeks direction to stop distress sale in Bolangir and warned of contempt proceedings. The issue had also rocked the Assembly in pre-budget session in February.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai/Delhi, Sept. 3: The Prime Minister will intervene in the impasse over Mumbais planned second airport in Navi Mumbai because of concerns raised by the Jairam Ramesh-headed environment ministry.        
	The announcement was made by chief minister Ashok Chavan after a meeting with Manmohan Singh in Delhi today. Civil aviation minister Praful Patel and Ramesh have also been at loggerheads on the project, with the environment ministry objecting to the diversion of two rivers, loss of mangrove cover and cutting of a hill if the airport is built at the site. Ramesh has claimed there will be massive floods in Navi Mumbais Panvel if the airport comes up. Patel insists there is no other location.        
	Taking into consideration the congestion at the existing airport, it (the city) urgently needs a second airport, said Chavan, who also met Sonia Gandhi.

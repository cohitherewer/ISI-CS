	New Delhi, Nov. 18: Mumbai and Delhi could be targeted by the Lashkar-e-Toiba and a Kashmiri militant group around the second anniversary of 26/11, inputs from a foreign intelligence agency suggest.        
	The inputs provided by a foreign agency suggest that terrorists could strike in Mumbai anytime before November 30, said a source.        
	The Union home ministry on Tuesday had sent red alerts to Delhi and Maharashtra police. Mumbai was also on alert for a possible terror strike when Barack Obama had visited the city.         
	Delhi police have been on their toes since Tuesday as the threat was believed to be specific to November 17. Although the source did not disclose which Kashmiri outfit could carry out a strike, the Hizb-ul Mujahideen is seen as a suspect.         
	Earlier, two Taiwanese tourists were shot at this September, weeks before the Commonwealth Games.

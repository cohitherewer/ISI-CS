	Washington, Nov. 30 (PTI): Former US lawmaker Stephen J. Solarz, who spoke in favour of India at a congressional hearing within days of the Pokhran-II, and was instrumental in setting up of the South Asia bureau in the Department of State died yesterday.        
	Stephen was 70. He had esophageal cancer.        
	He was one of the leading foreign policy experts in the House of Representatives during nine terms starting in 1975 and known as the best friend of India in the Congress.         
	Mr Solarz was a tenacious, deeply informed and sharp-tongued politician who evoked strong passions with his unapologetically robust role in international affairs.... He earned a reputation as a micromanager of foreign policy, The Washington Post wrote.

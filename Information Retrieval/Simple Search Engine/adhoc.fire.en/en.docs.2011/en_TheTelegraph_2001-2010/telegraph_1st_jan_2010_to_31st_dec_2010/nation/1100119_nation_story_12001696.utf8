The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia and Hasina to attend farewell 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sonia and Hasina to attend farewell 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Jan. 18: Two ladies with some fond memories of Jyoti Basu will be among the mourners during the Left patriarchs last journey. But few communist cousins from the global socialist fraternity are expected.        
	Sheikh Hasina, the Bangladesh Prime Minister, will fly down to Calcutta on a special aircraft at noon tomorrow. Sonia Gandhi, the Congress president and chairperson of the UPA now ruling at the Centre, will reach the city an hour before.        
	They will pay their last respects to Basu in the Assembly along with other dignitaries, including Bhutan foreign minister Lyonpo Ugyen Tshering.        
	Hasina, who was in Delhi on a state visit last week, had regretted not being able to see Basu when he was battling death in hospital.                    
	During her earlier tenure, Basu had gone to Bangladesh in 1996 at Dhakas invitation. Basu was given a grand reception when he went to his ancestral home at Barudi in Bangladesh.        
	Mamata Banerjee has not yet announced her schedule. As of Monday night, Opposition leader Partha Chatterjee and Sudip Bandopadhyay are expected to attend.        
	None of the high-ranking communist luminaries from abroad is slated to attend the final farewell. Basu had fond memories of Cubas Fidel Castro and Venezuelas Hugo Chavez. Castro is now unwell and has handed over power to his brother Raul.         
	The protocol-conscious Chinese government and party sent the countrys consul in Calcutta to the CPM state headquarters.        
	We have not asked foreign parties to send representatives. Wherever the communist parties are in power, the countries embassies will do that, said a CPM secretariat member.         
	Basus party, particularly its Bengal unit, will be happier seeing Sonia.         
	In public, Congress and CPM leaders declined to read too much into her visit except her respect for Basu and appreciation of his role in facilitating the first UPA government.        
	But some CPM leaders are clinging to the hope that the visit might mark the beginning of a thaw in relations between the two sides, frosty after the Left withdrew support over the nuclear deal.         
	Several CPM leaders and expelled partyman Somnath Chatterjee have said that Basu had not approved of the withdrawal of support, though he was opposed to the deal.        
	The Congress presidents office has told the partys state unit not to rush to her with bouquets, given the sombre occasion.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Chidambaram    
	New Delhi, May 18: The BJP has described P. Chidambaram, the home minister, as an injured martyr who appeared disheartened with the limited mandate the government has given him to combat Maoism.        
	The party  that on Monday pledged not to politicise the second Maoist strike in Dantewada  today went hammer and tongs at the UPA government for demoralising the security apparatus, engaged in battle in the Chhattisgarh forests, with their soft stand.         
	The BJP contextualised its attack in the back-to-back television interviews Chidambaram has given and allowed it to be known through sources that while it was reluctant to engage in a political debate, the government and the Congress were providing openings it could not ignore.        
	However, it refused to utter a word against its own government in Chhattisgarh and declined to take questions on whether the states administration had failed in its calling by not anticipating the strikes or effectively deploying central forces or protecting civilians.         
	It revelled in Chidambarams plight and played on the apparent differences between the government and the Congress on the policy to tackle Maoism.        
	Chidambaram in his defence said: The injured and the martyrs are both in Chhattisgarh. He appealed to the BJP to adopt a bipartisan approach to handling Maoism.        
	Briefing reporters, Arun Jaitley, Rajya Sabha Opposition leader, referred to a TV interview that Chidambaram gave last night in which he stated there was little he could do with the limited mandate he was given by the cabinet committee on security (CCS).        
	How can the fight against Maoism be crippled by the CCSs inability to give a larger mandate to eliminate Maoism? A limited mandate effectively means that our security apparatus must fight Maoists with one hand tied. The half battle against Maoism can never succeed. A half battle is a losing battle. India cannot afford to lose this battle against the Maoists, Jaitley stressed.        
	The BJP leader recycled the strategy he had used in a Rajya Sabha discussion on Dantewada and remarked that while it was intriguing that the Opposition willingly backed the governments present policy, the Congress and the UPA were tentative and picked on Sonia Gandhis letter in the latest issue of Sandesh (the Congress mouthpiece) to buttress his argument.        
	It is no longer peripheral leaders who want a soft stand against the Maoists. It is the centre-stage leadership of the Congress, which has now supported that (soft) stand. The recent letter by Sonia Gandhi to the Congress workers published in the party journal lends support to the soft line on the Maoists, Jaitley said.        
	A source said Congress general secretary Digvijay Singhs reported disapproval of Chidambarams proposal to use air support in the Maoist strongholds bolstered its case of muddled thinking in the top echelons of the party and government.         
	Singh was bold enough to say it on the sidelines of a rally in Mirzapur that Rahul Gandhi addressed. He has his blessings, the source said.        
	Jaitley virtually repudiated the line that development could solve the problem. But in order to ensure development and poverty eradication, the secluded Maoist-dominated areas must first be entered in order to establish the rule and governance of the civilian administration....         
	Those who believe in templates rather than action can shy away from this real debate, he said.         
	Alleging that the UPA government was in power but not in control, Jaitley demanded that the Prime Minister must tell the nation if he favoured a limited mandate and if India would see half a battle against the Maoists.

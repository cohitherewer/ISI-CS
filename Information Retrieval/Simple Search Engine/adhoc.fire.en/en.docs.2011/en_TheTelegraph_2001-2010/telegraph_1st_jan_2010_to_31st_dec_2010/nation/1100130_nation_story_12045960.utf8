The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Refueller shock for Germany
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Refueller shock for Germany
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 29: Germany today termed Indias cancelling of a competition to buy six mid-air refuellers for the Indian Air Force a nasty surprise.         
	European consortium EADS Airbus was the frontrunner to clinch the $1.5-billion deal, until the defence ministry cancelled the tender earlier this month.         
	It came as a little bit of a nasty surprise for us and (it was) very disappointing that it was rejected at the political level, German ambassador Thomas Matussek said, three days before German President Horst Koehlers week-long state visit beginning Monday. The rejection was not explained to us in detail. It appears that quality, performance of the system, state-of-the-art-technology, reliability were not exactly the criteria. The selection was done only on the label price as it stands.         
	The IAF had hinted at its preference for the Airbus 330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport refuellers over the Russian Illyushin-78. The tender was cancelled after the finance ministry questioned the price.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hooded IG holds firm
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hooded IG holds firm
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI AND BARUN GHOSH                          The IG on Saturday                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 21: Special in-spector-general (EFR) Benoy Chakraborty is unrepentant, a day after appearing before the media in a black mask and blaming the West Midnapore superintendent of police for not shifting the Shilda camp.         
	I do not have any repentance. I stand by what I said and do not care about punishment as what I have done is justified, he told The Telegraph.         
	Chakraborty blamed the prevailing system for the death of 24 EFR personnel and said he was not scared of anything. Had the SP act-ed professionally, considering the abject condition in which the EFR policemen lived at Shilda, there would not have been casualties. It was sheer negligence. We need to correct the system in which we work giving due importance to sub-ordinates, he added.        
	A 1991 batch officer of the state police, Chakraborty became special IG (EFR) about a month and half ago. He was the special IG (bureau of investigation) before that.        
	Yesterday, he took many by surprise by donning the mask and blaming the superintendent  a junior officer  for the Maoist massacre.         
	Calling a news conference was a conscious decision. I wanted to send a message across so that no more policemen are killed like those in Shilda, he said today, adding: I am devastated by losing 24 of my men and cant bear the grief of the shattered families.        
	He feels it is his moral responsibility to expose how the administration works in Maoist-hit areas and its apathy towards EFR personnel there. The lives of policemen in the unsafe and vulnerable camps are not valued. The government should provide all the infrastructure so that they can fight the guerrilla like a guerrilla rather than being used as cannon fodder.        
	Asked why he sought refuge behind a veil at the news conference, Chakraborty said: I had donned the black mask for my personal safety. There is specific intelligence about a possible attack at Salua. Why should I show my face to the Maoists? I have to work here.         
	A source close to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said departmental proceedings would soon start against Chakraborty for the outburst after the chief minister had ordered a probe to fix responsibility for lapses behind the massacre. It is unbecoming of an IPS officer to speak on an issue on which the chief minister has already ordered a probe. So the officer has to face departmental proceedings. But it is up to the chief minister to decide whether he should be suspended or transferred from the key post he is holding.        
	The source confirmed that a report on Chakrabortys behaviour would be placed before Bhattacharjee tomorrow.        
	According to procedure, the chief minister will sign the order on departmental proceedings against Chakraborty after he gets a report from the state police chief. As the officer concerned is in the IPS, the order has to be signed by the chief minister, a senior police officer said.         
	State police chief Bhupinder Singh, however, said no decision had been taken on the IGs suspension.

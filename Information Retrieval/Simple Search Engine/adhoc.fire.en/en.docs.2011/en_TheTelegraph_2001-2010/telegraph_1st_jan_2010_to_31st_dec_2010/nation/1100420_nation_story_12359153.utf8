The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PC trains guns at 33-page brigade
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      PC trains guns at 33-page brigade
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               Arundhati Roy and   P Chidambaram      
	New Delhi, April 19: P. Chidambaram today took on civil society organisations for showing sympathy towards Maoists by training guns at social activist and writer Arundhati Roy.        
	If the CPI (Maoist) overthrows the established authority and seizes power, will they allow any human rights organisation to function in this country? Will all those, who write 33-page articles, be allowed to write 33-page articles? Will there be a magazine to publish a 33-page article? the Union home minister said in the Rajya Sabha, referring to an article by Roy in Outlook magazine criticising the Centres operations against the guerrillas.        
	Chidambaram, replying to a discussion in the Upper House on the problem, said the rights organisations and NGOs which didnt realise that the rebels planned to seize power were living in a fools paradise.        
	They want to overthrow the parliamentary system. And how should Parliament respond to this challenge? I think the human rights organisations and the NGOs are living in a fools paradise, the minister said.         
	Chidambaram said he was willing to be advised, if necessary on the cross-corrections we need to make, but suggested that what he was doing was right.         
	Reeling off figures of the over 200 cops killed and 71 school buildings and 23 panchayat buildings demolished in 2009 alone, he questioned the wisdom of those advocating talks with the Maoists.         
	Will anyone, any of these human rights organisations, any of these NGOs stand up and tell the people of this country, rebuild these 71 school buildings, we assure you that the CPI (Maoist) will not attack any more school buildings? he asked.         
	The rift between Chidambaram and civil society groups has widened since the minister took a firm position on the offensive against the rebels. Groups such as those led by Roy have time and again warned that unless security forces stop unleashing a reign of terror in the tribal heartland, the problem cannot be resolved.         
	Rights bodies have said the Maoists target school buildings as they are being used as camps by security forces. In the lovely forest villages, the concrete school buildings have either been blown up and lie in a heap or they are full of policemen, Roy wrote in her article describing the situation in Chhattisgarhs Bastar.

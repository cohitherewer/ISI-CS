The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | ArcelorMittal project here to stay
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      ArcelorMittal project here to stay
          SUBRAT DAS                          Arcelor Mittals medical team visits villages in Keonjhar. (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                   
	Bhubaneswar, March 25: ArcelorMittal today ruled out shifting of its mega steel plant project from Orissa.        
	We have no proposal to shift the Orissa project. ArcelorMittal chief executive officer (CEO) for Greenfield projects Sanak Mishra has given a written commitment to the state government to this effect, said D.S. Arora, the general manager of the Bhubaneswar office, today.        
	We are committed to the Orissa project and we are working on it. The company has no plans to relocate its staff from the Bhubaneswar office either, said Arora.        
	The company has deployed 17 employees in Orissa (12 in Bhubaneswar and five at the project site in Keonjhar). The Bhubaneswar office has three general managers, seven managers and two executives, while five CSR managers and executives have been posted at the project area. None of them have been issued orders of transfer, said company sources.        
	However, we are fed up with the inordinate delay in acquisition of land by the state, admitted a senior official, requesting anonymity.        
	Group chairman L.N. Mittal and senior officials have been pursuing the matter with the state, he said. Presently, Mishra is in the city to talk about land acquisition issues.         
	Last October, a British newspaper had quoted Mittal as saying his company may pull out of Jharkhand and Orissa and look for alternative sites if land acquisition problems were not resolved soon.        
	Meanwhile, ArcelorMittal has negotiated with the Karnataka government and signed an agreement to set up a steel plant there at a cost of Rs 30,000 crore.        
	We have no information about the companys plan to pull out from Orissa. The ArcelorMittal CEO had given a written commitment to us a few months ago, said state industries and steel amp; mines minister Raghunath Mohanty.        
	The fact, however, remains that the proposed 12 million tonne Greenfield steel plant project here has made little headway. Though the Orissa government had committed to 8,000 acres for the proposed steel plant at the time of signing the MoU in 2006, it has not yet been able to provide any land. The process has been delayed due to agitation by displaced families under the banner of Mittal Pratirodh Manch as most of the land is fertile, agricultural land.        
	State industries and steel amp; mines minister Raghunath Mohanty said land acquisition was delayed due to elaborate official procedures prescribed under Orissa Land Acquisition Act.         
	However, the process is at advanced stage of completion, he said.        
	ArcelorMittal has already deposited Rs 25 crore with the government for land acquisition-related activities and held meetings in eight of the 15 villages to be affected.        
	We have provided Rs 3 crore for corporate social responsibility activities in 2010-11 and we have already taken up several projects like distribution of medicated mosquito nets, holding tuition classes for poor students and providing financial assistance to self-help groups and anganwadi workers, said an official.        
	The company has also applied for three acres to establish an industrial training institute for local youths.

	New Delhi, March 30: Road accident victims in Delhi who had to wait years before their claims were settled will now receive compensation within 90 to 120 days, thanks to a scheme to be launched next month.        
	The scheme, which involves the police, insurance companies and motor accident claims tribunals, has separate deadlines for investigation of the accident, settlement of the claim and payment of the compensation. (See chart)        
	The police formulated the plan in collaboration with insurance companies following a Delhi High Court direction, and will initially introduce it as a pilot project for six months. It will be extended if successful, with whatever tailoring is necessary.        
	Such a scheme had become necessary because thousands of cases are pending at the 13 motor accident claims tribunals in Delhi, where at least five road accidents happen every day.        
	According to a website that covers Delhis courts, 4,619 fatal accident cases were pending at these tribunals as of February 2009. Some 2,004 of them were stuck in the three tribunals at the Patiala House courts alone, and another 1,144 in the three tribunals at the Rohini courts.        
	If this scheme comes through, it will be a lot of help for people like us who have to wait years for compensation, said Mohammed Tahir, whose right hand was crushed under the rear wheels of a bus six years ago.        
	An accident victim has to spend a lot of money on medical bills. If relief comes early, proper medical help can be provided. Receiving the money several years after the accident doesnt help a person who has already been crippled because he had no money after the accident to provide himself with proper care.        
	Tahir had received Rs 5.76 lakh in compensation five years after his accident.        
	According to an advertisement on the scheme prepared by the police, accident investigations must be completed within 30 days.        
	We will collect and verify the evidence for computation of compensation and submit a detailed accident report to the tribunal during this time, with a copy to the insurance company and the Delhi legal services authority, an officer said.        
	The insurance company must finalise its offer in another 30 days. If the tribunal and the claimant find the offer acceptable, the tribunal will straightaway pass a consent award and the company must pay the victim within another 30 days.        
	The claimant will therefore get the compensation within 90 days of the accident, the officer said.        
	If the claimant finds the insurance companys offer unsatisfactory, the tribunal will settle the matter in 30 days so that the compensation reaches the victim or his family within 120 days of the accident.

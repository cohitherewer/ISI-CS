The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Apple lines up tablet computer sneak peek
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Apple lines up tablet computer sneak peek
                              Steve Jobs                            
	New York, Jan. 19: Apple sent email invitations to journalists on Monday morning for a special event to be held on January 27 in San Francisco. Come see our latest creation, the message said.        
	Unless you have been living on another Internet-deprived planet for the last year or so, you probably have a pretty good idea what this is likely to be: the unveiling of Apples long-awaited, breathlessly hyped tablet computer. The device promises to hasten the extinction of paper and solidify Apples advantages in the mobile computing market.        
	Apple has been developing the tablet for several years under the supervision of Steve Jobs, the chief executive. Analysts predict that it could shake up the market by popularising a new form of computer.        
	The device, said to resemble an oversized iPod Touch, is likely to have a 10-inch touchscreen. It will be capable of linking to the Internet with wireless or 3G connectivity and will act as a handheld lap computer for surfing the Web, watching films or television shows, listening to music or reading e-books.         
	Analysts predict that it will cost between $700 and $1,000. Apple has registered the Internet domain name iSlate.com, prompting reports that this will be the name of the new device. It is expected to go on sale midway through the year, after the January launch.        
	Other companies already produce tablet computers. Archos recently released its version built on Googles Android operating system, while Microsoft is working on its own format. Pundits, including Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, have forecast that a handheld tablet computing device will become the future of PCs.        
	The sophistication of touchscreen technology, the spreading availability of wireless broadband and the increasing selection of film, television and music streaming services have helped create a gap in the market for a multimedia device without a physical keyboard.        
	Jobs, 54, is expected to take centrestage at the launch of the tablet. A year ago, an announcement that he was taking six months leave because of a liver transplant, coupled with fears that the companys high-end music players, personal computers and phones would not sell well in the recession, sent Apple stocks to their low of 2008 at $78.20. On Monday, after a surge before Christmas, the shares rose to around $213, up nearly 2 per cent on the Christmas Eve close.        
	It has been a successful year for Apple, despite the fact that it has not released any big new products. The company recorded a 47 per cent rise in profits in its most recent quarter to $1.7 billion, on revenue of $36.5 billion. Jobs was paid his customary $1 annual salary in 2009, according to a regulatory filing, but he holds 5.5 million shares in Apple and, over the course of 2009, his holdings have leapt in value to about $1.15 billion.         
	Apple said it had reimbursed Jobs only $4,000 for company travel on his $90 million Gulfstream V jet, which he received as a bonus in 1999. Jobs is also the largest individual shareholder of The Walt Disney Co. His 7.4 per cent stake is worth about $4.5 billion.

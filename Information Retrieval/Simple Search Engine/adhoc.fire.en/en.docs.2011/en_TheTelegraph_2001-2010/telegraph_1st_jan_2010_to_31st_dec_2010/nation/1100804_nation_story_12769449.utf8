          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: The Supreme Court will now hear the grievance of a Delhi policeman who was punished for telling his boss he was too busy to do anything.        
	Hari Om, a head constable with Delhi police, was posted at Delhi airport in 2005. On December 14, 2005, he was called by his superior and asked to check some information pending with the record room. He was also asked about some registers, pending dossiers and other papers.        
	His senior later alleged that Hari Oms behaviour and response was atrocious as he had claimed he was the busiest person and could not carry out the orders then. The head constable was suspended the same day without any formal order. The formal suspension order was passed only on January 3, 2006.        
	He was reinstated with immediate effect on his request on January 19, 2006, pending an inquiry. Disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him on February 10, 2006, and an inquiry was held.        
	In the inquiry it was alleged that Hari Oms general attitude was to pose as the busiest person around whenever work was assigned to him.        
	His superior, a station house officer, said he had cautioned him about his attitude and asked him to complete the job on top priority. But there was no change in his behaviour. Instead, Hari Om told the officer he could take any steps he thought appropriate, but he would work according to his own pace and convenience. This, it was alleged, was gross indiscipline and insubordination.        
	The inquiry officer examined five witnesses and ruled against Hari Om. During the inquiry, the constable did not produce any witness in his defence nor did he depose. On the basis of the inquiry report and the constables reply, the disciplinary authority punished him. The authority directed that he would stand to forfeit one year of permanent service.         
	His suspension period would also be treated as not spent on duty, Hari Om was told. The appellate authority upheld this punishment. Hari Om challenged his punishment in the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). He said he was never given a copy of the inquiry report which was against all principles of natural justice. He also contended that the inquiry officer had only found him guilty on one count  atrocious behaviour  and not on the charge that there was no change in his behaviour even after he was cautioned. But the disciplinary authority did not take this into account.        
	However, the department claimed that the charges against him could be culled out from his responses to the SHO that showed no change in behaviour.        
	The tribunal held that though the version of the superior officer, Inspector Dharambir Singh Joshi, was not supported by other witnesses, the statement of an inspector could not be ruled out lightly. Joshi had evidence to show he had called the SI (record) and other staff, including Hari Om, to ask them about the status of replies to be sent to senior officers about some official papers, it noted. It then upheld the charge against Hari Om on the preponderance of probabilities.        
	Hari Om went to the high court, where he pleaded that the inspectors version was not correct but did not give his own version. But the high court ruled that merely because other staff had not complained against him, it did not mean that the complaint by the SHO was not correct. He then appealed to the Supreme Court. Hari Om claimed he was made ASI on June 2, 2010. But for the illegal punishment order he would have been selected for this post at least three-and-a-half years earlier, he said. The policeman said he had also lost out on seniority as well as financial benefits, both salary and pension.        
	Yesterday, the court issued notices to the joint commissioner of police, police headquarters, and the deputy commissioner of police, IGI Airport, asking them why Hari Oms punishment should not be reduced.

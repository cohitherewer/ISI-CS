          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, March 29: The President is required to address only a new session and need not address a House when it resumes after an adjournment, the Supreme Court said today, upholding Parliaments powers to frame its own rules of business.        
	No special address is required when a session is adjourned sine die in the previous year and the sitting of the same session is resumed the next year, a Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan said.         
	It is only when a House is prorogued and a new session is called that a special address is required by the President to inform Parliament why it has been convened, the judges said.         
	Republican Party of India MP Ramdas Athawale had filed a petition challenging the validity of the proceedings of the Lok Sabha that had commenced January 29, 2004, on the ground that the President had not addressed both Houses.         
	He contended that the term first in Article 87 of the Constitution, which makes such an address mandatory, should mean the session at the start of a calendar year. By that definition, the session commencing January 29, 2004, was the first session that year. Since the President didnt address both Houses at the beginning of the session, their proceedings were unconstitutional and void, he argued.        
	The court did not agree. The 14th session of the 13th Lok Sabha had commenced on December 2, 2003, and was adjourned sine die on December 23, 2003, the judges pointed out. The Speaker, they added, had informed members that the Lok Sabha would resume its sitting on January 29. The resumption , by no stretch of imagination, could be characterised as commencement of a new session. It is the second part of the same session.        
	The bench noted that an adjournment was only an interruption in the course of one session, whereas a prorogation terminated a session.        
	The judges also said the validity of any proceeding of Parliament cannot be questioned on the ground of procedural irregularity. The Speaker is the guardian of the privileges of the House.

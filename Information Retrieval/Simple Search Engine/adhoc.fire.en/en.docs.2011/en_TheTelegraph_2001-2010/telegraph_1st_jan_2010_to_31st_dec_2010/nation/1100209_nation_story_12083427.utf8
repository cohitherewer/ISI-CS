          ARCHIS MOHAN                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: The Centre hopes to ink an accord with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha at the next tripartite talks on Gorkhaland, the date for which will be announced after a meeting on Wednesday.         
	The Centre and the Bengal government have offered to enhance the powers of the DGHC. Earlier, after the third round of talks in August 2009, it had been agreed that the DGHC Act of 1988 would be repealed provided the Morcha and the state proposed an alternative set-up.         
	The governments may agree to replace the DGHC with a body that would have more area under it and increased executive and legislative powers.         
	The date for the fifth round of tripartite talks will be announced after consultations at the cabinet committee on political affairs on February 10.         
	Home ministry sources today hinted that an agreement with the Morcha may be reached in the fifth round.         
	If not for the Telangana issue, home secretary G.K. Pillai could have returned from Darjeeling with an agreement after the fourth round itself, said a ministry official. Sources said the Centre had been in touch with Morcha chief Bimal Gurung.         
	The Morcha had demanded the fifth round of talks within 45 days of the fourth round held on December 21, but the government missed the deadline.         
	A separate Gorkha state is out of the question. None of the three political parties in Bengal  the CPM, Congress and the Trinamul Congress  is in favour of a Gorkha state. How will the resolution be passed in the Assembly, said the official.

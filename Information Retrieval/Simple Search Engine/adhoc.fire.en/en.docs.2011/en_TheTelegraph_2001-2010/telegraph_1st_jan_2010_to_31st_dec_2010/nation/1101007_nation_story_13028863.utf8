          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 6: Structural changes are on the cards for the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), which got a new chief today.         
	K. Vijay Kumar, who took over as director-general, said: If vital structural changes are required, I will carry them out.        
	Sources said Kumar, who led the team that hunted down forest brigand Veerappan, would also be expected to lift the morale of the two-lakh strong force that has taken a beating after repeated losses to Maoists.        
	My job will be to figure out how to make it (the force) more purposeful, he said.         
	The CRPF, unlike other forces, does not have a specific mandate. Its range of duties covers fighting Naxalites, providing security for elections, maintaining law and order during rathyatras and tackling insurgents.         
	Naxalites are one of the formidable challenges, Kumar said. Police commanders ka kaam Naxal ko message dena nahin hai, he said when asked if he had a message for Maoists.

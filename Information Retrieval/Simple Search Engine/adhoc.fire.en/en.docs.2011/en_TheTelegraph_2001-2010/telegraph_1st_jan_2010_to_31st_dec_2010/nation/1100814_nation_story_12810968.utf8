          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      The Telegraph report on Friday                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: India today offered assistance of $5 million for victims of the floods in north-west Pakistan.        
	External affairs minister S.M. Krishna conveyed to his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi  what many retired Indian diplomats believe was belated  Delhis deepest sympathies and condolences to the people of and government of Pakistan on behalf of the people and Government of India.         
	The Government of India has offered assistance of $5 million for provision of relief material from India for the victims of the massive floods that have adversely affected Pakistan, causing widespread damage to life and property, said a statement from the external affairs ministry.        
	Krishna, in what was his first telephone conversation with Qureshi after the fractious July 15 news conference in Islamabad, conveyed this gesture of solidarity (of $5-million aid) with the people of Pakistan, in their hour of need.         
	Yesterday, The Telegraph had reported how retired diplomats saw Indias failure to send aid or issue a statement on the floods that have caused immense devastation in Pakistan as a failure of its foreign policy of good neighbourliness.        
	Sources in the ministry said Islamabad was likely to welcome New Delhis offer of aid this time.         
	In 2005, Islamabad has turned down Indias aid to victims of the earthquake that had hit Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

	New Delhi, May 5: The BJP shot itself in the foot a second time in Parliament after last weeks cut motion fiasco by torpedoing a discussion on the census because of internal divisions on the enumeration of castes.        
	The partys backward caste MPs are seething at their bosses in the House for deliberately mixing up issues and, instead, bringing the controversy over Bangladeshi infiltrators to the forefront. The MPs  who make up a sizeable block  felt they would have put the Centre on the mat had they tacitly backed the RJD, Samajwadi Party and Janata Dal (United) in demanding a caste-based census.        
	A meeting of the Union cabinet yesterday had exposed the schisms within the Congress. M. Veerappa Moily, S. Jaipal Reddy and Vayalar Ravi had pitched for caste enumeration, but Pranab Mukherjee, Anand Sharma and Kapil Sibal opposed it. P. Chidambaram, whose home ministry is overseeing the exercise, said the enumerators lacked the sociological sensitivity to classify the population on lines of castes and sub-castes.        
	Today, the BJPs backward caste lobby was shocked with the way the partys motion was phrased. Instead of focusing on caste, the motion questioned how a residents nationality was being recorded without proof.        
	This means even recent illegal migrants from Bangladesh can declare themselves as Indian nationals without adducing evidence, it said. BJP leader Ananth Kumar spoke on the theme in Parliament, but went on to controversially include the Nepalis, too.        
	Once the subject of illegal immigration was foregrounded, the OBC MPs concluded, their case went out of the window.        
	The BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, Gopinath Munde, had first flagged off the inclusion of caste in the census last month. Later, he had clarified it was his personal view.         
	Two days ago, Sushma Swaraj said this (the census) is a golden opportunity to classify the population on class, caste and religious lines. Today, she wondered why Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav were pre-occupied with caste.

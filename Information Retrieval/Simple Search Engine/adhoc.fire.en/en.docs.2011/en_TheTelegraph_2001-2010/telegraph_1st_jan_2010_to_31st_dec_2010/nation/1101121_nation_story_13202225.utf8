	London, Nov. 20 (PTI): An Indian-origin woman has been conned of nearly 22,000 worth of cash and jewellery by a man claiming to be a Hindu priest who is believed to have fled to Kerala from the east Midlands city of Leicester.        
	Hema Bhalsod, 37, was told by the man named Shankar that she was possessed by demons and needed to have cleansing rituals performed when she contacted him to complain about feeling unwell.        
	Shankar also told her that gold jewellery belonging to her family was cursed and that she should hand it over to him. When she did so, he disappeared, reports from Leicester said.        
	During her interactions with him, Bhalsod reportedly took bank loans of 7,000 and handed over 15,000 worth of the jewellery. She said she felt humiliated and hurt by the experience.        
	Bhalsod said: It was stupid to think he was helping me but I was desperate. Im totally broke now and he has my familys gold.        
	She said a leaflet advertising the services of the priest was posted through her door in June. She had been feeling unwell for a couple of weeks and had seen her doctor, who had been unable to diagnose the problem.        
	Despite being hesitant, she rang the number on the leaflet in search of advice.        
	She said: A man calling himself Shankar said I should come and meet him and he would try to find out what was wrong. He said I had demons inside me and asked for 325 to perform a ritual with fire.        
	It was very strange, I felt like I was almost under a spell.        
	She added: He said for 2,000 he would be able to remove the bad energy, so I took out a loan. But I started to feel worse.        
	The man then asked the woman to wait for nine days before returning to him and when she did he said he needed 5,000 so someone in India could also perform a ritual.        
	I just wanted the problem solved and to feel better again, so I took out another loan. Again he said to wait nine days and on the ninth day I started to feel myself again.        
	The priest then reportedly told her that the gold jewellery she was wearing had been cursed with black magic.        
	In October, he asked her to collect all the gold in her house and bring it to him at an address in Leicester so he could cleanse it.         
	She said: I had been outside for more than an hour so I went into the house and he was gone. I felt so stupid and realised what he had done.

	Hyderabad, Dec. 21: A top Maoist leader and three other rebels have surrendered, Andhra Pradesh police said today.        
	Additional director general of police M. Ratan, who presented the four to the media, said Maddela Adellu, 45, was a state committee member who carried a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh on his head.         
	Adellu, alias Anand, was accused of nine offences, including two murders.        
	His wife Kurma Rambai, 40, was a divisional committee member of the north Gadchiroli and Gonda joint divisional committee in Maharashtra. She went by the name Saritha.        
	The third to surrender is 25-year-old Killo Raju, alias Krishna, the commander of Konnavaram pocket militia. A pocket is made up of 10 villages.         
	Seendri Subba Rao, alias Srikanth, is the fourth. The 18-year-old was Rajus deputy.         
	Ratan said there were only 370 active and underground Maoist activists in Andhra Pradesh.         
	State police have intensified vigil on the Andhra-Orissa border and also on the Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra borders in view of reports of attempts by armed Maoist groups to infiltrate into Andhra after Operation Green Hunt started in Dandakaranya.         
	We have noticed infiltration of armed dalams, including military platoons, on the Orissa border and in the north Telangana region, the police officer said.         
	Four Maoists were killed in the Visakhapatnam forests during the weekend. Grenades, mines and Maoist literature was found in East Godavari district.        
	 The police said Maoists have planted pressure and claymore land mines all along the Orissa-Andhra border forests and jungle villages to keep commandos away from their hideouts.

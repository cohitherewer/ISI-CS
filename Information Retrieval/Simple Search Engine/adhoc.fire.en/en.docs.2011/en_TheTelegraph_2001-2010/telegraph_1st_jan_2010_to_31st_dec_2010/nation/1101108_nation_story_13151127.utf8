The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Move-on nudge to Delhi 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Move-on nudge to Delhi 
          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 7: US President Barack Obama today used the forum of a students meet to suggest that India moves on from obsessing over Pakistan where the progress in countering terrorism is not as quick as we would like.        
	Obama was asked by an undergraduate, Afsheen Irani, why the US was not labelling Pakistan a terrorist state.        
	Barack Obama replied that Pakistan is an enormous country of strategic importance to the world.        
	Even if it surprises many, he said, he would insist that the country that has the biggest stake in Pakistans success is India. If Pakistan is unstable it is bad for India; if Pakistan is stable it is good for India. India is on the move. India can afford to do without the distractions in an unstable neighbourhood, he added.        
	The BJP yesterday criticised Obama for not speaking out against Pakistan while commemorating victims of 26/11 at the Taj here, though the party has since then been calibrating its stand.         
	As soon as he heard Afsheen, Obama said good question and, I must say, not wholly unexpected.        
	The President had come prepared. Even if it was not a diplomatic forum, Obamas remarks showed the kind of line the White House is likely to push in the talks in Delhi tomorrow  basically that India and Pakistan should resume dialogue.        
	He suggested that India and Pakistan could start talking about the less controversial issues building up to the more controversial issues. He added it was up to India and Pakistan to decide what course of action they will take.        
	He said Islamabad was cracking down on terrorism, especially in North West Pakistan, even if it left a lot to be desired. I think Pakistan government understands now the potential threat that exists within their own border. Lot more Pakistanis were killed by terrorists inside Pakistan than probably anywhere else.... I think there is a growing recognition but it is something that does not happen overnight, Obama said.        
	Afsheen Irani, the second-year management studies student and the student director in H.R. College of Commerce and Economics, was still trembling with excitement after the event. I was really nervous. I did not know whether I should or should not (ask the question). But I finally decided to because he did not talk about it yesterday, she said. She was not sure if she was satisfied with the answer. It was diplomatic with flowery language, she said. But Im still so excited, maybe it will all settle down later.         
	Obama said the US was working with Pakistan to put down extremism. In answer to the first question on jihad, he had said extremists distorted the notion of Holy War in Islam. He referred to that and said there were such elements in Pakistan who were like a cancer threatening to engulf Islamabad.        
	He said there was need to militarily put down extremists who were violent as they were in Mumbai and New York.        
	The Pakistan government is very aware of that and what we have tried to do in the last several years is to engage aggressively with Pakistan government to communicate that we want nothing more than a stable, prosperous and peaceful Pakistan,... More Pakistanis were being killed by terrorists than others. But the change in Pakistan is not likely to going to happen overnight, he said.        
	Our feeling has been to be honest and forthright with Pakistan to say we are your friend, this (extremism) is a problem and we will help you but the problem has to be addressed, he added.        
	In reply to a question on Afghanistan, he said though 2011 is set to see a drawdown of troops, the military needs of the war in Afghanistan would dictate the schedule.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Party OBC ire dogs Nitin
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Party OBC ire dogs Nitin

	New Delhi, May 13: Nitin Gadkaris remark yesterday that Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav were licking Sonia Gandhis feet like dogs has not only angered the RJD and the Samajwadi Party but shocked the OBC functionaries in the BJP too.        
	Gadkari quickly apologised today, prompting BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman to declare the controversy closed. But the partys OBC lobby continued to fume as did its MPs from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where the remarks could have serious implications.        
	A Kurmi MP from Uttar Pradesh said that as a Brahmin, party chief Gadkari needed to show the political maturity of predecessors like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Deen Dayal Upadhyay.        
	Even a Brahmin Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh said: Gadkari should use language in a more nuanced way. Maybe cuss words go down well in a corporation but not when he is heading a national party.        
	Gadkari has been quoted as saying at a Chandigarh rally last evening: These leaders were roaring like lions but once they went to Sonias home, they licked the sole of her feet like dogs.        
	The context was the decisions by Lalu Prasad and Mulayam to vote against the cut motions on the finance bill.        
	The BJP chief today claimed he had used a proverb and said the word dogs should be taken metaphorically. They are respectable leaders. If they are hurt by my comments, I take back my words, he said.        
	But an OBC member from the Maharashtra BJP cited how even the anti-national barb at Lalu Prasad by Ananth Kumar (a Brahmin) was construed as an attack on the OBCs by some within the BJP.        
	Lalu Prasad, who wants to take on Nitish Kumar on the OBC plank in the Bihar elections, warned that his party would launch a protest campaign against Gadkari. I will use an injection to cure Gadkari of his affliction. Hes a coward, a news agency quoted Lalu Prasad as saying.        
	Samajwadi spokesman Mohan Singh said: We may accept his apology but what about the millions of Dalits and backwards whose sentiments have been hurt?

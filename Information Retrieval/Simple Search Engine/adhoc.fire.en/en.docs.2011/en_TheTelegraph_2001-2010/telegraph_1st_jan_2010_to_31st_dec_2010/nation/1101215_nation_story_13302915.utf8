          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: All faiths are equally protected under the Constitution and the Ayodhya title suit could not be decided on the basis of the faith of one party, the Sunni Central Wakf Board said today in a petition filed in the Supreme Court challenging the Allahabad High Court verdict.         
	Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution give equal protection to all faiths, the petition said, arguing that the high court had proceeded to rely on the so-called belief/faith of a section of the Hindu community regarding the place of birth of Lord Rama below the middle dome of the Babri Masjid although there was no evidence to record such a finding.         
	The wakf board said there was no evidence of the existence of a temple at the disputed site or its demolition before the construction of Babri Masjid around 1528 AD.         
	It was virtually impossible to determine or hold any particular place, and especially the site of the mosque, as the place of birth of Lord Rama when the evidence adduced by the Hindu side was to the effect that he was born more than 9 lakh years ago, the petition filed through counsel Shakil Ahmed and vetted by senior Anoop Choudhari said.         
	As such no such finding could be given under the law that the three-domed structure of the mosque, or any portion thereof, was the place of birth of Lord Rama as per belief and faith of the Hindus.         
	The court had failed to appreciate that judgments of the district judge and judicial commissioner of Oudh passed in 1886 specifically mentioned that Hindus believed that the Ram Chabutra in the outer courtyard of the mosque was Lord Ramas place of birth, the petition said.         
	On the basis of historical or archaeological evidence starting from Ram Charit Manas, Ain-e-Akbari, travel accounts of William Finch, documents of the 1885 suit filed by the mahant of the Janmasthan and other documents produced in 1941 by mahants of the Nirmohi Akhara, it cannot be said that the so-called belief of the devotees of Lord Rama about his place of birth being below the three-domed structure was either ancient or existed in the 18th or 19th centuries or even in the first decades of the 20th century, the wakf board said.         
	The petition also argued that the high court had erred in holding that prayers were not being held in the mosque five times a day since 1855 or 1934. There was neither dispossession nor discontinuance of possession of Muslims even after idols were placed inside the dome on the night of December 22/23, 1949, it added.         
	The finding that the Hindus had exclusive possession of the outer courtyard was also perverse, the petition said.

          OUR BUREAU                                        A survivor arrives at Dhanbad station on the Vananchal Express, after the mangled   bogies were separated from the train. Picture by Gautam Dey      
	Ranchi/Dhanbad, July 19: When Arjun Mandal tried to stand up, he felt a stab of pain. Trapped between twisted iron rods, he managed to struggle to his feet. The he heard voices  beneath him.        
	It was about quarter past two, 13 minutes after the speeding Uttar Banga Express had crashed into the Vananchal Express.        
	I heard groans and muffled voices. I managed to drag out one person trapped underneath, but we couldnt get out. Then I lost consciousness, the 36-year-old, an employee of Ranchi Veterinary College, told The Telegraph after reaching Dhanbad by a special train.        
	Another survivor, Bhagalpurs Deepak Arora, said his compartment was dragged for more than 200 metres by the north Bengal train.        
	Only 10 passengers had walked out of his coffin coach unscathed, said Abdul Kaes of Sahebganj. The others were either dead or critically injured.        
	In Ranchi, Sangita Tirkey doesnt even know if her aunt is dead or alive?        
	For nearly 16 hours, she has been waiting. My aunt was travelling in the general compartment. I dont know if she is safe. Her mobile phone is switched off, the 16-year-old said.        
	Her aunt Mary Tirkey was coming on holiday from Sahebganj, nearly 500km away.         
	A relative said Marys name was not on the list of 90 injured sent from a hospital in Suri, Birbhum.        
	Ranchi additional divisional railway manager Sunil Kumar said they feared several of the 62 dead were from the Jharkhand capital, but the exact toll wouldnt be clear before a couple of days.        
	While Sangita and her family waited, Jairam Oraon prepared to leave for Sainthia. My only son, Bhubaneshwar, was in one of the general coaches. He doesnt have a cellphone. I am going to Sainthia, said the resident Ranchi.         
	Many relatives were heading for Bhagalpur and Malda, where special enquiry counters have been opened.         
	We have arranged for a relief train for the kin of the victims, said divisional railway manager, Malda, M.K. Mathur.

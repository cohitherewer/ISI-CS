The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IAF off Red fight in state
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      IAF off Red fight in state
          KINSUK BASU                              
	Kalaikunda, Nov. 2: The air force chief today almost ruled out chopper support to fight Maoists in Bengal but added that the home ministry would take the final call on their deployment.         
	Asked if the IAF would deploy its helicopters in the states rebel-infested areas, Air Chief Marshal P.V. Naik said: We have only four helicopters for anti-Maoist operations and for the last six months they have been based across parts of Jagdalpur and Dantewada in Chhattisgarh and a few other areas. More helicopters are required.        
	Naik was in Kalaikunda today for the conclusion of a fortnight-long joint air exercise with the Royal Air Force of the UK.         
	He added though that ultimately it was up to the Union home ministry to decide where the choppers would be posted. We cant decide where and how the helicopters need to be used against Naxals. It is for the ministry of home affairs to decide, the IAF chief said.        
	The helicopters are equipped with side-mounted medium machine guns and are escorted by Garud commandos whose main task is to protect the IAFs assets. The force has permission to fire in self-defence if fired at but it cannot use its rockets and ground-attack weapons as yet.

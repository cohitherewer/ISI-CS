          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                      Mahesh Bhupathi with fiancee Lara Dutta. File picture                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 25: So what you repaid your dad, now pay the tax.        
	The Supreme Court today threw out Mahesh Bhupathis plea for tax exemption on the amount he said he had repaid his father for making him a Davis Cup-level player.        
	Bhupathi had claimed a tax exemption on Rs 28.5 lakh, which he said he had paid his father, but the three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia, dismissed his lawyer K.V. Mohans plea.        
	What was the IT returns of the father when he made the agreement? Justice Kapadia, whose core area of expertise is commercial law and income tax, asked, referring to the contract Bhupathi claimed he had entered into with his father on June 10, 1994.        
	What was the nature of the loan and how was the amount spent, the judge asked, before throwing out Bhupathis appeal against a Karnataka High Court order.        
	In his petition, Bhupathi had claimed the payment was for training obtained to make him fit enough to play Davis Cup matches.        
	He said his father C.G. Krishna Bhupathi spent the amount  Rs 28.5 lakh  between 1989-90 and 1993-1994 on his education, food, clothing, travelling expenses and training. He said he had agreed to repay the loan within 10 years of starting to earn, but lower-level tax officials had refused his plea for exemption.         
	Bhupathi had then taken his case to the commissioner of income tax (appeals) but failed to get any relief. He then approached the income tax appellate tribunal, which allowed him to claim 50 per cent exemption over the 10 years in which the amount was to be repaid.         
	The tennis player, regarded as one of the best on the doubles circuit, then moved Karnataka High Court. His lawyer contended that Krishna Bhupathi ran a coaching institute in Oman and it could not be said the agreement between the father and the son was strange. The father of the assessee, being a trainer, is entitled to claim the amount spent by him to train his students, he argued.        
	But the high court didnt agree. If really there was an agreement between the father and son, it would have been in existence before the father trained the son, the court said.         
	In this case, the court added, the father and the son had not been able to produce any agreement to prove they had entered into an agreement. Neither could they show details of the expenses incurred by the father.        
	The bench said the agreement came into existence only after Bhupathi started earning as a player, which meant the so-called contract was aimed at avoiding payment of tax.         
	Moreover, the high court said, a father and son cannot enter into such a contract under Hindu law.        
	The court said under Hindu law, it was a fathers moral obligation and a moral duty to maintain his offspring as he wouldnt attain heaven unless and until his son offered pinda on his demise.         
	Therefore, the agreement would be contrary to the concept of Hindu law, the high court said.        
	Bhupathi then moved the Supreme Court, but the cross-court return left him stranded  and poorer, too.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ulemas thank archbishop 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ulemas thank archbishop 
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 17: Top maulanas and ulemas of the city have thanked the Archbishop of Mumbai for condemning Florida pastor Terry Joness plans to desecrate the Quran on the 9/11 anniversary this year.        
	They have also appealed to people to remain calm whatever the court verdict on Ayodhya on September 24.        
	Some of Mumbais most influential Muslim leaders and priests together visited Cardinal Oswald Gracias at his residence in Colaba last evening and expressed their gratitude over the stand he had taken on Joness announcement. Jones, however, had cancelled his much-publicised event following global condemnation and White House pressure.        
	We visited Cardinal Gracias and thanked him for his stand. We also apologised to him for the retaliatory attacks on churches in Punjab and Kashmir, said Maulana Abdul Jabbar Azmi, president of the Ulema Federation of India.        
	The incidents in Kashmir and Punjab should be seen as stray incidents carried out by people who do not know anything about the teachings of Islam, the maulana said.        
	Cardinal Gracias, who has been elected president of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India this year, had condemned Joness plans at a specially convened Bishops meet on September 3.         
	But the tense build-up had affected relations between Christians and Muslims in Mumbai, a city that witnessed communal violence in the aftermath of the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition.        
	We believe in both the Bible and the Quran, Azmi said today.        
	The ulemas had met chief minister Ashok Chavan earlier this week to ask for strengthened security across the city on the day of the Ayodhya verdict and the days following it.        
	We have decided that whatever the courts judgment is, it will be acceptable to us. We are also appealing for calm during the aftermath of the court verdict, All-India Ulema Council general secretary Maulana Mehmood Daryabadi said.        
	Whatever the verdict, everyone should react within the ambit of the law. Community members have been asked not to take the law into their own hands. If we are unhappy with the verdict, we will approach the higher court, but will not come out on the streets and create a situation where human life is endangered.        
	Dr Azimuddin, president of the Movement for Human Welfare, said: It is the duty of the Muslim community to denounce anyone committing acts of desecration against any religion. Anybody who desires to cause a rift among peaceful communities, be they Christian, Muslim or Hindu, should be arrested.

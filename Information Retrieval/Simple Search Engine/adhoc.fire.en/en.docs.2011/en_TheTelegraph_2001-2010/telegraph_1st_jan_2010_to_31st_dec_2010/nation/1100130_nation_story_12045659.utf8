  - Team India captain to choose test time and venue        SANTOSH K. KIRO                          MS Dhoni: Calling the shots                                        
	Ranchi, Jan. 29: Rarely does an examinee get to choose the centre and date of his exams, but then not every examinee is Mahendra Singh Dhoni.        
	The India captain will not only choose where he will take the two semester examinations he has missed, he will also decide when.        
	All that he needs to do is send an application detailing his choice of centre and dates to the St Xaviers College management. He will, however, have to send his exam fees with the application.        
	If Dhoni appears in the first and second semester exams from our college here, that may create a law-and-order problem. Therefore, we have offered to conduct the tests in any of the colleges run by Jesuit groups in the country, said Father Nicholas Tete, principal of St Xaviers College, Ranchi.        
	Dhoni had enrolled in the college in 2008 for a three-year bachelors course in office management and secretarial practice (OMSP). However, his hectic cricket schedule has prevented him from appearing in his first and second semester examinations.        
	The India captain can choose his exam centre from among the St Xaviers Colleges in Mumbai, Calcutta and Jaipur, Loyola College in Chennai and St Josephs College in Bangalore.        
	Once he expresses his preference, I can talk to the principal of the college concerned and make arrangements, Father Tete said.        
	St Xaviers Ranchi, affiliated to Ranchi University, has complete freedom in academic decisions. The college enjoys autonomy in designing course materials, the mode and dates of examinations and the evaluation process. It follows a six-month semester system.        
	Dhonis college will send his question papers to the centre of his choice along with a teacher, who will conduct the examinations.        
	Although St Xaviers Ranchi is doing everything possible to enable the India captain to complete his course, Dhoni is yet to submit an application to be allowed to appear in the examinations he has missed.        
	The wicketkeeper-batsman is getting ready to lead the Indian team against South Africa in the Test series beginning February 6. He is expected to have some free time between March 1 and 12, the interval between the Test series and the third edition of the Indian Premier League.        
	Asked when Dhoni might apply to the college to be allowed to take his semester exams, his brother Narendra said: I am not aware whether he has already applied. If not, he may have to do it soon.

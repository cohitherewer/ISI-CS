The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Price-rise pinch awaits govt

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 21: The government will face a major onslaught from the Opposition in the budget session of Parliament starting Monday for its failure to control rising prices of essentials.         
	Although financial business dominates budget session, issues like engagement with Pakistan and Maoist violence have also given the Opposition ammunition to corner the ruling combine.         
	The Opposition parties today made it clear at a meeting called by Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar that Parliament would not be allowed to function if the government did not allow a full-fledged debate on price rise immediately after the customary presidential address to the joint session of Parliament.         
	We want the price rise debate on the first working day itself, said the new leader of Opposition, Sushma Swaraj, supported by the Left, Samajwadi Party, Janata Dal United and even UPA partners like the DMK and the Trinamul Congress.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed his governments readiness to discuss every issue. The Congress, too, promised not to shy away from any debate and requested the Opposition not to resort to disruptive measures.         
	However, some disruptions appear unavoidable as the government may not like the debate to take place on the first day to avoid diversion of attention from the Presidents address. The BJP and the Left plan to move an adjournment motion on price rise, which too wont be accepted.         
	The government is ready for a debate the next day. The Congress will prefer a debate on prices before the budget is presented as much of the heat would then be on agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, not finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who is not inclined to give a populist budget in the first year of the UPAs new term.         
	Swaraj said her party would also raise issues like Maoist violence, the Ranganath Misra commission report, Indo-Pak talks and Justice Sageer Ahmeds report on autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir.         
	The CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta said the Left would raise issues like fertiliser price hike and plight of workers in the unorganised sector apart from price rise.        
	Trinamuls Sudip Bandopadhyay sought a discussion on political violence in Bengal, a perpetual demand from the CPMs bitter rival. Telugu Desam Party leader Nama Nageshwara Rao wanted debates on fertiliser prices and doubts on the functioning of electronic voting machines. Asked if they would also speak of Telangana, he said: Wed like to know what the national policy is on further division of states.         
	The Speaker said all parties had agreed to co-operate for the smooth running of the session, which would have 35 sittings. Asked about efforts to prevent collapse of the Question Hour, she said the rules committee had approved amendments to allow questions being taken up for answers and supplementaries even if the questioner was absent.        
	The new rule also allows the Speaker to take up the Question Hour at any time during the day if it has to be suspended during the normal time  11am to noon. This is a major decision as the Question Hour, the most important tool in the hands of the members for scrutinising the performance of ministries and making the government more accountable, often becomes the first casualty of ruckus in Parliament.

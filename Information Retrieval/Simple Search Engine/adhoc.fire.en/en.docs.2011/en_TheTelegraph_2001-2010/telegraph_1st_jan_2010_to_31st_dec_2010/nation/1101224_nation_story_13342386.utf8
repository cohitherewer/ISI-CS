          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Dec. 23: Dancing bar girls in a health centre?        
	Hic! Just a cultural programme, Maam.        
	But Mayavati wasnt convinced.        
	The director of the Uttar Pradesh health and welfare department, two top officers and four others were suspended today after the BSP government found out that employees hired bar girls to perform at a programme last night on the premises of the state health directorate.        
	Liquor also flowed, witnesses said, as some of the employees and the girls gyrated to popular numbers till late in the night.        
	The hall, where the programme was held to celebrate victory in elections to the employees health association, is part of the state community health centre for women and children.        
	The three officers who have been suspended are director Ramji Lal, additional director R.B. Singh and joint director Ramesh Chandra. The others are Sudhir Chaturvedi, Jaiveer Prasad, Hanuman Prasad and Vinod Kumar.         
	These senior officials and their subordinates organised the dance programme by the bar girls on the health directorate premises last night when I was away on a visit to Faizabad, director-general, health, S.P. Ram told The Telegraph tonight. We ordered a probe and these officials will face more stringent action when the probe report fixes culpability.        
	Prasad, one of the suspended seven, said the bar girls danced to popular numbers like Munni badnam hui and Sheila ki jawani, but added that the event was just to celebrate victory in elections to the employees association.        
	Kumar insisted it was a cultural event. I swear it was nothing but a cultural programme, he said.        
	Sources said an outraged Mayavati decided to act after TV channels aired footage of the programme this morning.        
	The footage showed the president, the general secretary and other office-bearers of the health association clutching their bottles and leaping in joy in close proximity to the bar girls.        
	Director-general Ram said a preliminary probe by a three-member panel had revealed that the three senior officers were told that bar girls had been hired to perform but did not intervene.        
	So although the three senior health officers were not present when the four bar girls came on, they virtually allowed them to perform, Ram said.        
	Officials said the state information and culture department had, in 2008, banned hiring of bar girls to perform in official programmes.

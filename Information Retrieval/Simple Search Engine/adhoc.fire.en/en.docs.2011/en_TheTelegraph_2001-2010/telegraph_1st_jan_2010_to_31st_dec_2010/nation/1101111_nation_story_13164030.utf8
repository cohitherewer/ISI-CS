The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In summer of revolt, Sonia over sahib
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      In summer of revolt, Sonia over sahib
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Sharad Pawar                                  
	Nov. 10: On May 15, 1999, Prithviraj Chavan was watching Indias World Cup cricket opener against South Africa on TV when he received a call from a close associate of sahib Sharad Pawar, informing him about a rebellion against AICC chief Sonia Gandhi.        
	The caller told Prithviraj to rush to the residence of Shivajirao Patil on Delhis Shah Jahan Road where most Pawar loyalists were holding a late-night conclave.         
	At Hove, Sourav Gangulys majestic 97 was on the wane as Jacques Kalliss 96 fashioned South Africas 4-wicket win over India. But, for cricket buff Prithviraj, Indias defeat was not as painful as Pawars unkind cut to Sonia at the Congress Working Committee meet that her foreign origin were, indeed, a serious issue.         
	For the next few days, as Congress leaders fought to persuade Sonia to stay on as the partys supreme leader and branded Pawar, P.A. Sangma and Tariq Anwar traitors, Prithviraj was constantly told to side with sahib.        
	The Pawar camp claimed that it had got a survey done in Maharashtra. The conclusion was that if Pawar raised the banner of revolt against Sonia on grounds of her foreign origin, he would be a second Lokmanya Tilak.        
	Thrown out of the Congress, Pawar formed the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which focused on punishing all those in western Maharashtra who did not side with him. In Karad, which had sent Prithvirajs parents D.R. Anandrao and Premlata Tai to Parliament from the 1950s to the 1980s, the engineer from BITS Pilani and California suddenly found himself struggling.        
	Pawar camped for days to ensure Prithvirajs defeat in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections. Shriniwas Patil of the NCP won. Most of his contemporaries in Maharashtra  who would probably be eyeing ministerial berths under him now  used to cite his defeat as a shining example of how sahib punishes defiance.        
	In 1999, when he was 53, Prithviraj was in political wilderness. Often, he would mope over his electoral loss. But each time, when the burden of defeat became unbearable, Prithviraj would remember mother Premlata Tais words that loyalty to the Gandhi family mattered more than the perks of office.        
	Within the Congress, too, Prithviraj struggled to survive. Sonia appointed him co-chairman of the AICCs department of policy, planning and co-ordination but 99 South Avenue, which housed the party wing, proved a tricky terrain.        
	Contemporaries Jairam Ramesh and Salman Khursheed teamed up well to keep him out. Madhavrao Scindia offered himself as a mentor but Prithviraj was quick to distance himself from the Gwalior leaders ambitions.        
	The entry of Rahul Gandhi in 2004 offered Prithviraj a window of hope. At the 15 Gurdwara Rakabgunj Road war room  the Congress election office  Rahul could sense different vibes. Unlike Jairam, Anand Sharma and others, Prithviraj was neither flamboyant nor eager in taking credit.        
	Forums such as the AICCs future challenges group, parliamentary standing committees and a long visit to China helped Rahul get a closer look at Prithviraj. Incidentally, it was in China in 2008 that the young Gandhi was constantly referred to as princeling.         
	Between 2004 and 2010, serving as a minister in the Prime Ministers office, Prithviraj matured as a seasoned politician. In 2004, the UPA was cobbled together hurriedly and under extraordinary circumstances following Sonias act of renunciation.         
	After its second victory in 2009, the alliance functioned better but in the larger context, the UPA continued to work more like a bureaucratic machine than a political conglomerate. Under these circumstances, Prithviraj was successful in acting as a bridge between 10 Janpath and South Block  where the Prime Ministers office is located.        
	In the past couple of years, sahib has re-established his old link with the pupil.

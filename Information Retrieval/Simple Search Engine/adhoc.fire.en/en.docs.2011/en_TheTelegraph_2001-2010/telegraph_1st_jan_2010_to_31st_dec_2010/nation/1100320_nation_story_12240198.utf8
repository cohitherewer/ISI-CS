The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | End to Lever strike in sight
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      End to Lever strike in sight
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, March 19: Hopes rose today of an end to the strike at Hindustan Unilevers detergent unit in Haldia after talks between a senior Mumbai-based company official and the protesting Trinamul Congress union.        
	Pankaj Gupta, general manager (operations) of Unilever, held two meetings, the first with leaders of the Trinamul union and the second with Subhendu Adhikari, the local Trinamul MP from Tamluk and the unions president.        
	Our talks were fruitful. We are hopeful that the impasse will end tomorrow, Adhikari said after the talks.        
	Workers affiliated to the Trinamul union are on an indefinite strike outside the plant since March 2 demanding reinstatement of four employees sacked for allegedly refusing to obey transfer orders. The workers had blocked the main gate but on Wednesday Calcutta High Court ordered police to clear the area.         
	But since yesterday, around 360 Trinamul-affiliated workers and drivers of three other Haldia companies that supply chemicals to the Unilever plant stopped work in support.        
	Elsewhere in Haldia, a Citu-sponsored strike continues at a Tata Chemicals unit since February 24. A company official today described the protest as illegal and said it would impact the future of the factory and the area at large.         
	If this continues, Haldia may not be seen as a preferred industrial location in Bengal, the official said. Six hundred Citu-affiliated casual workers at the unit have stopped work demanding fixed monthly salaries.

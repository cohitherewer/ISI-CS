The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong price jab at Singh govt
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong price jab at Singh govt
          SANJAY K JHA                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: The Congress has warned the Manmohan Singh government against mismanaging prices of essential commodities, the veiled criticism also urging the Centre not to negate the good work done by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi and millions of party workers.        
	Although the censure is subtle, the partys decision to reprimand its own government has raised eyebrows both in the ruling establishment and in the Congress.         
	The latest edition of party mouthpiece Congress Sandesh, which raised the issue of price rise, says it is the duty of every government to live up to the faith the common man has entrusted in it. The editorial, however, sugar-quotes the warning by recognising the compulsions of coalition politics.         
	The editorial, which links the partys political future with the management of prices, says: We should remember that sometimes even a small issue can negate the good work of a lifetime. Carelessness in dealing with issues directly related to human feelings always costs dear.         
	The mouthpiece reminds the government that it is because of the hard work of Sonia that the Congress had returned to power.         
	Asked if the party had made its first formal attack on Singh, a senior leader told The Telegraph: It should not be seen that way. We have mounted pressure on the government in the past by calling Congress working committee meetings on price rise. This is an expression of our frustration at the continuing rise in food prices, not a criticism of the Prime Minister.         
	The editorial says practical difficulties in co-ordination among the PMO and various ministries are natural in governments. But the poor and the common people should always get top priority.         
	The mention of practical difficulties while referring to coalition politics is being seen as an indirect reference to agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, the NCP chief. Pawar had come under attack at a CWC meeting a few days ago for the spiralling prices of essential commodities.         
	 House vote        
	The three-day deadlock in Parliament over price rise was broken today with the decision that the issue will be debated in both Houses tomorrow under rules that do not call for voting.        
	The Lok Sabha Speaker rejected the Oppositions demand for an adjournment motion citing rules and established procedures.

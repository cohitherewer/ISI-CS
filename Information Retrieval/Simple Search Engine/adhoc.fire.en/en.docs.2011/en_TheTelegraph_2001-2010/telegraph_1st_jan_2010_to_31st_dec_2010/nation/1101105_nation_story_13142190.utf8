	Srinagar, Nov. 4: Top separatist leader Shabir Shah was heckled by BJP youth wing activists and other allied groups in Jammu today, weeks after a Kashmiri Pandit threw a shoe at Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani in Delhi.         
	Workers of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha stormed into a hotel lobby where Shah was addressing a news conference and tried to attack him. They ransacked the venue and damaged furniture. Shahs glasses broke in the melee.         
	Shah, who heads the Democratic Freedom Party which is a constituent of the moderate Hurriyat faction, was released yesterday after spending nine months in jail. Police sources said he was staying in a local hotel and addressed the news conference in the afternoon. Shahs colleagues threw a ring around him to keep him from harm.         
	We have taken four people into preventive custody, said sub-divisional police officer S.S. Samiyal.         
	The Opposition PDP denounced the attack. In the democratic system, every person has the right to express their viewpoint. The manhandling of Shah during the press conference is an unconstitutional and barbaric act, which is against the basic principle of politics and democracy. Action should be taken against those involved, a party spokesperson said.         
	Shah again addressed the media after the incident and said the youths had been hired to attack him. I regret that the youth are being exploited for vested political interests, he said.         
	In Delhi last month, a Kashmiri Pandit threw a shoe at Geelani during a seminar, titled Azaadi  The Only Way, but missed.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 13: Delhi High Court has recommended government pardon for a mother who had strangled her baby after discovering she was a girl, ruling that society had scripted her (the babys) obituary much before she was born.        
	Justice Pradeep Nandrajog said the mother was as much a victim of society as her slain daughter, having grappled all her life with illiteracy, poverty and social deprivation.        
	Manju, the illiterate wife of a day labourer, had killed the yet-to-be-named baby the day she was born.        
	She (the infant) was a baby girl and her arrival was a calamity. She was a source of anxiety to her parents, for in her, they saw a difficult problem of her marriage, Justice Nandrajog wrote in the judgment.        
	Society had scripted her obituary much before she was born. Her mother only published it. This is the story of the unnamed infant; probably this is the first decision which cannot even refer to the victim by her name.        
	The judge dismissed Manjus appeal against her life sentence but ordered a copy of the judgment sent to the secretary, Delhi law and justice ministry, with a covering letter asking the government to consider reducing the sentence or pardoning Manju on compassionate grounds.        
	If such a decision has to be taken, the authority concerned would take into consideration that the appellant is an illiterate lady who comes from a poor socio-economic background, the judge said.        
	Her thinking and rationale could not develop as is expected in a democratic society as she got no education. It (the murder) is a serious offence and a culprit needs no compassion, except upon proof that the culprit was herself a victim of the society due to her illiteracy, poverty and social deprivation.        
	The judge added a few remarks about the contempt the girl child faced in India and the skewed sex ratio in the country.        
	Manju had given birth to the baby on August 24, 2007. Barely six hours later, nurses found the infant lying dead with strangulation marks on her neck. The post-mortem said she had been throttled.

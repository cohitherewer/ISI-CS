          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Manmohan Singh with Mukul Wasnik at   the meet. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 19: Bihar Congress workers today erupted in anger at Mukul Wasnik in the middle of the party plenary, accusing him of selling tickets during the just-concluded Assembly elections.        
	Mukul Wasnik chor hai (Mukul Wasnik is a thief), they screamed, shattering a lull in the proceedings caused by a snag in the sound system in the middle of a discussion on the political resolution.        
	As a stunned Congress leadership watched, the workers raised slogans demanding that Wasnik, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bihar, be thrown off the dais. They angrily waved away Seva Dal workers who tried to pacify them, and then rebuffed senior leader Oscar Fernandess efforts at restoring order.        
	As the commotion got out of hand, Seva Dal workers forcibly herded the protesters out of the main hall.        
	Outside, waiting TV crew pounced on the workers, who happily grabbed the chance to badmouth Wasnik. They alleged he had played a role in compromising 160 of the 243 Bihar seats, the primary reason why the workers had got demoralised before the polls.        
	They claimed the Congress would have won at least 40 seats had Wasnik and others not distributed tickets for extraneous considerations.        
	The leaders said they had no option but to make a noise at the plenary. Soniaji does not meet us. Our written complaints are not forwarded to her and middle-rung leaders conspire to silence us at such gatherings.        
	Sources confirmed that till Friday there had been plans to keep the Bihar PCC delegates out of the plenary on grounds that organisational elections had not been held. The real reason, however, was the fear they would create a ruckus.        
	The workers, however, landed up in Delhi and protested till the leadership gave in.        
	Sources said Sonia Gandhi felt her managers had bungled up in Bihar, but there were some leaders trying to protect Wasnik.        
	It was a new beginning. I dont believe we made a mistake by going alone. We wanted to create our own space in Bihar... the path may be longer, Wasnik said.

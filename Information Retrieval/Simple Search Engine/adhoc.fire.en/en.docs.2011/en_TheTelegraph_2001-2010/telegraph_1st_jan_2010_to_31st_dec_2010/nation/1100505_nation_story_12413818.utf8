          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ghulam Nabi Azad during a seminar in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, May 4: Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad today accepted that the government has been a hapless spectator to the alleged corruption plaguing the Medical Council of India, the nations apex regulator of medical education.         
	Azad said the act that governed the MCI protected it from government intervention, and an effort to amend the law five years ago had been stymied by a parliamentary committee.        
	It is not that we sat quietly and whatever was going on, we allowed that to go on, and whatever is going on, it is because of the fact that under the act, we cannot do anything, Azad said in the Rajya Sabha. He was responding to allegations by MPs that the government had not only failed to check corruption in the MCI but had also protected illegal activities and corruption.        
	Earlier this month, the CBI had arrested MCI president Ketan Desai on allegations that he had sought a bribe of Rs 2 crore for the approval of admissions in a private college in Punjab.        
	Delhi High Court, relying on income-tax investigations, had in 2001 ruled that Desai had accepted unexplained payments of Rs 65 lakh, ordered his removal from the post of president, and called for his prosecution.        
	But in 2005, the CBI said it could not find any evidence that Desai had done any favours to the individuals who had paid him the money. Last year, Desai returned as MCI president, elected by council members, despite objections from sections of the medical community which had even written to the health ministry asking it to block his return.         
	In my view, the first accused is the Government of India, which has been responsible for protecting malpractices and corruption prevailing in the Medical Council of India for the last 10 years, said P. Rajeev, an MP from Kerala.         
	Although Desai has been arrested, he continues to remain MCI president. A senior medical educationist said that only members of the MCI were empowered to remove him from office under the act.         
	Rajeev said the MCI and the Centre had filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the high court order. I want to know whether the Government of India has conducted any inquiry before filing an appeal in the Supreme Court to protect the tainted president of the MCI, Rajeev said in the debate in the Rajya Sabha today.        
	Azad said the UPA had in August 2005 introduced a bill in Parliament to amend various provisions of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, to empower the Union government to take steps to make the council more transparent and accountable.         
	The bill, Azad said, had proposed specific provisions for the removal of the president and the vice-president or any other member of the MCI on grounds of misconduct, incapacity or abuse of power. But, Azad said, the department-related parliamentary standing committee on health had not agreed to most of the provisions of the bill.         
	Brinda Karat said the proposed amendments had been rightly rejected by the standing committee. That was a draft for centralisation of the entire thing in government hands, Karat said.         
	We want autonomy of the MCI, Karat said. We want other mechanisms for parliamentary oversight of such bodies. That is essential. But do not destroy autonomy.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Sept. 28: The Congress high command has devised a new plan to compensate families of some 450 people who died of shock or committed suicide after Y.S.R. Reddys death in a chopper crash last year.        
	Unable to nix the Odarpu (consolation) yatra undertaken by Jaganmohan Reddy, the rebellious son of the former Andhra chief minister, the high command has directed the Andhra Congress to conduct a drive of its own.        
	Over the last two weeks, Jaganmohan has been criss-crossing the Nellore and Prakasam districts, meeting grieving families individually, holding roadshows and installing YSR statues. Peeved with the high command for denying him the Andhra crown after YSRs death, he has been defying its diktat not to make a spectacle of the so-called Odarpu yatra.        
	The AICC has now issued a set of guidelines on how the drive should be conducted:        
	The AICC will issue cheques for Rs 1 lakh to all families that have lost members after YSRs death;        
	All victims families should be brought to one spot in a district and handed the compensation;        
	Only one statue of YSR is to be installed in one district;        
	Chief minister K. Rosaiah, PCC members and officials in charge of each district are to be present at the meetings where the cheques will be handed over.        
	Jaganmohan is, however, unfazed, with the high commands directives and has decided to continue with his yatra. Odarpu does not mean only giving compensation, it also involves a personal touch, he said.        
	Before Nellore and Prakasam, Jaganmohan toured four other districts, including Warangal, over 40 days and met some 300 families. He has had 225 statues of his father installed so far.        
	About the new directives, he said: They should have done it long ago. I am just fulfilling the commitment I made at the first memorial meet in the Kurnool jungles where my father died in a helicopter crash.

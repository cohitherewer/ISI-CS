          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CPM leader Sudhansu Sil campaigns at BK Pal Avenue. (Telegraph picture)                                  
	Calcutta, May 25: The key words are mass contact and personal interaction. In the hope that a change in its style of campaigning would help it recover lost ground in Calcutta, the CPM is concentrating on door-to-door visits rather than big public meetings.        
	At a CPM state committee meeting this month, state secretary Biman Bose had told the leaders that the party would have to reach out to every family through intense door-to-door visits.         
	The party will hold the big meetings and rallies in the last lap of their campaign for the May 30 civic polls. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Bose and politburo members Sitaram Yechury and Brinda Karat will be the star speakers at the rallies.        
	The large attendance at the public meetings so far, particularly those addressed by the chief minister, have enthused party workers and raised expectations among party leaders that the strong anti-Left sentiment witnessed during last years Lok Sabha polls is changing.        
	The huge gatherings at Bhattacharjees meetings in north and central Calcutta over the past two days were a sign of that change, a CPM leader said. But the partys door-to-door campaign remains its principal strategy.        
	Asked whether the change of strategy was fetching results, state secretariat member Mohammad Salim said: After the Lok Sabha debacle, we found out that mass contact would have to be renewed and personal interaction resumed rather than relying on big meetings. That helps in getting peoples suggestions and ideas. This time, our door-to-door campaign is yielding results as more and more people are attending our public meetings. The change of campaign style is working, it seems.         
	The campaigners are visiting households in the city with two simple messages  one of apology for its mistakes and the other pointing to the Trinamul Congresss alleged politics of murder and anarchy ever since the 2009 parliamentary polls in which the Left was humbled by Mamata Banerjee across the state.        
	Between the two messages, the CPM leadership is putting greater emphasis on humility and accommodation on the part of its own cadres. The partys move is one of self-criticism rather than aggression and this is being done in a low-key manner.        
	Minister Manab Mukherjee, who is looking after the partys north Calcutta campaign, has been harping at every election meeting on the CPMs need to admit its errors and go back to the people whenever they face problems or complain of lack of development work in their wards.        
	On the other hand, the chief minister, while addressing meetings in Barisha, Bijoygarh and Beadon Street, has urged the public to keep in mind while casting their votes how indisciplined and violent Trinamul is.         
	This campaign style is not only new for the CPM but is also in contrast with Trinamuls propaganda strategy.        
	Trinamuls campaign is high-profile and loud. Its main features have been the big public meetings of Mamata and a deluge of party banners, festoons, flex hoarding and graffiti.        
	Besides the change of style, the CPM seems to have identified two segments of the Calcutta electorate for launching an intensive campaign.        
	One segment is the middle and upper middle class, to which the party wants to convey the message of stability and order as against the fear of Trinamul-sponsored restlessness and violence.        
	The other is the poorer section of Muslims whose support the CPM is desperate to regain with assurances of more government jobs and projects.        
	At a Rajabazar rally, Bhattacharjee said his government would complete by June identification of one crore Muslims for reservation in government jobs. He has already declared that 10 per cent of state government jobs will be reserved for poor Muslims belonging to the Other Backward Classes.         
	To win back these Muslim voters, the CPM is also trying to remind them that Mamata was a minister in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre and that she had been soft on chief minister Narendra Modi even after the Gujarat riots.        
	The door-to-door campaign is particularly suited for civic elections in which constituencies are small and division among votes among candidates can become a big factor.         
	Despite this, the CPMs changed strategy has the larger political context of its recent reverses and its attempt at a fightback in preparation for the 2011 Assembly polls.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cautious support for Jairam tightrope act
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cautious support for Jairam tightrope act

	Cancun (Mexico), Dec. 7: Indias tightrope act on climate change appears to have coaxed the US as well as Brazil, China and South Africa to cautiously support Indias proposal for a new mechanism for international scrutiny of developing countries actions to curb greenhouse gas emissions.         
	As the UN climate change talks here slipped into the high-level ministerial segment on Monday, Indias proposal for International Consultation and Analysis, or ICA, has emerged as a key negotiating topic  and a part of an effort to prevent the conference from failing.         
	India is among developing countries with large emissions that have in the past rejected pressure to accept monitoring, review and verification (MRV) of their curbs on emissions. Developing countries view MRV as a tool that the industrialised countries may use to bind them to emissions targets.         
	But there appears to be a growing agreement on Indias proposal for ICA. On Monday, the US and Brazil, China and South Africa  the last three along with India form the so-called BASIC club  independently supported the ICA.         
	We agree with what (Indias environment) minister Ramesh proposed as ICA. We feel that inventorisation, information on mitigation actions, actual progress on emissions reduction and a review by an expert panel would form the core of such an exercise, a lead US envoy at the climate summit said.         
	Within an hour, the environment ministers of Brazil, China and South Africa also supported the ICA  although the modalities of operation still remain a bone of contention.         
	Most countries have welcomed the draft. The content has been agreed on, but the methodology is still in question and can be resolved over the next year, Ramesh told The Telegraph in Cancun.         
	Disagreements over international monitoring of voluntary domestic actions by developing countries to curb their emissions have long been obstructing an international political pact on climate change.         
	But non-government experts believe Indias proposal for ICA is only a watered-down version of MRV and will remove the distinction between industrialised countries and developing countries on climate change action.         
	Under the Kyoto Protocol, the existing climate change treaty valid until the year 2012, only the industrialised countries are expected to take on binding cuts on emissions  at least 5 per cent reduction in 2012 from the 1990 levels.         
	The ICA may become a backhanded way of breaching the firewall between the industrialised countries with historical emissions and the responsibility to cut their emissions and the rest of the world which needs the rights to development, said Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi.         
	But Ramesh has dismissed such apprehensions about the ICA. It is completely voluntary and non-punitive and basically linked to transparency  and we have no problem being transparent, Ramesh said.         
	You have to give it to the Indian minister the way he is tightroping with both the US and the BASIC group of countries. India is genuinely becoming an important rallying point in the talks, said a key negotiator from Brazil.         
	The question is how long will Ramesh be able to manage the fine balancing act. Manage or not, he wants to ensure that India is not seen as a deal-breaker in Cancun.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: CPM chief Prakash Karats efforts to unite the Left appear to have come unstuck because of Barack Obama.        
	The Forward Bloc today defied big brothers CPM and CPI and declared that its three MPs would not attend Obamas address to the joint session of Parliament, scheduled for November 8, to protest US policies.        
	The CPM and the CPI have said they will protest US policies but not ask their MPs to boycott the address. Karat has argued that Obama isnt George Bush, who had sent troops to Iraq and Afghanistan.         
	The Forward Bloc didnt appear to agree and pointed to a different, more immediate, concern that rankles with many at home: outsourcing. The change of guard has not changed US policies. Obama is the first US President who has openly spoken against outsourcing to India, said G. Devarajan, a Bloc central committee member.        
	The Blocs decision left the senior partners upset. They should have consulted us before taking the decision, said a senior CPI leader. The Bloc, though, will be part of a joint Left protest in Delhi during Obamas visit.        
	Devarajan appeared to suggest that his party need not follow every decision taken by the bigger allies. We are part of the Left Front but that doesnt mean we should follow the CPM and the CPI in every decision.        
	The RSP, another Left constituent, has not taken a decision on attending Obamas address.        
	The Left had boycotted Bill Clintons address to Parliament in 2000. In 2006, when Bush visited India, the Left-supported UPA-I government had to drop plans to get him to address a joint session of the House because of opposition from the communists.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal alert for double agents
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bengal alert for double agents
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, April 7: The Bengal government today told the joint forces fighting Maoists in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia to guard against double agents  those who share information with police and the rebels.        
	The alert was prompted by yesterdays Dantewada ambush in which the guerrillas trapped and killed 76 personnel.        
	State director-general of police Bhupinder Singh said: We should be cautious about double agents. These agents share information with both the rebels and the police. It may happen that to win our trust, on four occasions they will pass on information that is correct. But on the fifth, they will pass on false information that will lead us into a trap. We have told the forces to be cautious about people suspected to be double agents.        
	A home department official said a lot of disinformation was being fed about Maoist mobilisation, tempting the police to launch attacks. They have been told to cross-check all intelligence inputs thoroughly to avoid traps.        
	DGP Singh said he would talk to the central team going to Dantewada tomorrow to get detailed feedback on the exact method of yesterdays attack and work out a fresh strategy for the Bengal forces. He spoke to the team that went to Jagdalpur today.        
	Operations on        
	Our operations (against the rebels in the three Maoist-hit Bengal districts) have been continuing since yesterday. The one today yielded good results, Singh said.        
	State inspector-general of police (law and order) Surajit Kar Purakayastha said: Some arms and ammunition have been seized. But there were no arrests. The operations are on in the Junglemahal area.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chinese-checker: African safari with US

	New Delhi, Oct. 31: India and America are looking to dovetail their African projects to offset Chinas lengthening footprints in the continent, marked by multi-billion-dollar mining and oil contracts.        
	America is willing to learn from Indias good work in Africa, foreign ministry officials said, adding that the two countries would discuss such collaboration during President Barack Obamas visit.        
	South Block has long maintained that compared with China, India has a more humane, less exploitative approach to doing things in Africa.        
	China does not involve the local population in its projects and does not give anything back to the common African, Indian officials say. African journalists have confirmed to this correspondent that Beijings approach has come under criticism for being neo-colonialist.         
	Beijings African contracts are, however, worth five times New Delhis. Indias annual trade with Africa is worth around $40 billion; Chinas is $108 billion.        
	China also spends billions of dollars in aid in the continent, but mostly deals with dictatorial regimes. India, however, focuses on capacity-building  helping with healthcare, education, IT and the like  apart from exploring for oil and minerals.        
	Collaboration with Washington will give New Delhi stronger financial muscle in Africa. In exchange, some of the trust that India enjoys among common Africans  because of years of doing things in partnership with them  will rub off on the US. Sources said America would also gain from Indian expertise in executing projects at lower costs.        
	Obama and Manmohan Singh are likely to start with small steps, focusing on Africas battle for food self-sufficiency (several Indian companies own large farms in that continent) and democracy and its fight against AIDS.         
	Officials said Indias approach had touched a chord in Obama, an African American who during a trip to the land of his forefathers had said Africa was in his blood.        
	In a coordinated move, the foreign ministrys public diplomacy section launched a website on Friday showcasing Indias agricultural aid to Senegal. It also publicised Indias Pan African e-network, launched in 2007 to provide tele-education and tele-medicine to 53 African countries in five years.        
	The first two phases, covering 24 countries, have linked 1,700 African students with Indian universities and 33 African hospitals to 11 Indian super-speciality hospitals.        
	At an India-Africa partnership seminar on Thursday, the foreign ministrys secretary (west), Vivek Katju, said Indias focus in Africa would remain on capacity-building, human resource development, trade and technology transfer.        
	An exploitative relationship is... intrinsically ephemeral, he said, hinting indirectly at China.        
	Recently, even Japan has shown an interest in learning from Indias experience in Africa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Blame game? Not Buddha 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Blame game? Not Buddha 
  - Bengal CM calls for sharing of responsibility in fight against maoists          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee                                
	New Delhi, April 9: The Maoist buck may stop with him, but Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee can very well pass on the balm.        
	On a day P. Chidambaram accepted that the buck stopped at his table for the Dantewada massacre, the Bengal chief minister refrained from rubbing it in.        
	Bhattacharjee said this was not the time to blame each other and spoke of collective responsibility in tackling the Maoist threat. Everybody has to own (their) share of responsibility. We should work collectively. It is not the time to blame anyone, not the time to blame each other, he said.        
	In Lalgarh on Sunday, the Union home minister had nettled Bhattacharjee by saying that when it came to maintaining law and order in Bengal a subject that includes Maoist violence  the buck stops at the chief ministers table.        
	Bhattacharjee had, rather untenably, claimed the next day that Chidambaram had used slang that had no place in a politicians lexicon.        
	Today, he said: All of us need to give this matter (of countering the Maoists) a serious thought. We need to revamp our plans and operations. Let the Prime Minister come back from his visit to the US and Brazil, I will discuss this (with him).        
	Bhattacharjee, however, referred to another issue whether the Trinamul Congress is hand in glove with the Maoists - that has seen word games between him and Chidambaram.        
	Whenever I have met the home minister, I have been telling him that they (Trinamul and the Maoists) are working hand in glove, the chief minister said.        
	Asked about Chidambarams response, Bhattacharjee said in a remark open to interpretation: As usual he did not like it. The home minister does not like any party, any individual, NGO or the media supporting the Maoists.        
	Two months ago, queried on the matter, Chidambaram had said with lawyer-like ambiguity: As far as I am concerned, nobody is colluding with Maoists. Nobody can collude with Maoists. No political party in India that believes in parliamentary democracy can collude with them.        
	Bhattacharjee claimed that the anti-Maoist operations in Bengal had improved but added: I am not satisfied with the situation. We have to do more.        
	During his two-day Delhi visit that ended today, Bhattacharjee has met Planning Commission members, including deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia. The chief minister said he had demanded a development fund for Bengals Maoist-affected districts. The 28 police stations in Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore have a Maoist problem. We need a special fund for these areas, he said.

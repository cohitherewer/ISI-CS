	Antaragni, the Kanpur institute fest, was held from October 21-24. Teams from various engineering colleges, including one from IIT Delhi, participated.        
	On the night of October 20, some students of IIT Delhi consumed alcohol and behaved inappropriately, according to registrar of IIT Kanpur Sanjeev Kashalkar.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 21: A train mowed down two people and injured a third as they crossed the tracks near Mumbais Vikroli railway station today, triggering a blockade that disrupted Central Railway suburban services for over an hour and a half.        
	The 12.45pm accident prompted hundreds of angry residents of the eastern Mumbai suburb of Vikroli to squat on the tracks. They were led by Ghatkopar MLA Ram Kadam of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, who said several accidents had occurred at the Vikroli level crossing, yards from the station.        
	Local people cross the tracks on foot every day to travel between the suburbs eastern and western parts because of the lack of a foot overbridge at the level crossing. Among them are hundreds of students of a nearby convent school.        
	The residents have been demanding a foot overbridge for several years but claim the railways have not taken the demand seriously. The station itself has a foot overbridge, but local people have been reluctant to use it because they dont want to buy a platform ticket.        
	On Friday, though, Kul Bhushan, the new Central Railway general manager, had told a news conference that till a foot overbridge was built at the level crossing, people could use the station overbridge without a ticket.        
	But hundreds still cross the tracks on foot, either because they have not heard about the new rule or because they are reluctant to make the short detour through the station.        
	Bhushan also said that a new foot overbridge had been sanctioned outside Vikroli station and that construction would begin soon.        
	The protesters were pacified today only after the railway authorities promised that the construction of the new foot overbridge would begin within the next few weeks.        
	We will resort to MNS-style agitation if the construction does not start in 10 days, Kadam said.

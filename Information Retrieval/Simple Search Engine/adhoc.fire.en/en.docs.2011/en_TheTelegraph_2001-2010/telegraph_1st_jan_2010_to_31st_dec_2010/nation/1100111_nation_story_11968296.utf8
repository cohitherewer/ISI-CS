The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ideology comes between Nepal Maoist Big Two 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ideology comes between Nepal Maoist Big Two 
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                         Prachanda (top) and Baburam Bhattarai				                                       
	New Delhi, Jan. 10: Last weeks bitter exchanges between Nepals top two Maoist leaders, Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai, may be indicative of a maturing ideological rift that goes beyond a mere personality tiff.         
	The verbal feud between them has been unprecedented enough, not least because it was blunt and, perhaps for the first time, allowed to play out in the open.         
	Prachanda had all but labelled Bhattarai an Indian agent, telling a meeting of cadres that New Delhi had sent him signals it was willing to broker the Maoists return to power but only if Bhattarai was made a prime ministerial nominee. Bhattarai responded with a rare and rash public rebuttal, saying his party bosss remark amounted to character assassination.         
	But Prachanda did not stop at painting his revolutionary comrade-in-arms into the ugly Indian corner; he proceeded to barricade any steps that Bhattarai might take towards prime ministership by getting the party to adopt a fresh resolution that, should the Maoists return to power, Prachanda, and none else, would be the Prime Minister.         
	Senior Nepali Maoists are tight-lipped about the roots and ramifications of this extraordinary outbreak at the top, but few are convinced this is only about personal ambitions.         
	It is becoming increasingly clear that Prachanda and Bhattarai have come to divergent conclusions about where the party should go from here, a respected political observer told The Telegraph from Kathmandu on telephone. They have been out of power and are faced with opposition from big vested interests within and outside the country. Bhattarai clearly thinks democratic struggle is still capable of delivering the Maoist objective. Many in the party, including Prachanda, have begun to disagree.         
	During the last few months, Prachanda has treaded a line tantalisingly close to resuming armed struggle to capture power. This, many believe, he has partly done to keep militants within the party engaged and interested and partly as a tactic to force the hands of political adversaries who have squared the Maoists out of power.         
	There is evident frustration among the Maoists and many hardliners such as Kiran, C.P. Gajurel and Biplab believe that they should think of effecting a revolutionary (read armed) takeover of power.         
	India, an interventionist player in the stalled peace process, has cunningly played on simmering differences within the Maoists.         
	For a while now, behind-the-scene Indian operatives have barely been bothered about concealing their preference of Bhattarai as leader of a would-be Maoist-led government. Part of their design  and definitely their hope  is that backing Bhattarai will sow due suspicions about his credentials among Maoist hardliners and eventually precipitate a split.         
	Those who know Nepali Maoists up close are not so certain that ideological or personal fissures will lead to a parting anytime soon. There are differences and they are pouring out, conceded one of them, but he went on to argue: Let us not forget that Prachanda and Bhattarai have a long and very strong history of comradeship and both are very serious and committed persons. They have waged an underground war together, they agreed on coming overground, they belong to a very different school of politics. To expect a split on the lines of centrist parties just because there is a dispute may be to expect too much.         
	But more than any of that, it is the current balance of power among Nepali Maoists that may militate against swift rupture.         
	Bhattarai is inarguably the ideological fountainhead of the party, the man who crafted the theoretical spine that the Maoists eventually rode out of the jungles into electoral politics. It is again Bhattarai who has provided the Maoists the intellectual vision on issues as varied as federalism, the interplay of class and ethnicity in Nepal, the nature of the future state and its semi-colonial relationship with India.         
	In a key essay  Political-Economic Rationale of the War  in 1997, Bhattarai had identified the uses of Nepal as exporter of raw materials and a secure market of finished Indian products; the unfavourable balance of trade; control of Nepali economy through Indian-origin capitalists; the trend of multinational corporations operating in Nepal through their Indian subsidiaries; unequal water treaties; use of cheap Nepali labour; and the hegemony of Indian monetary policy as the key structural problems.         
	Bhattarais articulation remains the single most important text on which Maoist insistence of redefining the relationship with India is based. It is a bit rich for party rivals to accuse Bhattarai as an Indian agent, said a Nepali commentator, although it is true now that he is currently articulating a line of peaceful transition closer to what the Indians might be seeking.         
	Only last month, Bhattarai had both blamed New Delhi for derailing the peace process and sought its renewed assistance in restoring Nepals pursuit of democracy in an exclusive interview to The Telegraph. He had also argued that it was possible for the Maoists to wage democratic and peaceful struggle to create the new Nepal they were aiming to.         
	But Bhattarai is unable to leverage his intellectual prowess enough to steer the party in pursuit of his own schemes. It is the charismatic and skillful Prachanda who remains the chief Maoist arbiter. He has a vice-like grip on the party organisation and apparatus and remains the man who can best manage  and remain above  factional and ideological conflict.         
	Bhattarai has seldom displayed talent or inclination for organisational management.         
	But now that he feels tainted by his boss invective, Bhattarai may feel obliged to lobby his innocence with the party rank and file and explain the reasons why he, unlike hardliners Kiran and Gajurel, continues to believe that the democratic, rather than the military, option is more suited to get the Maoists where they want to be. That effort may only intensify the ideological struggle.

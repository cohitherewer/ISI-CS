The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Israeli spy station cry by killer of parents
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Israeli spy station cry by killer of parents
                            
	New York, Oct. 18 (PTI): An American national, who fled to Israel after killing his parents, has claimed that he worked for Israeli spy agency Mossad and wanted to set up a station in India to keep tabs on Pakistan.         
	Eric Bellucci, who killed his parents and then fled to Israel only to be extradited back to the US, was arrested yesterday by the New York Police Department.         
	Bellucci, who was brought back to New York from the Tel Aviv airport to face murder charges, told a friend that he had worked with the CIA and Mossad. He also told him that he planned to set up a station in India so I can look at Pakistan, The New York Post reported.         
	Bellucci was fearful of living in New York City because he feared another Times Square attack. Pakistani-American Faisal Shahzad, a LeT operative, tried to blow up an explosive-laden vehicle in Times Square on May 1 but failed and was later arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment after his conviction in the case.         
	I had no idea he had a history of medication at all prior to this event, Belluccis friend said on condition of anonymity.         
	Belluccis parents, Arthur, 61, and Marian, 56, were found dead on Wednesday night in their home in Staten Island. The Post reported that their daughter found their bodies.        
	The American media said Bellucci, who reportedly suffers from schizophrenia, was picked up on Friday after he tried to buy a plane ticket to Beijing and arrived at the JFK airport yesterday. He is in custody and is to appear at an arraignment hearing in Staten Island criminal court tomorrow.         
	Police believed he travelled to Israel to meet a friend, but were unsure if Bellucci made contact. Bellucci had used a credit card to rent a car upon arrival, SI Live.com reported.         
	His unstable manner at the Israeli airport made an attendant suspicious who informed the police. The attendant told an Israeli TV channel that Bellucci was talking to himself.

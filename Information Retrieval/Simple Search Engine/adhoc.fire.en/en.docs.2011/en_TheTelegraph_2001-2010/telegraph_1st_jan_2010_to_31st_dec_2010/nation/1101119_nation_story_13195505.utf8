The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata meets and assures PM
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mamata meets and assures PM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Railway minister Mamata Banerjee in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: Mamata Banerjee today met the Prime Minister and assured her partys support over the 2G spectrum controversy, Trinamul Congress sources said.        
	The 10-minute interaction took place in the Prime Ministers chamber in Parliament ahead of the Congress core group meeting to discuss the Opposition demand for a JPC probe.        
	It was just a courtesy call, Mamata said, adding that her party would accept whatever decision Manmohan Singh took. As the head of the cabinet, he is empowered to decide and our party will accept it, she said.        
	The sources quoted her as saying there should be some investigation. They added that she did not refer to a joint parliamentary committee probe.        
	Our leader feels that it is in the interest of the UPA to carry out an investigation and puncture the (Opposition) balloon, a Trinamul MP said. The CBI is already investigating the issue.        
	 Trinamul leaders said Mamatas meeting with Singh, which comes soon after a similar one with Sonia Gandhi, was part of her attempts to establish a direct line of communication with the Congress leadership.        
	They said Mamata would earlier knock on finance minister Pranab Mukherjees door over any issue she wanted to take up, but in recent times she has been reaching out to Sonia and Singh directly.

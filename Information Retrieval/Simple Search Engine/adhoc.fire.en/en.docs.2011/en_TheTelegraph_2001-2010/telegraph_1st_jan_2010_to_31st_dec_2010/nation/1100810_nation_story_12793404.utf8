          J.P. YADAV                               
	Vijayawada, Aug. 9: The index of Opposition unity was a big factor behind Mamata Banerjees poll successes, Sitaram Yechury said today, fanning the conflict of rhetoric between the Bengal CPM and the central leadership.        
	Yechurys statement at the extended central committee meeting could give the impression that the CPMs withdrawal of support to UPA I was the prime reason for the electoral setbacks in Bengal because the move paved the way for a Congress-Trinamul alliance.        
	This is also the Bengal CPMs line but the argument has been rejected by the central leadership, which blames the poll debacles on the performance of the state government and the organisation.        
	Asked to analyse Mamatas success in Bengal, Yechury cited the last Lok Sabha elections and said a divided Opposition had closed ranks and consolidated the anti-Left vote. The index of Opposition unity is a big factor. Earlier, Opposition votes used to get divided. Now everybody has come together to attack the Left in Bengal, he said.        
	The politburo members remark comes a day after CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said it was not unnatural to lose elections and reiterated that the decision to withdraw support from UPA I was right.        
	Yechury, though, clarified that Opposition unity was not the only reason behind Mamatas success: the alienation of a section of voters had contributed too.        
	He said the Congress-Trinamul alliance would break up soon  something the Bengal unit has been trying for. Asked how the party would fracture Opposition unity, Yechury said: We dont have to strive. The alliance is neither credible nor viable and will break shortly.        
	As an example, he cited the Lalgarh rally from which the Congress had kept away.         
	Yechurys remark is a pointer that the withdrawal of support to the Congress continues to be a big issue for the Bengal CPM to target the Karat-led leadership with.         
	Karat was said to have bought peace with the Bengal unit yesterday by agreeing to its tactical line of sparing the Congress and focusing the attack on Trinamul, especially for its perceived closeness with the Maoists.        
	It appears that the crack between the Bengal unit and the central line remains despite the temporary truce.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, May 13: The long-awaited government draft on pet rights is out, spelling out stringent rules for animal and bird owners as well as pet shops but leaving many grey areas as well.        
	What is clear is that you will need a licence for every pet you have, from cat to canary, and can expect government inspectors to come and check if it has enough of the right kind of food and exercise, adequate living space and the freedom to mate.        
	As for the unanswered questions, the Draft Pet Shop Rules 2010 will be finalised and issued by the end of June  so hurry up and send any objections or suggestions you may have, via the environment ministry website. (See chart)        
	Some of the rules are:        
	 Those under 18 years can neither buy nor sell pets;        
	 Pets can be too young to be sold: for instance, you cannot buy kittens or puppies under two months old:        
	 Buying pregnant pets is banned; so is the sale of mother animals whose offspring are yet to be weaned.        
	Every person who buys any animal/bird from any pet shop shall apply for a pet licence from the local municipal authorities within 15 days (of) the date of purchase of animals, the draft says. The licence fee is not mentioned.        
	You must report the death of your pet to the civic authorities as soon as it happens, and furnish a veterinarians statement on the cause of death. The licence for that animal will then stand cancelled.        
	Every buyer of a pet animal/bird shall compulsorily acquaint himself with all necessary details about proper maintenance and care of the animals including feeding schedule, type of food to be given, health check-up, exercise schedule, sleeping habits, minimum area to be provided, mating season and arrangements for the same, the draft says.        
	Those who ignore any of this may be left red-faced when an inspector from the state animal welfare board comes visiting.        
	The rules for pet shops are stricter  but farms, cattle fairs and weekly markets that sell livestock are exempt.        
	Pet-shop owners must ensure their outlet is in a structurally sound building with adequate arrangements for water, and set as far away as possible from sources of air and noise pollution. There shall be no pools of water or any garbage dump near the pet shop, the draft says. The shops must close by 7pm, and all lights must be put out at night to allow the animals proper rest.        
	Temperatures shall be kept between 18 and 23 degrees Celsius through the use of heating and cooling systems, insists the draft, issued last week under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960.         
	Pet shops will need a separate licence for each species of bird or animal, the fee being Rs 5,000. The licence must be renewed every 12 months for Rs 2,000. Offenders will face unspecified punishment, including cancellation of licence by the civic body or the Animal Welfare Board of India, which has been empowered to inspect pet shops.

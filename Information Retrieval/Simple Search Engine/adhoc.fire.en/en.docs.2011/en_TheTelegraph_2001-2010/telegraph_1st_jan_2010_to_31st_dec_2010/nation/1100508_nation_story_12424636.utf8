                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shoaib bats up a storm

	Hyderabad, May 7: Shoaib Malik has again courted controversy in wife Sania Mirzas city, this time by practising with Ranji Trophy players at the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) nets on Tuesday.        
	Sources said the Indian cricket board had asked the state association to explain how the Pakistani cricketer was allowed to join its practice session without being its member.        
	Also, with the Pakistan board having banned Shoaib for a year, questions have been raised how an official body like the HCA could have let him have a knockabout at its nets. More so because the privilege would have been denied to local hero and former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin, who is serving a life ban.        
	HCA joint secretary D.S. Chalapathi yesterday ordered an inquiry and issued a formal note saying Shoaib could not use the Gymkhana ground nets for practice.        
	Ground officials said Shoaib had come accompanied by former India manager and Andhra Pradesh Cricket Association ex-secretary Chamundeshwarinath, and so they could not object.        
	Shoaib and Sania had returned to India on April 28 after their wedding parties in Pakistan. On Tuesday, Sania sat in the Gymkhana pavilion as Shoaib faced the Ranji bowlers.        
	I am feeling comfortable once again to be able to wield the bat and do what I am good at  batting, Shoaib had told reporters. Sources said Shoaib might now practice at some of the citys private academies.        
	Yesterday, the star couple were at the indoor tennis courts where both played a few shots, with the groom winning his brides appreciation. Sania said Shoaib was playing tennis for the first time but seems to have a very good forehand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Two children lost, mom soldiers on with twin goals
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Two children lost, mom soldiers on with twin goals
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                            (Top) Anindyee, Ankik                          
	Calcutta, Feb. 16: She could feel the grief of the families of EFR policemen killed in the Maoist attack, for she herself has lost two children in a terror attack.        
	At times, Alpana Dhars eyes turn moist. At times, a daze of disbelief takes hold as she gazes at newspapers carrying reports on the terror attack in Pune and the massacre by the Maoists in West Midnapore.         
	I wish terrorism ended soon. It has become part of our daily life, snatching away bright young lives, sobbed the mother of Ankik, 23, and Anindyee, 19, who died in Saturdays blast at German Bakery in Pune.        
	The 49-year-old spoke to The Telegraph on Tuesday at her second-floor apartment in Salt Lakes BB block, youngest son Aishik by her side.        
	The doors of the rooms where Ankik and Anindyee once lived were open but the family members dared not step into them for fear of being haunted by their memories.        
	They went too early, said the mother, wiping tears with her sari.         
	Alpana has advised Aishik to appear in his board exams starting March 3 and to get on with his studies.         
	Less than 72 hours have passed since she lost two sprightly young children to an act of violence, but the mothers effort to come to terms with the realities of an unstable world cant be missed.         
	Many innocent lives have been lost in such violence in the past and perhaps many more will be lost in the future. I would have felt worse had they contracted some lethal ailment and suffered for days, said Alpana.         
	Father Kamalendu, an ONGC employee, was yet to come to terms with the tragedy even as Alpana, with Aishik by her side, sat in the drawing room sharing the memories of Ankik and Anindyee.         
	I will have to quickly remove all their awards and mementoes that are constantly reminding me of them, he said, stealing a glance at the trophies and medals placed atop a steel almirah in the drawing room of BB 49/5.         
	Ankik, who studied in IIT Kharagpur, left his mark on the campus as an all-rounder. Anindyee, who was pursuing graduation in economics in Fergusson College, had a diverse set of interests, from basketball to fashion designing to photography.         
	I had groomed them in a manner that they would become good human beings. After their death, I visited Anindyees college and Ankiks office and everywhere I found people loved them, Alpana recalled.        
	We were like a team. My daughter shot pictures and I helped her with the write-up on places, people and cultures. Ankik ensured we were never short of funds. Aishik was shaping up to help Anindyee. We were about to publish a book, Alpana said.         
	With Ankik and Anindyee gone, Alpana is left with two goals in her life  to groom Aishik in the same way as his siblings and finish the book. I will have to finish the book for them, she said.

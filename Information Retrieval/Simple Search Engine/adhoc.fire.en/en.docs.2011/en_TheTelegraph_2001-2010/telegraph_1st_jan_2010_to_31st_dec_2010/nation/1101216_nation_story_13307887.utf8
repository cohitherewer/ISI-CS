  - Party hopes DMK will see the larger political picture; Samajwadi Party, BSP sniff chance        SANJAY K. JHA                              Sonia Gandhi, Karunanidhi				                                       
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: The Congress does not fear any immediate political fallout of the CBI raids on close aides of DMK leaders A. Raja and Kanimozhi, but expects the ally to understand the difficult circumstances the UPA faces.         
	The top Congress leadership and the government are said to have studied the whole gamut of issues as they are aware of the sensitivities involved when the raids have inched close to M. Karunanidhis daughter, Kanimozhi, whose close associates office was searched by the CBI today.         
	The Congress leadership, which is clear in its mind that the government should be seen acting against the suspects in the 2G spectrum scam, has cited the CBIs functional autonomy to wash its hands of the choice of targets.         
	Decisions such as which place the CBI will raid is not taken at 24 Akbar Road (the Congress headquarters). It is not our concern. We cannot comment on these issues, said AICC media department chairperson Janardhan Dwivedi. We trust our ally, he said, indicating that the party was not anticipating a rebuff from the DMK. Asked whether the ally trusted the Congress, Dwivedi said: The trust is always mutual.         
	In its second round of raids today, the CBI searched the office of Father Jegath Gaspar, an associate of Karunanidhis daughter Kanimozhi.        
	Sources in the Congress revealed the DMK top leadership had been thoroughly briefed on the political imperatives of a thorough investigation, while the CBI had committed to the Supreme Court that a report on the spectrum scam would be submitted by March.        
	The DMK cannot be seen to be blocking the CBI at a time Karunanidhis arch rival Jayalalithaa had woven her electoral theme around the corruption issue and the Oppositions sustained campaign on corruption had questioned the credibility of both the parties.        
	Dwivedis public reiteration today that the Congress would not tolerate corruption could mean the party has already taken care of the pros and cons.         
	The bold public posturing of the Congress also emanates from the realisation that it would gain enormously in terms of peoples perception even if the CBI raids strained its ties with the DMK.         
	One senior leader said: We know the DMK will react cautiously as larger issues are involved and politics in Tamil Nadu is delicately poised. But do we lose much even if the DMK breaks the alliance against the Congress decision to fight corruption? We dont mind the public debate shifting to Congress-DMK tension.         
	The DMK will have greater worries than the Congress in Tamil Nadu as its state government is dependent on the Congress crutch.         
	The Congress will exploit this situation to its advantage even as it has no alternative plan of sewing up an alliance with the AIADMK. It will prefer contesting the Assembly election alone in case the DMK chooses to sever ties.

          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	New Delhi, May 20: Defence minister A.K. Antony today said the deployment of army and the air force in counter-naxalite operations should be off the agenda of public debate but the government will take a decision shortly.        
	Antonys remark is in sharp contrast to home minister P. Chidambarams statements and interviews in which he said chief ministers want the use of air force but that he has a limited mandate in the counter-naxalite offensive.        
	Top army commanders are mapping the growth of the Maoists this week and are assessing the resources required to deal with the rebels. Within the air force, too, there are discussions on how to use the airpower, after the chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal P.V. Naik, earlier this year asked for permission to arm (weaponise) helicopters that are being used to transport troops and casualties.        
	This (the deployment of the army and/or the air force) is not to be discussed in public. I will not entertain any public debate. The strategy will not be discussed in public, Antony said after speaking to commanders of the navy who are here for an annual conference.        
	Ultimately, government will take a decision after thoroughly considering all aspects and it will be binding on everybody, including the defence ministry, Antony added.        
	The armed forces have for some time been uncomfortable with suggestions from politicians and other commentators on deploying the military in the hinterland. The army chief, General V.K. Singh, had spoken out in public after the April 6 killing of 76 policemen and said that he does not see the need to deploy his troops in Chhattisgarh.        
	The army chief was quietly asked to refrain from making public statements on the strategy against the rebels after that.         
	But Antony has today chosen to reflect that discomfort in the armed forces. Since Mondays killing of special police officers and civilians in Dantewada, there are more voices asking for the deployment of the armed forces.        
	Antony, at the same time, has said the issue was not closed within the government as yet. Though the responsibility for the offensive rests with the home ministry, it involves discussions with the defence ministry that has also deputed a military advisor for the operations.        
	Emphasising the damage potential of the naxalites, the home ministry today came out with a detailed list of the attacks by them during the two-day bandh on Tuesday and Wednesday (May 18-19).         
	The statement lists 16 major and minor attacks by the Maoists in Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and Chhattisgarh. It says five CRPF troopers (in Kadashol near Lalgarh) and two civilians (one in Basantpur of Binpur in West Midnapore and one in Gadiras of Dantewada) were killed in these attacks.         
	The rebels blew up railway tracks, burnt vehicles and destroyed a panchayat office. Last night, the rebels looted 16.5 tonnes of ammonium nitrate (that can be used as explosive) from a truck. The consignment was being sent from Visakhapatnam to Raipur.

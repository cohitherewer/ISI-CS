The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Varsity go-ahead for separatists 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Varsity go-ahead for separatists 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Oct. 12: A Muslim religious group with separatist leanings has won a struggle to establish a modern university in Kashmir at a time a separatist-led agitation has shut schools for nearly four months.        
	The Omar Abdullah government has passed legislation permitting the Jamiat-Ahli-Hadees, one of the largest Muslim groups following puritanical Islam, to establish the Trans World Muslim University where computers and medicine would be taught alongside Islamic courses.        
	The bill was moved by National Conference legislator Mir Saifullah last year. It was referred to a cabinet sub-committee and passed by voice vote in the Assembly on Saturday.        
	This will be the first university to be established by a group with separatist leanings, although separatists are running many schools across the state. Jamiat considers Kashmir a dispute and favours its resolution by giving people the right to decide the states future.        
	We have to get prior consent of the government to establish a primary school, not to talk of such consent for a university. But that does not mean that we have changed our principled stand on the Kashmir dispute, Jamiat president Molvi Showkat Ahmad said.        
	The Jamiat president would be the universitys pro-chancellor and the chief minister its chancellor. Initially, we had proposed the Jamiat president should be the chancellor but it was amended by the select committee, to which we agreed.        
	Besides the chief minister, two legislators and the commissioner secretary of the higher education department will be on its board.        
	Ahmad said the select committee had members from the National Conference and the Congress as well as the opposition Peoples Democratic Party. But none of them opposed the bill. We believe education and politics are two different things and our only goal is to impart quality education to the people, he said.        
	Ahmad said 20 hectares had been bought in Budgam and work on the campus would begin soon.        
	Jamiats Kashmir chapter was founded by Molvi Anwar Shah Shopyani in the 1930s and it is influenced by Salafi  Prophet Mohammad and his companions  thought. They believe in puritanical Islam in which shrine worship is forbidden. The group runs 650 mosques, 150 schools and several colleges where they impart both religious and modern education.

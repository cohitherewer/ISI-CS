	Purulia, Dec. 1: A CPM supporter was killed by suspected Maoists in a Purulia village today, almost five months after his father, a local committee member of the party, was shot dead by rebels.        
	Bikash Mondal, 22, of Kerwa village in the Balarampur area of the district was talking to another local resident near the primary health centre when the two men came up to them on a bike around 4.30pm.         
	One of them took out a pistol and shot him twice in the chest. Bikash died on the spot. The pillion rider took Bikashs motorbike and both sped off.        
	The spot where Bikash was killed is 15km from Urma Hat, the place where his father and local committee member of the Ghatbera-Kerwa gram panchayat, Madhu Mondal, was shot dead on July 23.         
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee addressed a public meeting in the area on November 14 and highlighted the deaths of party leaders and supporters at the hands of Maoists.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangh dual attack on Rahul amp; Digvijay
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sangh dual attack on Rahul amp; Digvijay
          OUR BUREAU                      Narendra Modi                          
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Dec. 18: The BJP today stepped up its attack on Rahul Gandhi and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh demanded an apology from Digvijay Singh as allegations of Hindu terror exacerbated tensions from north to west.        
	BJP ally Shiv Sena also stepped into the ring, warning the Congress not to act smart, a day after Rahuls alleged comments on majority community radicalism became public following a cable published by online whistleblower WikiLeaks.        
	In Mumbai, Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi said the Congress general secretarys alleged comment that radicalised Hindu groups posed a bigger threat than terror outfit Lashkar was responsible for the pro-Pakistan policies of the US.        
	The whole world was convinced that Pakistan promotes terrorism. They train terrorists and terrorism is its biggest export industry. After the WikiLeaks release, it is known who was guiding the US and providing information about Pakistan, based on which America formed an opinion about the country. This is the biggest loss for India, the BJP leader said without naming Rahul.         
	The RSS sent a legal notice to Digvijay demanding an unconditional apology to Hindus and the patriots fighting cross-border terrorism, and asked him to withdraw his reckless and irresponsible comments.        
	The notice said Digvijays statement that slain Mumbai cop Hemant Karkare had told him he had been getting death threats from Hindu extremists had dealt a serious blow to the fight against terror and the investigation into the 26/11 attack that claimed the police officers life.        
	The stand of the government and the series of dossiers sent by it to Pakistan and others have suffered a staggering blow due to your unwholesome actions. It is indeed a painful situation that you chose to sacrifice prime national interest for petty vote-bank politics, the notice, despatched today by Supreme Court lawyer Monika Arora, said.        
	The notice pointed out that Digvijays earlier allusions to saffron terror had led to a clarification from Congress spokesperson Janardhan Dwivedi, who had said terrorism does not have any colour other than black.        
	The notice said Hinduism did not preach violence and hatred against non-Hindus and by linking the word Hindu with terrorism, you (Digvijay) are branding every person who professes and propagates Hindu religion as an agent and exporter of terror....        
	Digvijay hit back, claiming that by prematurely closing the case of the murder of RSS worker Sunil Joshi who allegedly plotted the 2007 Ajmer dargah blast, the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh had laid itself open to the charge of hushing up the matter.        
	On Friday, the state government said Joshi, an RSS pracharak, was killed by his own men because he had allegedly mistreated them.        
	When the RSS cannot forgive its own pracharak, Digvijay said, what will they do to others?        
	In Mumbai, Sena chief Bal Thackeray warned in party mouthpiece Saamna that Hindus wouldnt tolerate such utterances. Dont act smart. Hindus will retaliate if you unnecessarily badmouth them, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata catches Pranab flight
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mamata catches Pranab flight
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: Mamata Banerjee, who is known for her aversion to chartered flights, travelled to Calcutta with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee on his special aircraft today.         
	Party colleagues said Mamata readily agreed to Pranabs invitation because she wants good relations with central Congress leaders ahead of the Assembly elections.         
	Otherwise, she was booked on a normal passenger flight to Calcutta this evening, a Trinamul Congress MP said.         
	Mamata, who has had a blow-hot, blow-cold relationship with Pranab in the recent past, wants to keep central Congress leaders in good humour so that she can have her way on seat-sharing, party sources said.         
	The Trinamul chief refused to comment on the appointment of central vigilance commissioner P.J. Thomas. Whatever I have to say I will tell inside the UPA. But we are fully with the Prime Minister. We have complete faith in him, Mamata said and rushed away.         
	Party sources said Mamata was not happy with the decision to appoint Thomas but was unwilling to register her protest to avoid straining relations with the Congress.         
	Similarly, she has taken the line that her party will support any decision the Prime Minister takes on the demand for a JPC probe into the 2G spectrum allocation.         
	Recently, she called on both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi separately to assure them she was fully with them at a time the Opposition was taking on the government on corruption.

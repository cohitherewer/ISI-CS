The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal quota bill to skirt religion label 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bengal quota bill to skirt religion label 
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 22: The Bengal government is expected to table tomorrow a bill to institutionalise 17 per cent job quota for other backward classes, including 10 per cent for Muslims, without naming them.         
	Concern over the possibility of legal entanglements over religion-based quotas lies behind the governments reluctance to name the communities in the legislation that is expected to be the centrepiece of the CPMs drive to win back the minorities who have deserted the Left.        
	The West Bengal Backward Classes (Other Than Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Reservation of Vacancies in Services and Posts Bill will be placed in the Assembly tomorrow.        
	Perturbed over the loss of Muslim votes and growing criticism of the Left governments poor record in minority development, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had announced a 10 per cent job quota for the disadvantaged among the minority community. The subsequent government order and the proposed bill are aimed at giving the policy legal teeth before the coming Assembly elections.         
	The bill, however, does not mention Muslim or Hindu OBCs as such.         
	Whatever the chief minister had said, I have always maintained that no reservation could be ensured on religious identity of the targeted beneficiaries. There are constitutional and legal bars. Thats why the bill is silent on provisions for Muslims, backward classes development minister Jogesh Chandra Burman told The Telegraph.         
	I cant comment on the chief ministers announcement. But our department cannot ask for minority-specific job quota, apart from reservation (based) on socio-economic criteria, added joint reservation commissioner Manotosh Pandit.         
	Another minister and a CPM leader said the political potency of the chief ministers announcement notwithstanding, the party and the government realised it would be risky to mention religions in the bill. We have to do what is legally permissible. The Andhra high court had overruled the state governments job quota for Muslims, he said.        
	All concerned, however, said OBCs from the minority community would benefit from the legislation since Muslims form the overwhelming majority of the disadvantaged groups covered under Category A or the most backward.        
	The bill makes provision for 10 per cent job quota for this category, mirroring Bhattacharjees promise to Muslim OBCs. The remaining seven per cent job quota for Category B among the disadvantaged will benefit mostly Hindu OBCs.         
	According to Pandit, OBCs are estimated to be 38 per cent (around 3.5 crore) of the states population. Muslims total around 2.2 crore.        
	Among the 108 OBC communities identified in the state so far, 53 are Muslim while 11 groups belong to other minorities. Around 56 per cent of the state OBC population come under the most backward category.        
	The bill makes the provision to exclude the creamy layer of the backwards from the reservation benefit, in tune with the CPMs stress on the socio-economic criteria.         
	Those with an annual income of Rs 4.5 lakh or above, wealth-tax payers, land-owners holding only irrigated land equal to or more than 85 per cent of the property that comes under ceiling and wards of Class I officials of state and central governments would be barred from the quota.        
	Burman said the reservation could not be extended to the private sector legally. Government departments and state-run corporations and PSUs will have to implement the quota. The bill prohibits adjustment to the job quota if a backward aspirant succeeds in general competition and qualifies for a post.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Chance to prove worth for big throne 
   Delhi delight at Pak vote          MANINI CHATTERJEE                           External affairs minister SM Krishna speaks in the UN General Assembly in New York. File picture                                         
	New Delhi, Oct. 13: Indias landslide victory to a non-permanent seat in the UN Security Council yesterday has imparted a much greater degree of responsibility on the country as an emerging global power and one way to prove ourselves worthy of the coveted permanent seat would be to fast-track efforts to normalise relations with Pakistan, external affairs minister S.M. Krishna indicated today.         
	Separately, highly-placed external affairs ministry sources expressed great satisfaction that Pakistan had voted in favour of India for the seat and hinted that India would reciprocate the gesture when Pakistan makes a bid in 2012.         
	In a free-wheeling exchange with editors over breakfast, Krishna did not make an explicit link between Indias ambitions for a permanent seat and its ties with Pakistan. But between the lines it was clear that South Block  which houses both the external affairs ministry and the Prime Ministers Office  was aware that any enhanced global status for India was predicated, among other things, on stable and friendly relations with her contentious neighbour.         
	For the record, Krishna dismissed reports that US President Barack Obama during his upcoming state visit would endorse Indias demand for a permanent seat in exchange for a settlement on Kashmir as speculative. These are all kites being flown, there is not even a grain of truth in it.         
	He, however, conceded that the US was keen that we have good relations with Pakistan that we sit across the table and negotiate and that was something India wanted too.         
	While he remained circumspect on Kashmir, Krishna seemed to go out of his way to sound warm and accommodative of Pakistan. He recalled his visit to Islamabad and invitation to Pakistans foreign minister S.M. Qureshi to India and said: I look forward to receiving him.         
	Since there is a spate of high-level visits  Obama, Sarkozy, Putin, Medvedev  lined up in the next few months, India is hopeful of Qureshis visit in the first quarter of next year, Krishna said.         
	Asked if he had approached Qureshi for support ahead of Indias election to the Security Council, Krishna said: We did approach every country, including Pakistan. He went on to underline the excellent rapport shared by Indias permanent representative to the UN (Hardeep Singh Puri) and his Pakistani counterpart (Abdullah Hussain Haroon) and recalled the bonhomie witnessed between the two when the Rohan Bopanna-Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi tennis duo played the US Open Championship in New York earlier this year.         
	On whether Pakistan had indeed voted for India yesterday, Krishna just smiled and said it was a secret ballot but their body language was revealing.         
	Highly-placed sources later confirmed that Pakistan had indeed voted for India and could expect a return gift if things went smoothly in the intervening period.         
	In the context of Krishnas repeated assertion that Indias responsibility had increased tremendously after being elected to the Security Council and we would have to prove ourselves as a responsible and perceptive international player, he was asked whether this meant resolving problems with Pakistan.         
	To this, the minister candidly said that improving ties with Pakistan was a priority. Pakistan understands that there is a genuine desire on part of India to normalise relations; that we want to be good neighbours, cordial neighbours; that India is willing to go more than half way (to meet this objective). We are looking forward to a positive response to our overtures Krishna said.         
	India has often stressed the need to normalise relations but to seek cordial ties appears a leap of faith  and even more significant just weeks after Pakistan sought to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN after a long gap.         
	If that was remarkable enough, what Krishna left unsaid was even more evocative of the new thrust to Indias approach on Pakistan. He did not refer to 26/11 or the terror network in Pakistan which usually form the staple of Indias traditional we are for talks but Pakistan must position on the issue.         
	Nuclear bill        
	Krishna as well as foreign secretary Nirupama Rao, who was present at the breakfast, stressed the importance of President Obamas impending visit to India in November but made it clear that Delhi would not make any amendments to the Civil Nuclear Liabilities Act to accommodate American sensitivities.         
	The bill, which was passed after Opposition parties forced many amendments to impose stiff penalties on nuclear power suppliers in case of an accident, has caused much heartburn among US nuclear companies who want it diluted in order to do business with India.         
	In reply to queries, Krishna said: The question of amending the law was never on the cards. We (India and US) have to work out ways through which both of us can work within the parameters of the legislation. He said he had explained to US leaders the circumstances under which the law was passed and given their own difficulties with their Congress, they were aware of the legislative compulsions faced by the executive in a democracy.         
	Nirupama Rao added that India had told the US that we want to create a level playing ground for all companies, including US nuclear companies and were ready to clarify some clauses through a constructive dialogue to address the doubts and reservations they have expressed.         
	Krishna said bilateral, regional and global issues would be discussed by the two leaders. It was difficult to quantify the outcome of the visit which would depend on a number of other developments taking place in our neighbourhood. But it would certainly strengthen the strategic partnership between the two democracies which continues to flourish since it was struck some years ago.

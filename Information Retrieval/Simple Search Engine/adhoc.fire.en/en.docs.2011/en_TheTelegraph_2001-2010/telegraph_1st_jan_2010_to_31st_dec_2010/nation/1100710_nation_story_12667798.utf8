	New Delhi, July 9: The monsoon appears headed for a break that could bring mainly dry weather across north-western and central India, but is expected to revive by July 16, weather forecasters said today.         
	This is a typical break phase of the monsoon, said a weather scientist. Hot and dry north-westerly winds will prevail over north-western India and the monsoon will also be subdued over central India.         
	The India Meteorological Department said Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh as well as northern Bengal and Sikkim are likely to receive widespread rainfall over the coming week.

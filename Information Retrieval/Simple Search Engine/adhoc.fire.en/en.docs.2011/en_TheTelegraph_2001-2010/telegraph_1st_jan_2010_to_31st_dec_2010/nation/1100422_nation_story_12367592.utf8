          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 21: Mayavati today said tax authorities had accepted her claim that she received gifts worth Rs 2.77 crore from supporters between 1999 and 2005, and accused the CBI of not withdrawing an assets case against her under political pressure.        
	In her reply to a CBI affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister said the agency had, illegally and under political pressure, kept the case pending, to harass and defame her.        
	No case of disproportionate assets is made out as each and every paisa found in my accounts has been held and found to be genuine and bona fide received in form of a gift or otherwise, she claimed.        
	The BSP chiefs affidavit in the top court came days after the CBI said it had clinching evidence to nail her. In its affidavit, the CBI had cited statements of witnesses to show that Mayavati had forcibly acquired gifts from people.

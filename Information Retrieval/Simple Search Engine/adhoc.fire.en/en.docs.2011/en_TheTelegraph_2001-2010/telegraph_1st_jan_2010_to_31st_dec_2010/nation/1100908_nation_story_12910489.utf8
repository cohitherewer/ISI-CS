The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sushma skips CVC swear-in
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sushma skips CVC swear-in
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        P.J. Thomas    
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: Lok Sabha Opposition leader Sushma Swaraj today boycotted the swearing-in of bureaucrat P.J. Thomas as the new Central Vigilance Commissioner.        
	She later met President Pratibha Patil and objected to the choice of the Kerala-cadre IAS officer as chief of the countrys corruption watchdog.        
	Sushma had been part of the three-member selection committee, which included the Prime Minister and the home minister, but had rejected Thomass choice from the short-list of three.        
	She had alleged that Thomass selection was part of efforts to cover up the scam in the allocation of 2G spectrum, purportedly involving telecom minister A. Raja. Thomas had previously been the telecom secretary.        
	It was a conscious decision (by Sushma) not to go (to the function) in which Thomas was appointed after overruling the very legitimate concerns expressed by us about him, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said.        
	Thomas had earlier been cleared of suspicion in the palmolein import scam in Kerala in the 1990s.

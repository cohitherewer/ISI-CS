          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: The family of a 46-year-old heart patient who died in an ambulance near Rajghat yesterday has alleged that he could not reach hospital on time because roads had been blocked to facilitate the passage of the Prime Ministers convoy.        
	A senior Delhi police officer said a probe had been ordered after the Prime Ministers Office today sought a report from home secretary G. K. Pillai.        
	The deceased was suffering from heart aliments. Our officials will speak to the family members to ascertain what exactly happened yesterday when the Prime Ministers convoy was passing through Rajghat, the officer said.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi took a chopper to the party plenary on its concluding day at Burari today.        
	Yesterday, being a Sunday, not much traffic was expected. Hence, both the leaders had taken the road route. But since today was the first working day of the week, they chose to fly to the venue to avoid inconvenience to the people, a Congress leader told PTI.        
	Anil Jain, a heart patient and a resident of Shahadra in east Delhi, died when he was being rushed to Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital around 7.15pm yesterday.        
	My father was gasping for breath and we were in a hurry to take him to hospital. As we neared Rajghat, we saw a large number of vehicles stuck on the road.         
	On enquiry, we found that traffic movement had been stopped to clear the way for the Prime Ministers convoy, Dipak, the victims only son, claimed.        
	Dipak and his friend Manish, who was also in the ambulance, then dialled 100, the police emergency line. An official registered their complaint, Dipak said.        
	My father was tossing on the bed and his condition was going from bad to worse. We were feeling so helpless. We were stuck for over 20 minutes, and when we reached LNJP hospital the doctors declared him dead.        
	Dipak claimed the officers, who took his repeated calls to 100, simply kept asking about the location of the ambulance.        
	My father would have been saved had they taken the matter seriously and allowed the ambulance to move. We have registered our complaint with the police so that no other person meets the same fate in the future.        
	Dipak, who works in his fathers shop that sells home appliances, confirmed that two police officers had visited his home this afternoon.        
	They took my statement and assured me they would look into the matter. They promised to take action if they found any dereliction of duty by officers who took our calls, Dipak said.        
	Satyendra Garg, the joint commissioner of traffic, said traffic was restricted by security officials of Delhi police and not the traffic department.        
	In July, the parents of an eight-year-old boy Aman Khan had blamed their sons death on roads blocked because of the Prime Ministers visit to Kanpur.        
	In November last year, a 32-year-old man died at the gate of a hospital in Chandigarh. His family alleged that security for the Prime Ministers visit hindered access to timely medical treatment.

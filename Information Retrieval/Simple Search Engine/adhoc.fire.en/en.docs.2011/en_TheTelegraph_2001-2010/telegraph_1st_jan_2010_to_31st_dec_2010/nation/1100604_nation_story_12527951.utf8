The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia plays safe with RS list
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sonia plays safe with RS list

	New Delhi, June 3: Sonia Gandhi tonight re-nominated all four outgoing Rajya Sabha members from Andhra Pradesh, preferring to play safe in the face of intense lobbying and possible pitfalls.        
	The four seats from the state have gone to environment minister Jairam Ramesh, N. Janardhana Reddy, Hanumantha Rao and J.D. Seelam.        
	An influential section within the high command wanted former Union minister Renuka Chowdhury to be accommodated, but the powerful Reddy lobby was not prepared to allow the omission of their representative. This enabled Reddy, a veteran leader who has not been keeping well, to retain his seat.        
	Renuka had lost the last Lok Sabha election and the party generally avoids bringing losers into the Rajya Sabha immediately.        
	The Congresss real problem is in Karnataka, from where it had planned to bring in Oscar Fernandes and B.K. Hariprasad. But to get its second candidate elected from the state, the party needs the help of Janata Dal (Secular) leader H.D. Deve Gowda, who has backed out from his commitment to offer support. The former Prime Minister has strong reservations about the candidature of Hariprasad, who has been critical of him.        
	The absence of a woman and a Muslim from the proposed list has put an additional burden on Sonia. So the candidature of Mohsina Kidwai is being given a fresh look from Chhattisgarh where Ajit Jogi is in the race.

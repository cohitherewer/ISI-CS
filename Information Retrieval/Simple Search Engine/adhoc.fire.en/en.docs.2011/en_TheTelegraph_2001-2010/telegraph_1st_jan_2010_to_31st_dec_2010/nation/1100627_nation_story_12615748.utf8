          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 25: The Centre is planning to set up an independent civil aviation authority and an accident probe body, faced with criticism after the plane crash in Mangalore last month.        
	An independent authority is being actively considered by the government, director-general of civil aviati- on Naseem Zaidi said yesterday.         
	The International Civil Aviation Organisation had asked India and other member nations to set up autonomous civil aviation authorities to oversee aviation safety.        
	The Air India plane fell into a valley after overshooting a tabletop runway in Mangalore last month, killing over 150 people on board.        
	Currently, the DGCA performs the jobs of supervising aviation safety and probing plane accidents.         
	The DGCA is a civil servant who works in close proximity with the civil aviation ministry. This link with the ministry is believed to curb the officials independence.         
	Nilotpal Basu, the CPM leader who was earlier chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on transport, said: A civil aviation authority should be a statutory body whose powers are protected by the law. There should be provisions to ensure that the regulator does not indulge in favouritism.         
	The government plan comes in the wake of concerns voiced by pilots and aviation regulators elsewhere that safety standards are being given short shift in India.         
	The US Federal Aviation Authority had last year threatened to downgrade India from Category 1 to Category 2 grade in aviation safety because of repeated wrong landings and lacunae in the running of the DGCAs office.         
	The DGCAs office is understaffed, with over 370 technical positions lying vacant. Most airports function without sufficient number of air-traffic controllers.         
	Only Delhi airport has surface radars, which help the ATC guide planes on the runway and spot problems during landing and takeoff.

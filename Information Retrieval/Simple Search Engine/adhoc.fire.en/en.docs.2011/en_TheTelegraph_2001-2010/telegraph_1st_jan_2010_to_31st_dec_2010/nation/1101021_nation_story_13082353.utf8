	Jaipur, Oct. 20: Russell Brand can keep his shirt on, his fiance is keeping things pretty well covered.        
	But rumour mills arent ready to accept its just a coat Katy Perry has on and no tie-up.        
	The British comedian and the Hollywood actress touched down in Mumbai today to a persistent buzz  of their weekend wedding in Pink City Jaipur.        
	Theres another hum in the air: the luxurious Rambagh Palace Hotel will be the venue for the wedding in traditional Hindu style.        
	But if romance and rumour are having a rumba in Rajasthan, sources in Rambagh denied the wedding, saying the only celebrity marriage on their list for now was that of Prince Shivraj Singh of Jodhpur on November 18.        
	Some sources said the wedding may not be held this month and was set for November 23.        
	Others, however, said it could be a ploy to keep off prying paparazzi as Brand has been quoted as saying that he wanted to have a very simple wedding ceremony.        
	Nobody would confirm if the couple had reached Rajasthan, though Aman-i-Khas in Ranthambhore is supposed to be the resort they are headed to. The resort is about 190km from Jaipur.        
	Rumours that the two would tie the knot in India gained ground after Brand, 35, proposed to the 26-year-old chart-topping I Kissed a Girl and Hot Cold singer on last New Year Eve at Rambagh and got engaged there and then.        
	Wearing traditional Indian outfits, the couple got their relationship blessed by a love guru at a private spiritual ceremony in Rambagh, according to The Sun.        
	Home to history and heritage, the 1835-built Rambagh Palace is set on 47 acres of verdant land in the heart of the Pink City. The din and hustle of the city fade as you criss-cross its majestic gardens where peacocks still wander fearlessly on the manicured lawns and marbled corridors of the palace.

	Brand, famous for hosting Brothers Big Mouth  a spin-off of the UK reality show the Big Brother  had planned the Asia trip as a Christmas gift for Katy.        
	And Katy fell in love with Jaipur. It would be their wedding city, she decided.        
	While staying in India, Katy had taken a picture of her and Russell in front of the Taj Mahal and shared it on Twitter. He built this for me, she wrote in an accompanying message.        
	Whoever coined the term Brand loyalty, this is it.        
	Katy is said to have met Russell in 2008 when she was filming a cameo for his film Get Him to the Greek. They began dating after meeting again in September last year.        
	It was Katys best friend, singer Rihanna, who let the Kat  er, cat  out of the bag when she said in an interview on a radio show that Katy had put her in charge of her bachelorette party.         
	I have to come up with something cool because shes getting married in India, so Im like Okay, now what do I do to match that? Rihanna said.        
	Sources said Katy was keen on an Indian wedding after the hugely publicised 2-million marriage of Liz Hurley and Arun Nayar at Jodhpurs Umaid Bhavan Palace.        
	The couple, the sources said, have booked tents in Aman-i-Khas resort on the edge of Ranthambhore. The tents are air-conditioned and have minimal dcor. A dining tent serves Indian and Western cuisine made largely from ingredients grown in the resorts organic gardens, and a spa tent offers massage treatments and body scrubs. The tariff starts from around $1,000.        
	The sense of secluded solitude is key to the resorts appeal, which is perhaps what Katy and Russell are looking for after their wedding.        
	The two are expecting about 85-100 guests who would be flown in by a chartered plane.

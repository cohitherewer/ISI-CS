          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                              
	Jaipur, April 20: The controversy surrounding Lalit Modi has brought back the focus on a slew of controversial land deals in Rajasthan during the previous BJP regime when the cricket czar allegedly played the role of a super-chief minister.         
	Modi already faces a number of cases in the state, ranging from forgery to misappropriation of funds and insult to the National Flag. The cases are being heard in various courts.        
	The news of the income-tax investigations against Modi has come as a shot in the arm for his opponents in the state, who suffered a setback after Rajasthan High Court stayed a judicial commission formed to probe graft charges against the previous Vasundhara Raje government last November.        
	The order was passed by the division bench of Chief Justice Jagdish Bhalla and Justice M.N. Bhandari while hearing a public interest litigation challenging the appointment of the commission of inquiry headed by retired judge N.N. Mathur.         
	The petitioners, Kashi Purohit and KML Asthana, had challenged the appointment of the commission, alleging that it was constituted without following proper legislative procedures.        
	The government has now filed an appeal in the Supreme Court to revoke the stay.         
	The appointment of the three-member commission was one of the major decisions taken by the Congress government headed by Ashok Gehlot after coming to power in 2008.        
	Gehlot, one of the most vocal critics of Modi, had targeted the cricket official during his election campaign, branding him the de-facto head of the Raje government. Gehlot had variously described Modi as extra-constitutional head and super-chief minister in the BJP regime.        
	Politicians and bureaucrats say that it was common knowledge that senior officials were sent with files to Modi in his plush suite at a heritage hotel where he stayed during his Jaipur visits.         
	Sources said most of the files pertained to crucial land deals that facilitated the entry of big builders into the state.        
	The Congress government, through the Mathur commission, had wanted to probe these deals, particularly the controversial Section 90 B of the Land Acquisition Act, under which acres of agricultural land passed into the hands of big builders from Delhi.        
	Section 90 B was actually meant to be a one-time welfare measure to give relief to local farmers as they were allowed to convert their farming land into non-agricultural land within a specific cut-off date, said a senior Jaipur Development Authority officer, who requested anonymity.        
	But, the official added, the cut-off date was often given a go-by and the development authority framed ad hoc rules to get around the original objective of Section 90 B.         
	With it entered big builders from Delhi like the Ansals, Vatika and DLF, which is the title sponsor of Indian Premier League headed by Modi.         
	Modi is also alleged to have purchased two heritage havelis in the protected Amer Palace zone in Jaipur, manipulating rules, and converted these into a heritage resort.        
	The incident dates back to 2006 when Raje floated the Amber Development and Management Authority with herself as one of its promoters. The authority had put some of the heritage havelis on sale and those were bought by Amber Heritage City Construction Private Ltd. The company later changed its name to Ananda Heritage Hotels Ltd with Modi and his wife Minal as its directors.         
	The Congress government has recently set up a committee and ordered an inquiry into the controversial deals.         
	The havelis were given heritage status under a 1974 gazette notification. The Congress is demanding action against the registrar for registering the sale of these havelis without verifying ownership.

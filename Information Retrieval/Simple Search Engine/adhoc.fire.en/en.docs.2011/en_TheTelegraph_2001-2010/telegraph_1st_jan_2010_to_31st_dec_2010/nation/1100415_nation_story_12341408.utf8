   Glare on kin stake, links with Raje           RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                       Modi in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                
	Jaipur/New Delhi, April 14: The opponents of cricket czar Lalit Modi today raised questions about the stake of his relatives in at least two IPL teams and his connections with the BJP which made him a super-chief minister in Rajasthan when the party was in power.        
	Sanjay Dixit, an IAS officer who famously defeated Modi as president of the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) last year, is now using the same tool  Twitter  to strike at his adversary that the IPL boss has used to devastating effect against junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoor.         
	From Monday to Tuesday, Dixit, through a series of tweets addressed to Modi, hurled posers about the stake-holdings of his relatives in Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab.        
	Lalit, please also disclose the details of the shareholdings of your relatives in Jaipur IPL and GCV Mauritius.        
	Please tell me how the franchise contract was signed by Jaipur IPL when the bid was by Emerging Media? Who is Mohit Burman and how is he an investor in Kings XI Punjab, sorry what I meant was Gaurav Burman, your step son-in-law?        
	To the queries, Modi has tweeted back a crisp, Will disclose those details soon.        
	To a question about his interest in the Rajasthan Royals team, Modi told reporters in Mumbai: I have no hidden agenda or hidden stake.        
	Among the largest shareholders in the consortium that owns Rajasthan Royals is Suresh Chellaram, a brother-in-law of Modi. The Burman brothers, Mohit and Gaurav, are scions of the Dabur empire and are co-owners of the Punjab franchise. Gaurav is married to Modis stepdaughter.         
	Whispers over the Jaipur team had emerged soon after the Emerging Media consortium bought the franchise for a bargain basement price of $67 million in the 2008 team auction. Rajasthan Royals is owned by Jaipur IPL Cricket, which in turn is wholly owned by the Mauritius-based EM Sporting Holdings.         
	It was largely believed that Manoj Badale was the majority owner of the franchise. But it later turned out that the Nigeria-based NRI Chellaram family (Suresh and Aditya) owned 44.1 per cent in the Mauritius holding company.        
	At the time of the IPL launch, Modi was at the peak of his powers in Rajasthan. Sources said Modis phenomenal rise in cricket is in part owing to his proximity to former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, who is from the Gwalior royal family. Modis ties with the Gwalior royals go back a long way  his grandmother and Rajes mother were close friends.        
	Modis entry into the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was also said to have been facilitated by Raje. He won the RCA elections in 2005, using a controversial government ordinance that took away the voting rights of 59 individual members of the association and allowed only 32 district cricket units to vote.        
	Kishore Rungta, once a BCCI stalwart who was ousted by Modi as RCA chief, said: It was unfair to individual RCA members but Modi used his clout with Raje to bring about this ordinance and the subsequent law to ensure his victory.        
	Modi enjoyed formidable clout in Rajasthan when Raje was in power. Officials complained he often ran roughshod over them, but they did not have the guts to take up the matter with Madame.        
	The BJP today sought to make a distinction between a cricket administrator (Modi) and a central minister (Tharoor), adds our special correspondent in Delhi.         
	If Modi is found guilty on some count, the BCCI will act according to its regulations. Modi is not a public servant, he is not a minister, Tharoor is, said BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad.        
	The BJP rejected the suggestion that the feud could have larger ramifications with political overtones because of the perception that Modi was backed by a section in the party in Rajasthan.        
	He is not a primary member of our party, hes merely a cricket administrator, said a Rajasthan MP.         
	A BJP office bearer said: He might have had a relationship with some individuals but not with the entire government. I myself criticised him several times when we were in power, so there was no question of us protecting him.

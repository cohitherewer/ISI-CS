The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre stand key to Ayodhya verdict fate 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Centre stand key to Ayodhya verdict fate 
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 27: Most parties to the Ayodhya title suit have stuck to their demand for an early verdict a day before the Supreme Court takes up a deferment plea, but judiciary watchers believe the crucial factor would be what stand the Centre takes.        
	If the government expresses even the slightest fear of violence and wants the verdict deferred in the interest of communal peace, they said, the court could go along with it.        
	Officials remained tight-lipped today on what the attorney-general might tell the court, but if private remarks by Congress leaders over the past few days are any indication, the Centre may not want an early verdict.        
	Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee appeared to drop a hint today during a visit to inaugurate a bank in Sagardighi, Murshidabad.        
	The parties (to) the Ayodhya title suit have to resolve the matter among themselves through discussions. If that is not possible, then the court verdict has to be accepted, he said.        
	Its exactly this issue of whether to allow negotiations another chance  and therefore to put off the verdict till a later date  that the top court has to decide.        
	A three-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice of India will start hearing all 24 parties to the title suit as well as the Centre the first thing tomorrow in Court 1 as it takes up the deferment plea by Ramesh Chandra Tripathi.        
	On September 23, the top court had admitted the plea and stayed the verdict just a day before it was to be delivered by the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court. It had then asked Tripathi, himself a party to the title suit, to explore whether other parties backed his views.        
	Till this evening, the Nirmohi Akhara seemed to be the only major player to back Tripathis plea, as it had done in the high court before. Its counsel, R.L. Verma, said the Akhara had filed an affidavit in the apex court seeking three months time to try for an out-of-court settlement.        
	But the Sunni Central Wakf Board and another party to the title suit, Mohammed Hasmi, filed affidavits opposing any further move to delay the judgment. Mahant Paramhansa Ram Chandra and other parties too had earlier taken a similar stand, and sources said the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, which is seeking to intervene in the matter, would oppose a deferment in the court tomorrow.        
	The wakf board affidavit dismissed fears that the verdict could lead to unrest. It claimed Tripathi had no following among the Hindus and could not be expected to initiate a process to settle an issue that could not be resolved despite several efforts made by three PMs.        
	It cited six failed negotiations in recent years to argue that there is no chance of the dispute being resolved through mediation, conciliation, arbitration and there was no justification to defer pronouncement of the judgment.

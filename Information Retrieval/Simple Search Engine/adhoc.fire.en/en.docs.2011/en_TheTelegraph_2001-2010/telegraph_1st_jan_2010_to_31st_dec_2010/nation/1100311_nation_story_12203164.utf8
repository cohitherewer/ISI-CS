	New Delhi, March 10: The womens reservation bill has re-emphasised the dominance of the Congress despite the strong fetters coalition politics creates for the government. The Congress always has its way and its success is not dependent merely on its superior numerical strength in comparison to allies.        
	The BJP, which claims to be the champion of coalition politics, had to abandon its core agenda to win over allies. But the Congress has run coalitions on its own terms, rarely offering more than crumbs to its pushy allies. This attitude has come not because it gained strength after crossing 200 seats in the 2009 election  it had bulldozed the Indo-US nuclear deal past every barrier in its first term despite its numerical vulnerability.        
	Sonia Gandhi is aware that passing the womens bill in the Lok Sabha is going to be tougher, but she is not worried about the survival of the government primarily because she knows no other party is prepared to face elections better than the Congress at this stage. It is true the adventurism has injected a degree of instability into the government, but Sonia has placed her political agenda on a much higher pedestal than the survival of the government.        
	There is no denying that there are greater misgivings among the allies and Congressmen over the womens bill than there were on the nuclear deal  which Manmohan Singh thought was vital for the credibility of his leadership. But Sonia is convinced that creating a larger constituency of women is the best way to break primordial loyalties of caste and religion and, in the process, reduce the influence of personality-based smaller parties.        
	Party sources say she wont mind having a snap poll on the issue if the supporting parties decide to push her to the wall. A cabinet minister told The Telegraph: If you run a government, run it with full force. Otherwise you will slowly become a lame-duck government. It is no joke that we took such revolutionary decisions like the NREGA, RTI, OBC quota, nuclear deal and now, the womens bill, despite being in a coalition.         
	Not only in terms of policies, the Congresss complete dominance was always visible in other spheres of governance, too. At the very outset in 2004, it declared that the four key ministries of home, finance, defence and external affairs were out of bounds for the allies. While the BJP had made George Fernandes  who was from ally Janata Dal (United)  defence minister in the NDA regime, the Congress kept such powerful leaders like Sharad Pawar and Lalu Prasad at bay despite their lethal machinations.        
	The obstinate refusal to allow the Samajwadi Party share the ministerial pie, both in the beginning and after Mulayam Singhs unforeseen support for the nuclear deal, showed the ruthlessness with which the Congress treated its partners. In 2009, it firmly clubbed Lalu Prasad with Mulayam to be kept out of power. The Prime Minister initially refused to let the DMKs T.R. Baalu and A. Raja into his cabinet and then settled for a half-way compromise.        
	But the Congress had its way even then, by transferring the controversial 3-G spectrum auction to a group of ministers headed by Pranab Mukherjee as the Prime Minister didnt want Raja, who ultimately got the communications ministry, to mess around. It was not a small measure of Congress dominance that the CBI raided Rajas office and the DMK had to grin and bear it. Although the terms of engagement with the allies have changed in 2009 owing to the sheer power of numbers the Congress has, the scene was not very different in the first term either.         
	The allies kept threatening to form a separate bloc to bargain with the Congress for a larger share, but all the important appointments, particularly of governors, were done by the party independently. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), which kept fighting for Shibu Sorens return to the ministry after his unceremonious exit, was not obliged till the end. The Congress dominates allies for two reasons: one, it has the skill to do it, and two, it actually doesnt believe in coalition politics.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Techies to farmers, nervous week ahead   Subdued wait for report in Andhra
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Techies to farmers, nervous week ahead     Subdued wait for report in Andhra
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                                  
	Hyderabad, Dec. 30: Whatever decision is taken on Telangana could change the fortunes of lakhs of people, from software engineers in Hyderabad to the farmers of coastal Andhra, from film industry workers to political bigwigs.        
	So, all the stakeholders appeared subdued and nervous today as a weeks wait began for the contents of the Srikrishna Committee report to be made public, apart from the students of Osmania University who threatened a heightened statehood agitation.        
	The rice farmers in the coastal districts are worried that if Telangana becomes a state, the supply of the Godavaris waters, the lifeline for the regions agriculture, could become uncertain.         
	They (the rest of the state) takes away our coal and water while we live in poverty and unemployment, is a common refrain among Telangana campaigners.        
	The silk, tomato, fruit, poultry and tobacco farmers and handloom craftsmen from the coasts and Rayalaseema will have an additional concern: the loss of free access to Hyderabads markets.        
	If Telangana doesnt happen, the states major thermal power projects  all located in coastal Andhra  will heave a sigh of relief. These plants depend on coal from the Singareni mines of Telangana.        
	Equally relieved will be the government employees in Hyderabad and other Telangana districts: statehood would mean at least 4 lakh employees will have to be transferred. There are already complaints that people from the coasts are dominating the state secretariat in Hyderabad.        
	Even the fate of the Telugu film industry hangs in the balance. Most of its infrastructure is promoted by financiers from coastal Andhra, who fear they might feel unwelcome in the new state if it comes into existence.        
	Ditto for non-Telangana promoters of industry, hospitals and educational institutions in Hyderabad, their employees from outside as well as the students. (See chart)        
	Its crucial for the political parties too. Take, for instance, Chandrababu Naidu. He has stood for a Samaikya (integrated) Andhra but has allowed a group of Telangana-based Telugu Desam legislators to open a statehood forum in the party.        
	He faces the threat of this group leaving the party and floating a new one, with the consequent decimation of the Desam in Telangana.        
	The Congress isnt too worried because if statehood happens, it expects to form the government with the entire Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) joining it with its 11 MLAs and two MPs. But the Congress may have to pay in Andhra, losing part of its support in the coasts and Rayalaseema, including alienating some business groups. The Congress has left the decision to Sonia.        
	Jaganmohan Reddy, who had favoured a united Andhra while in the Congress, is waiting to decide what stand to take when he floats his new party in February 2011. By then he expects to find out which way the wind is blowing.        
	The Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen is not too concerned with Telangana per se but insists that Hyderabad must be kept out of a new state. There could be friction if the capital is given away.         
	Praja Rajyam Party chief and actor Chiranjeevi has been all for a united Andhra. But two of his 18 MLAs, both from Telangana, have revolted.         
	The BJP, which passed a Telangana resolution at its state executive in 2002, had avoided any statehood talk as long as the Desam was its ally and the NDA was in power. Now its all for Telangana in partnership with the TRS.        
	As for the Left, the CPI favours statehood and the CPM is against.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Valley protests shatter Id peace record   Govt seeks firing details
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Govt seeks firing details
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                                
	New Delhi, Sept. 11: The Centre has asked the Omar Abdullah government to run an audit on each case of firing by the security forces since the current unrest began in June, Union home ministry sources have said.        
	The move suggests that Delhi is keen to fix responsibility for some of the 60-odd civilian deaths, at least, to try and contain the anger on the Valleys streets.        
	The Centre wants to know how many bullets were fired in each instance, whether the CRPF or the state police fired them, and in what circumstances the firing took place, the sources said.        
	In the past four months, the state government has done no case-by-case analysis of how the deaths took place, making it difficult to fix blame, the sources said.        
	Also, if the Centre decides to revoke the Armed Forces Special Powers Act in some parts of the Valley, such an analysis would help it identify the areas where this should be done, they added.        
	We do not even know who (police or paramilitary) fired how many bullets under what circumstances, a source said.        
	The CRPF claims it has only fired in self-defence after being shot at by mobs, but the Union home ministry is not convinced in the absence of proper evidence.        
	Carrying out the inquiry would not be difficult for the state government since individual police stations and CRPF camps maintain records of who fired how many bullets, ministry officials said.        
	These data can be matched with post-mortem analyses and forensic evidence which, if collected, would show what kind of bullet caused the wounds.        
	We also want to know whether the local station house officer (SHO) or a magistrate was present at the spot when firing occurred. It is a simple analysis and yet it has not been done, a source said.        
	Whats known so far is that 48 deaths  79 per cent of the 61 deaths whose details are with the government  occurred in Srinagar, Baramulla (including Sopore) and Anantnag. Ganderbal and Shopian have witnessed no killings.        
	Baramulla heads the toll with 22 deaths while Srinagar has recorded 15 and Anantnag, 11. The toll was 34 in August alone, with Srinagar and Anantnag each witnessing eight deaths last month.        
	The various intelligence agencies are divided over the possibility of a Pakistani role in the unrest. The military intelligence believes Pakistan is involved but the rest think it is a spontaneous movement.        
	Kashmir has seen civil unrest earlier too, a home ministry official said.

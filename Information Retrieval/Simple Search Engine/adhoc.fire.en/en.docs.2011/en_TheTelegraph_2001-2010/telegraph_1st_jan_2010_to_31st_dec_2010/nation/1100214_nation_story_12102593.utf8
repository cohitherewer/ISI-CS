	London, Feb. 13 (PTI): Young British women of Indian origin are wary of discussing issues like sexual health, pregnancy and contraception with their Indian or Asian family doctors for fear that their parents and community might get to know things they wanted to keep private.         
	This reluctance to consult Asian family doctors has caused concern among Britains health officials who believe the sexual health of young Asian women may be at risk.         
	One such case of breach of confidentiality involved a woman identified as K who told BBC: I was 17 and I wanted to go and talk to my GP (general practitioner) about contraception.... That information got back to my mum within two weeks.

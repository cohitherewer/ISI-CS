          SATISH NANDGAONKAR AND SANJAY K. JHA                      Chavan                          
	Mumbai/New Delhi, Jan. 21: Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan today said taxi drivers should know a local language apart from Marathi to get new permits, clarifying his governments Marathi-must statement that sources said brought a rap from the Congress high command.        
	Domicile status is the first criterion under the rules. The second criterion is that the person concerned should know a local language. When I say local language, I mean that he should be able to speak in Hindi, Marathi or Gujarati. That is essential for him to communicate with passengers in any of the local languages they are conversant with, Chavan said.        
	Yesterday, an official statement had said people seeking new taxi permits should be able to read, write and speak Marathi apart from being a Maharashtra resident for a continuous period of 15 years.        
	The statement, which would have surely rattled north Indian migrants, many of whom drive taxis to earn a living, came two days after Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray made a similar demand.        
	Sources said the Congress high command, worried about the impact of the controversy, especially on election-bound Bihar, made it clear that the perception that the Congress was traversing the same path as Raj should be corrected.        
	Chavan today claimed no new decision has been taken regarding Motor Vehicles Rules. One of the rules says that for permission to drive a public service, one would need to satisfy the authorities about his topographical knowledge of the area and working knowledge of Marathi and any one of the languages commonly spoken there.        
	Although Chavan said his governments statement had been misunderstood, there was no mention of the phrase languages commonly spoken in yesterdays statement.        
	When reporters pointed out that yesterdays statement clearly said it was mandatory for new permit seekers to read, write and speak Marathi, Chavan said: We will rectify the press statement.        
	A fresh statement issued by the government said to get an authorisation to drive a taxi, the condition of 15 years domicile in the state and working knowledge of Marathi and any one of the languages commonly spoken there must be fulfilled. It is clarified that no change has been proposed in these provisions of the said rules by the state cabinet.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 13: Land protesters today allowed Orissas Naveen Patnaik government to conduct a survey for Poscos $12-billion steel project, billed as Indias largest single source of foreign direct investment.        
	They (the protesters) have agreed that the survey work will continue peacefully, the chief minister said after a meeting with Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, which is leading the agitation, here this evening.         
	This was the first time since 2005, when the state signed the agreement for the project with the South Korean giant, that the agitators held talks with Naveen on the deadlock.        
	The breakthrough was apparently made after the chief minister assured the protesters that he would visit the area in Jagatsinghpur, 110km from Bhubaneswar, and speak to people who would be affected by the project.        
	Abhay Sahu, the Sangram Samitis chief, described todays meeting as successful. Let the chief minister visit the area and see how the project would affect the livelihood of the locals.        
	Although the land survey started a fortnight ago in villages from where the land is to be taken, the officials had not been able to enter Dhinkia, the Sangram Samitis hub.

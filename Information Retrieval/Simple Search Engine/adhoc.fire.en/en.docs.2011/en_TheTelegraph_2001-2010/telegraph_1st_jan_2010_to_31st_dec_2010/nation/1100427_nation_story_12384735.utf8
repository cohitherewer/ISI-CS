The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt cut-motion eye on margin 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Govt cut-motion eye on margin 
          OUR BUREAU                          Manmohan Singh                                  
	New Delhi, April 26: For a change, parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal didnt mind todays House disruptions over the phone-tapping allegations.        
	They gave him enough time to personally contact every Congress Lok Sabha MP with a request: Please reach Parliament by 5pm tomorrow; dont make any appointments in the evening as that may delay you. Voting on the cut motions will take place at 6pm.        
	The ministers meticulousness doesnt mean the government is panicky. Rather, the Congress wants to use the opportunity to flaunt its Lok Sabha majority by establishing a healthy lead over the halfway mark of 272.        
	Bansal said the pro-government votes would be much more than 274, the UPAs official strength.        
	The Congress floor managers have reached out to the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal after striking a deal with Mayavatis BSP that it will not vote for the cut motions.        
	The Congress is pleased at the apparent rift in Opposition ranks  Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad are unhappy with the BJP for abandoning the IPL controversy for the phone-tapping scandal.        
	The Opposition, however, seemed to have reached a loose understanding for floor co-ordination tomorrow. Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj said the BJP had discussed the matter with the 13 non-NDA non-UPA parties led by the Left.        
	The CPMs leader in the Lok Sabha, Basudev Acharya, accepted there would be co-ordination with the BJP but insisted that it would be informal.         
	With the numbers not adding up for the Opposition, the Left appears to be concentrating more on tomorrows all-India strike over price rise to showcase the unity of the 13-party group.        
	The government is hoping the 13-party MPs would try to disrupt Parliament in solidarity with their workers fighting on the streets. If the disruptions continue for a long period, voting will become difficult.        
	All the NDA constituents, however, have issued a whip to their Lower House MPs to support the cut motions.        
	The defeat of a money bill means curtains for the government, but this has never happened in India although cut motions have been moved frequently.         
	A cabinet minister claimed the government could defeat the Opposition by more than 50 votes. Many MPs can abstain or walk out. Few MPs want fresh elections now. We cannot be sure about BSP support, though, as it has proved a slippery customer in the past.

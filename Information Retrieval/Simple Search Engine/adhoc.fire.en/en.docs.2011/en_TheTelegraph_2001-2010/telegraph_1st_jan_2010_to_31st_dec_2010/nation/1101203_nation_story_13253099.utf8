The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Respect PM? Raja raises court brow
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Respect PM? Raja raises court brow
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: The Supreme Court today criticised A. Raja for disregarding the Prime Ministers advice on spectrum allotment and faulted his language and attitude towards his boss.        
	The court also rapped the former telecom minister for going about his own way, allotting 2G spectrum at 2001 prices in 2008.        
	Manmohan Singh had written to Raja on November 2, 2007, asking him to try and find a better way to process the large number of applications  a hint that an auction might be the better option because of the skewed demand-supply ratio.        
	Speaking on Rajas behalf, his counsel T. Andhyarujina said: I have the greatest respect for the Prime Minister, I did not disregard his advice.        
	Is this the way you show your respect for the PM? Justice A.K. Ganguly shot back.        
	The bench of Justice Ganguly and Justice G.S. Singhvi referred to Rajas letter to Singh, which said it would be unfair, discriminatory, arbitrary and capricious to auction 2G.        
	Look at the command of his language, the court said sarcastically. When you address a letter to the highest executive, the tenor of the language should be temperate. Here, it is a question of attitude.        
	At one point, Justice Ganguly observed that Raja had ignored the Prime Minister, the law minister and the finance minister as well.        
	Andhyarujina had just defended Rajas decision to ignore the law ministrys opinion to refer the entire matter to a group of ministers (GoM).        
	He said the minister had only sought a clarification on the procedure of deciding applications but the law ministry had asked him to review the entire policy. So he wrote to the Prime Minister saying the law ministry advice was out of context.        
	Justice Ganguly observed: In view of the importance of the issue, the matter was to have been referred to the GoM. But Raja ignores the law minister, the PM and the finance minister.        
	The court noted that Singh had written to Raja a day after the DMK minister had rejected the law ministry advice. Singh told Raja to wait before taking further action, but the minister overruled it.        
	Justice Ganguly said: He writes a letter and then goes about it his own way. Is this the way a government functions?         
	Justice Singhvi said: Nothing would have happened if you had waited for 2-3 days.        
	The bench was hearing a public interest litigation seeking court monitoring of the CBI probe into the scandal. Andhyarujina argued that Raja had merely continued with a policy in place since 2003 and that telecom regulator Trai had consistently maintained that the old 2G prices should continue.        
	CBI counsel K.K. Venugopal said the agencys report to the court on the progress of the probe showed that no one had been spared. He said two officers, vigilance commissioner Sreekumar and J.M. Garg, could oversee the probe and report back to the court.        
	Prashant Bhushan, lawyer for the NGO petitioner, insisted on a third officer. The court will hear the case again on Tuesday.        
	The government today handed the original Niira Radia tapes to the Supreme Court for safekeeping.

	 Mumbai, Nov. 2 (PTI): Bombay High Court has described as unfair labour practice a 1994 Maharashtra government ruling that made only unmarried daughters eligible for employment in case of a parents premature retirement.          
	It is impossible to accept in this day and age that assuming a woman gets married she will cut off her ties with the family she is born in and will leave it to suffer the vagaries of life in penury, Justice Nishita Mhatre observed. The judgment was delivered last week.          
	The court was hearing an appeal filed by the state government against an order of a court that had said the termination of Medha Parkes services was illegal. Parke had got employment under the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pension) Rules after her father retired prematurely on medical grounds.                  
	 Bangalore (PTI): Karnataka High Court on Tuesday issued notices to Speaker K.G. Bopaiah and other respondents on petitions filed by five Independent MLAs challenging their disqualification from the Assembly and fixed November 8 for a hearing. The MLAs were disqualified on October 10 after withdrawing support to the BJP government.                   
	 Pune (PTI): A policeman who was dragged on the road by a car driven by a drunk bounced back to his feet, hailed a passing motorcycle and chased down the offender who crashed into another vehicle. Policeman Santosh Wadekar accosted the driver when he did not move his car even after the signal had turned green at a busy square on Monday evening. The driver, Eknath Pawar, then drove ahead, dragging the policeman for some distance.

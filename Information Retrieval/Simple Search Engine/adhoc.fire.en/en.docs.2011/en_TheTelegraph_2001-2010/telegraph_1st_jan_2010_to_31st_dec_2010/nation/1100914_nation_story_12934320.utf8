          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 13: The Supreme Court was today urged to take a tough stand against governments that stand by and watch reprisal killings, such as the pogrom of Sikhs in Delhi in 1984 and of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002.        
	The appeal came from Dushyant Dave, counsel for the survivors of 1984, who urged the court to lift the stay on the trial of Congress leader Sajjan Kumar in connection with the riots.        
	Dave said it suited the ruling parties to keep silent during such mass violence, and cited how the governments of Narendra Modi and Rajiv Gandhi won elections immediately after the killings. He said that in 1984, the government did not act till civil society brought pressure on it.        
	The lawyer said the denial of justice after the killings made matters worse. He cited how, after 9/11, only two people were killed in reprisal in the US and how the accused in both cases received death sentences within three months.        
	The apex court had, on a plea from Sajjan, stayed his trial on August 13 this year without even hearing the victims. Sajjan was the MP from Outer Delhi where hundreds of Sikhs were burnt alive.        
	Can he as an MP absolve himself? Dave asked. Sajjan, accused of inciting the killer mobs, faces murder and conspiracy charges.

          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Nov. 19: Eleven air force personnel and an army lieutenant colonel were killed when an air force Mi-17 helicopter crashed near the China frontier in Arunachal Pradesh today a minute after a 12.04pm take-off.        
	Defence sources said the Guwahati-bound chopper crashed on a wooded hillock at Tepsha village in the Bomdir area, about 6km from Tawang from where it had taken off, leaving no survivors.        
	The 12 dead include three officers: Flight Lieutenants Akash Yadav and Nishant Rai, one of whom was the pilot and the other the co-pilot, and Lt Col M.S. Nene. This is the highest toll in a military aircraft crash since June last year when an An-32 plane went down near Mechuka, also on the China frontier in Arunachal, killing 13 personnel.        
	This morning, the Mi-17 had flown an air-maintenance sortie from Tawang, located about 9,000 feet above the ground. Air-maintenance refers to helicopter-aided support of forward army posts on the China frontier, at altitudes of 8,000ft to 14,000ft where winds are high and oxygen density almost 30 per cent lower, and where supplies are either para-dropped or the helicopters make touch-and-go landings.        
	The helicopter was said to be in good condition and the weather too was deemed fair. The air force does not clear aircraft for flights in the Northeast if the Met report is not favourable.        
	But even in fair weather in the Northeast, air force helicopters often have turbulent sorties and have to fly at the limits of their capabilities.         
	The air force has ordered a court of inquiry to determine the cause of todays crash. All 12 bodies have been found.        
	The aircraft was from the 110 Helicopter Unit Vanguards, whose motto is Apatsu Mitram: Friend in the time of need. The unit is based in Kumbhirgram near Silchar, and a detachment is often based in Guwahati.        
	The Mi-17 is the air forces multi-utility helicopter, which can be used for transport as well as for offensive action and can be configured to carry 24 fully equipped troops or an equivalent tonnage.        
	It is also in demand from the Union home ministry for counter-Maoist operations. The air force has contracted 80 new Mi-17s from Russia that are to be delivered in batches by 2014.        
	Quoting eyewitnesses, defence sources in the Northeast said the chopper appeared to have lost control and went into a free fall before hitting the ground and bursting into flames.        
	Defence spokesperson Colonel Rajesh Kalia said: The mishap may have occurred due to poor visibility but it is too early to say exactly how it happened.        
	Arunachal has witnessed a large number of air crashes since World War II, when the Allies lost many aircraft in these Eastern Himalayan mountains. In 1997, then junior defence minister N.V.N. Somu and three army officers were killed in a helicopter crash near Tawang.        
	The US defence department estimates that about 400 Allied airmen were killed in crashes, caused mainly by poor visibility, along the route. The flight path over Arunachal, used by American aircraft to ferry supplies to Chinese forces battling the invading Japanese, was nicknamed the Hump by the Allies. The remains of some of the US aircraft are still found in the Arunachal mountains.

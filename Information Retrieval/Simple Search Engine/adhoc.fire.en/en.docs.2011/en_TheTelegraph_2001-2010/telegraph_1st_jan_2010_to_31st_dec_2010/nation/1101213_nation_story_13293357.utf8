                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Chauhan apologises after Mallya barb
                            
	Bhopal, Dec. 12 (PTI): Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan today likened the Rajya Sabha to a market and sought its abolition, referring to people like Kingfisher to suggest that huge sums of money were being spent to become a member.        
	However, hours later, Chauhan apologised and said he had high regard for constitutional bodies like the Rajya Sabha.         
	In an apparent reference to liquor baron Vijay Mallya, Chauhan had said people like Kingfisher were coming to the Rajya Sabha. Mallya, who has business interests in the liquor and airline industry, is a second-time MP.         
	Those who give funds make a sort of investment and earn out of it later, the BJP chief minister said. In my opinion, the time has come to do away with the Rajya Sabha elections in which huge sums of money are spent by the candidates. In place of it, a quota should be reserved in the Lok Sabha for Rajya Sabha members, Chauhan told a regional meeting on electoral reforms organised in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly.         
	Huge sums of money were being spent by the candidates to become RS members, he said, adding that men with money power were in the race to enter the House.        
	What is the need of the Rajya Sabha? There is already the peoples House, the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha was sacred and people who constituted the Rajya Sabha were people who couldnt fight elections, like scientists, artists, writers and intellectuals. But now, people like Kingfisher and others are entering the Rajya Sabha. There is open selling of tickets, it is like a market. It is a shame, Chauhan said.        
	 However, at a hurriedly called media conference at his residence tonight, Chauhan said: While participating in a seminar on electoral reforms earlier in the day, I had said a few things. I am always concerned about maintaining the dignity of state Assemblies, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.        
	As far as the Rajya Sabha is concerned, it is a constitutional body and I have high regard for it and its members. If people have taken otherwise what I have stated, then I apologise, Chauhan said.        
	The chief minister refused to take any other question on the issue.        
	In place of the Rajya Sabha elections, the system like nominating an Anglo-Indian as member of Parliament should be followed, he had earlier said.        
	He said that Lok Sabha and Assembly elections should be held simultaneously in the country, adding that they should be conducted once in five years.        
	Chauhan said frequent polls were hampering development because of the code of conduct kicking in.        
	The chief minister also expressed concern over the use of black money during elections, adding that urgent steps were needed to check the practice.        
	He stressed the need for state funding of elections, saying such a step would end the use of black money in elections.        
	No political party can run without funds, he said. A system should be evolved to make sure that money is received by cheque.

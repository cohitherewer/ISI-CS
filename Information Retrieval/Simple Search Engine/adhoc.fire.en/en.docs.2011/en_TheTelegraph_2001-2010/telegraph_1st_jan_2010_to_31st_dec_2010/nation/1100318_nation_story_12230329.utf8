          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 17: Maharashtra anti-terror squad chief K.P. Raghuvanshi appears likely to face disciplinary action for sharing with the media information about a terror plot to attack ONGC facilities and compromising the probe.        
	The signals came from chief minister Ashok Chavan, who said today that no one must leak vital information unless a probe is complete. Sensitive issues should be protected and it should not damage investigation.         
	Chavan suggested the Centre was upset with Raghuvanshi, but didnt say whether it had sought action. The Centre feels it has hampered the probe. I will speak to the (Union) home minister and elicit his views.         
	Intelligence agencies monitoring the calls and emails of one of the two suspects held on Sunday have said the trail has gone cold after the details were given out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Under stress: Nitish development card
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Under stress: Nitish development card
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                     
	Patna, Sept. 2: The bloody hostage ultimatum ticking away ominously in the Lakhisarai hills threatens to derail chief minister Nitish Kumars artfully constructed development discourse ahead of the Assembly elections and erode the advantage he currently appears to have over political adversaries.         
	The killing of one policeman by the Naxalite captors and a stern notice that three other colleagues held captive too might be put to ugly ends if demands are not met has abruptly locked the Nitish government in defensive crisis-management mode.         
	This is a nasty eruption, admitted a top Nitish aide, even as the chief minister put a brave front on Maoist pressure tactics, more so because elections are round the corner and we are going to the people on a positive development ticket. If this spirals out of our hands, it has the potential to taint five years of achievement.        
	It does not help that while Left-wing extremists have caught Nitish in a bitter cleft, there also looms the prospect of trouble brewing to the chief ministers political right. There is more than just a little anxiety in the Nitish camp over the impending court verdict on the Ayodhya title suit.         
	Whichever way Allahabad High Court rules, Nitishs coalition with the BJP could suffer fresh turbulence. A pro-mosque verdict will almost certainly witness a rash of Hindutva protests, which will discomfit Nitish no end. A pro-temple ruling could spoil his assiduous wooing of Bihars minorities.         
	Lalu Prasad, chief challenger to Nitish in the ensuing elections, is making no secret he is quite looking forward to the Ayodhya ruling because he believes it will finally expose the contradictions of the opportunistic and dubious alliance between Nitish and the BJP.         
	For the moment, though, he appears grateful for the ammunition the Maoists have handed him. Grabbing the grim moment with singular alacrity, Lalu Prasad launched into what he called Nitishs misrule with gusto.         
	I have been saying this all along, but nobody would believe me. The real face of Nitish raj is unravelling. Innocent policemen are being killed and held hostage and the state government is sitting idle, they do not know what do to, how to act.         
	Challenging Nitishs central claim to fame, Lalu Prasad said: If indeed Nitish has done such great development in Bihar, how is it that Naxalites have been expanding their base in the state and have now suddenly enacted a bloodbath in Lakhisarai? Development is a fraudulent claim, bakwas apne expose ho raha hai, humlog aur expose karenge (he is getting exposed, we will expose him more).         
	Nitish, who has been burning the back-channels to push a deal with the Naxalite group holding the policemen in addition to overseeing security imperatives  the dont-kill-them plea issued by Mahasweta Devi was a consequence of the chief ministers Track II efforts  keenly senses that political implications could reverberate well beyond the climax of the current standoff.         
	His essential approach to the crisis, therefore, remains political rather than police-oriented. Addressing the Patna intelligentsia at a programme this afternoon, Nitish said: I have taken a very different approach to Naxalites, distinct from the Centre and other chief ministers. They are our own people, they are angry, we need to talk to them in a democratic way. They should recognise my different approach and not indulge in killings.

	Mumbai, July 14: Over a 100 people landed in hospital today after chlorine gas leaked from cylinders long lying unattended in a Mumbai Port Trust godown compound, a little over a month after the Bhopal tragedy verdict re-opened wounds in the country.        
	At least eight persons are in the critical care unit of JJ Hospital with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome but they are stable, officials said. Over 50 people have been discharged after treatment.        
	The gas leaked around 3.30am from a set of 141 imported cylinders containing hazardous material stored at the Hay Bunder storage facility, of which 136 were empty. Residual gas leaked either from the empty cylinders or from one of the other five that have been lying on the facility premises in central Mumbais Sewri for 13 years.        
	Those hospitalised with respiratory distress were mostly labourers working on barges on the Sewri waterfront, and a few engineering students of the nearby Lal Bahadur Shastri Nautical Institute. They grew short of breath and complained of burning eyes and skin after a pungent smell started pervading the Sewri area around dawn.        
	Over 200 residents of the area and students of the engineering college were evacuated. Mumbai fire brigade officials and port trust fire services personnel first began operations to contain the leak. Four fire officials took ill after inhaling the gas.        
	Dr T.P. Lahane, the dean of JJ Hospital where most of the affected were admitted, said: Patients were given oxygen and steroids. The more critical patients were suffering from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome but their condition is stable.        
	Chlorine gas is heavier than air and floats close to the ground, increasing the duration of exposure after a leak. At significant concentrations, it causes irritation and inflammation of the eyes, nose, pharynx, the airways and lungs within seconds after exposure. Medical studies have suggested that exposure to the gas may lead to deterioration of lung functions.        
	Mumbai Port Trust chairman Rahul Asthana rushed to the site after hearing of the leak that reeked of negligence. Asthana said some importers re-used empty chlorine cylinders. It is possible that some residual chlorine could have leaked out. But the situation is under control now.         
	Mohan Chandran, the secretary to the Mumbai Port Trust board, said the exact source and cause of the leak had yet to be determined. A probe has been ordered.        
	Asked if measures had been taken to remove other hazardous material possibly lying unattended in the area, Chandran said: We will require permission from authorities like the customs and the controller of explosives. As a precautionary step, we have taken measures to neutralise all the material stored there.        
	The Centre has asked all ports to review safety measures. All ports have a set of guidelines for safety measures which are adhered to. I have directed authorities to review the safety measures so that such incidents do not take place at any port, shipping minister G.K. Vasan said.        
	The incident has come a little over a month after seven senior Union Carbide officials were convicted only for negligence for the worlds worst industrial disaster in Bhopal in December 1984.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Labourer poser in clean drain drive
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Labourer poser in clean drain drive
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 7: With monsoon likely to hit the state in the second week of this month, the pre-monsoon drain cleaning and de-clogging drive by the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) is still a non-starter.        
	Reason: dearth of labourers.        
	The civic body officials said that labourers are reluctant to scavenge in stinking filth and silt of choked drains. And this (non-availability of labourers) is said to be a major stumbling block for the BMC that has been failing to carry out de-silting activity since the past five years. We are hopeful of doing the same this year, BMC commissioner Gadadhar Parida said.        
	BMC mayor Ananta Jena told The Telegraph: We will start the de-silting process from June 10.        
	We have asked labour contractors to provide us labourers so that we can start the work in next few days. I hope labourers can be arranged this time, Jena said.        
	Sources said not less than 1,200 labourers are required to clean and de-clog the drains spreading across nearly 359 km across 60 wards of Bhubaneswar. Around Rs 43 lakh has been estimated to execute the drain cleaning and de-silting process, sources said. The whole exercise would take not less than one month.        
	Sensing that the de-silting tender would not fetch good amount of money, the contractors are not turning up. This is not a profitable work. So contractors are not coming forward to execute the tender, a BMC official said requesting anonymity.        
	Another possible reason for dearth of labourers is the poor wage to be paid to them. We have the approved rate of Rs 90 per labourer per day. But the same labourer can earn more than Rs 160 if he or she works elsewhere, the official said.                          
	Meanwhile, the citizens blamed the BMC for not taking the issue seriously. The BMC should pay more to the labourers for the job. Unless the silt is removed from the drains, the city streets will turn into drains in coming rainy season, said Subhranshu Rath, the general secretary of Confederation of Citizens Associations, Bhubaneswar.

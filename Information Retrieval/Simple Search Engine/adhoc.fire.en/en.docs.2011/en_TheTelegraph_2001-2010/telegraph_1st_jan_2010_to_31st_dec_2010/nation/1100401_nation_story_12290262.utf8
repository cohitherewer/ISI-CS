	New Delhi, March 31: India will for the first time host a quadrennial congregation of the worlds leading mathematicians in Hyderabad later this year, just weeks before the Commonwealth Games in Delhi.        
	The International Congress of Mathematicians is expected to attract stars from the field, senior faculty as well as students for eight days of discussions and lectures and insights into the latest research in mathematics.        
	Well have 20 plenary lectures by the worlds top mathematicians and 180 invited lectures across various branches of mathematics, said M.S. Raghunathan, a professor at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, and convener of the congress.        
	The 2010 congress in Hyderabad will introduce a new mathematics prize  the Chern Prize, named after S.S. Chern, a towering figure in geometry. Two other prestigious mathematics awards the Fields Medal and the Nevanlinna Prize  will also be awarded. Three mathematicians of Indian origin are considered by many to be among serious candidates for the Fields Medal.        
	The congress has been held every four years  except for a short break during the Second World War  since 1897. This is the third time the conference is being held in Asia  after Kyoto in 1990 and Beijing in 2002.

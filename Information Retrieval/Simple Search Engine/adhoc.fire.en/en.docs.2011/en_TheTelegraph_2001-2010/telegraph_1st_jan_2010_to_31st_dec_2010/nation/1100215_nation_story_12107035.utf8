          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                        
	Pune, Feb. 14: Osho follower Jack Heung of Taiwan was trying to grasp the idea of India at German Bakery when the bomb went off precisely at 6.52 on a bustling Saturday evening.        
	His Indian friends received minor burns. Jack, a 48-year-old former chief executive officer, received 30 per cent burns.        
	Thats pretty serious, but not very critical, he said, lying at Ward 2 of Sassoon Hospital.        
	Having lost his job in last years recession and after an estrangement from his wife soon after, Jack had hoped communal living at the Osho Ashram in Pune would heal his wounds.        
	Today so many people have come to meet me, find out how I am. They are not related to me, still they care. This is the great love of humanity the terrorist will never be able to destroy, said Jack, as his friend and partner Chen Feng, 26, held his hand.        
	Lying without a stitch on his body, Jack tries to manage a smile. Chen wants me to go back to China, but I want to see more (of) India, said Jack, who landed in Mumbai from Taiwan three weeks ago.        
	I was at the bakery yesterday  there were about 60-70 people. I looked around and saw the happy faces. And then I fell off my chair. I was sitting inside the bakery, I heard a loud noise and saw the whole place go up in flames, he remembers.        
	Seventeen-year-old Vidyashri Nayak was catching a bite with her boyfriend and her mother Sunanda before her first professional belly-dancing act at Dolores Pyramid, a Pune pub.        
	Sitting on her bed two steps away from Jacks, Vidyashri says she was lucky she had gone to the cash counter seconds before the bomb exploded.        
	I saw the roof of the bakery shatter. A huge piece of something hit me as chairs flew and blood and flesh smattered the verandah, she said.        
	Her mother and boyfriend escaped, but not without some major fractures, while she broke her hand.        
	As flames engulfed the entire place and stench of burning flesh choked those trapped inside the caf, Jack realised his legs were hurting, and found his robe on fire.        
	Osho commune members usually wear a one-piece maroon robe with two slits near the calves.        
	I could not get out of the robe as it had to be taken out through the head. Then someone put a cloth over me and I was saved, he said. He is now caught in an impossible diplomatic tussle.        
	Chinese embassy officials have decided to claim me as their own and I believe they are coming to Pune to meet me. They still think they own Taiwan. But I want my Taiwanese authorities, who are caught in a diplomatic web as India says Taiwan is a part of China, he winked, his sense of humour still intact.        
	Jack said police, who had been deployed in large numbers at a nearby field where a musical night had been organised by the local people, came fast. They were so helpful, I have no words to thank them, he said.        
	His friend from Osho commune, Amiel of Israel arrived with some of his belongings.        
	They talked about other injured Osho commune members and an Italian whose whereabouts were still unknown. Nadia Macerini was later found at the Sassoon Hospital mortuary.        
	As more Oshoiites pour in, Amiel tells Jack that scared by the blast, many of them were leaving Pune for good. Amiel, however, said he had decided to stay back.        
	There are five of us in the ashram now. We are not leaving. I was meditating when I heard a loud sound. I initially thought it was fireworks. Its a very shocking incident. But we have to understand that terrorism is a disease that is spreading all over the world. We have to start getting used to it, he said.        
	Koregaon Park, where the caf is located a stones throw away from the Osho ashram, is one of the spots that was surveyed by American terror suspect, David Coleman Headley last year.         
	Headley had stayed in a hotel, Surya Villa, opposite the Osho ashram.        
	Amiel as well as many local residents living in the vicinity of the Jewish Chabad House said the security outside the prayer house had been beefed up big time from two security personnel to 10, a few days before the German Bakery blast.        
	Everyone here is okay. We are on the same street. We are some minutes walk away. We heard the bomb. Most of the Israeli tourists who were staying in the area have been located, said Rabbi Betzalel Kupchik from Pune Chabad House.        
	Of the 60 injured in Saturdays blast, 12 are foreigners. Besides the Italian Nadia, a 26-year-old Iranian student from Symbiosis, Syed Abdul Ghani, also died.

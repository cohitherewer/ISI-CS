          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 17: The Cabinet Committee on Security today approved raising 32,000 troops for the paramilitary Sashastra Seema Bal to prevent the Red Corridor from taking shape from Tirupati to Pashupatinath.        
	Sources said 16 battalions would be raised in the first phase mainly to fight Maoist rebels, whether in the hinterland or at the Nepal border, the edge of the corridor now seen as a figment of imagination of security forces.        
	We have to think ahead and prevent the Red Corridor the Maoists are planning, said a senior government official.        
	The government today set aside Rs 1,800 crore to create a security architecture that will secure the boundaries with Nepal and Bhutan.         
	The official said the security apparatus needed to be strengthened over the next three to four years so that these borders would be safe.         
	Nearly 20 SSB battalions  or roughly 20,000 troops  now patrol the borders, but the force has been increasingly used in Maoist-affected states as well.        
	Although the Red Corridor from Tirupati to Pashupatinath is believed to be a figment of imagination of security forces, it is also true that relations exist between Nepalese and Indian Maoists.        
	The long, unfenced border with Nepal is known for arms smuggling but it is also provides free access to militant groups on either side.

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, July 17: The Reddy brothers of Bellary earned a reprieve from the BJP, thanks to the Karnataka governor H.S. Bharadwajs incessant political pitch for their ouster from the state government of which they are ministers.         
	But the BJP brass also decided chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa will be backed in case the Reddy duo, who control Karnatakas iron-ore reserves, have to be dropped in future if the governments integrity and image looks like being compromised. Karnataka after all is our first government in the south and that claim cannot be dented, a BJP functionary said.        
	Officially, Yeddyurappa who bore the brunt of the brothers alleged political machinations  today virtually ruled out their removal, saying such a step would be considered if the charges against them are proved.         
	The Opposition alleged that the Reddys have engaged in illegal iron-ore mining and exported the produce, depriving Karnataka of revenue losses amounting to several thousand crores. There are no charges against any minister. But if there are charges, I will remove them within 24 hours, the chief minister claimed. The states Lokayukta is looking into the illegal mining.        
	Yeddyurappa, who arrived in Delhi this morning, met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, home minister P. Chidambaram and BJP leaders L.K. Advani and Nitin Gadkari.        
	Sources said the last time he was in the throes of a Bellary-inspired crisis, he got virtually no support from the party brass. Indeed, a couple of central leaders asked him to account for his own corruption acts instead of pointing fingers at the Reddys.

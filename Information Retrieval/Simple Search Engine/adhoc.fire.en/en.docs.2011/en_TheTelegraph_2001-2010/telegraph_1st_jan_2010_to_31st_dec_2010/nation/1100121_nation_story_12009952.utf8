The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Some students of deemed varsities face test
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Some students of deemed varsities face test
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                       
	New Delhi, Jan. 20: Students who joined the 44 blacklisted deemed universities after their institutions earned the deemed tag may need to prove their academic potential afresh before they are eligible for degrees from recognised state or central universities.         
	A majority of the estimated 2 lakh students at these institutions are expected to be eligible to receive degrees without any hassle.         
	But a minority that joined these institutions after they became deemed universities may have to clear a fresh qualifying test to be eligible under the roadmap charted by the human resource development ministry.         
	The HRD ministrys action plan for accommodating students from deemed universities found unfit for the status includes the contingency of fresh admission screening to satisfy the affiliating university, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The government does not have an exact figure of the number of students who are likely to fall in the category that may need to take a fresh entrance test but sources estimated that it could run into several thousands.         
	These students, sources estimated, could form between 15 per cent (around 29,000 students) and 40 per cent (around 78,000 students) of the total students currently at the 44 blacklisted deemed universities.         
	The action plan was proposed by a task force that recommended withdrawal of deemed university status from 44 institutions and has been accepted by the HRD ministry.         
	The fresh admission screening is likely to be demanded by state universities before affiliating institutions stripped off their deemed status, sources aware of the action plan said.         
	Given the fact that many of these tainted deemed universities have been accused of awarding seats based on capitation fees instead of merit, we expect state universities to demand the screening, a source said.         
	The mid-course screening will not require students who clear the test to restart their course of study. On clearing the test, students can continue the course they are pursuing.         
	But students who fail the screening test may lose their right to a degree.         
	An estimated 1,19,363 undergraduate and postgraduate students, 2,124 research scholars  pursuing an MPhil or a PhD  and 74, 808 distance education students study at these institutions.         
	Of the 44 deemed varsities, 36 were set up over the past five years under the tenure of then HRD minister Arjun Singh.         
	University Grants Commission records show that most of these 36 were set up since 2008 and a majority of their students were admitted when the institutions were colleges affiliated to a university.         
	The HRD ministry, while notifying deemed status for these institutions, had clarified that students admitted till the notification must be awarded degrees by the university to which the institute was till then affiliated.         
	All students who joined these institutions before they were declared deemed universities continue to automatically remain eligible for degrees  irrespective of the fate of their institutions.         
	But students who joined these institutions after they were declared deemed universities are likely to be asked to take a screening test, before they are enrolled as students at the affiliating university.         
	The HRD ministry, in its affidavit, has identified 28 state and central universities, which it is confident, will agree to affiliate institutions to be stripped off deemed status.

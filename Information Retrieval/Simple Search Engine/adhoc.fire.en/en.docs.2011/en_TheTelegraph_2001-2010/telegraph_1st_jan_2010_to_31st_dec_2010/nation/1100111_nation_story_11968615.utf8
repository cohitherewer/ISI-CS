          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 10: An Air India flight from Dubai to Calicut was diverted to Mumbai this evening to offload a passenger who had allegedly misbehaved with a female co-passenger in a drunken state.        
	Hours earlier, a 56-year-old man was arrested at Mumbai airport on the charge of outraging the modesty of a Jet Airways air hostess.        
	The Air India passenger, a blue-collar worker, was drunk when he boarded the flight, an airline source said. He kept asking for alcohol and making noise aboard the flight.        
	The source added: Finally, he started misbehaving with a lady passenger who sat behind him and had asked him to shut-up. He started using abusive language and stood in the middle of the aisle fighting with her and threatening her. Thats when the crew had to restrain him. And since the plane was closing in on Mumbai, the commander decided to offload him.        
	The pilot of IC-537 alerted Mumbai air traffic control, requested permission to land and asked for security personnel to be provided to offload the unruly passenger.        
	The plane made an unscheduled stop at Mumbai around 6pm. The unruly passenger was offloaded for misbehaving with a co-passenger and the flight left for Calicut an hour later, said Jitendra Bhargava, Air Indias executive director (communications).        
	Police at Mumbais Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport said the man had been charged with criminal intimidation and also booked under the Suppression of Unlawful Act Against Safety Of Civil Aviation Act, 1982. He will be produced in court on Monday.        
	The incident came on a day Saudi low-cost airline Nas Air announced that its direct budget flights between Riyadh and Calicut would start from April 1.        
	In the days other incident at Mumbai airport, Bruno DSouza, travelling from Hong Kong to Mumbai on a Jet flight, was arrested in the early hours.        
	We had received a complaint stating DSouza had misbehaved with a female cabin crew member of Jet Airways on the flight. We later sent him to a hospital for a medical check-up to ascertain if he was under the influence of alcohol, said deputy commissioner Amitabh Gupta, who had handled a similar case involving Churchill Brothers players earlier this week.        
	DSouza has been booked for using criminal force against a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty, and for lewd behaviour intended to insult a womans modesty.         
	Like the footballers, he was released on bail against a bond of Rs 5,000 since both offences are bailable.

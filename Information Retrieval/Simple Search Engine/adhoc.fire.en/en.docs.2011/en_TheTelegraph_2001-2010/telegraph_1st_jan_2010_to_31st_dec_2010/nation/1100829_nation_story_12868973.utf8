  - Wish to quiz Indian duo        NASIR JAFFRY                          Ajmal Kasab                                        
	Islamabad, Aug. 28: Pakistan today proposed sending a judicial commission to India to quiz officials who were associated with the interrogation of Ajmal Kasab, the lone 26/11 gunman captured alive.        
	I will discuss this proposal with my Indian counterpart, interior minister Rehman Malik told reporters in Islamabad amid reports that Delhi had rejected Islamabads request to interview two Indian officials through videoconferencing.        
	Pakistans high commissioner to India Shahid Malik, who arrived in Islamabad on Friday for meetings with officials in the interior and foreign ministries, was also present during the ministers interaction with the media.        
	Interior minister Rehman Malik said the new proposal would lead to considerable progress in the ongoing probe against those involved in the November 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed nearly 170 people.        
	We have proposed formation of a judicial commission, which will visit India and quiz an Indian police official and a magistrate who interrogated Kasab and recorded his statement, he added.        
	The comment came on a day Pakistans Federal Investigation Agency told an anti-terror court trying seven suspects named by India that Delhi had rejected Islamabads proposal to interview the two Indian officials through videoconferencing.         
	India, the FIA said during the in-camera trial in Rawalpindi, had informed Pakistan that it was simply not possible because a trial court has already handed down capital punishment to Kasab.        
	The court  which had declared Kasab a proclaimed offender and directed the interior ministry to ensure availability of the two Indian officials who interrogated and recorded the gunmans statement  later adjourned the hearing till September 18.        
	A senior government official told The Telegraph he hoped India would come up with a positive response to Pakistans proposal.        
	We hope India will respond positively to this new proposal, which shows our commitment and sincerity in expediting the trial process of seven suspects in Pakistan, the official said.        
	The official, who didnt want to be named, said that Shahid Malik, who met Rehman Malik late on Friday, had revealed that Pakistan had handed over a new dossier to India seeking additional information about David Headley, a suspect under arrest in the US.        
	Headley, the US-born son of a former Pakistani diplomat, has pleaded guilty to scouting the hotels and other sites in Mumbai that were attacked during the 26/11 siege.        
	Interior ministry officials claimed they had made some progress since Malik recently ordered a probe into Headleys revelations.

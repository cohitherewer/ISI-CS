The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Stands empty, SOS to benches
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Stands empty, SOS to benches
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Cyclists ride past empty seats at the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi on Tuesday. (Reuters)                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: The Commonwealth Games Organising Committee has turned to Delhi schools for help to fill up stadiums and ferry athletes and officials.         
	The stands have been mostly empty in the first two days  only some volunteers and team support staff were there to see Indian shooters Abhinav Bindra and Gagan Narang win gold today.         
	We have not done the complete audit of all the venues. The organising committee is conscious of the situation. It is their concern how these venues are filled. We like to see spectator seats are filled, Commonwealth Games Federation chief Mike Fennell said at a news conference today.         
	The Suresh Kalmadi-led committee is hoping to get students of Delhi schools, which are closed for the duration of the Games, to fill the stands. Committee officials said they would seek the help of the state government, which runs over 1,000 schools, and promised the children free entry. Public schools in Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad have also been contacted.         
	We are working on that (providing free tickets to school children). Steps are being taken in this direction. We are also planning to get in people from the lower strata of the society, Kalmadi said.         
	The organisers are planning to issue cheaper tickets and have opened ticket counters outside venues. So far, tickets were being sold from select branches of Central Bank of India, retail outlets of a two-wheeler manufacturer and a fast food chain. They have been priced between Rs 50 and Rs 1,000, depending on the event. Closing ceremony tickets, which have seen good sales after the success of the opening ceremony, are priced between Rs 750 and Rs 50,000.         
	Organising committee secretary-general Lalit Bhanot said 40 ticket counters have been opened across the city. Around 50 per cent of the tickets have been sold, he said.         
	Kalmadi put the number of tickets sold at six lakh. At some venues, the audience number was good. Swimming attracted a lot of crowd. Now we are fully ready. As of today, things are all right. We have set up ticket box offices in all the stadia, he said. There were big queues yesterday, even up to a mile.         
	That mile-long queues  mostly for tickets to the October 14 closing ceremony  also told a story of mismanagement probably missed Kalmadis attention.         
	But wrestling and boxing have been a hit. An almost packed Talkatora stadium cheered Indian boxers, who won many bouts and acknowledged the crowds support.         
	Commonwealth Championships gold medallist Amandeep, who won his bout today, said the crowd made it all the more easy for me. It was amazing to fight in front of such supportive spectators.         
	Pakistani boxer, 19-year-old Haroon Iqbal, also got huge cheers from the spectators. I have never fought in an atmosphere like this. It is simply out of the world. Thank you so much, India. I wasnt expecting this, he said after his victory in the 52kg category.         
	For the rest, it has been mostly empty stands.         
	The Dr Karni Singh shooting range, where Bindra and Narang won the gold, is on Delhis outskirts. But several other stadiums in the heart of the city, such as the gymnastics venue at the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex, had few spectators. The stands were empty at the squash, sevens rugby and lawn bowls events, and even at the R.K. Khanna Tennis Stadium where Indian players were competing. Badminton, which features a strong Indian team, could not pull crowds either.         
	Delhi schools have been asked for support not just with crowds but also with drivers. The majority of the 500 drivers that the organising committee hired either dont know the citys roads or have quit within days of collecting their fancy uniforms. Sources said most had been hired not from Delhi but from Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh and had no previous experience of driving on the capitals roads.         
	One of these new recruits had lost his way while fetching Fennell from the airport.         
	A senior committee official said many of the public schools have agreed to the request to lend their bus drivers to transport the athletes and officials.

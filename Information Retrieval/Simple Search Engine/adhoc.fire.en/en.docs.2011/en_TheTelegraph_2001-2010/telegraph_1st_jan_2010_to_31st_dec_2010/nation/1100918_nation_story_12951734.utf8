The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangh tilts to legal route on temple
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sangh tilts to legal route on temple
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: The RSS and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad have welcomed the rejection of a petition to defer the September 24 verdict on the Ayodhya title suit by the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court.         
	The response marked a change in their known stand that had so far called for an out-of-court settlement through talks or by enacting a law in Parliament to hand over the disputed site to Hindus to build a Ram temple.        
	This is the first time the Sangh parivar has stressed the primacy of legal adjudication in an issue they always claimed was beyond the jurisidiction of law because it was a matter of religious faith.         
	The more militant elements in the VHP and the Bajrang Dal had declared that no matter who the court ruled in favour of, Hindus had a natural entitlement to the site of the demolished Babri mosque because it was Ramas birth-place.        
	RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav said: The court did the right thing because the petition was a ploy to delay the judgment. It was uncalled for.        
	VHP spokesperson Prakash Sharma said judges had upheld the prestige and integrity of the judiciary by turning down the petition. He questioned the locus standi of the plaintiff, Ram Chandra Tripathi, and claimed: All these years, he never once appeared for the hearings. Suddenly, how come he wants an out-of-court settlement? He is out to cheat the society and the system.        
	Sharma welcomed the courts decision to levy a hefty fine on the petitioner. This is a lesson for those who create legal hurdles, he said.

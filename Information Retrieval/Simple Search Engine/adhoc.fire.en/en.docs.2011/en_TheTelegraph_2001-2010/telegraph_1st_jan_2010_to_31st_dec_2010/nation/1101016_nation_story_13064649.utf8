The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CHEERS AND JEERS: WHO GETS WHAT
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CHEERS AND JEERS: WHO GETS WHAT

	Winners        
	Athletes        
	The athletes soldiered on, braving the blizzard of doomsday predictions and sniggers. The Indians came up with their best-ever Commonwealth Games performance. Our unfancied ladies rocked where they were foretold many ravages  in the track and field arena. The foreigners, too, chipped in with their cheer. When some news reports said cyclists were being made to pedal in extreme weather, Australian bronze medallist Chloe Hosking revealed that she often rode in 40 degrees Celsius back home or in sleet in Europe. This is actually quite enjoyable, she said        
	Volunteers        
	Over 20,000 volunteers helped accomplish the Games. The Uncle generation will have to eat its words: the volunteers  sourced from the so-called Generation Me in their 20s  were unpaid and more than willing. I knew it would be a success despite the negative reports. We learnt a lot, said volunteer Vikas Bhalla, 23, who got his entire extended family of over a dozen to buy tickets to watch the closing ceremony        
	Spectators        
	Many  its difficult to put a figure  of the 60,000 spectators at the opening and         
	closing ceremonies were complimentary pass holders. Yet, fears of a rent-a-crowd event were allayed when jeers went up for Suresh Kalmadi. Booing is not exactly a         
	sign of good manners but few could suppress a chuckle. Among those who could not hep giggling: Sonia Gandhi and Gursharan Kaur. The crowd had a mind of its own and it did fill the stadium with raw and renewed energy        
	Security        
	Hats off to the men and women who played protectors. Delhis cops, infamous for being rude, were mostly polite and courteous. Hundreds of smartly turned-out policewomen managed crowds and traffic efficiently. Traffic-related fatalities were at a low. Some         
	attributed the change to a decision to widen the catchment area for recruits beyond Delhis immediate neighbourhood        
	Delhi delight        
	Most residents couldnt recognise their city this past fortnight. The landscape looked nicer, helped in great measure by a good monsoon. The beggars couldnt be seen (having been temporarily banished), nor could the Blueline buses that sow death and chaos on Delhis roads but are also the preferred mode of transport for lakhs of         
	workers. Traffic was definitely better. Delhis ugly side was covered with hundreds of hoardings. But in certain aspects, Delhi lost out too (see Losers)        
	Sonia and Rahul        
	The family led by example, not just in opting for the spectator stands but also in         
	showing an interest in a variety of events. Rahul frequented boxing and wrestling         
	venues while Sonia opted for field hockey. The First Lady of the UPA was punching the air, grinning ear to ear as India beat Pakistan; even a Congress victory hasnt brought such happy rush of blood to her. Priyankas children were seen at the         
	swimming venue, sitting almost unnoticed with their friends among other spectators        
	Sheila Dikshit        
	She wasnt shown nearly so often on the giant screens at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium after the opening ceremony. Was that deliberate? Dikshit was a         
	show-stealer during the opening, getting huge rounds of applause. Whatever her political future, Sheila continues to be the favourite auntie of Delhis middle class. However, any inquiry into the mess in the run-up to the Games will find it difficult to gloss over the Delhi governments ineptitude        
	losers        
	Closing ceremony        
	Had its moments but fizzled out into a mishmash of Republic Day parade,        
	Bollywood sing-song and tech wizardry. Probably, the splendid opening ceremony had raised unrealistic expectations. Shorn of its glittering underbelly, the aerostat, the star of the opening ceremony, looked like a peeled and hollowed-out egg. But those who conceived the ceremony had limited time on their hands to have         
	rehearsals because construction at the stadium wasnt complete. The opening         
	ceremony took priority, the closing ceremony suffered. A planned Mexican wave at the start did not get off the stands        
	Shera        
	The Games mascot was supposed to rival Appu, the endearing baby elephant of the Delhi Asian Games of 1982. But in Delhi, Shera was as difficult to sight as the frequently poached Indian tiger. Appu was also helped by the fact that there was a real elephant calf by that name which entertained the crowd with its antics. It would have been impossible  and ill-advised  to repeat the spectacle with a live tiger. In this age of ubiquitous soft toys, Shera failed to catch peoples imagination, partly because of poor marketing. Shera mementoes such as coffee mugs and key chains were hard to find, most having been purloined by the capitals freebie-seeking VIP class        
	Delhi difficult        
	The winner is a loser on some counts. What hurt the most was the eviction of         
	vendors  Delhis lifeline. Buying vegetables and cigarettes had never been as difficult. It is just as well for the Congress government that the Assembly elections are three years away. Its voter base comprises these very vendors and labourers who live in Delhis unauthorised colonies and who were rudely packed off farther afield in order to put a shine on the capital        
	Suresh Kalmadi        
	Kalmadi can be termed a winner as well as a loser. His bloopers  from Prince Diana to serial mix-ups of names  are now part of the Commonwealth Games lore. So are the dime-a-dozen jokes that the scandals generated. But he did         
	deliver the Games, albeit with a hard and very public nudge from the Prime         
	Minister. Kalmadi named nearly everybody who probably could help him save his job, even thanking Sonia and Rahul for coming to watch our athletes perform and sitting in the stands rather than VIP galleries to boost their morale as if it was his idea in the first place. DD cameras caught Sonia grimacing. Now his fate is tied to how the government will proceed with its probe into the charges of corruptionand mismanagement       Compiled by Archis Mohan and our bureau

  -Airline employees at Mamata door
          J.P. YADAV                               
	New Delhi, June 10: Poor Left, there is no peace in the sky either.        
	Air India employees usually identified with the Left today called on Mamata Banerjee to air their grievances in another sign that the Trinamul Congress leader is carving a niche for herself as an anti-establishment force  a label the CPM once sported with pride.        
	Mamata lent a patient hearing to the delegation of Air India Employees Association at her Rail Bhavan office, sparing around 45 minutes.        
	Sources said the airline employees were demanding the de-merger of Indian Airlines and Air India, castigating civil aviation minister Praful Patel for good measure.         
	Madam heard us patiently and assured us that she would take up our cause with the government, one of the members of the delegation said. The meeting was fixed by Trinamul minister Dinesh Trivedi, known for his keen interest in aviation matters.         
	Asked about the meeting, Mamata said: I cannot stop anybody from meeting me Safety and security of air passengers can only be ensured when the employees are happy.        
	Another of her pet themes  block oil price hike  also seemed to have met with success for the time being. The issue is not there right now. I will react when it comes up, Mamata said in reply to a question on the Centres move to raise prices of petroleum products.         
	Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee was scheduled to hold discussions with Mamata before todays cabinet meeting to fix the dates for the next session of the empowered group of ministers on fuel prices.        
	He, however, refrained from holding discussions with Mamata, following her clear opposition to the move. The issue (fuel price hike) was not discussed, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni said.         
	Trinamul sources claimed that the fuel price hike had been shelved for the time being after their leader put her foot down and made it clear that any increase in prices was unacceptable to her. The government is now looking for other options. The fuel price rise has been put off for the time being, a Trinamul leader said.        
	Some sources saw the Mamata effect on another postponement but it is not clear if she was responsible at all on this count.        
	Sources said the cabinet committee on economic affairs was scheduled to discuss a proposal for divestment in Coal India Ltd and Hindustan Copper Ltd but it was not taken up. It was learnt that the two issues were on the agenda but were not discussed.         
	Global economic conditions may have played a role but some attributed the omission to Mamatas known opposition to divestment, especially since Coal India is headquartered in Calcutta.        
	Asked, Mamata said: I dont know. It was not there in the cabinet.        
	She also frowned on the media for pestering her with questions she cannot answer as a member of the cabinet.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Patil nod to Lalli suspension
                                      B.S. Lalli    
	New Delhi, Dec. 21 (PTI): President Pratibha Patil tonight cleared the order of suspension of Prasar Bharati chief B.S. Lalli.        
	The letter recommending his suspension was sent by the information and broadcasting ministry to the Prime Ministers Office which forwarded it to the President for her assent.        
	According to the Prasar Bharati Act, its chairman or a member can only be removed by an order of the President on the ground of misbehaviour after the Supreme Court holds an inquiry..        
	Pending inquiry, the CEO can be placed under suspension as per provisions of the Act.        
	Lalli, a 1971-batch IAS officer, had been in the eye of a storm over allegations of irregularities in the public broadcasting body which included the controversial decision to award contract for broadcast of the recently concluded Commonwealth Games to a UK-based firm, SIS Live.        
	The ministrys move recommending Lallis suspension came a week after President Patil gave her assent to a Supreme Court inquiry into the alleged irregularities in Prasar Bharati.

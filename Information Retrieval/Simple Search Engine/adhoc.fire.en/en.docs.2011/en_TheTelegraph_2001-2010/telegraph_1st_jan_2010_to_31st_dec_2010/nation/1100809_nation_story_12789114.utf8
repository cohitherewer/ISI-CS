The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tilting vessel spills oil, Mumbai shores on alert
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tilting vessel spills oil, Mumbai shores on alert
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The MSC Chitra, which collided with another cargo ship on Saturday, tilted further on Sunday                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 8: The oil spill off Mumbai coast spread today, prompting an alert about the slick possibly reaching the city shoreline although it was moving in the opposite direction this evening.        
	MSC Chitra, the cargo ship that collided with another, four to five nautical miles (4.6 to 5.8 miles) off the shore yesterday, continued to spill oil as the coast guard battled the emergency with six vessels and two aircraft.        
	The slick is spread 1.5 to 2 miles around the ship, aground off the Gateway of India coast, and is still four to five miles from Colaba point, the tip of Mumbai. Coast guard officials said the spill was unlikely to reach the citys public places like Girgaon Chowpatty immediately though everything depended on the wind and tides.        
	The situation worsened when Chitra tilted further today, dropping about 200 containers that created a navigational risk for the coast guard ships engaged in Operation Chitra. A few of the containers were towed away, officials said, but traffic in the city harbour was suspended.        
	Defence spokesperson Capt Manohar Nambiar told The Telegraph the rocky sea, poor weather and tidal conditions had made the operation difficult. Containment and recovery of the spilled oil in the current position is not feasible because of these factors, he said.        
	Officials are yet to locate the point of leak, PTI said.        
	Fearing that the spill could reach Mumbais shores, the state pollution control board and the Maharashtra Maritime Board have formed quick-response teams. Volunteers of the Bombay Natural History Society have also been asked to be ready for a shore clean-up if necessary, officials said.        
	Coast guard officials said the spill was moving towards the Mandwa and Uran coasts in Raigad district. It had been sighted about 1.5 nautical miles (1.8 miles) from the Mandwa coast in the morning.        
	The Panama-flagged Chitra had collided with MV Khalija-3 around 9.50am yesterday after leaving Jawaharlal Nehru Port. Thirty-three crew members were rescued.        
	This morning, the coast guard pressed five additional ships  Sankalpa, Amrit Kaur, Subhadra Kumari, Kamla Devi and C-145  into service to assist AOPV Sangram, deployed yesterday. It also used CG Helo and Dornier aircraft to spray dispersants  clean-up chemicals  from the air.        
	The dispersants helped clear isolated oil patches extending to the oil jetty off Butcher Island and similar patches sighted near Elephanta Island, officials said.        
	Over 150 litres of oil spill dispersants have been sprayed on the patches. Smaller coast guard ships have been churning down the oil sheen for weathering and emulsification (chemical process that breaks down the large fat globules in oil), Capt Nambiar said.        
	PTI quoted police to say an FIR had been registered against the crew of both vessels under the Indian Penal Code and the Environment Protection Act. The police said they intended to question the crew in a day or two.        
	The spill has virtually halted all fishing on the coast. Fishing associations have been asked to avoid fishing completely till the spill effect is minimised, a coast guard official said.        
	Built in 1980, the 234m, 38,485-tonne Chitra was bound for Mundra port. The vessel had 2,652 tonnes of fuel apart from a cargo of 283.8 tonnes of diesel and 88,040 litres of lub oil, a coast guard official said.        
	Khalija-3, carrying the St Kitts and St Nevis flag, had been grounded since July 19. But it was sailing towards Jawaharlal Nehru Port with a cargo of 30,000 tonnes of steel coils yesterday when the collision happened, officials said.

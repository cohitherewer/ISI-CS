The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Business before fun for Chinese
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Business before fun for Chinese
          CITHARA PAUL                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: That Chinese Premier Wen Jiabaos entourage includes some 400 business leaders  far more than the number that accompanied Barack Obama or Nicolas Sarkozy  may not be accidental.        
	For the Chinese, an India trip means business before leisure.        
	A survey by the Indian tourism ministry shows that more Chinese, compared with other foreign visitors, come with business and professional purposes. Of the 96,997 Chinese who came to India in 2009, as many as 50.4 per cent said business was their priority.        
	Another 41.5 per cent said they had come on vacation and were looking for recreation, while the remaining 4.1 per cent had come to visit friends and relatives.        
	Visitors from all other countries listed leisure, holidaying, recreation, or visiting friends and relatives as their priority.        
	This is in keeping with the history of Chinese tourism to India, for Faxian (Fa-Hien) and Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang) too came on business  to learn about Buddhism and acquire Buddhist texts  in the fifth and seventh centuries.        
	So its no surprise that the Chinese came to India round the year in 2009 regardless of the weather, whereas visitors from other countries opted for the cooler months from November to February.        
	Also, the Chinese had the highest proportion of males (72.6 per cent) among the visitors. Males dominated among the visitors from other countries too, except Russia.        
	One interesting aspect of the Chinese visits is the preference shown to Calcutta airport, with 14.4 per cent of them getting off there first. In this they were behind only the Bangladeshis, with all the rest favouring Delhi, Mumbai or Bangalore. A high proportion of Nepalese too favoured Calcutta, but not those from Malaysia or Singapore despite coming from the east.        
	The Chinese were the youngest too, with the dominant age group being 25-34 (37.8 per cent), followed by those aged between 35 and 44 (29.8 per cent). For most other countries, the dominant age group was 45-55.        
	The arrivals from China also provide a reflection on India-China relations over the years: only 1,371 arrived in 1981 but the numbers have grown to near one lakh now. Last year, however, the numbers from China fell a little but this was true of most other countries too  a fallout of the global economic slowdown.        
	The survey puts the Chinese at 12th position among the tourism-generating markets for India, with a 1.90 per cent share in total arrivals. America sent the highest number of tourists, followed by Britain, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Canada, France, Germany, Australia, Malaysia, Japan, Russia, China, Nepal, Singapore and Italy.

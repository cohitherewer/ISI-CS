	New Delhi, July 7 (PTI): The government today gave a clean chit to a senior diplomat, facing charges of enslaving her domestic help.        
	Shanti Gurung, the maid, had filed a lawsuit in a US court against Neena Malhotra.         
	Ministry of external affairs (MEA) sources said Gurung had disappeared from the diplomats New York home a day before they were to return to India. Malhotra, now director (south) in the MEA, had hired Gurung as a domestic help when she was posted in the Indian consulate in New York in 2006.        
	Gurung, then 19, had visited the US embassy in New Delhi to procure a visa after agreeing to work for Malhotra, the sources said.        
	According to MEA sources, since the diplomat was at work through out the day, Gurung had a run of the house. She had keys of the premises and even used to go out shopping on her own, they said.        
	When Malhotra was later posted in India, Gurung had expressed the desire to stay back in New York and requested her employers to refer her to other Indians in the area, which was agreed upon, the sources said.        
	Since the domestic help held an official passport and a visa only for a specified period, Malhotra asked her to travel to India last July and return to the US after getting the necessary documents.        
	However, a day before Malhotra was to leave for India Gurung did a vanishing act only to surface a year later to level the allegations.         
	Malhotra had informed the Indian consulate in New York and US authorities about Gurungs disappearance and got her official passport cancelled, the sources said.        
	Last week, Gurung claimed the Malhotras had tricked her into accompanying them to America in March 2006 with the promise of Rs 5,000 a month and a raise every six months.        
	In the law suit, Gurung claimed she was forced to sleep on the floor of their apartment and made to do household chores 16 hours a day often until 3am following frequent parties.

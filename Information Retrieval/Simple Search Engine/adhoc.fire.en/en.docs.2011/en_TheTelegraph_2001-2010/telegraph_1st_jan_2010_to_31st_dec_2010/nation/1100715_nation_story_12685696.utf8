The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 2 fishermen die in Andhra land row
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      2 fishermen die in Andhra land row
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                        
	Hyderabad, July 14: Over 2,000 Andhra fisherfolk today locked horns with police at the site of an upcoming thermal power plant, leading to police firing in which two persons lost their lives.        
	Armed with stones, sticks and axes, the men and women, from 25 fishing villages in Srikakulam district, converged at the spot where the foundation stone was to be laid this morning and ran amok, the police said. The cops wielded lathis and opened fire to disperse the protesters, leading to the deaths.        
	The fisherfolk have been agitating against the 2,650 MW power plant being set up by the Nagarjuna Construction Company outside Sompeta town, about 650km south-east of Hyderabad. Fearing the loss of their livelihoods, they have been going on hunger strike in the area over the last few months, but descended on the plant site only today.        
	Enraged at the police action, the group entered Sompeta town and staged a sit-in outside the Nagarjuna company offices. They also gheraoed the police station and the district collectors office, damaged standing vehicles and gathered around the local hospital where about 60 injured fishermen were admitted.         
	The dead persons have been identified as Krishnamurthy and Mohan Rao. One died of bullet wounds and the other of head injuries. Three others with bullet wounds are critical. Unofficial sources said four persons had died.        
	Andhra home minister Sabita Indra Reddy said the situation in Sompeta was still tense. She has directed police reinforcements in the area after mobs attacked a circle inspector and pelted five policemen with stones. They also demolished temporary shelters at the plant site.        
	The plant is coming up on land belonging to the fisherfolk that was bought by the state government. Although they were adequately compensated, the fisherfolk have been saying that they did not want to part with their land.        
	Environmentalists have been opposing the plant because of its location in an ecologically critical wetland area. Local NGOs have been taking the lead in helping the fisherfolk stage protests. They claim the plant would not only threaten fisherfolks livelihoods, it would violate coastal zone regulations. A civil rights activist, E.A.S Sharma, said it would endanger bird sanctuaries at Bhavanapadu, Naidupalli and Kakarlapalli.        
	Another local leader, Purushottam Rao, said since the thermal plant site was just 6km from the sea, it would affect about 25 fish tanks on which the livelihood of nearly 350 fishing families depended. Besides, coal dust from the plant would pollute drinking water sources.        
	We are scared our children will fall ill once the plant comes up, said Parvatamma, a fishermans wife.        
	A Nagarjuna company spokesperson said they had not anticipated trouble as they had all requisite clearances for land acquisition and from the environment ministry.        
	This seems to be the handiwork of some miscreants who seem to be bent on creating trouble, he said.        
	The state human rights commission has asked the government to withdraw the police forces from Sompeta immediately.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 24: The computerised Common Admission Test for admissions to the IIMs will this year be spread across more days and at fewer centres than last year to avoid a repeat of glitches that plagued the 2009 examination.         
	Test service provider Prometric today announced in a statement that the CAT this year will be held over a longer testing window which will provide candidates more dates to pick from for their test.         
	The test will also be conducted at fewer test centres and Prometric will prepare longer on arrangements at each centre than last year, the statement said.         
	The computerised CAT was conducted for the first time last year initially over a period of 10 days, which was extended by a day after students faced technical glitches at several testing centres.         
	Amid an outcry from students over their inability to attempt the test fairly, the IIMs conducted a computerised retest at the end of January for about 8,000 candidates identified as adversely affected by the glitches the first time.         
	The glitches raised concerns over whether the IIMs and Prometric were prepared enough for a test of this scale  over 3 lakh students appeared last year.        
	As revealed by The Telegraph on May 16 and 17 this year, the IIMs awarded the contract for the computerised CAT to Prometric despite their own reservations, and signed away rights to hold the firm liable for the glitches that ravaged the CAT.        
	The master service agreement between the IIMs and Prometric revealed that the institutes themselves may have had to pay for compensation claims made by affected students against Prometric.

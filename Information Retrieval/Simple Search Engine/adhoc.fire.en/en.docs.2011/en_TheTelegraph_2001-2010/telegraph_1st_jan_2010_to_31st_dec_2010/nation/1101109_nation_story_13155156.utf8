                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Comrade protest: dont clap for Obama
          J.P. YADAV                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: Prakash Karat came, spoke, gave TV bites and left.        
	Most other senior leaders who had joined the Left protest outside Jantar Mantar against imperialist US policies followed suit.        
	After the leaders were gone, the cadres held on for some time shouting slogans like Jo America ka yaar hai, woh desh ka gaddar hai (any friend of America is a traitor) and then dispersed.        
	Some Left MPs spotted at the meeting drove away after Karat to prepare for Obamas Parliament address in the evening.        
	Left MPs would listen to the US President in Parliament, Karat said, and Obama would have to listen to the peoples voice they represented.         
	In the past 10 years the US has succeeded in getting India in its alliance. This is not in the interest of the country, the CPM general secretary declared and warned the Prime Minister not to become a military ally of the US.        
	As he spoke, Obama was busy holding talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at Hyderabad House and Left MPs outside Jantar Mantar were busy chatting among themselves or giving TV bites.        
	If Americas imperialist policies havent changed under Obama, then why are we not boycotting his Parliament speech like we did with Clinton and Bush? a Left activist wondered.        
	CPM leader Hannan Mollah said: He is an Afro-American President. We dont want to be seen insulting a Black.         
	He is Barack Hussain Obama, another activist quipped, pointing out that the CPM needs the support of Muslims in Bengal.        
	Karat spoke after CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan. While he was waiting for his turn, an SUCI procession also against the US passed from the other side. The CPM boss turned, saw the procession, inquired about it and quickly withdrew his gaze.         
	In Parliament, when other MPs were giving Obama a thunderous applause, the Left MPs did not clap as a mark of protest.

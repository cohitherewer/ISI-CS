	Shimla, Aug. 31: Police have questioned archery gold-medallist Saklang Dorje for his alleged role in the smuggling of red sanders wood to China.        
	Dorje, member of the Indian team that won the 1989 Asian Archery Cup in Beijing, had allegedly rented his truck to the smugglers to ferry the wood from Shegu village to Kaurik.        
	The police seized the trucks, carrying 12 tonnes of the wood, at Kaurik in Lahaul and Spiti district, 425km from here and close to the China border. The wood was being brought in from Delhi.        
	Lahaul and Spiti superintendent of police S.R. Rana said four smugglers had been arrested and Dorje too could be arrested if found involved. The role of Dorje in the smuggling is being probed.

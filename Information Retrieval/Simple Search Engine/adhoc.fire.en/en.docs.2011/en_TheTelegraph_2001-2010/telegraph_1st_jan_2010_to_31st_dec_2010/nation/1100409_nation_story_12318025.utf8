	Kochi, April 8 (PTI): Kerala High Court today told the state government and its institutions not to participate financially or otherwise in a firm modelled on the lines of an Islamic bank.         
	The Kerala state and institutions controlled by it will desist from participating financially or otherwise with the Kochi-based Al Barakah Financial Services Ltd, a division bench said in its interim order.         
	The court, however, permitted the company to carry on with its proposed activities.         
	The state-owned Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation was to invest about Rs 1.10 crore in the new company, with plans to raise an initial capital of Rs 500 crore from NRIs and Indian business houses.

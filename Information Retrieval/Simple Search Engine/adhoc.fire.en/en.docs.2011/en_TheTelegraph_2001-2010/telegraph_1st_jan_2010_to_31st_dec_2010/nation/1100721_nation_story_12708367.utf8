The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Allies close ranks on Mamata
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Allies close ranks on Mamata
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 20: The Congress and the Trinamul today walked out of the Assembly together over a Left MLAs demand for Mamata Banerjees resignation over yesterdays accident, despite the CPMs efforts to drive a wedge between the allies.        
	The Congress and Trinamul accused Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim of misusing the Assembly by allowing the Left members to speak on the accident after question hour. The Speaker acted like a leader from Alimuddin Street. He has desecrated the sanctity of the House. We are shocked and hurt, leader of the Opposition, the Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee, said shortly after the walkout.        
	During question hour, while the Congress MLAs were in the House, Trinamul MLAs were outside boycotting the proceedings. But they walked in to protest after hearing the RSPs Tapan Hore demand Mamatas resignation. Then, the two allies walked out together.        
	The CPMs Rabin Mondol claimed people had raised slogans demanding Mamatas resignation when she visited Sainthia yesterday.        
	State Congress chief Manas Bhuniya said the CPM was only interested in Mamatas resignation. We knew communists did not believe in parliamentary democracy. But the ugly face of communists we saw today was too much to bear, said Bhuniya. He urged Mamata to take care. The series of accidents in Bengal, he added, raises doubts of possible conspiracy or sabotage.

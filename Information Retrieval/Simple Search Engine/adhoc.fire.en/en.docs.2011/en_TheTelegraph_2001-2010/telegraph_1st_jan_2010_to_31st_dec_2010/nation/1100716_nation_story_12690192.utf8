	New Delhi, July 15: The Centre will do away with discretionary powers that allow an arms licence to be issued even before the police verification report on the applicants antecedents is submitted.        
	The change, to be brought about through an amendment bill cleared by the Union cabinet today, aims to prevent people with criminal backgrounds from getting arms licences.        
	The proposed amendments to the Arms Act of 1959 specify a 60-day deadline for the police verification report to be handed to the licensing authority.        
	The cabinet approved the introduction of the Arms (Amendment) Bill, 2010, in Parliament, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni said. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh chaired the cabinet meeting.        
	In its present form, the act does not specify the time within which police need to file the verification report. The authorities often invoke their discretionary powers  granted under Section 13 (2A) of the act  and issue a licence in the absence of the report.         
	The licensing authority is required to call for a report from the officer in-charge of the police station nearest to the place of residence of the person who has applied for the licence. The officer is required to send his report within the prescribed time  a term that was not specified and which the cabinet has now fixed at 60 days.        
	The ambiguity in the law had left scope for misuse of the discretion, with several instances of arms licences issued to people with criminal antecedents.        
	The tightening was prompted in part by railway minister Mamata Banerjee, who pointed out at the meeting that arms were being brought into the country by infiltrators. Farooq Abdullah, the minister for new and renewable energy, highlighted the security threat from the presence of unlicensed arms in his home state Jammu and Kashmir.        
	It has been decided to delete the proviso to Section 13(2A) of the Arms Act, 1959, and prescribe a period of 60 days for the police authorities to send their reports, Soni said.

	New Delhi, May 11 (PTI): The Union environment ministry today put on hold the controversial Rs 15,000-crore Vedanta University project in Orissa following complaints of irregularities against its promoter, the Anil Agarwal Foundation.        
	The move comes within a month of the ministrys conditional clearance to the project. Agarwal, the foundations head, is an NRI billionaire and chairperson of Britains Vedanta Resources.        
	The foundation denied having flouted any of the conditions and said the allegations were made by vested interests.         
	We are yet to start construction, so where is the question of violation. We are sure to get the go-ahead,said Ajit Samal, Vedanta groups Orissa project vice-president.        
	The multi-disciplinary university was planned along the Puri-Konark highway over 6,892 acres, of which 4,000 acres are to be transferred by the Orissa government to the foundation.        
	In its April 16 clearance, the ministry had banned the foundation from drawing ground water, restricting local fishing and undertaking construction in the coastal regulation zone (CRZ). These were among the 50 conditions imposed, which also included inviting public objections to the project.        
	However, in its order issued today, the ministry said it had received information alleging inter alia irregularities, illegal, unethical and unlawful deeds by the foundation.         
	Also, serious objections raised during (an) Orissa Coastal Zone Management Authority (OCZMA) meeting had not been appropriately considered in granting the (previous) clearance, the order said.        
	Samal wondered how the ministry could cite this ground now.         
	By stating that OCZMA observations were not followed, the ministry is challenging its own order, he said.

          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                      President Pratibha Patil on Saturday pays tribute to the Indians who died in the Taliban attack in Kabul. (PTI)                          
	Feb. 27: Afghan President Hamid Karzai called Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today to express regret over the deaths of at least six Indians in a Taliban suicide attack in Kabul and New Delhi sent an air force jet to repatriate the bodies.        
	Delhi appeared to be treading with caution against the backdrop of the resumption of talks with Pakistan, desisting from blaming the usual suspects in haste.        
	Singh conveyed Indias outrage over Fridays assault that killed at least 16 people in all, and requested Karzai to ensure full security for Indian nationals in Afghanistan, a statement from the Prime Ministers Office said.        
	The statement said Karzai had promised a full investigation into the attack, which targeted an area of residential hotels in the Afghan capital rented by Indian Embassy workers and other foreigners. An Italian diplomat and a French filmmaker also died.         
	The 26/11-style rampage followed attacks on Indias Embassy in Kabul in July 2008 and October 2009.        
	The six Indians who died were Major Dr Laishram Jyotin Singh of the Army Medical Corps, Major Deepak Yadav of the Army Education Corps, engineer Bhola Ram, tabla player Nawab Khan, Kandahar consulate staffer Nitish Chibber and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) constable Roshan Lal.        
	The bodies of the six were flown to Delhi this evening. Eight other Indians who were injured in the terror strike were also brought to the city in the plane.        
	President Pratibha Patil, who was returning from Pune, offered tributes to the victims at the Palam technical area where the aircraft had landed. She also spoke to the relatives of the victims.        
	A Taliban spokesperson claimed responsibility for Fridays attack. He did not specifically name India as the target. But the militia has long opposed Indias involvement in Afghanistan and its ties to the Northern Alliance, which had helped the US oust the Taliban regime in 2001.        
	This attack specifically targeted Indian co-operation experts and workers, those who are serving the Afghan people and earning goodwill for India, Indian ambassador to Afghanistan Jayant Prasad said. Its clearly the handiwork of those who oppose our presence in Afghanistan.        
	 Prasad refused to point the finger specifically at Pakistan or say whether it would damage Pakistan-India talks that resumed Thursday after a 15-month hiatus.        
	India has accused a Pakistani spy agency of involvement in the July 2008 embassy attack, and Pakistani militants waged the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai, that had prompted Delhi to pull out of the peace dialogue.        
	Thats too much to speculate, Prasad said of the possibility that Fridays attack could derail talks. It depends on where the precise provenance of the attack is. We are still looking at that.

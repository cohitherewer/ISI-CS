The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bitter end to laddoo bite with old Bengal buddy 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bitter end to laddoo bite with old Bengal buddy 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                      Ravi Inder Singh                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: Little did the Union home ministry director realise he was walking into a trap when he set about photocopying a document in his office.        
	Hidden cameras and bugs were keeping tabs on Ravi Inder Singh, 43, who was detained yesterday and arrested tonight on the charge of leaking sensitive information of commercial value.         
	His alleged contact Vinit Kumar, a well-to-do businessman and old friend from Bengal, too was arrested today.        
	Singh, a 1994-batch Bengal cadre officer, and Vinit apparently referred to the information as prasad and laddoos during phone conversations. Their meetings took place at a luxury hotel in Delhi.        
	Sources said Vinit, who has stakes in a multi-crore food-processing company, was the broker in the whole business. He had allegedly approached Singh to leak information that could yield rich dividends for the two of them and a telecom company.        
	Officials would not identify the company. Singh was handling the BlackBerry security issue.        
	Home ministry mandarins smelt a rat when the telecom company complained that a broker was asking for crores of rupees for information. From that moment, the ministrys own officials came under the scanner. Almost everyones phone (in the ministry) was put under surveillance, a source said.        
	Phone intercepts indicated Singh and Vinit used a code language, an official said. Vinit would ask, Laddoo de raha hai? We are trying to find out what laddoo means.        
	Singh apparently did not talk to Vinit from his own number but used four different SIM cards given by the corporate broker. The sleuths tapped all five numbers and Vinits mobile as well.        
	A trap was laid for the director. His superiors first held back a vital file from him and then sent it to him, presumably so that he would be pressed for time to act.        
	Sources said Singh was filmed secretly as he went through the document and stamped and photocopied it. He then allegedly left the office in his official car to deliver the copies to his contact at the luxury hotel.        
	Although no money exchanged hands, telephone intercepts suggest the broker would have made crores, a source said.        
	The next step is (Singhs) suspension. Action will be taken against him, a government official said. Singh has been booked on criminal conspiracy and corruption charges.        
	The developments have raised concern about foreign moles, though officials say Singh did not spill any security secrets.

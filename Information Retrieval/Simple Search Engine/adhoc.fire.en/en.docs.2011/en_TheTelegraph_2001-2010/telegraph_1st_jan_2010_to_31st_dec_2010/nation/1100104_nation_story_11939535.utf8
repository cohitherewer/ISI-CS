The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US leash on Hyderabad travel
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US leash on Hyderabad travel
          K.P. NAYAR                                             
	Washington, Jan. 3: Discreetly but firmly, the US has begun acting beyond statements in retaliation for the haphazard and arbitrary implementation of visa rules for Americans arriving on visits to India.        
	A warden message sent by email to Americans registered with their embassy in New Delhi recommends that US citizens defer all non-essential travel to Hyderabad.        
	The advice which will be in force till January 31 has also been circulated by the US state department here for the benefit of Americans who may have been planning to visit Hyderabad.        
	Travel alerts for Americans are routine by the state department and US missions and posts in countries which pose travel problems for their citizens. As of today, there are warnings issued by the state department against travel to 30 countries that are in force.        
	In addition, there are travel alerts pertaining to seven counries, including two alerts about India that the state department says are issued to disseminate information about short-term conditions that pose imminent risks to the security of US citizens.        
	The US media seldom makes even a passing reference to such alerts and warnings, except in the increasingly common occurences in countries like Pakistan or Yemen when a US embassy is closed temporarily because of threats from terrorism.        
	What makes the advice against travel to the Telangana region different is the spin being given here about Hyderabad, which has considerable US-related economic activity.        
	The alert over the situation in Hyderabad has received unusual publicity especially on radio and television here: this would not have come about unless the US authorities have been deliberately drawing attention to the alert and providing background briefings to journalists.        
	There have been, for instance, previous alerts recently about information that terrorist groups may be planning attacks in India and warning to Americans cautioning them about congregating and even detailed instructions about choosing hotels, restaurants and recreation venues. These have drawn only scant attention in the American media.        
	The US is well aware that what can hurt India in the context of the ongoing tangle over changes to Indian visa rules is the economic content of the Indo-US relationship to which Hyderabad is pivotal.        
	The Americans are also meticulous about reciprocity in diplomatic dealings. But they do not want, in this instance, to impose reciprocal restrictions on Indians arriving in the US on visitor visa.        
	Following the arrest in the US of a half Pakistani American, David Coleman Headley, who scouted terrorist targets on a tourist visa on behalf of terrorists who attacked Mumbai in 2008, foreign tourists departing India with tourist visas now have their passports stamped that they cannot re-enter India for two months.        
	Reciprocity in this case will have no effect because most Indians arriving in the US on tourist visas do not go to neighbouring countries or return otherwise to America within two months.        
	However, most Americans visiting Hyderabad on business actually do so on tourist visas and not on business or employment visas. Curbing their travel will have an adverse impact on business activities such as call centres which proliferate in Hyderabad.        
	The US stategy, therefore, appears to be to force India into making resonable changes to its draconian visa rules by gently twisting arms where the impact will be felt on economic activity in Hyderabad.        
	Singificantly, the travel alert emailed to Americans living in India is very specific about the areas of the Andhra Pradesh capital that they have been advised against visiting.        
	For example, Americans have been advised against going to the state secretariat or the Legislative Assembly and to avoid the Panjagutta, and Ameerpet areas of Hyderabad.        
	Any foreigner who has done business in India knows that visits to state secretariats are mandatory as civil servants who deal with their subjects have to be kept in good humour. Visits to legislators and ministers are also vital and such contacts are being curtailed under the latest travel alert.        
	The British government, in contrast, has advised its nationals to go ahead with visits to Hyderabad and the rest of Andhra Pradesh.        
	Visitors to Hyderabad and the state of Andhra Pradesh are advised to avoid crowded areas and public places, to check transport arrangements with their airline or hotel if arriving or departing from Andhra Pradesh and to monitor the situation through the local media, the British travel advisory says.

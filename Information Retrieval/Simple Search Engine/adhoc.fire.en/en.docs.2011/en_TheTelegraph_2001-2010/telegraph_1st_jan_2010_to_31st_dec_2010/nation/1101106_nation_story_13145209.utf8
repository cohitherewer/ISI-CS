The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | VCs chafe at archaic fetters, raise autonomy cry
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      VCs chafe at archaic fetters, raise autonomy cry

	New Delhi, Nov. 5: Central universities are unhappy that their autonomy is being infringed upon and have opposed the archaic practice of seeking the Presidents approval for award of honorary degrees.        
	The vice-chancellors of 34 universities have demanded that the human resource development ministry and the UGC respect the autonomy granted to the institutions by acts of Parliament under which they were created.        
	The criticism about an excessive control mechanism obliging the varsities to seek UGC permission on administrative and financial matters came at an October 20 meeting called in Hyderabad by a government panel seeking to give more autonomy to higher education institutions.        
	The VCs opposed the practice of seeking the approval of the President, who is Visitor to the universities, to award honorary degrees to persons of eminence. They said the process led to needless delays and complications as the HRD ministry had to co-ordinate with the Presidents office for the clearances.        
	Two months ago, the Central University of Hyderabad had to face the embarrassment of not being able to award world chess champion Viswanathan Anand an honorary degree at a special convocation he was invited to because the Presidents clearance did not come on time.        
	The VCs were of the view that universities are autonomous bodies and have the power to select persons of eminence for honorary doctorate degrees, a VC who attended the meeting said.        
	Even if the honorary doctorate degree to a person brings embarrassment to the government, let that be. The executive and academic councils of a university should be the final authority to decide the persons for such awards. Seeking the Visitors approval is too archaic a practice.        
	The practice of having a presidential nominee in panels selecting faculty and administrative officials also came in for flak. Since varsities were required to send in their requests for nominees through the HRD ministry, the formalities were time-consuming and led to inordinate delays in appointments, the VCs said.        
	They suggested a better alternative would be for the Presidents office to approve a panel of nominees and leave it to the universities to pick any one when a selection committee needed to be set up.        
	The VCs also criticised the UGCs dictatorial attitude over clearance to start courses or create posts. The UGC at times withholds such permission, as in the case of the Central University of Punjab, which wanted to begin nine courses but was given the nod for only six.        
	The academic council of the Central University of Punjab had approved starting nine courses. But the UGC gave permission for only six, saying it did not have faculty. Had the UGC given permission, it could have recruited faculty for other courses as well, another VC said.        
	The VCs also opposed the practice of varsities having to separately seek grants for each new course or post. They said the UGC should provide varsities block grants and allow them to use funds as and when required.        
	The universities have to go to the UGC for any small expenditure. If they are given block grants, they can manage their expenditure better without any bureaucratic hassle, the VC said.        
	All VCs said universities are created by acts of Parliament. We want the government and regulatory bodies like UGC to respect the autonomy of the institutions as guaranteed by the laws.        
	The six-member panel that held the meeting is headed by Prof. Madhava Menon. The idea is the institutions should be out of bounds of any political or governmental interference, a member said.

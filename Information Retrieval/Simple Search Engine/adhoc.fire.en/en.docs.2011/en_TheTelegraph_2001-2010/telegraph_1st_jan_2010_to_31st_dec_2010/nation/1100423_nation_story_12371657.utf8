                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Second quiz for Modi in 24 hours
          OUR BUREAU                          Lalit Modi smokes a cigarette inside his car on his way to meet Mukesh Ambani in Mumbai on Thursday. (AP)                                  
	April 22: Income-tax and Enforcement Directorate sleuths today continued to question Lalit Modi regarding the various deals the IPL entered into under his stewardship.        
	A joint team questioned Modi for over three hours in Mumbai and later took him to the Mumbai Indians office to verify some documents.        
	Top income-tax sources said they are looking into the broadcasting deals struck for the IPL and whether any facilitation fee was paid by an IPL partner to an offshore company registered in a tax haven without paying the duty on the transaction in India. The Indian government may have lost out on revenue amounting to at least Rs 40 crore because of this, said a tax source.        
	The interrogation began at Modis suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in Parel at 8.30am and later shifted to his office at Nirlon House in Worli. This is the second time in 24 hours that Modi has been questioned.        
	After his questioning, Modi was taken by the investigators to the Mumbai Indians office in Maker Chambers at Nariman Point for verification of some documents, said tax sources.        
	It is not clear whether Modi met Mumbai Indians boss Mukesh Ambani.        
	Pushed to a corner, Modi is thinking of moving court against the coming IPL governing council meeting on April 26, when he is expected to get the pink slip. Sources close to Modi said the IPL chief was considering seeking a court injunction on the meeting.        
	Tax authorities, meanwhile, kept up the heat on the franchises with teams surveying the Mumbai offices of Red Chillies Entertainment, a company owned by actor Shah Rukh Khan, the principal stakeholder in Kolkata Knight Riders.        
	A team of six to nine tax officials arrived at the Red Chillies office in Khar, a 10-minute drive from Shah Rukhs bungalow Mannat on the Bandra Bandstand. Sources said SRK, who is shooting for his new film Ra.1, was in Mumbai, but it could not be confirmed if tax officials questioned him.        
	The survey follows a similar operation yesterday at the Knight Riders office at Eden Gardens in Calcutta. Officials said they were going through the documents seized there.         
	Income-tax deputy director, Calcutta, Akhilendu Jadhav said: We have found whatever we were looking for and we need to have a look at certain transactions.        
	The sleuths also recovered from waste paper baskets a torn document pertaining to payments made to an associate company of KKR.        
	Tax teams made similar visits today to offices of the Sahara group in Lucknow. Sahara won the Pune franchise last month after bidding a record $370 million (Rs 1,700 crore). The GMR-owned Delhi Daredevils office on Barakhamba Road in the national capital was also surveyed.         
	As the raids continued, income-tax sources said four franchises  Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, KKR and Kings XI Punjab  had applied for a tax-deducted-at-source exemption. Its a bit weird, given that the appeals have come up during the ongoing raids. TDS of these IPL teams have already been assessed by the Mumbai wing of the income-tax department. Between the four, Rs 8 crore has been paid as TDS so far. So why this sudden appeal, said a tax source in Mumbai.         
	The tax department has given a clean chit to Chennai Super Kings and Deccan Chargers.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      101-gun salute bullet hits BJP leader
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Narendra Singh Tomar; (below) the gun salute                           
	Bhopal, March 21: A 101-gun salute for a national BJP leader in Madhya Pradesh this morning proved to have one gun too many  one of the bullets pierced the thigh of a party divisional vice-president.        
	Subhash Sharma was critically ill in hospital tonight, hours after 101 party workers had lined up and fired in the air simultaneously to honour newly appointed BJP general secretary Narendra Singh Tomar on his return to hometown Morena.        
	The shooting took place on an open field, but the thigh injury suggests Sharma was hit by a misdirected bullet rather than one dropping from the sky.        
	Sources said that Tomar, who was state BJP chief till recently, had approved the 101-gun salute that was several notches higher in the prestige stakes than the 21-gun salute the royal Scindias were entitled to in the Raj era.        
	Tomar has been an opponent of the Scindias, especially Yashodhara Raje, who tried to stop his elevation to national politics.         
	Private individuals are banned from firing in pubic places under the Arms Act, but such celebratory shooting by political activists or baraats is common across wide swathes of India  a fact several BJP leaders hid behind today while asking not to be quoted.        
	Several district-level police officers were present during the shooting in the BJP-ruled state, but till evening the force had not lodged a case.        
	In New Delhi, chief BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad merely said: It was an enthusiastic welcome in a ceremonial fashion from the people of the constituency for their public representative.         
	Under the law, the President of India and visiting heads of state are entitled to 21 cannon shots on certain ceremonial occasions, but rifle or pistol salutes are totally banned. Sources said the guns used in Morena were mostly .303 rifles and country-made pistols. Off the record, senior officers admitted that most of the guns were unlicensed.        
	Yesterday too, when Tomar had arrived in Shivpuri, gun-toting BJP workers had fired several rounds in the air to welcome him.        
	Old timers said that three years ago, when Tomar was appointed state BJP president, there was a similar gun salute. No case was registered though the firing had taken place in Gwalior city in the presence of many senior police officers.        
	Tomar, fondly called Munna in BJP circles, is said to have been one of the architects of the BJPs return to power in the state in 2008. The low-key and hard-working politicians organisational abilities were acknowledged by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, L.K. Advani, Rajnath Singh and others. He had been key to the successful hosting of the BJP national council in Indore recently.

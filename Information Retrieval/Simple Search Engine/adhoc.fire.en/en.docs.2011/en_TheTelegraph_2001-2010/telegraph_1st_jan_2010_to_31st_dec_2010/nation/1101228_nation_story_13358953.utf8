The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jharkhand wakes up to Sanyal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Jharkhand wakes up to Sanyal

	Ranchi, Dec. 27: Jharkhand police are preparing to seek the remand of Maoist ideologue Narayan Sanyal, convicted last week in Chhattisgarh along with Binayak Sen, in a five-year-old arms loot case in Giridih.        
	Armed Maoists had struck a home guard training centre at Mohanpur, 3km from Giridih town, and looted Rs 3 lakh in cash, 200 rifles and 2,000 rounds of cartridges on November 11, 2005. The raid lasted barely half an hour but left seven dead, most of them trainees and cadets. Sanyal is among the 27 accused in the case.         
	According to sources, Raipur police, while collecting evidence against Sanyal, Sen and businessman Piyush Guha  convicted last week with the other two  had visited Giridih and sought a report from the district police chief. A Giridih inspector, Parmeshwar Shukla, had also appeared as a witness in the Sen case.         
	When Sanyal was arrested by Raipur police, we had put in an application for his remand, but did not pursue the case. He was not in the original list of accused but was named later, an officer said.        
	Ironically, Giridih police superintendent Amol Homkar retrieved the file today after The Telegraph informed him about Sanyal being an accused in the rifle loot case and the police doing nothing to complete the trial.        
	Jharkhand director-general of police Neyaz Ahmed, who had initially insisted that there was no case pending against Sanyal in the state, promised to take up the issue when told about the Giridih fiasco.        
	Giridih SP Homkar said he would send the investigating officer of the loot case to Raipur. Generally, courts allow remand to the police of other states after the cases lodged in a particular state are concluded, he said, adding 10 of the 27 accused were in Giridih jail.

          SANJAY K. JHA                      Chidambaram at the plenary on Monday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: P. Chidambaram today advocated quarterly monitoring of ministers performance by the Prime Minister and the governments performance by the Congress president, his perceived gumption raising eyebrows in the party.        
	Critics at the plenary accused the home minister of attempting to set the agenda for Manmohan and Sonia.        
	Speaking on the economic resolution, Chidambaram said ministers should report to the Prime Minister every three months on how they had delivered on their promises, and the government should report to Sonia on its performance.        
	The Prime Minister had himself introduced a performance-monitoring mechanism in December last year that was strongly resented by most ministers, and the plan of submitting a report card to the cabinet every May 1 was not followed this year.        
	Many All India Congress Committee members found the nature of contents in Chidambarams speech curious and wondered if he saw himself as the partys conscience-keeper.        
	One leader from Uttar Pradesh remarked ironically: The Prime Minister and Congress president should follow his guidance!        
	Several ministers laughed the suggestion away and refused to answer related queries, but one junior minister quipped: His speech was prime ministerial.        
	Chidambaram also asked the Prime Minister to achieve universal education and employment, total healthcare and equality for all in addition to passing the womens reservation bill. He hoped India would soon become the worlds largest economy.        
	The home minister questioned the states claims about lack of funds, saying a cash balance of Rs 95,398 crore was available to them right now and the Centre would give them over Rs 3 lakh crore this financial year.        
	Stressing the confident, upbeat and resurgent mood in the party following the speeches by Sonia, Rahul and Manmohan, he declared there was no chance of the BJP coming to power in at least the next 10 years.        
	Compare the rousing speech of Sonia Gandhi and the revolutionary road map laid down by the Prime Minister with the BJP, which is confused, majoritarian, communal, elite and unable to deal with the rot within, Chidambaram said.        
	He said the BJP was envious of the Congress because of its electability and the capacity to deliver growth.        
	Chidambaram said the average growth under NDA rule had been 5.8 per cent compared to 8.5 per cent under the UPA. He stressed that the difference between the two lay not just in these numbers but also in the current governments high spending on social sector programmes such as the rural job scheme, rural infrastructure projects, agriculture loan waivers, mid-day meal and the Indira Awaas Yojana.        
	The home minister said the Congresss political and economic resolutions were interlinked and the running theme was peace and good governance.        
	The economic resolution, presented by rural development minister C.P. Joshi, declared that the next 10 years would be a decade of social and economic justice. It kept to the partys stated economic policy but laid greater emphasis on pro-people schemes, welfare measures and inclusive growth.        
	It promised a comprehensive land policy and asked the government to protect the interests of all stakeholders, especially the tribal communities, and give them a share of the profits of the industries and businesses that use the land and its resources.        
	The resolution praised the UPA governments policy of strengthening the public sector and mentioned a new set of rights for the people, from food and work to identity and information.

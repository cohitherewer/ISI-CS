The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Corruption collision looms in House
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Corruption collision looms in House
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: Parliament is in for troubled days ahead with the Opposition deciding to gun for the Congress on corruption charges and the ruling party also raring for a fight.         
	The Opposition, which did not allow either House to work today, hopes to make a big impact by paralysing Parliament for at least a few more days.         
	The Congress is in no mood to relent and accept the Opposition demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe because it believes both the Centre and the party have responded adequately to the corruption charges.        
	The Congress is keen on a debate on corruption in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha because it is confident of exposing other parties poor track record, sources said.         
	Party spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan today dared the BJP to a discussion on corruption. Asserting that only the Congress was responsive to public sentiment on morality and propriety, she asked the BJP why it did not act in the Tehelka case or the Karnataka scams and why it had aligned with the tainted JMM in Jharkhand.        
	The Opposition was disrupting Parliament instead of having a thorough debate, Natarajan said. They cant extract a JPC (probe) by shouting or putting a gun to the governments head, she said.        
	The Congress also tried to put the BJP in the dock in the Adarsh housing society scam, alleging that one of its beneficiaries is very, very close to Nitin Gadkari.         
	While raising the Adarsh issue, they are not taking the name of Suresh Prabhu, who was a minister in the NDA regime, or Sancheti who is supposed to be very, very close to BJP president Nitin Gadkari. According to reports, his driver whose monthly salary is just Rs 8,600 has purchased a flat worth Rs 60 lakh, party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said.         
	Ahmed cited Karnataka, where the government has been rocked by mining and land scams as well as allegations of horse-trading, and said the BJPs double standards on corruption were there for everyone to see.        
	 The BJP should explain what action it proposes against its senior leaders Vijay Kumar Malhotra and Tarlochan Singh who were defending Suresh Kalmadi and were seen in TV footage with the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee Chairman. They should also spell out their stand on Sancheti and Suresh Prabhu, Ahmed said.         
	On the demand for communications minister A. Rajas resignation in the 2G spectrum issue, Natarajan said: Although it is the prerogative of the Prime Minister to decide who will be in the cabinet, we cannot ignore coalition dharma. The Congress maintains high standards on the question of morality but it is for the DMK to decide on Raja.         
	Asked about the latest CAG indictment, she said the party had not seen that report yet.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                       Manmohan Singh                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 7: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today sought to bring the focus back on an operation to flush out Maoists, asserting that if a battle on the ground is needed, so be it.        
	We are clear in our view that the government must re-establish the control of the civil administration. Therefore, the (security) forces will be deployed in order to re-establish the control of the civilian administration, Chidambaram told reporters after a conference of chief ministers on internal security.        
	 If that means confronting the Naxalites, if that means some kind of a battle on ground, so be it. Our forces are meant to put down violence and our forces will be deployed to put down violence. The chief ministers generally supported our response to them (the rebels), he added.        
	The minister had built the tempo for an operation in the latter half of last year but compulsions tied to the Assembly polls in Jharkhand, one of the states worst affected by Naxalite violence, and perceived misgivings among a section of the Congress over the likely fallout of casualties had prevented the Centre from launching an all-out offensive.        
	However, low-intensity operations had been launched in some states.        
	Chidambarams comments today suggest the Centre is now ready to widen the offensive if needed. The minister is scheduled to attend a meeting of four states  Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa and Bihar  in Calcutta on Tuesday. Other than Bihars Nitish Kumar, who will be sending the chief secretary, the chief ministers of the three other states are scheduled to attend the meeting.        
	At the conference today, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described as worrisome the recent spike in killings by the Left-wing extremists, though Chidambaram said that the high casualties were part of the collateral damage as security forces tried to flush out the rebels and establish rule of law.        
	Singh drew attention to the problems in policing by states. Four lakh sanctioned police posts  20 per cent of the total strength  were vacant across the country, he said, adding that the concern was deepened by the lack of modernisation of the forces.        
	He stressed the need for caution, saying the response to Naxalism must be calibrated to avoid alienating our people, especially those in tribal areas, and asked state governments to step up socio-economic development in these zones.        
	Chidambaram echoed the Prime Minister on the threat, and said the number of casualties would increase this year as security forces tried to reclaim rebel-dominated pockets, repeating a warning he had made last week.         
	The minister pointed out that more civilians and personnel had been killed in Naxalite areas last year than in militancy-hit Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast.         
	He said 591 civilians, 317 security personnel and 217 militants had died in Naxalite zones.        
	Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said Left-wing extremism remained a threat despite the joint operation in Lalgarh.         
	He said security forces had arrested 450 suspected Naxalites in the area since moving in there in June 2009.         
	In the coming months, security forces will form teams to move at night to prevent ambushes by the rebels, Bhattacharjee said.        
	 New areas targeted by the extremists will be adequately policed and action will be co-ordinated with neighbouring Orissa and Jharkhand to stop easy passage across the borders for the rebels.

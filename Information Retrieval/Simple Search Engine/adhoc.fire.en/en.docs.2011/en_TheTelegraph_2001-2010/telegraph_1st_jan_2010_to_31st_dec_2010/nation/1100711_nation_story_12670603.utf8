The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UP poised to beat Brazil
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      UP poised to beat Brazil
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                                            
	Lucknow, July 10: Most people in Uttar Pradesh didnt care to stay up and watch the Kakas and Robinhos last month.        
	They had better things to do: they were working on beating Brazil. Yes.        
	But not in a game of just 11 people, oh no.        
	The country of samba may start as favourites when it hosts the next World Cup in 2014, but be sure that long before that, the land of Mayavati will have outstripped it in population.        
	It could happen as early as next year when the states population is expected to reach 21.1 crore, health officials said on the eve of World Population Day tomorrow.        
	Then the state will officially overtake the population of Brazil, the worlds fifth most populous country with a population of about 20 crore now, said Siddharth Bhatia, a health policy expert and adviser to the state government.        
	At this rate Indonesia, world No. 4, could fall in another decade or so. According to health specialist Rupesh Srivastava, the states population could by 2016 reach 23.4 crore, which is the current Indonesian population.        
	That would leave only the US (31 crore), India (logically impossible for Uttar Pradesh to beat) and China (135 crore) ahead of the Heartland Heroes in the population world cup.        
	Studies have cited many reasons why the state governments family planning efforts have failed: chief minister Mayavati hasnt come up with new ideas; the men refuse to use condoms or get themselves sterilised; the women dont take the pill, nor can they keep their eager husbands at bay.        
	But one family planning official wasnt prepared to accept such excuses at a heated discussion on population growth in Lucknow last year. Its all the result of not watching television, he declared.        
	The official suggested the government distribute TV sets at a nominal price among the rural folk. We should think outside the box, he insisted, drawing accusations of contradicting himself.        
	Although no study has been done to ascertain the effect of M. Karunanidhis similar scheme on Tamil Nadus population, the other delegates nodded and said this must not be dismissed as a joke.        
	So far, Mayavati hasnt shown any inclination to carry out the suggestion. Perhaps she realises that if the music of vuvuzelas failed to keep her people awake at night, theres little chance anything else would.

	Mumbai, Dec. 8: DJ Akhil Talreja, 26, had not heard of the Varanasi blast when Mumbai crime branch officers knocked on his door last night to ask about the email claiming responsibility for it.         
	The email from Indian Mujahideen, sent to media houses some 30 minutes after the blast, was traced to Vashi in Navi Mumbai.         
	The wireless broadband connection of brothers Akhil and Nikhil, 30, had been hacked into and used to send the mail, Mumbai police commissioner Sanjeev Dayal said.         
	Crime branch officers visited Mansarovar building in Sector 17 and detained the brothers for questioning.         
	We were told that a mail had been sent through our WiFi. I had secured it with a password yet it was hacked into and misused like that, Akhil said. We were questioned by the police and we assisted them so that they could get any leads possible.         
	Dayal confirmed the two were innocent.         
	The email was sent by hacking into the WiFi network The police will renew efforts to spread awareness about securing WiFi networks as such incidents have occurred in the past as well, the commissioner said.

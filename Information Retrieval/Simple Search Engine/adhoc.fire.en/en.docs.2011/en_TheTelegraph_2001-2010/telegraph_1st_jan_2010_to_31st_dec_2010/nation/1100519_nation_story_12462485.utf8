          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 17: Orissa today issued storm warning signals at all its four ports after weathermen cautioned on intensifying of cyclonic storm Laila.        
	Following the official communication early this morning, distant warning signal number-II (DW-II) was hoisted at Gopalpur, Paradip, Puri and Chandbali.        
	The Laila  over south-east and adjoining south-west Bay of Bengal  moved west-northwestwards and lay centred at 8.30am near latitude 12.00N and longitude 85.50E, about 800km south of Gopalpur, said an official release.        
	The current conditions and numerical weather prediction models suggest that the system is likely to intensify further and move in a west-northwesterly direction for some time. It will then move in a northwesterly to northerly direction during the next 72 hours toward Andhra Pradesh coast close to Machhalipatinam, said Bhubaneswar Met office director-in-charge S.K. Dastidar.        
	Rain or thundershower at a few places over south Orissa and at isolated places over north Orissa during next 24 hours may take place, the Met office said. However, no warnings have been issued for fishermen.

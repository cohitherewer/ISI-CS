The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Buddhababu, Buddhababu... silence rules
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Buddhababu, Buddhababu... silence rules

	Calcutta, June 2: He came, he surely heard, but he refused to speak.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today simply ignored whatever question waiting journalists managed to throw at him as he got off his car, or climbed into it, at Alimuddin Street and Writers Buildings.        
	It was 9.36am when the chief minister reached his party headquarters in a convoy with gun-toting commandos all around him. As he stepped out of his bullet-proof car in a starched-white dhoti and kurta, TV cameras zoomed in on him.        
	Buddhababu someone shouted from the knot of journalists, waiting to catch the faintest of reactions.        
	Bhattacharjee neither paused nor looked back. He just held the end of his dhoti and hurried up the flight of steps to the first floor.        
	Inside the conference hall, a TV set beamed the latest trends from the Calcutta civic polls: Left Front 30, Trinamul Congress 81, Congress 7.        
	The sound of the TV seemed to echo around the corridor. The chief minister paused for a moment before slipping into party state secretary Biman Boses room.        
	As the trends turned into final figures, Bhattacharjee continued to gaze at the TV set in the room. One by one, party colleagues came in: industries minister Nirupam Sen, environment minister Manab Mukherjee, Mohammad Salim, Mohammed Amin, Shyamoli Gupta.        
	Around 10.30, they all walked out of Boses room and into the conference hall to discuss the results. Party insiders said Bhattacharjee mostly preferred silence here, too, but heard out the others.        
	The meeting lasted 35-40 minutes, after which Sen was the first to leave the party office. A few minutes later, around 11.20, the air crackled with a sense of anticipation outside.        
	Bhattacharjee could be seen climbing down the stairs.        
	The policemen stood at attention; the commandos smartened up their jackets; the journalists shuffled a few steps closer. A reaction from the chief minister would be the days prize quote.        
	But as he stepped on the ground floor, Bhattacharjee failed to take the right turn towards his car, near which the reporters and cameramen waited impatiently. He kept walking straight along the corridor and disappeared from sight.        
	Then he emerged again, all of a sudden.        
	Buddhababu, we have a question someone asked.        
	Grim silence.        
	As the journalists jostled with the police, Bhattacharjee settled himself on the left side of his rear seat.        
	Just after the convoy had rolled out of the lane, a huge victory procession by Trinamul Congress workers appeared, party flags fluttering on two-wheelers. The marchers turned up their volume as they neared the main entrance of the CPM headquarters.        
	Laal hato, the bike-borne youths screamed. Iqbal Ahmed, the local Trinamul councillor, flashed a broad smile.        
	Bhattacharjee spent hardly two hours at Writers. He refused to look towards the assembled reporters and walked straight to his chamber where he held a meeting to review the power departments work.        
	After the meeting  attended by Sen, who has additional charge of the power department, finance minister Asim Dasgupta and health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra  Bhattacharjee watched the TV news. Around 1.30pm, he walked out.        
	A reporter flung a question: Buddhadebbabu, will you bring the Assembly elections forward?        
	Silence.        
	The chief minister did not return to Writers after lunch as he usually does but turned up at the party office at 4pm.        
	Buddhababu, how do you react to the results?        
	But the chief minister was already striding up the steps.

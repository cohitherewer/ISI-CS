          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 23: BJP national leaders today rallied behind star campaigner Narendra Modi as the Gujarat chief ministers public face-off with his Bihar counterpart gave an opportunity to his supporters to underscore his importance.        
	M. Venkaiah Naidu and Ravi Shankar Prasad said Nitish Kumars demand to keep Modi and Varun Gandhi away from campaigning in poll-bound Bihar was unacceptable.        
	The issue dominated a meeting between BJP president Nitin Gadkari and the partys Bihar leaders last night. Sources said there was unanimity on continuing the BJP-JD(U) alliance but none wanted the BJP to compromise its self-respect.        
	Asked if Modi would campaign in Bihar, BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar said: Modi will go to whichever state he is invited for campaigning. He is our star campaigner. Naidu said Nitish had hurt the BJP by returning the Rs 5 crore Modi had sent during the 2008 Kosi floods.

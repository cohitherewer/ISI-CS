	Srinagar, July 30: Four deaths in alleged police firing today put Kashmir back on the edge after a lull, taking the number of casualties in such action to 21 in a crippling seven-week cycle of shutdowns and curfews.        
	Two of the deaths occurred during a march after Friday prayers in Sopore. The other two were killed when cops fired to control a mob of hundreds who had laid siege and torched a building inside the Pattan police station compound.        
	The backlash went beyond the north Kashmir towns and singed Srinagar, where a youth is in hospital on life support after being hit by an alleged police bullet.        
	Todays deaths took place as separatists, who have been calling non-stop shutdowns, were expected to announce a let-up in their agitation.        
	Sopore, where separatists hold sway, appeared the flashpoint. The victims there, Showkat Ahmad and Mohammad Ahsan, were part of the group of marchers that clashed with security forces who tried to stop them in the towns Amargarh locality. The police claimed they fired after demonstrators pelted them with stones.        
	The two persons (Showkat and Ahsan) were brought dead to our hospital and both of them had bullet wounds, said Dr Waseem Qureshi, the medical superintendent of Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) hospital in Srinagar.        
	The mob fury in Pattan was part of the protests that broke out across the Valley after news of the Sopore deaths spread. Mohammed Rafiq and Nazir Ahmed were hit by bullets allegedly fired by policemen trapped in the compound the protestors had first surrounded and then set on fire. Some police vehicles were also burnt.                      A woman joins protesters in throwing stones at security forces during clashes in Srinagar on Friday.

	In Srinagar, the day started with hundreds trying to march to Maisuma, the city centre, in response to a call by separatists. The police claimed that the protestors were asked to disperse peacefully but did not relent, prompting a baton charge and lobbing of tear-gas shells. The demonstrators hit back with stones. The forces opened fire as the situation threatened to spin out of control, hitting Iqbal Ahmad in the head.        
	Iqbal was shifted to nearby hospital from where from he was referred to Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, the capitals main government-run healthcare facility, where he has been put on life support. He has received a bullet in his head, an official said.        
	The authorities clamped curfew in Srinagar and some other places as the Sopore deaths and the Srinagar incident fanned a fresh wave of protests.

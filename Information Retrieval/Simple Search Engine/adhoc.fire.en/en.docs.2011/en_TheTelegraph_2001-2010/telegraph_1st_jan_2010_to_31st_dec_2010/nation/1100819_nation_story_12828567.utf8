The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hike in damages clears N-bill decks
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hike in damages clears N-bill decks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: A parliamentary panel has asked the government to triple the compensation cap for possible nuclear accidents to Rs 1,500 crore and make the suppliers accountable along with the operators for such accidents.        
	The standing committee on science and technology has also recommended that the period during which a nuclear accident victim can claim compensation for damage to health be doubled from 10 years to 20 years.        
	Accepting the suggested changes to the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill will allow the Centre to get the legislation passed in Parliament with BJP support. The government is expected to accept the recommendations, though it is under no compulsion to do so, since it has been in touch with the BJP and the proposals are part of a consensus.        
	The committee, whose recommendations came in a report submitted to Parliament today with a dissent note from the Left, has allowed nuclear accident victims the right to appeal to high courts and the Supreme Court if they are not satisfied with the claims commissions award. It has ruled out the participation of private players in nuclear installations.        
	Suggesting that the operators liability be raised from the previously proposed Rs 500 crore to Rs 1,500 crore, the report said: The lower amount may result in the operator marginalising the issue of safety and security... which may lead to accident.        
	The Left had wanted the liability raised to Rs 10,000 crore, but committee chairman T. Subbarami Reddy dismissed this as illogical.        
	The committee also struck down the Centres right to lower the compensation cap, originally provided for in the bill, but allowed it the right to hike the amount.        
	It also felt that the expression wilful act or gross negligence, relating to a suppliers role in a nuclear accident, was too vague and would be difficult to prove.        
	So it modified the clause to hold the supplier accountable for any accident that results as a consequence of latent or patent defect, supply of sub-standard material, defective equipment or services or from the gross negligence on the part of the supplier of the material, equipment or services.        
	This was one of the BJPs chief demands. The committee said the operator must secure his interest through appropriate provisions in the contract with the supplier.        
	It said: If a written contract between the operator and the supplier provides for the right of recourse, the operator may, after compensating the victims, exercise his right of recourse against the supplier in accordance with the provisions of the contract.        
	The committee, however, found that the government had not consulted relevant ministries  such as those of health, environment, labour and employment, agriculture and food and public distribution  while drafting the bill.        
	The House panel wrote: The government in future should consult all such ministries/departments which are even remotely concerned with the provisions of a proposed legislation.        
	Some of the suggested changes to the bill came on the basis of submissions from these ministries. The health ministry had proposed expanding the definition of nuclear damage to include loss or damage to a persons health in the immediate and long terms. The doubling of the claims period from 10 to 20 years was an environment ministry suggestion.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: Indias nuclear command today tested the medium-range Agni I ballistic missile, a day before marking two years since the Mumbai attacks.        
	The Strategic Forces Command (SFC), a component of Indias Nuclear Command Authority and custodian of Indias nuclear delivery systems and warheads, tested the 700km-range missile at 10.20 this morning from Wheelers Island off the Orissa coast. The missile is capable of carrying a 1,000kg warhead.        
	Todays test was described as a user-trial meant to assess the preparedness of the SFC to transport and fire the missile.        
	Since the Agni I ballistic missile was introduced in 2004, the SFC has tested the Agni II, which has a range of 1,200km, and the Agni III, which can cover 3,500km.        
	A Defence Research and Development Organisation spokesperson said the missile followed the trajectory in a copy-book style and reached the designated target in the Bay of Bengal.        
	The SFC is likely to test the Agni II again by December 12. Before that, the DRDO has also scheduled a test-firing of the 290 km-range Brahmos supersonic cruise missile.        
	The DRDO spokesperson said the 15-metre-long Agni I tested today weighed about 12 tonnes. It was tracked by radars, telemetry and electro-optical systems along the east coast. Two ships were also positioned near the target to assess the accuracy of the missile.        
	A Prithvi II short-range (about 250km) ballistic missile had failed a test on September 24.

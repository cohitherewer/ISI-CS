The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Game, set and a babu in the frame

	New Delhi, Oct. 8: The Games are on in full swing, but its Doordarshan that appears to have pulled off a hat-trick  of spoilt shows.        
	The public-sector broadcaster, the only one with the rights to cover the Commonwealth Games, shocked sports lovers today when it stopped telecasting the tennis semi-final between Indias Somdev Devvarman and Australias Matthew Ebden to show an interview with CWG organising committee secretary-general Lalit Bhanot.        
	The Somdev-Matthew duel was interrupted when it was at a crucial stage to usher in Bhanot, who had not long ago struggled to deflect charges of corruption and shoddy preparations in the run-up to the showpiece event.        
	What defied explanation was why an interview with Bhanot, who has been seen at news conferences almost daily, couldnt have been telecast at the end of the day.        
	Bhanot is eyeing the top post at the Indian Olympic Association, hoping the negative publicity around present chief Suresh Kalmadi will help him get the job. His (Bhanots) DD friends may have helped him out, said a sports ministry official.        
	The airing of the interview today was at least the third time since the Games began this week that DD had left viewers stunned. The telecast of Sundays opening ceremony was a disaster, with long ad breaks spoiling the visual treat. Later, an inconsequential match was shown instead of the event where marksman Abhinav Bindra won gold.

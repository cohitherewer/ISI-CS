  - Setback to Indias extradition effort        OUR BUREAU AMP; PTI                      David Headley                                
	New Delhi/Chicago, March 19: Indian investigators will get access to interrogate David Headley, who has confessed to plotting the Mumbai attack, in the US but he will not be extradited to India.        
	Yesterday, the 49-year-old pleaded guilty before a Chicago court to all 12 terror charges of conspiracy, including bombing public places in India, which means he will escape the death penalty and is likely to be given a life sentence.        
	His lawyer John Theis said Headley has agreed to make himself available for interrogation by Indian enforcement authorities or any authorised Indian authority.        
	Headleys plea bargain contains the condition that he will not be extradited to India. While this is being inter- preted by some observers, including the Opposition BJP, as a setback, home minister P. Chidambaram did not agree.        
	He asserted that India would continue to press for extradition, but recognised that the objective would be hard to achieve. We had apprehended problems in extradition. But we have not given up. We will continue to maintain our plea for his extradition.        
	Home secretary G.K. Pillai said: If there are other offences, which are not covered under the plea agreement, then of course extradition is still possible.         
	There are other charges, which do not come under the 12 counts.        
	The two countries will have to figure out how and when he can be questioned and whether the Indian investigators will be allowed direct access.        
	The US, which has so far denied India the right to question Headley who was arrested by the FBI in October last year, said he had agreed to fully and truthfully participate in this process which had to be undertaken only on American soil.        
	It was stated in the plea bargain that Headley would not be extradited to India, Pakistan or Denmark for any offences for which he had pleaded guilty. This came with a rider, so long as he fully discloses all material facts concerning his role with respect to these offences.        
	In a statement, the US department of justice said Headley further agrees that, when directed by the United States attorneys office, he will fully and truthfully testify in any foreign judicial proceedings held in the United States by way of deposition, video-conferencing or letters rogatory.        
	His lawyer was asked if this meant the Indian investigators could come to the US and talk to Headley about the Mumbai attacks. Theis said: Yes. If he refuses to talk to foreign governments here, it would mean a violation of the plea agreement.         
	Chidambaram said: There is a good chance that he will testify in a US court where Indian authorities will have a chance to ask questions.         
	There are many questions we have asked and we want much more information. I will continue press for access to Headley.        
	He added that the US director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, who met him yesterday, had also told him about the plea bargain. BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said India had lost the battle to know the full and complete truth about the nature and width of the 26/11 conspiracy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Honey, you married a chief minister
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Honey, you married a chief minister
          BASANT RAWAT                               Govind Patel (above) and Narendra Modi				                                 
	Ahmedabad, Sept. 22: Govind Patel, 56, can easily be mistaken for Narendra Modi at first glance  and that is how he likes it.         
	For the past eight years, the rolling mill owner with an uncanny resemblance to the chief minister has happily reduced himself to a Modi clone, imitating his gestures and wearing the same half-sleeve kurta and rimless glasses. Till recently, he drove the same car  a Scorpio.         
	Honestly, Patel says, I am loving it. So are his neighbours and his family. Only his wife, Shardaben, is a little embarrassed.         
	The businessman proudly reveals that he is noticed everywhere and gets VIP treatment by default.         
	On a pilgrimage to Kedarnath last year, he was mistaken for Modi by local BJP workers. They refused to believe I was not Modi, Patel recalls, even though I kept telling them I was his brother and not Modi.        
	Again, on a recent trip to Birla Mandir in Delhi, he overheard security personnel wondering aloud how the Gujarat chief minister was visiting without security.         
	Patel, who lives in the heart of Modis Assembly constituency Maninagar, loves the attention.         
	Children, he says, get very excited on spotting him and often spontaneously chant Modi Aaya (Modis here).         
	The same happens when he goes to any public meeting to be addressed by the chief minister. Hes invariably called to the dais and people hysterically chant Modi! Modi!         
	Patels son Parth, 25, adds: The gullible come to him to submit their list of problems, presuming they are talking to the chief minister.         
	He looks like a duplicate Modi, Parth says, as proud as his father. The people know me and at the same time they dont know me and it is okay with me, says Patel, who claims to share a rapport with the chief minister.         
	Whenever Modi visits his constituency, he is invited as a special guest to the meetings, claims the businessman.         
	When Modi cant come, Patel fills in for him as he did on the chief ministers 61st birthday last week. Modi was busy finalising candidates for next months civic elections, so Patel became the birthday boy for the celebrations at Krishna Baug Society, the housing complex where he lives in Maninagar.         
	A follower of the powerful Swaminarayan sect, Patel has become a true devotee of the chief minister, seeking to merge his identity with that of Modi. He endorses everything the chief minister says or does and all that he stands for.         
	Neighbours Suresh Gajjar and Papu Joshi agree with him that the chief minister is an indisputable leader and are glad to have another Modi in their midst.         
	Shardaben, 49, is the only one with any reservations about her husband living the life of a duplicate. The reason she is uncomfortable though is not that he is seen as a clone, but that she gets neglected when Patel is mistaken for Modi.         
	The chief minister, after all, has projected himself as a bachelor. Shardaben is aware of talk that Modi was married to a schoolteacher in north Gujarat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | House body scanners with no eyes for MPs
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      House body scanners with no eyes for MPs
          ARCHIS MOHAN                      SECURITY CASTE SYSTEM                          
	New Delhi, June 27: Parliament may soon install body scanners that can peep through peoples clothes to reveal hidden weapons or explosives, but MPs are likely to be exempt in keeping with Indias security caste system.        
	It appears that only visitors and junior government staff will have to pass through these body scanners if Parliaments security drill remains unchanged.        
	At present, MPs and senior bureaucrats get off their cars at Parliaments foyer and are not even frisked. The plan is to install the body scanners at the gates where a cross-section of Indians, many from towns and villages, enter Parliament when it is in session.        
	Privacy issues involving the use of body scanners, especially in a conservative nation like India, has for four years stalled a proposal to install them at the countrys airports. The Parliament plan would, therefore, have offered the MPs a chance to set an example by volunteering to be body-scanned, thus making these machines acceptable to all.        
	However, a VIP culture pervades the countrys security system even in these times of global terrorism, with people like Robert Vadra, Sonia Gandhis son-in-law, being exempt even from frisking at airports.        
	Such a mindset had led to a furore in Parliament when a US airline frisked former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. And after movie star Shah Rukh Khan was subjected to strict security procedures at Newark airport last year, civil aviation minister Praful Patel had threatened to take (up) the issue with the US government strongly.        
	Officials in charge of Parliaments security, therefore, are tight-lipped about the current plan, mindful of the controversies it can generate. The plan to have body scanners is in different stages of analysis. A technical committee will look into the various aspects, an official involved with the purchase of these machines said.        
	The committee on Parliaments security, headed by MP Kariya Munda of the BJP, had recently approved the purchase of security equipment including body scanners. The committee thought Parliaments security, overhauled the last time after the 2001 terrorist attack, needed an upgrade.        
	Body scanners are fast becoming a norm at airports in the US and Europe and the Intelligence Bureau wants them in Indian airports too.         
	Security officials claim that body-scanning would be optional or used as secondary screening at the airports. We are devising a drill where only the people whom the frisking personnel find suspicious will be subjected to body-scanning, an official said.        
	In February this year, Shah Rukh had alleged that staff at Londons Heathrow had printed and circulated his naked image, taken from a body scanner, and that he had even autographed them. The actor may have joked but the British Airports Authority took it seriously enough and described his claim as completely factually incorrect.

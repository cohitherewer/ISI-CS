The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata skips, Cong frowns
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mamata skips, Cong frowns
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 19: Mamata Banerjees decision not to visit the Assembly to pay homage to Jyoti Basu has allegedly upset Sonia Gandhi and left even some Trinamul Congress leaders dismayed.        
	Soniaji was very upset when we were discussing Mamatajis absence from todays programme among ourselves after paying homage to Jyoti Basuji in Calcutta, K. Keshava Rao, Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs, said.        
	After all, not only the country but the entire world saw thousands of people offering their tributes to Basuji. Being a national leader, Mamataji should have acted wisely (rising above) party lines.        
	Rao said Mamata, who was in Calcutta, should have come down for at least five minutes.        
	She (Mamata) is not only the leader of a political party but the railway minister of the Indian government. Her presence in the Assembly along with other national leaders would have raised her image, he said.        
	The Trinamul chief spent the morning and afternoon at her Kalighat home. Mamatadi watched TV at home and relaxed till 3pm. She came to her office after 3pm for a meeting with senior railway officials. Later she met singer Usha Uthup at her home, a Trinamul vice-president said.        
	A Trinamul junior minister said from Delhi that Mamata would have sent a good message to the party ranks and the people of Bengal had she gone to the Assembly and paid homage to Basu.        
	She had herself said that party workers and leaders should behave in a responsible manner after the people had voted for us in successive elections. She should have risen above petty politics to attend Basus funeral, the Trinamul minister said.        
	CPM leaders, who had expected Mamata at the Assembly, were surprised. Mamata had herself told me, when she came to pay homage to him (Basu) at the Salt Lake hospital on January 17, that she would be present during his last journey, said Rabin Deb.        
	Trinamul leaders such as Partha Chatterjee, Subrata Bakshi, Madan Mitra, Sonali Guha and Firhad Hakim were at the Assembly.         
	Mamata told her aides she had skipped the Assembly for three reasons.        
	One, because a privilege motion was pending in the House against 25 Trinamul legislators for violence on the premises on November 30, 2006.        
	How can Mamatadi forget the sordid episode in which 25 of our party MLAs had to pay Rs 14,000 each for damaging Assembly property? Yet there had been no such violence, Trinamul president Subrata Bakshi said.        
	Two, Mamata did not want to be seen with the chief minister and certain other CPM leaders who were present in the Assembly through the day.        
	Three, some CPM activists had allegedly used abusive language against Mamata when she had gone to the Salt Lake hospital after Basus death.        
	A party flag, however, flew at half-mast at Mamatas home from January 17 till this evening, a Trinamul general secretary said.

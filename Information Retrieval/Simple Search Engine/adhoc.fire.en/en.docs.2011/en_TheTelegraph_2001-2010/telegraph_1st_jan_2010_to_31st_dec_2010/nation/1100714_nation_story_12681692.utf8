          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 13: The Union home ministry has told telecom service providers to scrap licences of Jammu and Kashmir franchisees that dont adhere to security verification rules within a week and warned that top executives would be named co-accused if the companies didnt take action.        
	At a meeting yesterday with home secretary G.K. Pillai, the CEOs and MDs of seven telecom firms  Aircel, Bharti Airtel, Tata Teleservices, Reliance Communication, Idea, Vodafone and BSNL  the ministry is understood to have set the deadline.         
	They have been told that if the companies do not act, the managing directors can be made co-accused (along with the franchisees flouting norms while giving SIM cards), a source said. If that happens, it could put bigwigs like Anil Ambani of Reliance Communication and Sunil Bharti Mittal of Bharti Enterprises under the ministrys scanner.         
	The government seems to have cracked the whip after persistent reports that militants in Kashmir were taking advantage of mobile phone connectivity.        
	Sources said there was a choice between shutting down short messaging service (SMS) altogether or taking action against erring retailers or franchisees. It was decided later that the second option would take care of the problem. Bulk SMS is not allowed in Jammu and Kashmir anyway.         
	Telecom service providers generally outsource the task of selling SIM cards and verification procedures to their franchisees. But many franchisees dont follow guidelines on security verification because selling SIM cards is always the priority.         
	The department of telecommunications, in consultation with the home ministry, had issued guidelines earlier this year directing mobile operators to complete subscriber verification in a time-bound manner to address security concerns.         
	However, as militants have continued to take advantage of easy access to mobile phone connectivity, the ministry has decided to crack the whip.         
	Agencies under the home ministry found that several connections, out of a 0.1 per cent sample data collected from an allegedly verified lot, had not been verified.         
	As a result, it was found that even when intelligence agencies had intercepts, the real troublemakers could not be spotted  the people simply did not exist.

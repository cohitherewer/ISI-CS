          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 22: The Supreme Court may end up laying down norms for creating new states or dividing existing ones.        
	An anti-Telangana group has filed a petition saying the Centre cannot form new states arbitrarily and has requested the court to set guidelines for the exercise of such powers under Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution.        
	The court will take up the petition after two weeks, alongside another plea that has been filed against the proposed creation of Telangana. Any decision will have an impact on demands for new states across the country, lawyers said. At least 10 such demands, including one for Gorkhaland, are pending before the home ministry.         
	The petition pointed out that re-organisation of states in the past, whether in 1956, 1960 or 1966, had some rational basis, whether linguistic or administrative. It pointed out that the state reorganisation committee had in 1956 explained why Telangana was included in Andhra.         
	The petition said the Constitution had special provisions to deal with pockets of underdevelopment  one of the reasons for such demands  without creating new states.         
	 Unfortunately, due to the weakening of the political structure caused partly on account of fractured mandates, governments are seen to act under populous (popular) pressure.        
	Even the terms of reference of the Srikrishna Commission on Telanagna demand do not specify a concrete basis on which it should take a decision.

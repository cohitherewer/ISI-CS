          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            (From top) Nitish Kumar, Arun Jaitley                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: The BJPs homilies to P. Chidambaram and its political grandstanding against the UPA on Maoist violence went out of the window in Bihar.        
	While sounding a trifle defensive about the hostage-killers crisis in Patna, it justified every statement and response of chief minister Nitish Kumar, knowing that a false step could rock the BJP-Janata Dal (U) alliance ahead of the polls.        
	The partys unofficial Bihar minder Arun Jaitley said he would speak to Kumar this evening. I didnt want to disturb him,Jaitley said.         
	Spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP from Bihar, Ravi Shankar Prasad said: Its wrong to assume that the chief minister is lenient towards the Maoists and harsh on the cops. He never prevented the cops from taking action against them. There was an incident in Jhajha when the police station was attacked. About two to three Maoists were killed and one was injured. The chief minister made it a point to get him treated in Delhis AIIMS under police protection.        
	Prasad picked on a couple of sentences from Kumars reaction on Thursday evening when word was out that one of the abducted cop was done to death to prove his line on Maoist excesses was not blurred by political compulsions. He clearly said when we respect their (Maoists) human rights, why should they violate the rights of the others? asked Prasad.        
	He cited Jehanabad  a former Naxalite stronghold  as a case in point of the chief ministers will and commitment to wipe out the problem.         
	Nobody from the administration dared to step into the area for fear of the Maoists. The chief minister reclaimed the place and today its a common sight to see girls cycling even after sundown, claimed Prasad.        
	Admitting the latest incident could dent the halo of around Kumar of being a good, no-nonsense administrator, the spokesman added: But it wont impact our election prospects because for the first time in 25 years, the people of Bihar have seen real development. Jagannath Misras (former Congress CM) track record was as bad as his successors, he contended.        
	In the past, when the government was bedevilled with internal differences between home minister Chidambaram, and Congressmen Digvijay Singh and Mani Shankar Aiyer over the polemics of tackling Maoism, the BJP lost no time in magnifying the contradictions.         
	It is intriguing that whereas the Opposition (read the BJP) is willing to give full support to an effective strategy by the government to eradicate Maoism, it is the Congress and the UPA, which is involved in demoralising the entire security apparatus, Jaitley once said.

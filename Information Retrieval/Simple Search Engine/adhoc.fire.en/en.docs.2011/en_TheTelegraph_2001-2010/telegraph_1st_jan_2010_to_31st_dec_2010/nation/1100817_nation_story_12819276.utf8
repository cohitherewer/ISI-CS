	New Delhi, Aug. 16: The IITs cannot launch their own medical colleges just yet. The human resource development ministry has put the proposal on hold following the law ministrys advice to seek Medical Council of India approval.        
	This will be a setback for IIT Kharagpur, whose plans to open its own medical college on its campus, in collaboration with the railways, were in an advanced stage.        
	The provision for medical education has been dropped from the IIT Act amendment bill, which the Union cabinet cleared today, a senior HRD ministry official said. The bill seeks to grant statutory status to the eight new IITs so they can award degrees.        
	It also proposes to convert the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, into a full-fledged IIT.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tokyo, Oct. 24: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today nudged Japan to conclude the pending nuclear co-operation pact with India, stressing it would be a win-win proposition for both countries.        
	Singh, who arrived here today, sought to allay Tokyos fears about Delhi holding another nuclear test. He said India was committed to maintaining its unilateral and voluntary moratorium on nuclear explosive testing.        
	The Prime Minister made it clear that India was not setting Japan a deadline to wrap up negotiations.         
	Sources said India was not prepared to dilute the treaty for Japan after having clinched a similar deal with America largely on its own terms. No matter how sensitive Japan is on this matter, we dont just want any agreement, an Indian official said.        
	In an interview to a Japanese daily on the eve of his visit, Singh said India would like Japan to partner it and participate in the expansion of its nuclear energy programme.        
	He was asked whether India was prepared to accelerate its economic reforms and de-regulation, considering that certain Japanese companies had faced problems in procuring land and handling the complicated tax system. Singh said there was an increasing appreciation that calibrated and sustained growth was better than sudden about- turns and that his government was committed to reforms as the principal instrument of economic transformation.

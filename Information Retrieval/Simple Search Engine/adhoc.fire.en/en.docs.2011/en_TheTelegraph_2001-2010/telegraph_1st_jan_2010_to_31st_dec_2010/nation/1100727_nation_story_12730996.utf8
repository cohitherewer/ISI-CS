  - Jailed former cop Narendra Amin to testify against Gujarat ex-minister        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            (Top) Amit Shahs lawyer Ram Jethmalani arrives at the Ahmedabad CBI court; BJP president Nitin Gadkari speaks up for him in Mumbai. (PTI)                                       
	Ahmedabad, July 26: Amit Shah suffered a huge blow in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case with a jailed ex-deputy SP who knows the former Gujarat minister since school days today seeking to turn approver against him.        
	CBI sources said Narendra Amin would be their star witness and was likely to give damning evidence that could rip the BJP leaders claims of innocence.        
	Amins move came on a day the CBI special court allowed Shah, a confidant of chief minister Narendra Modi, to be interrogated in jail from July 28 to 30. He will be grilled on the three days between 9.30am and 5pm at the Sabarmati jail here. The sessions will be videographed.        
	Amin filed an application saying he would testify against Shah in the court. The plea will come up for hearing tomorrow.         
	Nirupam Nanavati, who along with senior counsel Ram Jethmalani appeared for the former minister, claimed Amin turning approver was inconsequential and would have no bearing on the case. The tainted cop is himself an accused, Nanavati contended, and his statement will not carry credibility.        
	But Amitabh Thakur, the chief CBI officer in the case, said it was normal for the accused to become approvers. Agency sources said the evidence and testimony of an approver like Amin  if the court allows him to become one  carried more weight than those of any witness.        
	Amin was close to suspended IPS officers D.G. Vanzara, Rajkumar Pandian and Abhay Chudasama. All three are in jail in the case.        
	Amins advocate Jagdish Ramani, who filed the approver application, said his client knew much more than his own involvement in the case and could crucial for the CBI to buttress its case against the ex-minister.         
	Amin has also requested the court to shift him out of the Sabarmati jail saying he fears for his life as he has been kept with the other accused in the case.        
	Amin knew Shah since his school days as his brother was a classmate of the leader. They studied in the same school. Amin has also reportedly told CBI officials that Shah used him to threaten rivals or extort money from businessmen.         
	The sources said he could give the exact sequence of events that occurred from November 25 to 29, 2005. Sohrabuddin and his wife Kauser Bi were said to have been killed sometime in that period.        
	Ram Jethmalani, who appeared on behalf of the BJP leader, said his client was not legally bound to answer questions during interrogation unless he was given a copy of the chargesheet.         
	The CBIs counsel, Azaz Khan, said that wasnt a problem as the chargesheet had been filed and was a public document that could be accessed from the court.        
	Jethmalani also filed a bail application, which the court posted for hearing on August 2. That means the former minister will be in jail at least till next Monday.         
	Legal experts said chances of a bail in such cases were remote given the serious nature of the charges  murder, extortion and kidnapping  against Shah. The court had ordered Shahs judicial remand till August 7 after the agency did not seek his custody.

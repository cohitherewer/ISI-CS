The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pawar stirs quota pot, Cong seeks to put lid
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pawar stirs quota pot, Cong seeks to put lid
                            
	March 14 (PTI): Sharad Pawar today suggested that a reduction in the 33 per cent quota for women could be considered if such a step helped achieve a consensus.        
	But the Congress described as needless speculation the references to the possibility of a review of the quantum of the quota.        
	Pawar, who was addressing the Nationalist Congress Partys concluding session of a two-day national executive, is perhaps the first UPA leader to openly suggest a reduction in the quota.        
	A combination of Yadavs has emerged to oppose the womens reservation bill. I had a talk with them. I told them that the bill could be amended to address their concerns in respect of OBC and Muslim women. A reduction in the proposed 33 per cent reservation can be considered to arrive at a consensus, Pawar said.        
	So far, the leaders of the Congress have been against reducing the quota of 33 per cent. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said: We do not live to tilt at windmills and do imaginary crossing of non-existent bridges.        
	Claiming that the campaign by the Yadav trio would turn out to be a damp squib, Congress leader V. Kishore Chandra Dev also insisted that there was no going back on the 33 per cent quota. The very fact that the Yadavs are bargaining means that they have accepted the principle of reservation, he said.        
	Pawars statement comes a couple of days before the first phase of the budget session is scheduled to conclude. The government has promised to consult all parties before moving the bill in the Lok Sabha.

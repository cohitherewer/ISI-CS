The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 1-coach palace plan for all trains
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      1-coach palace plan for all trains
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 20: At least one coach in all major trains will soon offer the feel of a travelling palace.        
	The railway ministry in collaboration with the tourism ministry is planning to add a specially designed luxury compartment meant exclusively for tourists to all important trains.        
	The coaches will be designed keeping in mind the requirements of foreign tourists.        
	It does not mean that local tourists cant travel in these luxury coaches. But they will have to pay the same fare (as the foreign travellers), said an official with the tourism ministry.        
	The Indian Railway Tourism and Catering Corporation (IRCTC) runs luxury tourist trains like the Palace on Wheels, Deccan Odyssey, Royal Rajasthan on Wheels and the Fairy Queen. But to have a luxury coach in every important train is a novel idea, the official said.        
	Unlike the luxury tourist trains, these trains (with a luxury coach each) will be taking normal routes so that tourists can get a better feel of the real India, the official said.        
	According to the official, select coaches will be designed to have aesthetic interiors, better designed seats and toilets and wider sleeping berths. The windows, too, will be larger to give a better view of the landscape.         
	There is also a plan to serve liquor in these special coaches. Alcohol is banned on trains though booze is part of the charm of travelling by luxury ones like Palace on Wheels and Deccan Odyssey.         
	The coaches will also have attendants. We want the tourists to have the feel of being in a travelling palace, the official said.        
	The ministry is planning to start the modification with all Rajdhani trains. The rest of the major trains will be modified in the next phase.        
	The official said the Planning Commissions steering committee on tourism had suggested rail tourism should be developed in the countrys interiors that have a rich heritage but lacks infrastructure though railway lines are available.        
	The IRCTC had earlier come up with a proposal to allow private companies to provide train services to and from all tourist destinations. But it was shot down by the railway ministry.        
	That proposal did not work out because it involved so much technicalities. But the idea of having a special luxury coach was approved easily, the official said.        
	While the railways plan big, Keralas tourism department has latched on to Indias busiest travel network to launch one of its biggest branding exercises.        
	It has wrapped the exterior of the Thiruvananthapuram-bound Rajdhani Express with a huge canvas that encapsulates all that Kerala has to offer to visitors to the state.        
	 The mobile canvas depicts Keralas famed backwaters, houseboats, beaches, wildlife and art forms.

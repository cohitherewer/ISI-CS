          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 23: The Orissa Agriculture Produce Markets Act was amended in 2006 to allow establishment of private markets and contract farming in the state. However, even four years after that, the act has failed to meet the expected results reasons being poor implementation at the ground level, said experts.        
	A study, Farmers access to market facilities in Orissa, released by the Centre for Youth and Social Development reveals this.        
	The act enables any person, co-operative society, or self-help group to establish a private market for sale and purchase of produce.         
	Similarly, contract farming arrangement envisages private institutions for operations starting from production to marketing.        
	Implementation of the act is at its infancy because of the ignorance of the farmers, the report says. Private markets expected to work as an effective alternate to the existing market yards have been functioning with inadequate numbers of cold storages and godowns.

	Washington, April 13: A two-day nuclear security summit of 47 nations ended here today with a 12-point communique which is significant from Indias point of view for what it does not mention.        
	India has been working overtime since November last year to ensure that the summit remains what it was originally conceived as: a conclave on nuclear security that does not stray into areas such as the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).        
	The final communique, unanimously approved by participating heads of state and government, does not mention either the NPT or the CTBT even in passing.        
	In the run-up to the summit, there were voices within the Obama administration which wanted the centrality of NPT in the global non-proliferation architecture to be included in the communique.        
	Such a view was strengthened when President Barack Obama and his secretary of state Hillary Clinton last week repeatedly referred to the importance of NPT as a pillar of nuclear disarmament while making major changes to US nuclear policies.        
	As a non-signatory to the NPT and the CTBT, India would have found it difficult to be party to any document that endorses these treaties, which New Delhi considers to be discriminatory.        
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao, Indias sherpa  high-level representative  at meetings in November, February and last weekend to prepare for the summit, had made clear New Delhis desire to see that the Washington summit was NPT-neutral.        
	On Sunday night and yesterday, national security adviser Shivshankar Menon added his muscle to those efforts by tapping his extensive contacts among governments, which he built up during Indias campaign for approval by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the substance of the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	The communique reaffirms the essential role of the IAEA in the international nuclear security framework and will work to ensure that it continues to have the appropriate structure, resources and expertise needed to carry out its mandated nuclear security activities.        
	This is a matter of satisfaction for India as a founder member of the IAEA. In recent years, there have been attempts to whittle down the powers of the IAEA and allow others, including a group of self-appointed countries to usurp those functions.        
	A preamble to the communique reiterated the shared goals of participants in the summit to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, a long-standing demand by India on behalf of itself and other developing countries since the time Jawaharlal Nehru.        
	The centrality of the IAEA in nuclear security and the right of countries to peaceful uses of nuclear energy represents a back-handed victory for Iran, which has been emphasising these claims in the face of US threats to impose new sanctions on Tehran.        
	The communique calls upon the international community to work together to prevent the theft of and clandestine trade in nuclear materials. The next nuclear security summit is to be held in 2012.

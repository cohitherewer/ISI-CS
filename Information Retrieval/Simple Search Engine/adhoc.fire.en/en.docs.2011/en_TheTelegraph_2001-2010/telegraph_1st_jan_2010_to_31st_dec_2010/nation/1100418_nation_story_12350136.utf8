The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pledge for no-plastic city
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pledge for no-plastic city
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 17: Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) has tied up with ACC Limited to provide plastic waste for its plant at Bargarh in western Orissa, where the company will process them to manufacture cement.        
	CMC commissioner Rabi Narayan Nanda told The Telegraph that the civic body had already made a beginning with two truck loads of non-degradable plastic waste like disposed water bottles, polythene and other waste materials. Every month, we will supply plastic waste  gathered after segregating it at collection points across the city. We hope to increase it to two trucks every week after the segregation process is initiated at our garbage dumping yard at Chakradharpur, Nanda said.        
	CMC has been engaging 30-odd vehicles for collection of garbage from 32 points in different wards, but outsourced solid waste disposal at the dumping yard coming up at Chakradharpur, 14km from the heart of the city, to Orissa Small Industries Corporation.        
	ACC will not give anything in return to CMC, but the civic administration is apparently relieved, as proper disposal of non-degradable waste material is a major problem despite prohibiting manufacture and sale of polythene in the corporation area. It will make solid waste management in the city much easier for us, he claimed.        
	CMC officials say the city, at present, is witnesses disposal of 360 tonnes of solid waste per day, but the civic body has no mechanism to quantify plastic waste.        
	Unofficial estimates, however, peg the per day generation of garbage in the city at over 500 tonnes and plastic and polythene category at nearly 40 per cent of it.        
	Meanwhile, the CMC has declared Mahanadi Vihar area on the eastern fringe of the city as a model no-polythene zone.         
	People in the locality are being sensitised on the harmful effects of rampant polythene use not only on the environment but also on their health, he said.        
	The locality was first chosen as it is most affected by waterlogging in the rainy season. And polythene is cited as a major cause as they choke the drainage outlets, he added.

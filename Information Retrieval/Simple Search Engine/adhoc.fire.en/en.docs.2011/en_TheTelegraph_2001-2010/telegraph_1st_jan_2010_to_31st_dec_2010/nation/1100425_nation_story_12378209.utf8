  - Mob welcome moves tennis star to tears                            Shoaib and Sania in Lahore on Friday. (Reuters)                                  
	Lahore, April 24 (PTI): Shoaib Malik has appealed to the people of Pakistan to give a decent welcome to Sania Mirza.         
	He was upset by the unruly behaviour of crowds that had gathered to greet them on their arrival in Pakistan. He has asked people to treat Sania as their sister-in-law.        
	I know people here are very happy about our marriage but at the same time they should be decent in expressing their emotions. In our country, respect is shown to sisters and mothers, Shoaib told a news channel.         
	A large crowd gathered at the airport in Karachi where they landed on Thursday, and later in Islamabad and Lahore and the hotels where the couple stayed.         
	Sania and her mother were mobbed by fans at Lahores Pearl Continental Hotel where they checked in yesterday.         
	A huge crowd was waiting at the hotel when the newlyweds arrived last evening, causing chaos.         
	Both Shoaib and Sania had to make their way to an elevator through a corridor packed with cheering fans. As they passed they were pushed and shoved. Sania almost fell and was near to tears but Shoaib caught her.         
	Shoaib declined to hold a scheduled news conference after the incident.         
	He also met the local superintendent of police and asked him to provide the couple and his Indian guests tight security and keep unruly elements away from his wife.         
	About a dozen of Sanias relatives are scheduled to arrive in Lahore today. The couple will leave for Shoaibs hometown in Sialkot later in the evening for a reception to be held on Sunday.         
	Shoaibs family has also landed in trouble with Pakistani authorities. The Maliks have been told to switch off decorative lights at their house in Sialkot. The move is part of an an energy conservation drive.        
	The electricity supply company visited Shoaibs home and asked his family to switch off the lights.         
	Shoaibs brother-in-law Imran Zafar contacted some top officials of the Punjab government but was told there were strict instructions and no exceptions would be made for anyone. If the government wants us to celebrate the event in the dark, we will do (so), said Zafar.

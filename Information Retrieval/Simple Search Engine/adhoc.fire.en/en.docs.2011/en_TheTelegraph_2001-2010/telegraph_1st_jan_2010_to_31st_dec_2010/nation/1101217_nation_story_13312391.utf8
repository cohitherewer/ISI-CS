          J.P. YADAV                          Wen shakes hands with Yechury before presenting him an award in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: If Rajghat is a must-see for visiting dignitaries, heres a must-ask: hows the Left doing?         
	A month after Barack Obama enquired about the Left, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao last night popped the question when Sitaram Yechury met him.        
	The bonhomie between Indian communists and China notwithstanding, Wen asked the CPM leader about the prospects of the Left in the forthcoming elections in Bengal.        
	Right wing forces have consolidated against and we are battling it, Yechury managed to mutter before the discussion shifted to relations between the two countries.        
	The occasion was a private dinner hosted by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in honour of the Chinese Premier where Yechury was also invited.        
	In between, Yechury did not forget to mention how the Maoists in Bengal were selectively killing CPM leaders. Jiabao told him that he was aware about it and then moved ahead.        
	Contacted, Yechury confirmed the interaction. Yes, he asked me about Bengal and I told him that right wing forces had consolidated against the Left and we were battling it, Yechury told The Telegraph.                    
	Yechury said the conversation ended there. He shied away from disclosing whether Jiabao wished the Left luck or not.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, who had earlier told British Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm that the Left was besieged in Bengal, was busy attending a party class in Hyderabad. Yechury, who was also in the southern city, had taken leave to dash to Delhi to receive an award from Jiabao on Wednesday for strengthening India-China friendship.        
	A curious Obama had taken Yechury by surprise at Rashtrapati Bhavan when the US President asked him whether the communists had always been part of the mainstream democratic set-up in India. That is why I am here, Yechury had replied and Obama said he was pleased to meet an Indian communist.        
	The meeting between the Chinese Premier, the political head of the largest communist country, and the CPM leader, came after a string of electoral setbacks for the Left in Bengal.

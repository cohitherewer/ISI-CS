The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal rejects JPC demand
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sibal rejects JPC demand
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 5 (PTI): Union telecom minister Kapil Sibal today rejected the demand for a JPC probe into the allocation of 2G spectrum calling it unreasonable.        
	Sibal said such a process would not help achieve the objective sought to be served and alleged the Oppositions motive was pure politics.        
	Criminal culpability is being investigated by the CBI and we are not averse to Supreme Court monitoring and ideally we dont want any executive authority in between, so that the process is transparent and the public is confident that it is directly being investigated by the apex court and JPC cannot do anything better than that, Sibal said.        
	He said a JPC should emerge through a consensus or when there is a cause of national concern.        
	He also asserted that the telecom ministry has already initiated action into the decisions taken from 2008-2009 on 2G spectrum and that the new operators who allegedly suppressed information to get licences would be issued showcause notices and asked to explain why their licences should not be cancelled.

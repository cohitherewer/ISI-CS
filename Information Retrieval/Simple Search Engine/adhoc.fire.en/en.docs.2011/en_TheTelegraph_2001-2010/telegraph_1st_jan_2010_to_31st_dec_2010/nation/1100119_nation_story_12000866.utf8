	Srinagar, Jan. 18: Security forces today claimed to have killed the mastermind of the 2005 fidayeen attack at Ayodhyas Ram Janmabhoomi complex.         
	Jaish-e-Mohommad commander Abu Dawood was killed in an encounter with joint team of the army and police in Narol forest of Mendhar in Poonch on Sunday night.         
	Dawood was the divisional commander of Jaish. He was in charge of the border districts of Rajouri and Poonch in Jammu.         
	Poonch police chief Manmohan Singh said the encounter took place last night. We have found an AK-47 rifle, three magazines, a pouch, one mobile, two SIM cards of Aircel and Airtel and photos of Osama Bin Laden and literature of the Jaish, Singh said. He (Dawood) was the mastermind of the Ayodhya attack.         
	Five armed terrorists were killed by the police at Ayodhya in July 2005 and the police later arrested five militants from Mendhar for their alleged involvement in the attack.

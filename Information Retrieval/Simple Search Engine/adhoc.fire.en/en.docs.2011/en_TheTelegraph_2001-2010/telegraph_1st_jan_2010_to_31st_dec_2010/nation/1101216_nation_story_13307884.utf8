The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | LTTE threat to PM 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      LTTE threat to PM 
                            
	Chennai/New Delhi, Dec. 15 (PTI): The Tamil Tigers are trying to regroup and planning to target high-profile personalities like Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, home minister P. Chidambaram and Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi, a top police officer said today.        
	We received an alert from a central agency about a possible threat to the Prime Minister, the chief minister and his cabinet in Tamil Nadu and to several other VVIPs who may visit the state, state police chief Lethika Saran said.        
	The state has been put on high alert and we have strengthened the intelligence machinery to check if there is any truth in the matter, she added.        
	Saran said the state government would take all possible measures to ensure the visits of any VVIP to Tamil Nadu, including that of the Prime Minister or our own chief minister, are carried on without any hitch.        
	According to an intelligence input, some LTTE cadres who managed to escape during the flush-out operations in the island nation were trying to regroup in India and planning attacks on top political leaders, particularly when they travel to Tamil Nadu.        
	Singh is likely to visit Tamil Nadu next month to attend some public events.        
	Security agencies have taken the input seriously as former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by LTTE suicide squad members in the southern state in 1991.        
	Though the LTTE is now a weak force and all top leaders were killed during the Sri Lankan armys assault, attempts to regroup by some cadres is a disturbing report, an official said.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Spy in Tihar, but smile intact
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                           Madhuri Gupta outside a court in Delhi on Saturday. (AP)                                  
	New Delhi, May 4: Plush apartments, fancy cars, embassy parties Tihar Jail.        
	Alleged spy Madhuri Gupta stepped into her 9ft-by-12ft cell for the first time on Saturday  but not before she had told Tihar officials I will be out soon.        
	For all her defiance, it was clear life had changed for the middle-level diplomat, arrested on the charge of spying for Pakistan and passing on sensitive information. Locked up in jail No. six, she now shares her cell with two others, both first-time offenders.        
	Jail sources said Gupta, a second secretary in the high commission in Islamabad before her arrest, had not been put in a cell alone as she was on suicide watch and, although no CCTV cameras had been installed there, she was being monitored round the clock.        
	Usually, alleged offenders like her tend to get depressed and might harm themselves, so we keep a close watch. But Gupta is not only fine and eating her meals regularly, she is also maintaining a cordial relationship with her cellmates. She has told them she is going to be out of Tihar soon. She doesnt seem depressed at all, said a jail source.        
	Tihar officials said Guptas first night in jail was uncomfortable. The 53-year-old  used to living in plush government accommodations, driving around in sport utility vehicles and attending embassy parties during postings abroad  found it difficult to sleep because of mosquitoes.         
	Sources said Gupta tunes into news channels as soon as she wakes up and puts on her spectacles. She has her morning tea, bread and aloo curry and then scans all the newspapers.        
	That Gupta, arrested last week in Delhi, hadnt lost any of her confidence was evident when she showed no sign of distress or nervousness as she walked into a local court on May 1, the day a judge sent her to judicial custody for14 days.        
	As she walked out of the court, dressed in bright pink, the alleged spy had a hint of a smile on her lips. The smile, Tihar sources said, is still intact.        
	Gupta, jail officials said, has never stopped protesting her innocence in her conversations with her cellmates.        
	I have been framed, a source quoted her as telling her cellmates. I am not senior enough to access any kind of sensitive information.        
	Tihar sources also said Gupta, a diabetic, has been a regular visitor to the jails medical examination room to collect her pills. Careful about her diet, Gupta has been eating roti, sabji and daal without any hassle.        
	Known to have an affinity for mystery novels and Islamic literature, Gupta hasnt yet asked for any books from the well-stocked Tihar library.

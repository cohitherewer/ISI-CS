The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Son in US jail, dad seeks 3 minutes with Obama
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Son in US jail, dad seeks 3 minutes with Obama
          SUJAN DUTTA                          Vikram Buddhi                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 5: The elderly gent walking through a convoy of security cars outside the Indo-Gothic building that houses Bombays St Xaviers College knows he has but little chance to enter his sons alma-mater the day US President Barack Obama does.        
	A day after landing in this city, President Obama is scheduled to visit Xaviers (on Sunday), the college that has produced a brilliant student, Vikram Buddhi, who is languishing in a US jail for four years.        
	Vikram allegedly posted messages on an Internet chatsite urging the people of Iraq to avenge themselves against the US invasion of 2003 by killing Obamas predecessor, George W. Bush, his wife Laura, the then vice-president, Dick Cheney, his wife Lynn and the then defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld.        
	Vikrams father is here today, outside the college, telling all who will care to listen of his sons  and his own  plight, for the millionth time. He has written to Obama thrice, to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and to President Pratibha Patil.         
	To the last, who once sought to help him by getting the foreign office to write to its mission in America to get legal aid to Vikram, B.K.Subbarao has also pleaded that she cause a three-minute meeting in her presence with the US President.        
	But the zeal with which the US government has arranged for its Presidents security  stationing its warships outside Mumbai and even getting the Indian Navy to put its only aircraft carrier (INS Viraat) on an Operational Readiness Platform makes it appear that Vikrams father may have set himself an almost impossible task.        
	But the 69-year-old Subbarao is exceptionally dogged. The former Indian Navy captain with a doctorate in nuclear technology is now a practising Supreme Court lawyer. He was once accused of spying for the US when Rajiv Gandhi was Prime Minister. But he fought his own case and was acquitted with all his honours restored.        
	My son was a student of St Xaviers from 1988 to 1990. Will a student of the college ask President Obama about Viram? he wonders aloud.        
	A national science talent scholar, Vikram was a silver medallist from IIT Bombay in 1996. He then moved to Purdue University in the US for PhDs in pure and applied mathematics. He also had a teaching assistantship to pay for his studies. His father shows letters he received from the university, commending Vikrams performance as a teacher.        
	This Sunday, Obama is scheduled to attend a town-hall style meeting at Xaviers, where 300 carefully selected students from across Mumbais colleges will be allowed to question and exchange ideas with the US President. US secretary of state Hillary Clinton had a similar programme during her visit last year.        
	A group of 20 Jaihind College students, that is among the selected, is working hard on its question(s) if it gets a chance. They do not want to let on what the question is  maybe about Pakistan, counter-terrorism or trade  for that is a closely guarded secret. The President has a 20-minute stop in Xaviers. He is expected to give a speech for about 10 minutes. A Xaviers student questioning him on one of the college alumni would be tricky to handle.        
	Vikram, now 39 years of age, was picked up by the US secret service for questioning on January 16, 2006. His father says he was among several students and teachers questioned by the Secret Service after the Internet postings. He says Purdue Universitys server was probably hacked and the Secret Service traced the Internet protocol addresses to the universitys computers, one of which was used by Vikram.        
	Vikram was released after two days of questioning and, in February 2006, the Secret Service gave a report stating that he was not a threat to any of its protectees, says Subbarao. But, nearly three months later, on April 14, 2006, Vikram was picked up again and prosecuted.        
	Subbarao went to the US to arrange his sons defence and attend the trial. He was on a years emergency visa but was deported before the guilty verdict on June 28, 2007.        
	The authorities in Indiana, the state where Purdue is, further delayed the process, by sentencing Vikram more than two years later in December 2009.        
	When I approached external affairs minister S.M. Krishna with the case, the minister in my presence asked his joint secretary, But where is the charge? recalls Subbarao.        
	He has also met Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs daughter who is a human rights lawyer in the US.        
	Vikram could be jailed for nearly 35 years unless he is given a proper trial. I am not asking for mercy, says Subbarao, because that would mean an admission of guilt. I am asking for a review of the case, he says.        
	Asked if a three-minute audience with Obama would be sufficient, Subbarao says: If he knows, he will understand. All I will need to tell him is this: Mr President, you are a civil liberties lawyer yourself. Please go through these papers and I will hand over the documents.

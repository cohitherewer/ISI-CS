	New Delhi, Oct. 5: Prince Charles had been accused in the past of being too grand to squeeze his own toothpaste, pick up his own clothes or even hold his own specimen bottle.        
	Now it seems that folding down his own seat can be added to the list of everyday chores the Prince of Wales need never worry about.        
	After arriving at the Commonwealth Games swimming pool to watch some of the heats, the prince waited for an aide to flip down his seat as he hitched up his trouser legs.         
	The seatwallah, who is believed to work for the British high commission, then left the scene as the prince was joined by the Earl of Wessex, who is the vice-patron of the Commonwealth Games Federation.        
	Eight years ago Paul Burrell, the former butler of Diana, the late Princess of Wales, claimed in a book that the princes servants squeezed his toothpaste onto his brush for him, picked up his discarded clothes from the floor and on one occasion an aide had even held a specimen bottle while the prince produced a urine sample.        
	Burrells claims were denied at the time by Clarence House, but the prince has struggled to shake off a reputation for extravagance.

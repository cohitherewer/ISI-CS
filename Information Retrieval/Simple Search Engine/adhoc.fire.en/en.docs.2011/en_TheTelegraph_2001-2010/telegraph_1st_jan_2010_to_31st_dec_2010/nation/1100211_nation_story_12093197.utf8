	Bokaro, Feb. 10: Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Sorens younger brother, Lalu Soren, was today sent to jail after being denied bail in a hit-and-run case dating back to 2002 when he allegedly caused the death of a 32-year-old Bokaro Steel Plant employee.        
	A non-bailable arrest warrant was issued against Lalu, a senior JMM leader, in 2007 after he stopped appearing for hearings in the case.         
	According to court records, on April 10, 2002, a white Ambassador, which was being driven by Lalu, hit a scooter near Ambedkar crossing at Sector IV of Bokaro steel city, injuring rider C.M.P. Gupta. He died while being taken to hospital.        
	A policeman of Sector IV police station, Mofiguddin Khan, who was an eyewitness, noted the number of the car while it sped away. Later, the car was traced and it was established that Lalu was driving it when he escaped from the spot.        
	Today, Lalu reached the court of Bokaro sub-judicial magistrate K. Kumar in the morning with a battery of lawyers to seek bail. But the magistrate turned down his plea and sent him to jail.        
	Lalu was first arrested in May 2002, a month after the case was registered. But he had managed to get bail then. He attended a few hearings but after 2006, he began ignoring summons and stopped coming to court.        
	In 2007, the sub-judicial magistrate issued a non-bailable warrant against Lalu. Even though the JMM leader moved about freely and attended public events, he wasnt arrested.         
	The chief ministers press adviser said Soren was not fully aware of the case.

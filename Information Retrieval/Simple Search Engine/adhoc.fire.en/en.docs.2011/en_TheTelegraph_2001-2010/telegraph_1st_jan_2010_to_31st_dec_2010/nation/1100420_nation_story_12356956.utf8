          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 19: The state has finally come up with a comprehensive development plan for Bhubaneswar and its neighbouring towns for catering to the needs of a projected 30 lakh population by 2030.        
	The final report on the comprehensive development plan, prepared by IIT-Kharagpur, has been notified by the state recently, said Deoranjan Kumar Singh, the vice-chairman of Bhubaneswar Development Authority, today.         
	The last comprehensive development plan for the capital city had been prepared in 1994.         
	In October 2008, the state invited objections of the public and stakeholders to the draft. The final plan was expected by January 2009. But, the finalisation was delayed as it involved hearing of 5,000-odd objections raised by various stakeholders, especially real estate groups represented by the Orissa chapter of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India and the Real Estate Developers Association.        
	Bhubaneswar is emerging as major IT hub in the country, besides being a prominent tourist spot.         
	The state  under the Orissa Technology Mission  had initiated a proposal for a development plan and assigned the task of preparing a Perspective Plan Vision 2030 and Comprehensive Development Plan for Bhubaneswar-Cuttack Urban Complex, to the department of architecture and regional planning, IIT, Kharagpur.        
	The long-term perspective plan envisages an investment of Rs 29,560 crore in sectors like traffic and transportation, housing, physical infrastructure, social infrastructure, tourism and heritage. Of this, Rs 15,000 crore will be public investment.         
	The balance requirement will be met through long-term loans, capital finance through devolution of funds, user charges, increased tax collections.         
	Around 4.4 lakh houses will be needed for 30 lakh people by 2030 (presently there are nearly 2 lakh houses). The requirement of drinking water will be an estimated 88 million gallon per day.         
	Also included in the plan are a rapid mass transit system, improvement of roads, construction of parking space and open space to cater to the burgeoning population of the city.

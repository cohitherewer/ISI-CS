          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           Sanjay Mohindroo      
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: The Tihar jail authorities have ordered an internal probe after two inmates told a Delhi court yesterday that some prison guards had tried to coax them into killing two former members of the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee who are also lodged in the high-security prison.         
	A preliminary probe revealed that Amit, who is a murder convict, and his friend Nishant, facing trial in another murder case, were recently shifted to the high-risk ward from jail number 4 where the duo had formed a gang, said Sunil Gupta, a law officer in Tihar jail.         
	 Amit and Nishant were not happy because they were put in the high-security section, he said. It led them to fabricate a story.         
	Yesterday, the duo claimed that some jail officers had handed them a revolver and a knife each and urged them to murder the two Games officials. They did not name which two the prison guards wanted them to kill.         
	They also requested the court for security after alleged threats by the jail authorities.         
	Acting on the allegations, chief metropolitan magistrate Vinod Yadav had sought a detailed report from the station house officer of Hari Nagar police station, which oversees Tihar jail, by December 24.         
	Three former Games officials  T.S. Darbari, M. Jeyachandran and Sanjay Mohindroo  are in judicial custody in Tihar jail since the CBI arrested them on November 15.         
	They have been accused of misappropriating funds while organising the Queens Baton Relay.        
	Amit and Nishant, residents of Badarpur in south Delhi, have been in jail for the past three years.         
	Amit has been sentenced to life imprisonment.         
	On December 18, the two friends put a request before a magistrate saying they wanted to disclose some important information against some Tihar personnel and could provide the court with relevant evidence.

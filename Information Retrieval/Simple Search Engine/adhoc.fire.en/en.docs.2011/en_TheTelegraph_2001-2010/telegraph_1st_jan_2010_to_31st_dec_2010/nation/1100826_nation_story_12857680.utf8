          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A Greenpeace activist holds a banner atop a lamp-post during a protest near Parliament against the nuclear liability bill on Wednesday. (PTI)                                         
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: The Lok Sabha today passed the nuclear liability bill after the government accommodated the BJPs concerns and the Prime Minister mounted a defence by drawing a parallel with the path-breaking economic reforms he pioneered.        
	All the demands of the main opposition were accepted through 18 amendments moved by the government itself but the Lefts proposals were negatived by voice vote, except one by division which threw up a score of 252-25.        
	In a rare parliamentary spectacle of recent times, minister of state for science and technology profusely thanked the Opposition for co-operation and Leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee walked across to the BJP benches for expressing the governments gratitude. Although the government had sorted out the differences much in advance, the last thorn  an eleventh-hour insertion that talked about the suppliers intent to cause nuclear damage  was removed by science and technology minister Prithviraj Chavan on the floor of the House. He did not move the related amendment (no 13) and replaced it with the one the BJP had suggested.        
	The passed version talks of the operators right to recourse if the nuclear incident was a consequence of an act of the supplier or his employee. This covers the supply of equipment or material with patent or latent defects or sub-standard services. During the four-hour debate, most speakers tried to target the government primarily on two points: its unfair handling of the draft by inserting words surreptitiously and the haste to enact the law before President Barack Obamas visit.        
	BJP leader Jaswant Singh, who initiated the debate, offered little substantive opposition to the bill but wanted to know why the government had used sleight of hand to alter the draft after negotiating with the Opposition. Jaswant said the manner in which the government hustled the standing committee and Parliament raised suspicions.        
	The BJP leader said the government was being dictated by foreign suppliers, although India was on a strong wicket and no other country had such business potential as to buy around 40 reactors. The Prime Minister made a brief intervention to underscore that the bill was the completion of a journey to end apartheid against India in the field of atomic power. He also rejected allegations that the proposed legislation was designed to benefit American interests. He said: To say that this has been brought to promote American interests, to promote American corporations, I think, this is far from the truth.        
	The Prime Minister said such charges were not new as he had faced similar allegations even in 1992 when he presented the budget as the then finance minister. He recalled that the whole Opposition, with a few exceptions, demanded his impeachment on the claim that the budget had been prepared in the US.         
	To say we have anyway compromised Indias national interest will be a travesty of facts, Singh emphasised.         
	History will be the judge, the Prime Minister said and pointed to the economic reforms initiated in 1991. He said the reforms had contributed to making the country what Jaswant Singhji called a resurgent India.         
	Referring to the question whether nuclear power is a viable option, the Prime Minister said it was preferred as it was clean. What the government has done is to create more opportunities to meet such options, he said.        
	Singh said technology is not constant and was moving fast. I cannot predict what future holds for us.        
	Noting that the government was doing everything to ensure safety of nuclear plants, Singh said utilisation of nuclear energy was a serious issue that could not be ignored.        
	Chavan tried to allay fears of the Left that the victims will be left in the lurch if the nuclear accident is big because of the Rs 1,500-crore cap on the plant operators liability.        
	The minister said the compensation to be paid would be unlimited and the cap was only for insurance. He expressed the hope the safety standards would be so good that the bill would never be put to use. Chavan assured the House that India opting for the uranium-based reactors from abroad for producing electricity does not mean ongoing research on use of thorium would be given up.

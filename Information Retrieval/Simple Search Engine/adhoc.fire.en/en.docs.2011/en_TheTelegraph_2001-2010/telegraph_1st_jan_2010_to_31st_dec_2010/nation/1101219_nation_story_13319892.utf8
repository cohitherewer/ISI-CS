          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 18: Mumbai police today detained a Gulf- bound passenger at the airport here on suspicion of involvement in the Varanasi blast, but could not establish till late evening if he was the suspect they were looking for or just a namesake.         
	Confirming the detention, Central Industrial Security Force Commandant J.S. Negi said a passenger identified as Shoaib Nadeem Siddiqui was detained when he was about to board a Gulf Air flight.        
	There was a lookout notice issued by the police in the wake of the Varanasi blast. Spotting the passenger name, the airline alerted us and we detained him this afternoon. We have handed him over to Sahar police, Negi said.         
	However, Mumbai police chief Sanjeev Dayal had another version.        
	We have detained him for questioning. The CISF control room had received an anonymous call saying that this person could be linked to the Varanasi blast and he was detained on the basis of that information. We cant arrest a person on the basis of an anonymous call. We are still questioning the person, Dayal said.         
	The explosion at Sitala Ghat during the aarti on the banks of Ganga had killed a two-year-old girl and a woman, and injured 30 people.         
	The terror group Indian Mujahideen had claimed responsibility for the blast that took place on the evening of December 7 and said that it was in retaliation to the Ayodhya title suit verdict.

                                        Mental Leap    
	Washington, Dec. 24 (PTI): Babies as young as seven months can understand and consider others perspective, a new study has suggested.        
	This mental leap, called Theory of Mind, was earlier thought to occur in a child not before four years of age. But the new study suggested that by the time they are 15 months, babies are aware that another person has a different perspective on their surroundings.        
	According to researchers, the findings will contribute to the understanding of a process thought to be critical to social interactions  the ability to infer others mental states.        
	The approach the researchers used for testing such young children may also lead to earlier detection of developmental disorders, said lead researcher Agnes Melinda Kovacs of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Institute for Psychology.        
	Developing tasks that can be used with very young infants will significantly contribute to current efforts to achieve early detection and diagnosis of autism, and will pave the way towards early intervention techniques, Kovacs told LiveScience, a science news website.        
	The researchers also said that the ability in babies to detect different perspectives had been missed so far perhaps because scientists didnt know the right questions to ask.        
	For their study, Kovacs and her colleagues showed 56 seven-month-old babies an animated cartoon in which a Smurf-like character watches a ball roll behind a wall placed on a table through a number of scenes.        
	The ball either stops behind the wall and is hidden from view or keeps rolling until it disappears from the scene. At the end of the clip, the wall is removed to reveal a ball or no ball.        
	Smurfs are very short, mostly male North American cartoon characters with blue skin, white trousers with a hole for their short tails and white hat. They stand for simple archetypes of everyday people, such as Lazy Smurf, Grouchy Smurf or Brainy Smurf.        
	The infants response times were measured by how long it took them to look away from the video screen. The longer it took, the more surprised they apparently were at seeing the ball behind the wall or not.        
	The researchers found that the infants stared longer at the final scenes depicting a surprising outcome for the cartoon character when he retreated early (absence of ball) than the anticipated one (presence of ball). Babies are thought to look longer at unexpected situations or events.        
	So, the researchers interpret the infants behaviour as indicating that they were surprised at the unexpected outcome, just as the cartoon character would have been.        
	In other words, the babies seemed to process the characters viewpoint, not just their own, said the scientists.        
	By seven months, it seems humans can perceive anothers point of view, remembering it even after the other person leaves, they reported in the journal Science.

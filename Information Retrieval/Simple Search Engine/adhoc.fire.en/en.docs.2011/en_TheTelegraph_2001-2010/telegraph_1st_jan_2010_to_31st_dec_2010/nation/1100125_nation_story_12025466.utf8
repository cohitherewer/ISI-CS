The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In missing factor, Rahul aides see shift from caste
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      In missing factor, Rahul aides see shift from caste
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Rahul Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 24: Some of the recent appointments backed by Rahul Gandhi may have surprised a few Congress leaders, but his close associates claim these reflect the Amethi MPs determination to dilute the caste factor in his political management.        
	A Union minister of state, believed to be a member of Rahuls core group, cited the example of Uttar Pradesh.        
	The state Congress president is Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a Brahmin. According to the usual trend of our politics, the Congress legislature party (CLP) chief would have been from a lower caste or another religion. But Pramod Tiwari, also a Brahmin, was retained as CLP leader. Even the party general secretary in charge (of the state) is Digvijay Singh, a Rajput, the junior minister said.        
	Rahuls aides say this does not reflect an upper caste bias. He picks people who can deliver. Digvijay was chosen because he was considered the most dynamic general secretary. There were pressures from the party to do some caste-balancing but Rahul doesnt listen to that sort of logic, a leader close to Rahul said.        
	The aides also cited the decision to make Pradeep Jain of Uttar Pradesh a minister despite the presence of another Bania, Sri Prakash Jaiswal, in the government.        
	They said Rahul was looking for someone from Bundelkhand, a neglected area, and not a piece of symbolism in caste management. Two other leaders from the state, Jitin Prasada and R.P.N. Singh, were made ministers because Rahul was targeting the youth as a constituency.        
	The youth will make up almost 70 per cent of our voters in the 2014 elections, and he (Rahul) is the obvious leader of this group, one of Rahuls associates said.        
	Above all, there is a palpable distaste among the youth for the overwhelming influence of caste in our society. Younger people see a nationalist fervour in Rahuls Indian-first rhetoric.        
	Even in Bihar, where the general focus of the Congress is on the upper castes because both Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar are wooing the backward castes, Rahul preferred Jagdish Tytler who signifies nothing in terms of caste.        
	In Jharkhand, Rahul stuck with Babulal Marandi because of his good image, ignoring the wishes of leaders who wanted to form the government through political deals, those close to Rahul say.        
	They claim that Rahuls rise has taken the political discourse out of the secular-communal groove too. They say he is sending out a message that the purpose of politics and governance is to solve the common mans problems.        
	This seems to be working because of the general cynicism about the political class in our country. He does not want to lose his way in ideological debates and semantics, a young MP said.        
	Rahul has often claimed that he does not visit a Dalits or Muslims home; he goes to a poor mans home who is identified by the media as a Dalit or a Muslim.

	Cuttack, April 13: The ongoing agitation for proper education and good food by students of Bhima Bhoi School for the Blind in Bhubaneswar has drawn the attention of Orissa High Court, which has expressed concern over the apathy of the authorities.        
	A official of the court said, Chief Justice V. Gopalgowda issued a notice to the state government yesterday. He expects the government to offer a clarification on allegations of harassment made by the students and their demands.         
	Over a dozen students have been protesting since April 5, demanding filling up of teaching and non-teaching posts, increase in diet allowance, dismissal of teachers posted irregularly and free Braille textbooks.

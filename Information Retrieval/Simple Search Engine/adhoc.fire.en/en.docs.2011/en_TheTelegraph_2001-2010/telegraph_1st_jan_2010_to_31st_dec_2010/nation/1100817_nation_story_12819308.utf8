The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Live-in couple for long as good as wed: SC

  - Court allows sons born out of wedlock to be named property heirs          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 16: The Supreme Court has held that a couple in a long-term live-in relationship would be presumed to be married under law, unless proven otherwise.        
	A live-in relationship if continued for such a long time cannot be termed as a walk in and walk out relationship and there is a presumption of marriage between them, a two-judge bench of the court said on Friday.        
	The court was dealing with a property case. The sons from a mans marriage had contested the right of the sons from their fathers live-in relationship to be included in his list of legal heirs.         
	Madan Mohan Singh and others had filed an appeal against the Allahabad High Court judgment of August 14, 2003, which had ruled in favour of the sons from the live-in relationship.        
	Rajni Kant and Anjani Kumar claimed to be the sons of Chandradeo Singh from Shakuntala, who was never married to him, and said they were the only legal heirs to his land. They contested the claim of Madan Mohan and his brother, sons of Chandradeo from his marriage, to be included in the list of heirs and filed objections under Section 9A(2) of the UP Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953.         
	Madan Mohan filed similar objections, saying Rajni and Anjani had no right or interest in the suit and that he and his brother were the only legal heirs to the property.        
	The consolidation officer passed an order on November 8, 2000, permitting the recording of the names of Rajni and Anjani also as legal heirs.        
	Madan Mohan then filed an appeal before the settlement officer, which was dismissed. A revision plea was rejected on March 15, 2003. The high court also dismissed their appeal.        
	In the petition before the Supreme Court, the counsel for Madan Mohan and his brother said their mother Sonbarsa had died in 1945 and Chandradeo, a freedom fighter, was in jail from 1945 to 1947.         
	There was nothing to show that he married anyone thereafter. At the most Shakuntala was a concubine and her children, being illegitimate children, had no right to inherit any share in their fathers ancestral property, he claimed.        
	The counsel also claimed that Rajni was born even before Shakuntala and Chandradeo started living together.         
	On the other hand, the lawyer for Rajni and Anjani claimed their parents lived together for a long time. Their relationship as husband and wife had been accepted by society as well as family members, he argued. Chandradeos name was shown as the father of Rajni and his brother, he contended.        
	The Supreme Court concluded that Chandradeo lived with Shakuntala from 1960-61 to December 31, 1979, when he died.         
	Four daughters and two sons were born out of this relationship, it noted. Citing earlier judgments, the court said the law would presume in favour of marriage and against concubinage when a couple had co-habited for a number of years. In other words, the court would presume a couple were married if they had lived together for such a long time.         
	The presumption of marriage can be rebutted if there is unimpeachable evidence, Justices P. Sathasivam and B.S. Chauhan said.         
	The children in such cases will not be considered illegitimate under Section 114 of the Evidence Act, the court said, dismissing Madan Mohan and his brothers appeal against inclusion of Rajni and Anjani in the list of legal heirs.

	New Delhi, Oct. 16: Delhis roads have become safer this month, thanks to the Commonwealth Games.         
	A senior police officer said there has been a nearly 60 per cent fall in the number of fatal road accidents in the capital since the Games began on October 3.         
	During these nine days the city recorded over 50 deaths in 2008, against the 19 deaths in road accidents this month. There has been a steep decrease in the number of overall road accidents in the capital, the officer said.         
	Last year, there were nearly 200 road accidents during this period. The number this year is 130.         
	In 2008, Mumbai had the most accident deaths at 8,681, followed by Delhi at 7,016.         
	Senior officers said that strict enforcement of traffic rules had worked. The presence of policemen in large numbers on the roads for the Games had also helped.         
	Satyendra Garg, joint commissioner (traffic), attributed the sharp decrease in fatalities to the shift in emphasis from prosecution to regulation.         
	We have managed to contain the rise in the number of accidents this year compared to the last few years, which had witnessed an alarming upward trend. The traffic arrangement during the Games is phenomenal and we will try to keep up the momentum, he said.         
	Enforcement of lane driving and strict vigil has yielded results, he said.

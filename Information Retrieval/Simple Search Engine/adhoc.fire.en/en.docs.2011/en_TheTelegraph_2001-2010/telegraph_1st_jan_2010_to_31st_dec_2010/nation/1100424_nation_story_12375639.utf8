          OUR BUREAU                       Desai is brought to court in New Delhi on Friday. Picture by Prem Singh                          
	New Delhi, April 23: Medical Council of India president Ketan Desai, who appeared to be spearheading a campaign urging doctors to reject cash, gifts, or hospitality from drug companies, has been arrested by the CBI for allegedly accepting a bribe.         
	The CBI registered a case yesterday on information that Desai had entered into a conspiracy with a Delhi-based middleman and the vice-chairman of a medical college in Punjab for granting permission to admit students from the academic year 2010-11, CBI sources said.         
	Desai allegedly rejected certain objections that had been raised by an inspection committee, in lieu of heavy monetary considerations, a source said.         
	This is the second time that Desai is in trouble for bribery.         
	In 2001, Delhi High Court had taken note of evidence that Desai had received Rs 65 lakh as a gift for himself or his family, and had ordered his removal from presidentship, and directed the CBI to prosecute him.         
	But the CBI filed a closure report in 2003 which, sources associated with the health ministry claimed, described the payment as goodwill gift. Desai returned as MCI president a few years later.         
	In recent months, Desai appeared to be leading an MCI campaign to discourage fellow doctors from accepting gifts or hospitality from pharmaceutical companies. Some of us wondered at this irony  a tainted doctor telling others not to accept bribes, said a senior doctor in Jaipur.         
	In February, the executive council of the MCI found that the college in Punjab lacked infrastructure and its request to begin admission of students this year was declined.         
	The CBI later arrested the Delhi-based middleman with Rs 2 crore sent to him by the vice-chairman of the medical college for delivery to Desai. The CBI has conducted searches in Delhi, Punjab, Chandigarh and Gujarat and recovered several incriminating documents, cash and other items from the accused, the CBI sources said.

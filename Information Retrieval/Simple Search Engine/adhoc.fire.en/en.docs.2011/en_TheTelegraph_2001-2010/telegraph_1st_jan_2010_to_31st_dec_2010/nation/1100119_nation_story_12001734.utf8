	From a barely legible scribble by Ramwati, a migrant woman from Nepal, to the calligraphic flourish of Vice-President Hamid Ansari, the condolence book at the CPM headquarters in New Delhi, for people to pay their tributes to Jyoti Basu, today became a bridge across the capitals class and power divides.         
	Cabinet ministers and peons, ambassadors and commoners, Indians and foreigners, atheists and religious leaders queued up at AK Gopalan Bhavan to express their grief and, in some cases, even gratitude towards Basu. Many left a reminder of how Basu belongs not just to the CPM or to India.         
	Nepal has lost a great warrior, wrote Tek Bahadur, representing Nepalese migrants who came in large numbers to pay their respects.         
	Comrade Jyoti Basu was Russias best friend, penned the Russian envoy to India. His death is a great loss to South Asia, said his counterpart from Sri Lanka.         
	Others like Mohamed El Turk from the Palestinian embassy, the Cuban ambassador, Pakistans high commissioner, BJP leader Arun Jaitley and Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit described Basu as one of the tallest Indian leaders. External affairs minister S.M. Krishna said Basu became a legend in his lifetime who always thought of the have-nots.         
	Others who paid their tributes included JD (U) leader Sharad Yadav and defence minister A.K. Antony. I was the chief minister of Kerala in 1977 while he was the chief minister of Bengal. I know him very intimately.              
	He was a unique person who gave correct directions to find solutions to problems. His guidance was useful for me, Antony said after offering flowers to a Basu photograph.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited AK Gopalan Bhavan at 11am. CPM politburo members Sitaram Yechury and K. Varadrajan received the Prime Minister, who cited his official preoccupations as reason for his not being able to attend Basus last rites.         
	In the sad demise of Shri Jyoti Basu our country has lost a great son who was a great statesman and a great patriot. I convey my deepest condolences to the members of the bereaved family and countless admirers, comrades and followers of Shri Basu, Singh wrote.         
	Vice-President Ansari said: The country mourns the passing away of a patriot and a great statesman.              OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

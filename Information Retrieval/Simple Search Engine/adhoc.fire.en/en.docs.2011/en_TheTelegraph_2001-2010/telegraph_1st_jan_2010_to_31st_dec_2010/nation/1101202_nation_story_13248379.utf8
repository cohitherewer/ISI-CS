          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Dec. 1: The Omar Abdullah government has decided to reduce the presence of security forces in Srinagar in the face of sharp criticism of the move by the army.         
	The armys Northern Command spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Pradeep Kochar, issued a statement yesterday questioning the chief ministers stand in favour of a troops cut and revocation of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act.         
	The statement, which was withdrawn by the army last evening, had blamed demilitarised Srinagar for the Qamarwari incident, where three militants and a policeman were killed in a gunfight on Monday.         
	The clamour to remove bunkers and thin out the police/paramilitary presence from the urban areas had compelled the Omar Abdullah government to give in, it said.         
	Official sources said Omar took strong objection to the statement, forcing the army to withdraw it.         
	All these decisions are taken by the state government jointly with the Union home ministry, an official said.         
	The chief minister told a gathering here that the government has taken the necessary steps for removing 25 bunkers from Srinagar and that CRPF personnel, too, would be moved out. At least 1,000 CRPF men are being removed, a source said.         
	The decision to remove the bunkers was taken on September 29 and in the first phase, 16 bunkers were removed from Srinagar in October.         
	The same methods will be adopted in Anantnag and other towns with fast improvement of the situation, Omar said.         
	More than 70 CRPF battalions are deployed in Jammu and Kashmir and the majority of them are serving in the Valley.         
	In the five-month streets protests in the Valley that have killed 110 people, 1,274 CRPF personnel and 2,747 policemen were injured.

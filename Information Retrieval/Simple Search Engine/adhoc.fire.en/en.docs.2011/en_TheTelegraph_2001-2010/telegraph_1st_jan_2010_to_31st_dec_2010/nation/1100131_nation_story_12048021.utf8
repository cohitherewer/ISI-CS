          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 30: The CPM leadership is likely to expand the partys state secretariat tomorrow.         
	Bengal CPM secretary Biman Bose today asked members of the state committee to assemble for a meeting tomorrow morning before resuming the two-day session of the extended committee that began today. Before that, the state secretariat will meet.         
	Bose has been laying stress on promoting younger and dynamic leaders at all levels to invigorate the organisation.        
	The expansion of the 14-member secretariat is considered necessary in view of the vacancies created by the death of Subhas Chakraborty and Jyoti Basu as well as the ill health of some members.         
	We are yet to decide on the expansion. It may be discussed if we find time tomorrow, said Benoy Konar, the senior-most member of the secretariat. There is no hard-and-fast rule laid down in our party constitution that vacancies have to be filled up to ensure a certain number. Neither is there any time frame, he added.        
	According to some secretariat members, the expansion as well as filling vacancies were supposed to have been completed by January. But they couldnt be done because of lack of consensus.        
	Various leaders were tipped as frontrunners from time to time. Among them were former chief whip and city unit leader Rabin Deb, Bankura unit secretary Amiya Patra and his West Midnapore counterpart Dipak Sarkar.        
	Deb, who looks after the party organisation in Purulia along with Bose, is known for his organising capabilities. Patra ensured the partys victory in Bankura despite threats from Maoists and the Trinamul Congress.        
	Sarkar is not young but was instrumental in retaining the Jhargram parliamentary constituency despite the partys rout in Lalgarh and the adjoining areas of Junglemahal.         
	They may find berths in view of the partys stakes in the districts hit by Maoist violence. The units of both districts today reported some recovery of turf lost to the Maoists.        
	The names of finance minister Asim Dasgupta and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, both known to be close to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, have also cropped up. But their administrative responsibilities could come in the way of their inclusion.        
	Other names doing the rounds are those of former MPs Hannan Mollah and Nilotpal Basu, womens wing leader Shyamali Gupta, Rajya Sabha MP Mainul Hasan and tourism minister Manab Mukherjee.        
	Some aged and unwell members like Konar and North 24 Parganas secretary Amitabha Bose, who had earlier expressed their desire to step down, have changed their mind.         
	I sought to be relieved of my responsibilities after I fell seriously ill following an operation. I thought I wont be able to recover. But now I am fit, thanks to new treatment. However, I will leave (the secretariat) if there is a more competent younger comrade, Konar said.        
	In the presence of general secretary Prakash Karat, politburo member Sitaram Yechury and Bhattacharjee, some district leaders chided the leadership today for concentrating too much on corruption among the lower rung. Do you think all the wrong things are done only at the lower level? a district leader asked.         
	Another cited the example of Sabala Mela, sponsored by the government, in a property owned by convicted bhujia baron Prabhu Sankar Agarwal. The chief minister had inaugurated the fair.

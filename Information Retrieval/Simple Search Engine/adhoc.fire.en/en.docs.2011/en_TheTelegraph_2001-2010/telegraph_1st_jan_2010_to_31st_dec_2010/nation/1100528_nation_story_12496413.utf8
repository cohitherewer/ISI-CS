          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	Calcutta, May 27: At least one of the three Calcutta-based employees on Air Indias sack list cut a brave front today, though the airline has not always reinstated punished personnel.        
	The three have been identified as Surojit Kumar, Samir Mondal and Ajay Sarkar  all office-bearers of the two unions that spearheaded the strike this week and were derecognised today.        
	Vikrant Sansare, a pilot who had met with a similar fate in 2003, has not been reinstated by the national carrier till now.        
	Sansare was the general secretary of the Indian Pilots Guild, the countrys oldest association representing professional pilots, in April 2003 when the members refused to fly to SARS-hit areas.        
	Air India then derecognised the guild. After six years, in April 2009, the airline restored the recognition to the guild but Sansare was not given his job back.        
	 The recognition was given back under certain terms and conditions. However, the then IPG president, Kenneth Khan, and general secretary, Sansare, had not resumed duty, said an Air India official.         
	Khan had retired after a disciplinary inquiry and Sansare fought a legal battle with Air India. Later, Sansare joined a private sector organisation and the order was not withdrawn, the official said, adding that he could not recall the outcome of the case.        
	But at least one of the three sacked employees in Calcutta said he was confident of being reinstated.         
	 I am sure the problem will be solved. I am not planning any legal action individually. I am in touch with national leaders of our union. Whatever happens, well make a collective move, said a leader of a derecognised union.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ayodhya appeal in SC, glare on faith
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ayodhya appeal in SC, glare on faith
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 15: The first appeal against the Ayodha judgment was filed in the Supreme Court today with the petitioner, the Jamiat-Ulama-i-Hind, arguing the order was wrong in using faith as a basis and decreeing a three-way split of the disputed land.        
	The core finding as regards the alleged place of birth of Lord Shri Ram, is based on the professed belief of Hindus and not on evidence. In law, belief and/or faith has no place and a party cannot be denied ownership against the weight of evidence, the Jamiat, one of the parties to the case, said in reference to Allahabad High Courts September 30 verdict.        
	If faith were to be used as a yardstick to decide the ownership, Muslims should have been permitted to use religious scriptures to prove their claim, the petition filed by Jamiat general secretary Mohammad Siddiq said.        
	The Sunni Central Wakf Board, which has been given a third of the land along with equal shares to Ram Lalla (the deity) and the Nirmohi Akhara, had said it would challenge the verdict but is yet to file an appeal.        
	The Jamiat has suggested that the high court ruling amounted to validating the demolition of the Babri Masjid. The mosque was illegally demolished, however, (and) the ruins still exist. The foundation is still intact. Therefore, it was incumbent on the court to uphold the rule of law and not to validate an illegal act (demolition).        
	The petition said the high court had also erred in decreeing the suit in favour of the deities (an allusion to Ram Lalla) and ignored the fact that the idol was illegally placed in the mosque on the night of December 22-23, 1949. By no stretch of imagination could it (Ram Lalla) be suggested to be a legal entity, it added.        
	If the demolition was illegal, the act should not have been given the seal of approval but should have been deprecated. Any such illegal dispossession always follows by restoration of possession in the spirit of rule of law.         
	Questions have also been raised on the order to divide the plot. The high court, the Jamiat said, had treated the case as a partition suit and ordered the three-way division, though no party had sought it. It was nobodys case that the Muslims, Hindus and the Nirmohi Akhara were in joint possession, much less joint title-holders, it said.        
	Their claims were mutually exclusive, with each set claiming the entire property as its own, the Jamiat said, adding that the proper relief would have been to restore the pre-December 1949 position.        
	The Jamiat also said the Nirmohi Akhara should not have been regarded as a party different from the Hindus and allotted a third of the plot as there was evidence that the organisation only possessed two small patches of the disputed area. These were the Ram Chabutra of 39.6 square yards and the much smaller Sita Ki Rasoi.

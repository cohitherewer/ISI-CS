The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ayodhya stirs Lalu hope
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ayodhya stirs Lalu hope
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Lalu Prasad                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 8: Lalu Prasads comeback hopes have been revived by the Ayodhya verdict, with his RJD colleagues saying Muslims will back them over rivals Congress and the ruling Janata Dal (United) in the upcoming Bihar polls.        
	Muslims are discussing among themselves that all events related to the Babri Masjid  from secretly putting idols in the mosque, opening of locks, demolition of the mosque and now the verdict  took place under Congress governments, said a senior RJD leader.         
	Leaders close to Lalu Prasad claimed they had feedback that Muslims were particularly upset with the Congress.         
	Before last weeks Allahabad High Court ruling for a three-way division of the disputed land, RJD leaders had expressed fears that the Congress would eat into their Muslim votes. Lalu Prasad had become a darling of the Muslims after arresting L.K. Advani during his 1990 rath yatra in Bihar.        
	The first phase of voting in the six-stage Bihar elections, spread almost over a month, will be held on October 21.        
	Prior to the verdict, the belief was that the states 16 per cent Muslim population would go three ways, with some favouring even the Dal (United), whose leader Nitish Kumar heads the ruling coalition with the BJP.         
	Despite his alliance with the BJP, Muslims were said to have no doubts about Nitishs secular credentials.        
	But the concern now is that Muslims will be averse to backing Nitish as it would amount to strengthening the BJP, some of whose leaders have been aggressively speaking of reviving the temple campaign. The verdict is sure to turn away Muslims despite all our good work, said a Muslim leader of the Dal (United).        
	But Dal (United) Mp Ali Anwar insisted Ayodhya would have no major impact on the polls. The central issue in Bihar is development.

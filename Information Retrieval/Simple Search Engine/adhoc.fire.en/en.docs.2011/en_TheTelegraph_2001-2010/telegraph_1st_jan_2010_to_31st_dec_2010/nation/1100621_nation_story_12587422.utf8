          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, June 21: Tirumala temple authorities today chaperoned Vijay Mallya and his entourage of 150 for a special darshan, delaying the miles-long weekend queues and putting under the scanner again the shrines VIP privileges that inconvenience general devotees.        
	Angry crowds protested the special treatment to Mallya, elected to the Rajya Sabha last week, and claimed it caused a two-hour delay.         
	D.K. Adikeshavulu, the chairman of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam, had apparently allowed the VIP break for the UB group chairman in violation of temple norms that forbid such special treatment by jumping queues on Saturdays and Sundays.        
	Devotees had protested the special treatment given to Amitabh Bachchan and his family a few years back in a way that held up the general queues.

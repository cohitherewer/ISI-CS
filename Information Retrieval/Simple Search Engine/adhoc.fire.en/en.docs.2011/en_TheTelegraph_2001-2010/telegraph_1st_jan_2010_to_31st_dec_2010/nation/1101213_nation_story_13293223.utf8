	New Delhi, Dec. 12 (PTI): An army court of inquiry has found a colonel guilty of misdemeanour after a probe revealed that he asked the front desk of the hotel he was staying in to send a woman up to his room while on training in Gangtok.        
	Sources said the army would decide whether to proceed on the courts recommendations against Colonel Sandeep Singh, who was facing charges of misbehaving with a woman while drunk at a casino.        
	Four colleagues, including two others of Singhs rank, were witness to his behaviour, the court said.        
	They had gone to Gangtok earlier this month as part of their forward area tour, mandatory under the course.

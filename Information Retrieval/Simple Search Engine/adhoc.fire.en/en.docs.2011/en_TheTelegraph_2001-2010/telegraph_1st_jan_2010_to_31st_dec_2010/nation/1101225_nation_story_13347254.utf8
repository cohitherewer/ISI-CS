                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Church casts Net to connect with faithful
          CITHARA PAUL                                                Plugged in      
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: The Web appears to have been cast wide over the pulpit.        
	Catholic priests in India will now learn about blogs and Facebook in addition to boning up on religious texts as part of a Church drive to reach out to the large number of faithful hooked on the Internet.        
	The move is in tune with message of Pope Benedict XVI, who has asked the Catholic priests across the world to use all multimedia tools at their disposal to preach the Gospel and to engage with people of other religions and cultures.        
	Priests should use cutting-edge technologies to express themselves and lead their communities. Make astute use of the unique possibilities offered by modern communications, the Pope had said in his message.        
	Blogs, Facebook, YouTube and Wikipedia will soon become part of curriculum for the seminarians. A wing of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Indias (CBCI), the Commission for Social Communication, has already launched a resource-book, Communications in Formation, for use in seminaries across the country.        
	Communication for Pastoral Leadership, another course book being put together by the commission, is peppered with Internet basics  how to write and read blogs, and use Facebook and other social network sites.        
	The CBCI has asked priests and bishops to start blogs to share information and offer guidance to their followers. Dioceses and major churches in metros have already decided to launch their own websites by next year. Broadband connections have been made a must for all seminaries, with access to all the students.        
	The CBCIs Father Mani Mekkunnel underscored the importance of the Internet and the need to learn its ways. The Internet is a great opportunity for consecrated life and it can act as a stimulus to all. The Church is of the view that every Catholic religious figure should have the right to use the Internet, he said.        
	Father Vincent Antony of the CBCIs Kerala unit echoed the view, and pointed out that the followers were no longer restricted to those who attended Sunday Mass. It is important to offer pastoral care to the growing Internet community, said Antony.         
	According to him, Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli, the head of the Vaticans communication office, had urged the Indian Church to take to the Web world to reach out to the growing number of Netizens. We are living in a changed world where there will be more Christians logging on to the Internet for shopping rather than attending the Christmas Mass. So it is imperative to speak to them in the language they understand, Antony said.        
	Pope Benedicts aides invited representatives from Facebook, Google video-sharing website YouTube and online encyclopaedia Wikipedia to the European Episcopal Commission for Media, a Vatican event held recently to explore ways in which the Church could get its message across to a larger number of people.

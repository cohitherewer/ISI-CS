          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 24: The BJP has taken strong objection to Kashmir interlocutors view that any comprehensive solution to the Kashmir issue was not possible without Pakistans involvement.         
	It has asked the Prime Ministers Office to immediately clarify if this was part of the brief given to the interlocutors.         
	Dileep Padgaonkar, who heads the three-member panel, said yesterday: We are here to look for a permanent solution to the Kashmir issue but a permanent solution is not possible without the involvement of Pakistan. Any attempt to have a comprehensive solution without Pakistans involvement is not possible. Pakistan has to be involved.         
	The BJP statement today said: What is the Pakistan dimension that the interlocutor is referring to? Is this a part of the brief given or has he stepped beyond their (the panels) brief? the BJP asked. These comments sound as if they are rationalising Pakistans stand on its unfinished agenda on Kashmir.

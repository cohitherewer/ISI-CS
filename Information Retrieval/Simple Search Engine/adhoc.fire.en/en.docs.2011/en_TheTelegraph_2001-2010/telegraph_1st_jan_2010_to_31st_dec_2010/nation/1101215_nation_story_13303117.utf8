The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Judge punches hole in ex-CJIs version
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Judge punches hole in ex-CJIs version
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: Sitting Supreme Court judge H.L. Gokhale, who was Madras High Court Chief Justice when Union minister A. Raja purportedly made an unattended call to a judge to seek a favourable bail order for his family friends, today disclosed that former Chief Justice of India (CJI) K.G. Balakrishnan was told of the name of the minister.        
	The former CJI was not only informed of the incident but was also forwarded a copy of a complaint letter that Justice R. Regupathi wrote, spelling out Rajas name for further action, said an unparalleled media release issued by Gokhale to Supreme Court reporters.         
	The statement fuelled suspicions that the former CJI had avoided taking note of the name of the Union minister to sidestep the need for further action. The case had sparked a furore then.         
	Todays statement by Gokhale, saying Balakrishan was told about the incident, may make untenable the former CJIs current position as the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission.         
	Referring to Balakrishnans statement that Gokhales letter did not mention the name of any Union minister having tried to talk to Regupathi over the phone to influence him, Gokhale said: With respect  I may point out that Justice Regupathis letter was already with him, and in the second paragraph thereof, Justice Regupathi had specifically mentioned the name of minister Raja.         
	Balakrishnan had claimed in a media conference here on December 8, 2010, that he had never received a complaint about this and hence could not have recommended any further action. Balakrishnan said he had not received any letter from Justice R. Regupathi regarding the incident when he was CJI.        
	He had also said that the report on the incident which Gokhale sent as Madras High Court Chief Justice did not mention the name of any minister having tried to talk to Regupathi on the phone. Therefore, there was no occasion for him to recommend any further action.         
	Today, Gokhale issued the media release contesting Balakrishnans claims. Gokhale claimed he had forwarded to the former CJI a copy of Regupathis letter dated July 2, 2009.        
	The former CJI acknowledged receipt of his letter on August 8, 2009, Gokhale said. Vide letter dated July 5, 2009, you have forwarded to me a detailed letter/report dated July 2, 2009, of Mr Justice R. Regupathi explaining the actual state of affairs concerning the alleged misconduct of a Union minister of the Government of India reported in the media, the media release said, quoting the former CJIs response.         
	Narrating the events that unfolded after the alleged call made by the minister, Gokhale said the former CJI also sought his views and comments on a copy of a memorandum he had received on the subject. The memorandum had been submitted by a large number of MPs to the Prime Minister.         
	Gokhale said he replied to this letter on August 11, 2009. The judge said he had no personal knowledge of the incident and had gone by the contents of Regupathis letter.         
	Regupathi had claimed that a lawyer appearing before him in chamber (as opposed to an open court hearing which was the norm) had told him to grant bail to certain persons in a marksheet forgery case saying they were family friends of a Union minister by the name of Raja.         
	The lawyer had then tried to hand over his mobile phone to the judge to speak to the minister. The judge refused to talk to the caller and complained to Gokhale, the then chief justice of the high court.        
	The case hit the headlines recently again when the lawyer, K. Chandramohan, was suspended by the high court from functioning as the president of the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu.        
	Balakrishnan had convened a media conference the next day and disclaimed any knowledge about the incident or the minister behind the alleged call.        
	Propriety demands that when the CJI gets a complaint, he should act on it. According to the judiciarys code of conduct, high court chief justices cannot raise such issues with their political counterparts. They have to be taken up by the CJI with the President. The President can then seek the cabinets advice and take action.         
	Raja had denied he had made any such call  something only phone records can establish since Regupathi did not take the call and will not be able to vouch if indeed it was the minister who was at the other end.         
	If Balakrishnan had pursued the issue last year and probe had established the call had gone from Rajas phone, the minister would have had to resign then, instead of being forced out last month.        
	In Ahmedabad, Balakrishnan said: It was a letter written by Justice Regupathi to the then Madras High Court chief justice (Gokhale). How can I reveal the contents of that letter?        
	You must understand I had said that Justice Regupathi has not written to me as Chief Justice of India. He has not written any letter to me. I was only saying (last week) it is not a letter written to me. Chief Justice Gokhale is a good judge. He has sent a correct report, the former CJI said.

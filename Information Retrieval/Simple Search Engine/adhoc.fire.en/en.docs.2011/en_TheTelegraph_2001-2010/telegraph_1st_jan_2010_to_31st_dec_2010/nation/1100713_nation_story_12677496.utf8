                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Omar talks plea boost
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, July 12: A beleaguered Omar Abdullah today got a shot in the arm when his call to start internal and external dialogue on Kashmir found favour with almost all in an all-party meeting.         
	The meeting urged the Government of India to strengthen the ongoing peace process through the internal and external dialogue, read a resolution passed by representatives of nine political parties.         
	Jammu and Kashmirs main Opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), stayed away from the meeting.         
	Talks between India and Pakistan were stopped after the 26/11 Mumbai attack. Later this week though, foreign ministers of both countries will meet in Islamabad.         
	On the internal front, dialogue between the government and the separatists have been stalled since 2005.         
	Sources said Omars plea for resumption of talks was supported by ally Congress, despite Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs condition in June that Delhi would only speak to groups that oppose violence.         
	A participant at the meeting said: All the parties today agreed that there should be talks without pre-conditions.         
	The Omar-led Jammu and Kashmir government had invited 12 political parties for the talks.         
	Six resolutions were passed in the meeting of which five were adopted unanimously.         
	A resolution demanding an inquiry into the killings of civilians in the past month was opposed by the BJP. The all-party meeting urged the state government to have an inquiry conducted to ascertain the circumstances leading to the death of the civilians, the resolution read.         
	But BJP leader Ashok Khauria said the call for a probe into the killings was a conspiracy to lower the morale of the security forces.         
	Omar read out the resolutions after the four-hour meeting. It expressed anguish on the loss of lives and appealed for adequate relief to the families of the deceased. The resolution also expressed dismay over the economic losses suffered during the disturbances.         
	Keeping in view the suffering of the people, huge economic losses and the adverse impact on the education of children, the meeting made a fervent appeal to all, irrespective of their political affiliation, to come forward and help in the restoration of peace, the resolution said. It also said an all-party delegation would call on the Prime Minister and discuss the problems of people in the state.         
	Besides the PDP, the Jammu-based Panthers Party also stayed away.

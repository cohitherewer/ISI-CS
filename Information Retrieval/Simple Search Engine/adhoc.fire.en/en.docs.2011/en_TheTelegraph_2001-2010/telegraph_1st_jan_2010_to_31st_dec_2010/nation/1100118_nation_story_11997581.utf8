                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      How Basu saved my job in Telegraph

	The rain hadnt stopped falling that July 84 morning and I reached Writers Buildings a little late.        
	It was past 1pm and I was in a hurry  Jyoti Basu was to hold a news conference.        
	When I reached the secretariat to cover the conference for The Telegraph, I got a shock. It was over.        
	Some reporters still around told me Basu had already held a lengthy news conference and was about to leave Writers for lunch.        
	Seldom had Basu held a news conference so early in the day, but I couldnt obviously tell that to my boss.        
	For a minute I stood cursing myself for starting late. Then I decided.        
	There wasnt much security those days in the secretariat and I barged into Basus chamber. His private secretary tried to stop me, but didnt seem to mind the intrusion all that much as mine was a familiar face at Writers.        
	But once inside Basus chamber, my courage ran out as the chief minister looked straight at me and asked what I was doing there after the news conference was over.        
	I stammered something and then almost broke down at his feet. I would be pulled up, I pleaded, if I didnt get the details of the news conference.        
	Basu looked at me, paused for a moment, then asked me to take a seat.         
	I sat on a chair and was about to take out my reporters notebook when I heard Basu tell someone to get a cup of tea for me with cashew nuts.         
	I know your editor, he smiled at me. Aage ek cup ga-ram cha khao tarpor tomake shob bole debo (First have a cup of hot tea, then Ill tell you everything).         
	As I sat sipping tea, I saw him go through files lying on his large table. I asked him if I was making him late for lunch, but he just smiled.        
	A while later he asked me to note down the details of the news conference. After I had jotted them down, he asked me to read out what I had written. I was allowed to leave after he was satisfied that there had been no distortion of facts.        
	Nearly a year later, I again approached Basu to tell him how I was threatened at gunpoint by one of his ministers.        
	I had been told to meet the then minister of state for civil defence, the late Ram Chatterjee, at his Tarakeswar house in Hooghly to ask about a pending case against him.        
	Chatterjee seemed agitated. Suddenly, in the middle of a heated discussion, he took out a revolver and pointed it at me. He said he would shoot if I didnt leave. I ran out.         
	The next morning I went to Writers and narrated the incident to Rathinda (Rathin Sengupta, the then home secretary). He took me to Basu.         
	When I told Basu about my experience, he summoned Chatterjee to his chamber. Right in front of me he rebuked the minister. Chatterjee later shook hands with me as Basu looked on.        
	Since then, I used to call up Basu at his Indira Bhavan home quite often, even after office hours.        
	Basu became more accessible after 1996 when his party denied him a chance to become Prime Minister.         
	Convinced I had free access to Basu, my son, then a Class VI student of St Xaviers, one day insisted on calling him up from our Dhakuria home to pay his respects.         
	I had always discouraged my son from calling up Basu but that day he wouldnt listen. Finally, I relented.        
	I dialled Basus number. He was having breakfast. When I told him my son wanted to speak to him, he immediately asked if it was a Thursday. A former Xaverian, he knew St Xaviers was closed on Thursdays.        
	He then asked for my son and they spoke  for over 15 minutes.        
	Barun Ghosh kept his job and has risen to be a special correspondent

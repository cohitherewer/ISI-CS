	New Delhi, June 24: The monsoon is expected to further advance across Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand over the next three to four days marking intensified rainfall activity, meteorologists said today.         
	Rainfall from June 17-23 was subdued, 21 per cent below the expected normal levels.         
	But weather features suggest that a spell of wet weather lies in the week ahead. Overall, things appear to be getting better for the season, said Damodar Pai, a senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune.         
	He said sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean appeared to be cooling  a phenomenon known as La Nina and associated with more rainfall over India.         
	The IMD is scheduled to deliver on Friday an updated long-range forecast of the 2010 monsoon.         
	Another weather parameter called the Madden-Julian Oscillation  a pattern of anomalous rainfall that circles the globe  is also currently over the Indian Ocean and could contribute to an intensification and further advance of the monsoon next week, Pai said.

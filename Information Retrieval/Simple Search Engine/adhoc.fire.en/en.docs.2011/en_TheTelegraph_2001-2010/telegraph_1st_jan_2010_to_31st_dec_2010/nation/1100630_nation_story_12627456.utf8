	Calcutta, June 29: Mamata Banerjee today showered more orders on Burn Standard and Braithwaite, two struggling Bengal wagon makers her railway ministry took over earlier this month.        
	We need around 20,000 wagons every year but there is a shortage in supply.You will get so many orders you wont be able to finish, she told the employees of Braithwaite at its Hide Road factory in Calcutta.        
	She also visited the Burn Standard unit. This was her first trip to the two units after the Centre cleared the takeovers. At both factories, which together employ over 1,500 people, Mamata showed copies of the fresh orders to the employees.        
	Railway officials put the value of todays deals at Rs 41 crore. These are in addition to the 500 wagons ordered from each of the two manufacturers after the companies takeover on June 10.        
	Mamata said the railways would procure 750 wagons and 15 electrically operated overhead cranes from Braithwaite, and 500 wagons from Burn Standard. The railways will also provide Rs 30 crore to Burn Standard  suffering losses for the past 16 years  for new plant and machinery. Braithwaite had also slipped into the red but clawed its way back from losses in 2005.        
	Bhalo kore chotpot kaaj korun (Work well and fast), Mamata told Burn Standard employees who had gathered in a field at the plants sprawling compound in Howrah.        
	Sunil Kumar Rishi, MD of Braithwaite, said his plant would get more equipment to meet the orders. Burn Standard MD S. P. Bakshi said the company had an annual capacity to make 2,100 wagons but that came down to around 850 last year as the machinery is over 40 years old and has not been replaced.

	April 6: From the age of the Ramayan to the 21st century, Dantewada has remained a fertile ground for those living in exile.        
	Hundreds of years ago, residents of the region were blessed with the presence of Ram, who is said to have lived in exile for 13 long years in the forests of Dandakaranya, as the area was then known.         
	In Chhattisgarh, many Ramnamis  a Dalit sect whose members were barred from visiting temples  still tattoo the name Ram all over their body to make God inseparable from them. The legend is that as blood flows from every pore, they chant Ram, Ram to withstand the pain.        
	For centuries till the early years after Independence, Dantewada, named after the Danteshwari temple in the district, remained a gateway to the land of traditional values, diverse cultures, spiritualism and mysticism, eco-tourism and medical tourism, rocks and hills.        
	In 1952, the local tribals had another set of visitors.         
	From neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, hundreds of young ultra-Left guerrillas shifted base to Dantewada and surrounding areas after their home state intensified its operation against rebels.         
	The simplicity of the local folk, and the common food and language, helped the rebels mix easily with the tribals. The visitors earned the tag of saviour when they targeted the local patwaris (revenue officials) and forest guards who represented the oppressive state.        
	The saviours have now turned killers.         
	After the Salwa Judum  the anti-Maoist militia backed by the Chhattisgarh government  virtually every villager has become a suspect either in the eyes of the security agencies or the Maoists.         
	The absence of land reforms, underdevelopment, exploitation, corruption, the lowest literacy numbers and the porous borders with Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Orissa have all combined to turn Dantewada into the most violent and anarchic region in the country.        
	The natives do not understand the intricacies of the games being played at North Block  the seat of the home ministry in New Delhi --- at Raipur by the Raman Singh government or at the den of Kishan, the on-the-run Maoist commander. Dantewadas tribals wonder why they are receiving bullets from those they had given shelter to. The rebels have their own explanation: after the sudden spurt in the anti-Naxalite movement, it is a battle for sheer survival.         
	Steeped in religion, many local people feel it is destiny that has got them embroiled in the spiral of violence. They point out that Dantewada and the rest of Bastar were soaked in blood during the Ramayan era too.         
	In what is currently Kanker, Bastar and Dantewada, Ram and his brother Lakshman had to fight many bitter battles to evict the rakshasas (demons) from the region.        
	The natives believe that Geedam, a small town in Dantewada with a population of about 6,000 and famous for the local mahua brew, chironji, silk insects and dried mangoes, is the Giddham mentioned in the Ramayan.         
	It was here that Jatayu is said to have fought with Ravan and laid down his life while trying to rescue Sita from his clutches.         
	Geedam has a patch that is barren --- a striking fact since the rest of the area has a dense forest cover. The faithful attribute it to the heat generated by Ravans reported flying object, the Pushpak Viman.         
	They believe that it was this particular spot in Geedam where Ram had his hut, and from where Sita was abducted by Ravan who appeared as a sage at her doorstep.        
	Near the Danteshwari temple in Dantewada town, flow two rivers called Shankini and Dankini, named after two demon women, Shaakini and Daakini.        
	The battle for supremacy between the saviours and the demons continues in this age too. The only debate is over who the modern-day demons are.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Days of blunder: How the party burnt the Delhi bridge 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Days of blunder: How the party burnt the Delhi bridge 
                                          
	May 1996. The Red star shines in full splendour over the CPM headquarters in the heart of New Delhi. A page is about to be turned in the history of the communist movement and the nation.        
	Jyoti Basu is on the threshold of becoming the first communist Prime Minister of India.        
	Never before has the CPM been at the centre of such riveting attention in national politics. The frail but steely 82-year-old, the patriarch of the largest communist party of India, is looking towards his comrades for a nod of assent that will catapult him as a protagonist on the national stage.        
	Basu, the Bengal governments mascot for 19 long years, has the whos who of Indian politics pleading with him to wear the mantle of Prime Minister.        
	The United Front, a conglomerate of regional satraps and their parties, is in a position to assume power with a little help. The Congress is ready to accept Basu as Prime Minister and support from outside a government led by him.        
	Eight chief ministers from across the country urge Basu to lead them into a new age of coalition politics. The air crackles with excitement and expectation.        
	The CPM, confined to three states for decades, finally has a chance to go down in history not as a footnote but a full-fledged chapter. All because it is fortunate to have on its masthead an icon whose face has become the partys identity card.              
	But it was not to happen. In less than a week, the tide of opportunity had ebbed. The CPM had shut the door on the possibility of a new era, preferring to remain confined to the still and placid waters of its bastions of Bengal, Kerala and Tripura.        
	Here is an account of those four days when a storm raged over A.K. Gopalan Bhavan in Delhi.              
	May 11: The CPM politburo meets to discuss whether the party can participate in a third front-led government supported by the Congress from outside.        
	General secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet tells his comrades that all the third front constituents want the CPM to participate in the government and Basu to become Prime Minister.        
	Surjeet argues that it is necessary for the party to give its assent so that the BJP can be kept out. He says President Shanker Dayal Sharma would attach more credibility to a government that has more parties inside than outside.        
	Prakash Karat, the then second-in-command and now the general secretary of the CPM, vetoes Surjeets proposal. He says that with only 53 Left Front members in the Lok Sabha, the CPM would be in no position to influence the governments policies even if it participated in it. S.R. Pillai from Kerala and Benoy Choudhury from Bengal support Karat.        
	The same evening, Surjeet and Basu meet the President to discuss the formation of a government at the Centre.              
	May 12: The CPMs central committee members arrive in Delhi to attend an emergency meeting called by the politburo to discuss participation in the government and Basus Prime Ministership.              
	May 13: At 10am, the CPM headquarters is chock-a-block with national and international media. The central committee members refuse to talk as they troop in to attend the historic meeting. Skirmishes break out between Basus bodyguards and the media as journalists jostle to catch a word from the Bengal chief minister who keeps mum.        
	As the morning passes and the afternoon sun blazes on, the temperature rises in the room where the central committee is meeting. Nerves are frayed as many Bengal and Kerala members dig in their heels and refuse to allow Basu to cross the threshold dividing regional and national politics.        
	Others want the party as well as Basu to take up the challenge. A strident note comes from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee who argues that the party must not allow the historic moment to pass it by. He has the support of Hannan Mollah, Samar Mukhopadhyay and M.A. Baby.        
	Ranged on the other side is a formidable lobby of no-changers: Biman Bose, Anil Biswas, Niren Ghosh, Sukomal Sen and Kanak Mukhopadhyay from Bengal; and E.K. Nayanar, V.S. Achuthanandan and Susheela Gopalan from Kerala.         
	They cite the CPMs unpalatable experiences with the United Front government in Bengal and say the party should support a United Front government in Delhi only from outside.        
	The central committee meets again in the evening, only to reaffirm the decision not to join the government. Soon, Basu, Surjeet and CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan drive down to Bihar Bhavan where the rest of the United Front leaders are assembled.        
	Surjeet is in the same car with Bardhan. It is a moment of deep regret for the CPM general secretary who feels the weight of his partys rigidity, its refusal to break out of its cocoon. Surjeet expresses his fears about the younger second line of command in the party  those who refuse to look beyond Bengal and Kerala.        
	The CPM general secretary informs the United Front leaders of his partys decision not to allow Basu to become Prime Minister.        
	The United Front leaders go into a huddle. Around 9pm, V.P. Singh, flanked by Surjeet and Basu, address the media. Surjeet looks ashen. Basu is characteristically inscrutable.        
	VP informs the media the CPM central committee has rejected the United Fronts appeal to join the government.         
	But we have urged the central committee to reconsider the decision at another meeting tomorrow, the former Prime Minister says.              
	May 14: The central committee meets once more. The no-changers attack Surjeet for trying to push a line that has already been rejected by the committee. The CPM general secretary says he wants to quit his post. But the central committee rejects that too, saying the subject is not on the days agenda but can be taken up at the next meeting. Basu says he would go along with the partys decision.        
	The sharp division within the central committee forces a resolution to be put to vote. Twenty-seven members oppose joining the government against 22 who support such a move. A historic blunder is committed.              
	May 15: A former chief minister of Karnataka, H.D. Deve Gowda, is chosen Prime Minister by the United Front.

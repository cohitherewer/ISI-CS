The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Deemed dissent from Nitish
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Deemed dissent from Nitish
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has challenged the Centres plans to strip the deemed university status of one of Indias foremost Buddhist schools, offering the first glimpse of politics that could shroud action against such institutions.         
	Nitish has written to human resource development minister Kapil Sibal, demanding that Bihar-based Nava Nalanda Mahavihara be allowed to retain its deemed status despite being found substandard by a review panel, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	He is the first major politician to object to the HRD ministrys plans to withdraw the deemed status from an institution found unworthy of the tag.         
	Sibal has asked his ministry to draft a response, but Nitishs letter has left the government, and the ministry in particular, treading a fine balance between ensuring quality and exhibiting political sensitivity.         
	The Mahavihara is one of the four government-run deemed universities among 44 institutions found unfit for the deemed tag.         
	An autonomous institution under the Union culture ministry, the Mahavihara focuses on research in the Pali lang- uage and teaches Buddhism through Tibetan, Sanskrit, Chinese, Mongolian, Japanese and other Asian languages.         
	Nitishs letter has left HRD ministry officials scratching their heads for a response for several reasons, sources said.         
	Accepting the plea  and withdrawing from planned action against the institution  would draw charges of bias from the other 43 blacklisted deemed varsities, especially the private ones.         
	It would weaken the moral position on ensuring quality that has won Sibal and the central government support from wide sections of society.         
	But withdrawing the deemed tag, especially after the Bihar chief ministers letter, will not be easy either.         
	The letter argues that as the Mahavihara is the best known institute for research in Pali and in Buddhism, withdrawing deemed status would hurt these fields of study in India.         
	The HRD ministry argued that the institute  even if its deemed status were to be withdrawn  could continue as a college affiliated to a university, and its resea- rch and teaching need not suffer.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Mumbai, Nov. 11: Prithviraj Chavan was today sworn in as Maharashtra chief minister along with 10 NCP leaders, including outgoing deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal who appears to have accepted Ajit Pawars anointment in his place.        
	It is a great honour for me. I will try to do justice to the responsibility the party high command has bestowed upon me. I will work hard to make Maharashtra the number one state in the country, said Chavan, who as Union minister had played a key role in the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal.         
	Apart from Bhujbal and Sharad Pawars nephew Ajit, the NCP leaders who took oath were R.R. Patil, Jayant Patil, Ganesh Naik, Lakshman Dhoble, Vijay Gavit, Sunil Tatkare, Jaidutt Kshirsagar and Manohar Naik. Naik, an MLA from Pusad in Yavatmal, is the younger brother of Pawars arch rival and former Congress chief minister Sudhakarrao Naik.         
	Ashok Chavan, who lost the chief ministers chair over allegations of involvement in the Adarsh housing society scam, was present at the swearing-in.         
	Former chief ministers Vilasrao Deshmukh, Sushil Kumar Shinde and Narayan Rane, all of whom have been linked to Adarsh society, were also present. The three were thrown out of the race for the top job after Rahul Gandhi made it clear that the next chief minister should be a person with a clean image.         
	Dapper in a black Jodhpur bandhgala jacket, Chavan took the oath in Marathi, ending speculation over whether his long stint in Delhi had made him less proficient in his native tongue.         
	Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray had demanded yesterday that the new chief minister take oath in Marathi. It is irrelevant whether he has worked in Delhi or not. He has been designated Maharashtra chief minister and he should take oath in Marathi, which is the state language. In his TV interviews, he referred to Mumbai as Bambai. I would like to remind him that Maharashtras capital is Mumbai, Thackeray said.         
	Ajit had travelled to Delhi to meet his uncle and NCP chief Sharad Pawar along with civil aviation minister Praful Patel before the swearing-in. Initially, the chief minister suggested that only the two of us take oath. But the NCP has a tradition that along with the deputy chief minister, the partys senior leadership also takes oath. So we requested Prithvirajji that 10 of us will take oath today. In three or four days, more cabinet members would be sworn in. Only after that will we decide the portfolios, he told reporters earlier.         
	Hectic lobbying for cabinet berths and portfolios is likely to begin in the Congress. Deshmukh, who met Prithviraj in Delhi yesterday, is likely to lobby for a cabinet berth for his son Amit, an MLA from Latur. Shinde is likely to push for his daughter Praniti, an MLA from Solapur.        
	Bhujbal is expected to either demand more portfolios in addition to PWD or seek a berth for his son Pankaj.

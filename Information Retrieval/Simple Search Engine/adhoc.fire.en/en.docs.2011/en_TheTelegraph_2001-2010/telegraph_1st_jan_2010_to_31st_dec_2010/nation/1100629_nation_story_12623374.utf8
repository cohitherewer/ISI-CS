The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Akshay touch to India-Canada ties
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Akshay touch to India-Canada ties
          K.P. NAYAR                                                Manmohan Singh (top) with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper; Akshay Kumar who was present at the dinner with them      
	Toronto, June 28: For the Prime Ministers of India and Canada, last night was a romance that ended well in a marriage, Bollywood style. The difference was that it was real, not reel Bollywood.        
	Thirty-seven years after Indira Gandhi visited Canada, film star Akshay Kumar brought together Manmohan Singh and Stephen Harper on Canadian soil formally ending a long hiatus that set into Indo-Canadian relations a year after Indira Gandhis visit when she tested Indias first nuclear bomb.         
	Although several Canadian Prime Ministers have visited India, no Indian Prime Minister visited that country since Indira Gandhis tour.        
	The Bollywood star, a favourite of the Canadian Prime Minister, acted as master of ceremonies at an unconventional dinner hosted by Harper for Singh when the Canadians added a bilateral component to Singhs stay here at the end of the G20 summit.        
	Last November, when Harper was in Mumbai on an official visit, he met Akshay and asked him to be one of the 14 international torchbearers for carrying the Olympic torch in Toronto. Canada hosted the 21st Winter Olympics in Vancouver in February.        
	Later, the Canadian Tourism Commission appointed Akshay its tourism ambassador to India.        
	The gala dinner, to which Harper invited several hundred Canadians, many of them of Indian origin, followed a historic one-on-one meeting between the two Prime Ministers last evening. It was followed by delegationlevel talks, which culminated in the signing of a nuclear deal between India and Canada broadly on the lines of a similar deal which India has signed with the US, Russia and France.        
	In a media note, that said much between the lines, the ministry of external affairs said about the nuclear deal that India and Canada are friendly states with comprehensive capabilities in advanced nuclear technologies.... Taking into account their respective strengths with regard to Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors and CANDU reactors, there is considerable scope for joint work between the two countries.        
	The ministrys description of the deal is a deliberate understatement because Canada effectively made a complete turnaround in its relations with India by signing the agreement.         
	Like George W. Bush in the US, Harper buried the ghost of an issue  nuclear co-operation with India  by agreeing to collaborate with New Delhi in design, construction, maintenance, sharing of operating experience and decommissioning of nuclear reactors, supply of uranium, projects in third countries, nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear waste management.        
	The deal with India is bound to be criticised here and is seen as a bold initiative by Harper to advance ties with India despite his status as the head of a minority government.        
	The two countries also signed a memorandum of understanding for co-operation in mining, another MoU for co-operation in culture and one for that in higher education.        
	A festival of India is planned to be held in Canada throughout next year and Canada will organise an exhibition in India of Inuit art from the people of the Arctic, who used to be once described as Eskimos before the era of political correctness.        
	A joint statement at the end of the meeting between Singh and Harper listed a promising agenda for future bilateral co-operation: a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement and linkages in key areas, including education, academic relations, arts, culture, sports and tourism.        
	Lest it should divert attention from the substantive content of the bilateral discussions, a section of Indias officialdom in New Delhi disfavoured Harpers idea of having Akshay as master of ceremonies at the dinner for the Indian Prime Minister.        
	This was probably for the first time in the history of Indian prime ministerial visits that a host foreign country introduced a Bollywood element into its official proceedings.        
	Harpers unconventional decision was a reflection of the large Indian presence in Canada of more than one million people, who are active in the countrys political life.        
	But Singh and the delegation returned home today satisfied that all went well despite their reservations.        
	Akshay has emotional ties with Canada because he lost his father to cancer at a hospital in Toronto. Akshay also shoots films there.

          ARCHIS MOHAN                                             
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: Next time you say software, better mention computer.        
	Else, the program might pop up in the shape of a curvy siren  smirking and quite willing.        
	As more details of the shenanigans of arrested home ministry director Ravi Inder Singh emerged, so did the code words he used.        
	Delhi police sources said Singh, who was handling some 5,000 cases with internal security implications in telecom, mining, shipping and surface transport before his arrest, used to demand sex workers from Central Asian countries and was readily obliged by middlemen hired by telecom companies. The code was software, or paid sex.         
	A Delhi court today sent the 43-year-old Bengal cadre IAS officer, accused of leaking sensitive information of commercial value, and his businessman friend Vineet Kumar to police custody for six days. There could be more people involved, said a home ministry official.        
	Sources said several telecom officials may have been working in tandem with Singh to help foreign and domestic companies, particularly a US-based firm, concerned about the governments decision to allow number portability.        
	The sources said the New Jersey-based firm needed approval for a joint venture with an Indian company in mobile number portability. But the matter had come to the home ministry since the US company had a presence in Pakistan.        
	Officials said home minister P. Chidambaram was personally monitoring the case, which could even be transferred to the CBI.         
	The ministry sources said they were probing the role of a deputy general manager with a service provider, whom Singh had called on November 16 to find out if his phone was being tapped. They said the official had hinted that it was indeed being tapped and thus exceeded his brief. It isnt his job to divulge these details, said an official.        
	For the moment, though, the focus is on Singhs friendship with Kumar.         
	According to the Delhi police sources, Kumars company footed the Rs 50,000 monthly bill for Singhs rented home in posh Greater Kailash I where he had moved in for the first eight months after being posted as director (internal security) in North Block in January.        
	Kumar also arranged for sex workers from Central Asian countries for Singh. For hotel rooms, their code word was hardware.        
	On November 2, Singh asked Kumar prasad kab aayega  or when would the promised cash be delivered.        
	The sources said Singhs wife opened a bank account in June and deposited Rs 25 lakh. Delhi police suspect the money came from Kumar. Singhs wife later withdrew Rs 10 lakh from the account.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Beijing not playing ball, say diplomats
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Beijing not playing ball, say diplomats

	New Delhi, Dec. 17: For all his verbal grandstanding on the formidable potential of India-China friendship in the emerging new world, Premier Wen Jiabao departed for Islamabad today leaving New Delhi a little lost on whether its concerns really bothered Beijing.         
	Indians may have put across their annoyance with the Chinese on a whole range of bilateral and regional issues by refusing, for the first time in years, to commit themselves on paper to a One China outlook, the code for accepting Tibet as an integral part of the northern neighbour.         
	But while that may amount to no more than an academic taunt to the Chinese  even those who think the omission of One China in the joint communiqu as significant are quick to add the caveat that it makes no real difference to Chinas suzerainty over Tibet  what worries New Delhi is Chinas blunt refusal even to recognise Pakistan as an exporter of terror to India.         
	The message to India should be clear, said a top diplomat from an Asian neighbour of China. China isnt playing ball, if it is playing any games here it is playing from the Pakistani side. Perhaps India was wrong even to expect any change there, where was the groundwork?         
	The Pakistanis, predictably, were chuckling as they prepared to receive Wen.        
	You got lost in minute administrative issues like stapled visas, a Pakistani mission official said: The Chinese operate at that level too, but not when a leader of the stature of Wen is visiting, you seemed to lose sight of the big picture that is emerging.         
	He would not go into what that might be, but he added, tongue-in-cheek: The big picture on the subcontinent as far as China is concerned has been clear for a while. And the Wen visit only confirmed where Chinese interests lie.         
	Misgivings about how the Chinese have conducted themselves with India bilaterally and geopolitically were not for leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj alone to raise.         
	While she brought up the Chinese silence on 26/11, the status of Arunachal Pradesh and the issue of stapling visas in a meeting with Wen today, seasoned diplomats began to question whether New Delhi had prepared well enough for the visit.         
	Did Wen come to India merely because he expressed a desire to, or did we do our homework before agreeing to host him? asked a retired Indian ambassador. Such visits should be able to achieve something, what was there in it for us? Wen came and went and we did not even get so much as a word on terrorism from him, that should have been our chief working concern with him.         
	Another former ambassador, G. Parthasarathy, raised the more fundamental issue of what it is that India could have hoped to achieve with a Wen visit. Look, Wen represents a leadership that is on its way out in less than two years, they are not even in a position to make substantive promises to us, if at all, they cant deliver even if they wished to.         
	Parthasarathy spoke of Chinas increased regional and global arrogance, particularly after the recession that left the West weakened, and said: The bottomline is China respects power, not friendship. It is its policy to contain India and it is using Pakistan for that quite unabashedly. This visit is proof of that.         
	We have to now exhibit power to them. We have to gain more economic muscle, we have to upscale our conventional and nuclear deterrence in the years to come. I think we did well to be present at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony despite the Chinese frowning. But if we have to do all of this, we need a broad and long-term policy framework that we do not seem to have.         
	To add to disappointed noises already made by two former foreign secretaries  Kanwal Sibal and Salman Haider, both of whom thought India got little out of the visit  a seasoned diplomat and former ambassador to the US said: China has been openly belligerent and patronising of India. They remain insensitive to Indian concerns because they have their own to pursue.         
	Deng (Xiaoping) said a long time ago that the 21st century cannot become an Asian century unless China and India shake hands. China has long moved on from that position, we are still stuck on it because we have not been imaginative enough to change with changing times.         
	Making a strong case for homework that makes us outcome-oriented, the diplomat illustrated Indias laggard responses by turning to President Hu Jintaos 2005 speech on the Chinese navys blue water ambitions.         
	We never seemed to take note of that, but what Jintao said way back is only becoming obvious in Chinese naval aggression in the seas around us, he said.        
	He also thought India should have been sagacious enough not to reveal its little victory in having avoided any obeisance to One China. These are negotiating weights you play with in diplomacy, he argued. It does not always serve to have them in public play.

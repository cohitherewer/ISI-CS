	New Delhi, Nov. 9: Congress chief Sonia Gandhi may send Prithviraj Chavan, minister of state in the PMO, to Maharashtra to take charge as chief minister.        
	Prithviraj, an AICC general secretary holding several portfolios in the Manmohan Singh government, has an unblemished image and is considered a serious politician. He enjoys the trust of senior leaders, including Sonia and Singh.        
	Senior Congressmen Pranab Mukherjee and A.K. Antony held talks with Sonia this evening before leaving for Mumbai to ascertain the views of Congress legislators. The Congress Legislature Party tonight passed a resolution authorising Sonia to select a new leader to replace Ashok Chavan.        
	Sources said a decision had yet to be taken as Sonia wanted to know the MLAs views before picking the chief minister. Since the Congress did not want any fresh controversy  Ashok Chavan resigned after being embroiled in the Adarsh housing scam the factor being given most weightage was the image of the contenders, they added.        
	Rahul Gandhi is believed to have said the new chief minister must be capable and have a clean image. Sources said two of the other contenders, Vilasrao Deshmukh and Sushil Kumar Shinde, did not meet these criteria.        
	Prithviraj was called to 10 Janpath this evening before Sonia met Pranab and Antony. Her political secretary, Ahmed Patel, was present at the meeting.        
	Sources said the fact that Sonia did not send for Deshmukh and Shinde indicated the mood in the party, which is grappling with charges of corruption at various levels. Prithviraj could be the best antidote in the circumstances because of his detachment from murky state politics.        
	Prithviraj is believed to be a very efficient administrator who can develop a new leadership in Maharashtra. Although he holds several portfolios, including science and technology, personnel, public grievances, pensions and parliamentary affairs, he is considered a political lightweight. His biggest handicap possibly is he is considered a Delhi representative who has no clout in Maharashtra politics.        
	But Shinde and Deshmukh, who are entrenched in state politics, have an image problem  both are allegedly linked to Adarsh society development. Deshmukh, the strongest Maratha leader, has been removed twice as chief minister; many feel sending him to Mumbai again would be like reversing the clock. A third contender, Narayan Rane, does not have a clean image.        
	Deshmukh was first removed for his inability to build the party, and again after the 26/11 terror strikes. Many felt he would be the best choice given his political management skills and the support he commanded among majority of leaders. Besides, he had the stature and clout to counter Sharad Pawar. But a section of the high command had reservations about his return.        
	Shinde is a Dalit and has been chief minister once. He enjoys Sonias trust but is also considered close to Pawar.        
	Two other names were doing the rounds: Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, who quit the Shiv Sena and joined the Congress and has been a Union minister, and Balsaheb Thorat, the state education minister.

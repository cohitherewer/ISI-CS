	New Delhi, Dec. 14 (PTI): Civil aviation minister Praful Patel lashed out at lobbyist Niira Radia tonight, calling her an economic terrorist with vested interests and a personal agenda.        
	You want me to comment on lobbies and their agents and what they have said? They have vested interests and a personal agenda, Patel said, asked to comment on new leaked tapes containing purported conversation between Radia and Rajya Sabha member N.K. Singh in which the minister has been accused of working for private airlines.        
	A spokesperson for Vaishnavi Corporate Communications, which Radia heads, described the remarks as irresponsible and baseless.        
	In the tapes, Radia reportedly tells Singh that Praful Patel has destroyed the (aviation sector). I am sorry I do have a view about it. I do not think he has done justice with the sector.        
	In reply, Singh says: He has worked as a minister for Naresh Goyal (Jet Airways).        
	Radia then says. Yes, yes and now Vijay Mallya (Kingfisher airlines) at the cost of the national carrier.        
	Patel said he was not bothered about smear campaigns. One has to live with it, the NCP leader added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Alimuddin loses Navratna
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Alimuddin loses Navratna

	Calcutta, Jan. 19: Jyoti Basus last journey made a stopover this morning at a place where he used to come every day before he fell ill  the CPM state headquarters on Alimuddin Street.        
	Basu was instrumental in turning the nondescript party office in the dingy lane into the power centre of Left Front rule for the last 32 years. Today, he left it for ever when the party and the front, facing their worst crisis, needed his guidance the most.        
	The sense of loss was evident from the mood in the party office and outside where the rank and file had gathered for a glimpse of the last of the Navratnas, as the nine members of the CPMs first politburo formed in 1964 were known.        
	For CPM and front leaders, Basu was the symbol of continuity in the history of the communist and Left movement.        
	CPM leaders said that it was for the sake of this continuity that Basu was persuaded to stay on as a special invitee to the politburo and a full member of the partys central committee, state committee and the state secretariat.        
	That link has now snapped.        
	Draped in the partys red flag, the bier carrying Basus body entered Alimuddin Street around 8 as flag-bearing party faithful raised slogans.        
	Long live comrade Jyoti Basu, rose a chorus from the party workers who lined the route.         
	Comrade Jyoti Basu, we wont forget you, another chorus broke through the winter morning chill.        
	Many joined in singing the International, the most sacred hymn of the communist movement.        
	All the politburo members, including general secretary Prakash Karat, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state secretary Biman Bose, and some central committee members like Mohammad Salim and Shyamal Chakraborty carried the stretcher on which Basus body lay.        
	They took the stretcher to the small portico of the party office and laid it over a huge slab of ice covered with a red flag in front of the bust of communist party founder Muzzaffar Ahmad, after whom the office is named.         
	A huge banner hung over the bust. It read: Red salute, comrade Jyoti Basu.        
	Former politburo member Samar Mukherjee, the partys senior-most leader who is even older than Basu, was the first to pay homage.        
	Members of the politburo, the central committee and the state committee followed. Among those who paid their respects were leaders from the CPMs front partners as well as those from non-front Left parties like the SUCI and CPIML (Liberation).        
	Bose, industries minister Nirupam Sen and Tripura chief minister Manik Sarkar stood on vigil beside the body.        
	As the one-hour schedule for Basus last visit to his party office neared its end, all politburo members huddled around his body.        
	A pensive Prakash Karat seemed to be looking at the departed icons feet. Beside him stood wife and fellow politburo member Brinda, crying softly. The chief minister stood close to Basus head. Sitaram Yechury appeared to be looking intently at Basus face.        
	The wife and daughter of the late state party chief, Anil Biswas, left after paying homage. The chief ministers wife stood silently.        
	As the cortege left Muzaffar Bhavan, a misty-eyed Joykrishna Ghosh, Basus Man Friday for the past 32 years, caressed back the late leaders hair, tousled by the breeze.        
	The huge turnout appeared to have rekindled among party leaders hopes of a political turnaround in the June polls to 82 civic bodies across the state before the battle for the Assembly next year.        
	We knew Jyotibabu was a living legend. But we didnt exactly expect this sea of humanity made up of different generations and people from all walks of life. It will help us recharge our organisation and bring back those who have deserted us. Many of our inactive cadres or well-wishers who had distanced themselves from us turned up today, said a CPM state secretariat member.        
	He agreed that a massive crowd had also gathered for Subhas Chakrabortys funeral procession last year, but todays turnout was different. This time it was not an emotional outburst.        
	But other leaders were cautious and said the party would have to go for a major course-correction to cash in on Basus legacy.        
	I have never seen such outpouring of love and emotion for a communist leader. But we have to learn from Jyotibabu and correct our deviations if we want to survive and strengthen ourselves, said politburo member M.K. Pandhe.        
	The Left Front will hold a condolence meeting at Shahid Minar Maidan on January 24.        
	Venezuelan envoy        
	Venezuelan ambassador Milena Ramirez paid homage to Basu today, the only diplomat of that rank from a communist government to do so.        
	She flew in from Delhi and paid her respects to Basu at the Assembly.         
	Recalling President Hugo Chavezs visit to Calcutta in 2005, Ramirez said: He would have loved to come to attend the last journey of the great fighter, Comrade Jyoti Basu. However, time was too short to organise his visit but his heart is here with the people of Bengal.        
	The consular envoys of France, Germany, Japan and Bhutan also paid their respects at the Assembly. Chinese, Vietnamese and Cuban emissaries had visited Basu at hospital and later paid homage at the party office.

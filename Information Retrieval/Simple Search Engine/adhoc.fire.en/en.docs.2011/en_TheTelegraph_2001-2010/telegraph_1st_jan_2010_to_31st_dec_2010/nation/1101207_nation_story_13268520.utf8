          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, Dec. 6: Security officials in the UAE believed that India along with Iran had supported the Pakistani Taliban and Pashtun separatists even as the US suggested the UAE itself was a source of funding for the militants, another leaked diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks has said.        
	The cable, published by Pakistani media today, brought to light details of a meeting between officials of the US treasury department and those of the UAEs state security department (SSD) and Dubais general department of state security (GDSS) to discuss suspected Taliban-related financial activity in the UAE.        
	A senior security official told The Telegraph that the cable did not come as a surprise. We already have concrete evidence of Indias involvement in destablising Pakistan. These are the issues which Pakistan thinks should be sorted out and this is possible only if India agrees to meaningful and result-oriented talks with Islamabad on all issues.        
	The meeting, spread over several hours in December last year, took place months after the Pakistani military defeated Taliban militants in an offensive in north-western Swat and Malakand and launched a massive operation in the South Waziristan tribal region on the Afghan border, also known as the hub of Taliban and al Qaida operatives.        
	At the meeting, GDSS officials noted Irans support to the Taliban in Pakistan, adding that they believed India too backed the Pakistani Taliban and Pashtun separatists. The US side was represented by Howard Mendelsohn, treasury department acting assistant secretary in the office of Intelligence and Analysis.        
	Mendelsohn also raised the matter of the Afghanistan and Pakistan-based extremist and terrorist groups, to include the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jamaat ud-Dawa al-Quran wa al-Sunna, according to the cable.        
	The UAEs security services were not familiar with the names of specific UAE-based Lashkar members shared by the treasury but promised to follow up on the information, the cable said.        
	During the course of the two multi-hour intelligence exchange sessions, treasury analysts walked through the previously shared information suggesting that Taliban-related finance officials have visited the UAE in order to raise or move funds, the cable said.

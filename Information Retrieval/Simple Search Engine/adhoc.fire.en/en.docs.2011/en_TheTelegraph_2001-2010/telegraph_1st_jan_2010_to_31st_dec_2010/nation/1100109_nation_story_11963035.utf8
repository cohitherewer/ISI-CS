          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                          
	Mumbai, Jan. 8: Pradeep Sharma, the policeman for whom encounters were an addiction, has been arrested, bringing the curtain down on the Famous Five picked to snuff out the underworld that once reigned over the megapolis.        
	Sharma, 48, perhaps Mumbais most talked about encounter specialist along with Daya Nayak, was arrested late yesterday for killing a suspected gangster in an allegedly staged gunfight in 2006.        
	The officer, who was dismissed from Mumbai police in 2008 for alleged links with gangsters Dawood Ibrahim and Chhota Rajan but later reinstated, was picked up around 10.30pm on Thursday night from his residence by a special investigation team (SIT) set up by Bombay High Court.        
	He is the first Mumbai policeman to be arrested on charges of staging an encounter.        
	A senior inspector with the crime branch, Sharma was produced in the Andheri sessions court this afternoon along with two policemen and three civilians.        
	All six are accused in the murder of suspected gangster Lakhan Bhaiyya, whose family had filed a court case in 2006 alleging that Lakhan had been picked up from his home by Sharma without a warrant and later shot dead in Andheri.        
	The family alleged that Lakhan, whose real name was Ram Narain Gupta, was killed by Sharma at the behest of the Dawood gang. Lakhan allegedly belonged to the gang of Dawoods arch enemy Chhota Rajan.        
	We have been able to collect solid evidence against Sharma in the case and will soon chargesheet him, said SIT chief KMM Prasanna. Sharma has been sent to police custody till January 14.        
	Broad-shouldered, six feet tall and having the swagger of a film star, Sharma was one of the five policemen selected to end the underworld raj in the nineties. (See box)         
	Except for Vijay Salaskar, who was killed by Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Kasab on 26/11, all the others are embroiled in one case or the other.         
	Details of their exploits vary. Sharma once reportedly claimed to have personally killed 103 gangsters, all in self-defence, an explanation rubbished by rights groups. After the gangsters went on the run, Sharma, who was one of the inspirations for the Shimit Amin film Ab Tak Chhappan, told an international news agency: Encounters are an addiction for me. I feel bored on Sundays.        
	But the law started catching up with Mumbais encounter boys, dubbed the Dirty Harrys. In August 2009, Bombay High Court ordered an FIR to be filed against Sharma and 17 other policemen following a petition from Lakhan Bhaiyyas brother.        
	The high court had observed that the first bullet was shot at point-blank range at the forehead of the victim, while the second hit his chest.        
	Sharma has been booked on charges of abduction and murder. There is evidence that one of his main accomplices  Pradeep Suryavanshi, another police inspector from DN Nagar police station in Andheri  actually took the shot at Lakhan, killing him instantly. Sharma has been arrested. Suryavanshi will be taken into custody in a day or two, a senior Mumbai police official said today.        
	Lakhans brother Ramprasad Gupta denied his sibling belonged to the Rajan gang when he was killed on November 11, 2006.        
	My brother was not a gangster when he was killed. There was no criminal case against him post-1997. He was trying to reform. Seven hours after he was picked up by Pradeep Sharma, my brother was dead, he said.        
	Sharma and Nayak were also accused of amassing a huge amount of wealth disproportionate to their income by playing one gang against the other.        
	Sharma was dismissed after being suspected of amassing Rs 3,000 crore in illegal wealth using his Dawood-Rajan links. He was reinstated in May last year after no evidence was found.         
	Sharmas colleagues sprang to his defence. Where are the senior IPS officials who backed these people then? Why are no steps being taken against them? asked an angry senior officer of Mumbai police.        
	Among Sharmas bosses at the time was current Mumbai police commissioner D. Sivanandan, who was then joint commissioner (crime).

          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, June 18: What do you do when guns dont work against the Maoists? Simple: Play marriage broker.        
	Uttar Pradesh police are doing just that. Two days ago, they married off 101 girls in rebel-hit Sonebhadra and even arranged for the reception and dinner for the wedding guests.        
	The objective was to wean villagers away from the Maoists and prevent the district from turning into another Lalgarh, the rebel bastion in Bengal where forces are locked in a fraught battle with the guerrillas.        
	On Thursday, police and paramilitary commandos killed eight rebels not far from Lalgarh. All were between 19 and 27.        
	We are telling the young men and women of the area to get married and take the responsibility of bringing up a family rather than take up violence, said Charandeep Yadav, a police officer in the district.        
	Of course, theres the possibility that the cops can be branded copycats.        
	So long, local residents have told police officer, such kanyadaan  the ritual of giving a woman away in marriage  used to be conducted by Maoist leaders who made the newly weds swear that they would dedicate themselves to the cause of revolution.        
	I know its not an easy job bringing the young back, but we try, said Sonebhadra police chief Pritinder Singh.        
	Singh personally supervised such a marriage in Ramgarh, a small town in the district, on June 15 when he got Savita Pathari married off to Ram Pal Singh, a 32-year-old farmer.        
	Five years ago, the 19-year-old tribal girl had seen her elder sister Bullu walk away with Maoists, an AK-47 slung across her shoulders.        
	Bullu, who recently surrendered and became a social worker, was also there at her younger siblings wedding.        
	Uttar Pradesh additional police chief Brij Lal said a key component of the states anti-Maoist strategy in Sonebhadra and two other districts, Mirzapur and Chandauli, was integrating people through social interaction, underlining chief minister Mayavatis recent assertion that guns were not the only way to contain the rebels.        
	When we got 101 couples married on June 15, each of them was presented items of daily use, clothes and ornaments. Applications have been filed to the chief minister for helping them get an assistance of Rs 10,000 to get settled, Lal added.        
	Lal said the police had also recently arranged for coaching facilities in Sonebhadra for 124 candidates who wanted to join the force. Twenty-nine of them got selected, he added.        
	Sources said the Mayavati government had taken up several pro-poor schemes and recently set aside Rs 50 crore for road reconstruction in the three districts.        
	Under a new project, estimated to cost the state Rs 230 crore, the BSP government has also decided to open Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) centres in Maoist-infested areas.        
	So far, 138 new centres have come up in affected areas in Sonebhadra and Chandauli, officials said.

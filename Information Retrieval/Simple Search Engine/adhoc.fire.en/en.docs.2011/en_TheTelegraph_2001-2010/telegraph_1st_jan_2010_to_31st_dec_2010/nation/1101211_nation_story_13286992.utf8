                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bihar IITian dead in Paris lake
          JOY SENGUPTA                                        : Satyam Kumar      
	Patna, Dec. 10: A former IITian from Bihar who was studying at the Ecole Polytechnique University in Paris has been found dead in a lake on the campus under mysterious circumstances.        
	Satyam Kumar, 28, had been missing since a late-night party on Friday, December 3, at the lakeside with two other Indian students, who said they were celebrating the end of their exams with a bottle of whisky.        
	The other two boys apparently left earlier than Satyam, whose body was fished out on Wednesday.        
	Satyam, the only son of a schoolteacher in Sitamarhi, 200km from Patna, had done his BTech and MTech at IIT Mumbai. He had joined the prestigious tech school in Paris in August this year to do a masters in mechanics in the field of computational fluid dynamics.        
	His family today faxed the Indian embassy in Paris requesting them to send Satyams body and medical report.        
	After the body was found, Satyams friends in Sitamarhi had called up the two youths partying with Satyam on December 3 night. They were Nitish, a Patna boy who too is enrolled at Ecole Polytechnique, and his friend Abhishek Singh, an Allahabad resident studying at the Paris engineering institute, IFP School.        
	Satyams friends recorded the conversation with Nitish (The Telegraph has had access to the recording), in which Nitish says it was he who had invited Abhishek, a former batch-mate at IIT Kanpur.        
	Abhishek had never actually met Satyam. I carried a bag with a one-litre bottle of... whisky. Around 8.30pm, we sat down near a hut next to the lake and chatted as we drank.        
	They talked and drank for three hours. Then, Nitish says, he and Abhishek left. Once Nitish woke up around 10.15 the next morning, he remembered he had left his bag at the lakeside and went back. He says he didnt find his bag but found Satyams camera lying nearby.        
	Confused, I came back and went to Satyams room. But he wasnt there. Nitish says he slept again. When he woke up at 4pm, Satyam was still missing.        
	After a failed search by Satyams roommates, they told the university guards who called police. On Sunday, the French police scanned Nitishs room and took away Satyams camera and other belongings.        
	Satyams mother Sobha Devi said over the phone that Satyam had told her he would be leaving for the US for a job interview in February.        
	He was so happy. He said he had made a unique design of an aircraft and would get the US job. How could this have happened? she said, breaking down.

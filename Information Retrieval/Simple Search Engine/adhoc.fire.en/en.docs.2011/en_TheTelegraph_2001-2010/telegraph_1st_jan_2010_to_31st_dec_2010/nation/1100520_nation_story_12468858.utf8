The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Responsibility taken, with prod to Centre
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Responsibility taken, with prod to Centre
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Raman Singh in New Delhi on Wednesday. (Ramakant Kushwaha)                                  
	New Delhi, May 19: Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh today accepted full responsibility for the deployment and use of central forces in the Maoist-affected districts of his state.         
	However, he made it clear that the violence in Bastar  which covers Dantewada where two successive Maoist attacks have killed over 100 people  was no longer a local law and order issue. It was, he said, a problem and a challenge that has acquired the magnitude and intensity of the militancy in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab.         
	Clearing the air on who should take responsibility for the repeated rebel strikes  the Centre or the Chhattisgarh government  Singh told The Telegraph: I have to take the responsibility. Central paramilitary forces like the CRPF, SAP and the ITBP are spread over the LWE (Left-wing extremism) districts but they work in co-ordination with our police commanders.         
	The entire operation is under me. I am fighting the biggest battle our democracy has faced so far and I am determined to win it.         
	Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh had started the debate on responsibility when he suggested two days back that the Chhattisgarh government was alone culpable for the killings and blasts. His statement came at a time home minister P. Chidambaram himself chose to be the public face of the counter-offensive against the Maoists and ensured Singh was out of the frame. The move had come as a relief to the BJP, which runs the government in Chhattisgarh.         
	But Chidambarams clarification on Tuesday on his comment that he had been given a limited mandate in dealing with the Maoist challenge has changed the perspective. The home minister said: It is the state government which has the primary responsibility to tackle the Maoists. From that sense, I said our mandate was limited. Well, if you play on words like limited mandate, I could turn around and say the state governments and the chief ministers have an unlimited mandate.         
	The BJP reacted to the home ministers turnaround by asking if it was the Congresss policy that it (the Maoist challenge) is exclusively a law and order problem (which is a state subject)?         
	A statement the BJP issued said that since Left-wing extremism threatened Indias integrity, sovereignty, defence and its constitutional order, the Centre could not shy away from its responsibility and belittle it as a law and order problem.         
	Rajiv Gandhi, the BJP said, had enacted Tada because he was convinced a law and order problem can easily transgress into the destabilisation of the nation.         
	As it commiserated with a down-sized Chidambaram, the BJP directed the otherwise low-key and avuncular Singh to publicly accept the Maoists dare and project himself as more than equal to the task. The idea behind the strategy was to strengthen the perception that the BJP alone was unapologetic about its hard-line stand towards the Maoists while the Congress and the Left sounded fuzzy.         
	Singh  who was in Delhi today to attend a Planning Commission meeting as well as call on the Prime Minister and Chidambaram  dismissed Digvijays comments.         
	I am only concerned with what the Prime Minister and the home minister say because they are fully focused on development and security. I am comfortable with them, he said.         
	Singh branded the Maoists terrorists  they are two sides of the same coin  but added that there was no question of bombing inhabited zones. There is no open war of the kind we have to sometimes fight with Pakistan. I have to save the tribals.         
	Singh, who belongs to a powerful land-owning caste, rejected the argument that Maoism was triggered by the entry of private mining stakeholders and zamindars.         
	The chief minister said Maoism was most rampant in (Bastars) Abhujmadh, the most impregnable forest area which remains unpoliced and can be entered only with special permission.         
	Nobody can buy tribal land. Yet how come improvised explosive devices are being used there all the time? We have to find out where the technology comes from because my tribals cannot do such things, he added.

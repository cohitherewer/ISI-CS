The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | For BJP, by outsider
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      For BJP, by outsider
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 29: Who should head a state BJP unit? Dont ask the BJP.        
	For the first time, a political party has outsourced its internal polls.        
	BJP president Nitin Gadkari has hired a pollster to pick the right persons to head the party in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Delhi, deciding that an outsider should be better than the party brass at reading local party workers minds.        
	This is shocking. Never before has a political party involved outsiders in its internal affairs, said a national executive member. Its a sign of things to come. Those at the top dont want to involve themselves in problems that call for dedication and objectivity.        
	The pollster was first put on the job in Uttar Pradesh. First, Gadkari short-listed three names after consultations with the factions. Then the pollster was asked to take the views of party workers on the three: S.P. Shahi, Dinesh Sharma and Dharam Pal. A Rajya Sabha MP said the workers rejected all three but Shahi got the most support.        
	In the past, state presidents were elected through a consensus but infighting has now deepened in the state unit. These leaders refuse to speak to each other, how can you have a consensus? a central leader asked.        
	Now a survey is about to begin in Bihar, where the short-listed three are Ashwani Choubey, J.S. Sigriwal and Mangal Pandey. A Bihar MP said if the workers rejected all three in the survey, Gadkari would have to hold an election and let the fissures be seen publicly. Next will be Delhis turn.

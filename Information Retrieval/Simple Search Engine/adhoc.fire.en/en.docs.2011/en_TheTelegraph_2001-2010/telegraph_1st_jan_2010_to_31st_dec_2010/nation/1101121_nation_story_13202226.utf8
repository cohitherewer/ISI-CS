  - Court refuses to interfere   in management matter        SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 20: Fixing the working hours is a managements prerogative and employees cannot demand parity in their duty hours with their colleagues on the ground of equality, the Supreme Court has ruled.        
	In our opinion, fixing of hours of work, provided they do not violate any statutory provision or statutory rule, are really management functions.... This court must exercise restraint and not ordinarily interfere with such management functions, a two-judge bench said.        
	The top court was dealing with an appeal against a Bombay High Court order of October 9, 2009, dismissing a petition by some Mumbai Port Trust typist-cum-computer clerks. These clerks, appointed after November 1, 1996, had challenged the longer hours they had to work compared with colleagues appointed before that date.        
	While the typists and clerks appointed earlier had to work six-and-a-half hours a day, the newer recruits had to put in seven-and-a-half hours. The latter group went to court alleging the arrangement was discriminatory and violated Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees equality.        
	They said that either their working hours should be reduced by an hour or they should be given overtime allowance for one hours work.        
	The port trust agreed that by convention, its indoors personnel had to work six-and-a-half hours while its outdoors staff had to work an hour longer. But because of changes in technology and the arrival of private competitors, it said, the management had decided to have a uniform seven-and-a-half-hour rule for both indoors and outdoors personnel.        
	However, to avoid any litigation, it was decided that the working hours of the old indoors staff would not be changed, but fresh indoors appointees would be told during recruitment they must work eight hours with a half-hour lunch break. The port trust claimed that the new recruits had accepted this condition.         
	The Supreme Court said that in its opinion, Article 14 did not take away the power of classification, which to some degree is bound to produce some inequality. It said it was enough if the law or the practice deals equally with members of a well-defined class.        
	Differential treatment, per se, does not constitute violation of Article 14. It denies equal protection only when there is no reasonable basis for differentiation, the bench of Justice Markandey Katju and Justice Gyan Sudha Misra said.        
	In the modern world, businesses have to face competition with other businesses. To do so they may have to have longer working hours and introduce efficiency, while avoiding labour disputes.        
	It noted that the newer recruits were clearly given to understand what their working hours would be if they accepted their appointments.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tribunal clears air on OBC job
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tribunal clears air on OBC job
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 1 (PTI): The Central Administrative Tribunal has said the Centre will not reserve jobs for castes considered OBC by states but not by the Union government.        
	The tribunal passed the order on a petition by four members of the Jat community, recognised as an Other Backward Caste by the Delhi government, who sought appointment to posts reserved for OBCs in the Employees State Insurance Corporation, a central agency.         
	The petitioners pleaded before the tribunal that since the selection was to be made for the Delhi region, they, as Delhi residents, should be considered for appointment.        
	But the tribunal dismissed their petitions. The bench headed by V.K. Bali said: In our opinion.... What is material is that the recruitment is being made for an agency of the central government.

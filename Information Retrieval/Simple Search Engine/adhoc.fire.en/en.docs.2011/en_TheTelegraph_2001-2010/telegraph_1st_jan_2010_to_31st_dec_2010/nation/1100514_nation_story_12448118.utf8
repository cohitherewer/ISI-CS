	Calcutta, May 13: A leaflet issued in the name of Kishan and mentioning the IPL scandal surfaced today, the first since March when reports suggested that the Maoist leader was injured in police firing.        
	The statement, dated May 6, said the Maoists had called a two-day bandh on May 18 and 19 in five states, including Bengal.        
	Other than targeting Operation Green Hunt, the leaflet referred to the IPL controversy. The statement demanded the resignation of Union ministers Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel for their alleged involvement in the scandal. Lumpen elements are involved in the IPL, the statement said.

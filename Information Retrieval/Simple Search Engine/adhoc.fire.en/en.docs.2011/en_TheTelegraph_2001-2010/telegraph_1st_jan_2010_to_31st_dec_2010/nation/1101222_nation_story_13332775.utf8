                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      IIT in mind, khukuri in hand 
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 21 (PTI): A teenage IIT aspirant murdered a retired teacher in his south Delhi home on Saturday for making his parents pay up for a credit card and jewellery he had stolen, police said.        
	D.K. Joshi, who lived alone, was found dead with head and neck injuries after his son Anurag asked a cousin to check on him because his calls from the US were going unanswered.         
	We detained the boy from his uncles residence in Gurgaon early this morning. He is from a well-to-do family. His father is a businessman while his sister is pursuing second-year MBBS, deputy commissioner of police H.G.S. Dhaliwal said.        
	The police have found the khukuri used to commit the murder, the teenagers bloodstained shoes and a laptop and wine bottles that he allegedly stole afterwards.         
	The 17-year-old had stayed as a paying guest with the retired teacher in his Vasant Kunj apartment from November last year to March. Joshi, who had turned an introvert and an Osho follower after his wife died in 2008, had taken in two students as paying guests.         
	He started treating them as his own kids and used to help them in their studies. He even got his cable connection cut so that their studies were not disturbed, Dhaliwal said.        
	But in March, Joshi discovered the boy had stolen his wine bottles, jewellery and credit card on which he spent Rs 1.3 lakh. He allegedly sold the jewellery for Rs 56,000.        
	The retired teacher made the boys parents, who live in Shingroli in Madhya Pradesh, pay him Rs 3 lakh. We worked on this lead and this led to the detention of the teenager who felt he was humiliated. Joshi, who had not pressed for criminal charges against the teenager, had later demanded another Rs 50,000. The boy was angry at this and wanted to get rid of Joshi, Dhaliwal said.        
	The teenager got the khukuri, which he had bought on a Nepal trip two year ago, from his home last Thursday, the officer said. The next day he got a womens wig he could use as a disguise from a friends beauty parlour in Kalkaji telling her he needed it for a play. Another unwitting friend helped him get away on his motorcycle.        
	He told his school friend that he could arrange a job for him and went to his house to take his motorcycle. He also arranged some interviews for his friend. The teenager then took him to Vasant Kunj on the pretext of collecting some money, Dhaliwal said.        
	Joshi, who had gone out to shop, found the boy outside his flat when he returned and asked why he was there. The teenager pushed his way inside and allegedly attacked him with the knife.        
	The khukuri got damaged as the boy hit the teacher. Then he stabbed him with scissors. He also searched the house and laid his hands on whatever he could find easily. He returned with a laptop, three wine bottles and a mobile phone in his bag to where his friend was waiting for him, Dhaliwal said.         
	He spent the night at the beauty parlour, the officer added.        
	Joshi, who had retired in 2003 and moved to Vasant Kunj a year later, was not registered with the senior citizens cell because he was planning to join his son, a software professional, in New Jersey.        
	Also, his relatives were very caring. They used to meet him every day. The nephew who reported the murder used to park his motorcycle in his flat only, Dhaliwal said. However, our beat constable used to meet him regularly. We were also aware of the theft that took place in March though no case was registered.

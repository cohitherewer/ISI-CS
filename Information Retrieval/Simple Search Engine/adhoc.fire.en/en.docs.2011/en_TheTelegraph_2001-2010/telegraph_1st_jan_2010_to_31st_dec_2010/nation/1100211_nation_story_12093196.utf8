The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Need for super brinjal never assessed 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Need for super brinjal never assessed 
          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: An independent socio-economic analysis to determine whether Indian farmers really needed genetically modified (GM) brinjal was never done despite recommendations for such a study by an expert committee.         
	Documents released by the environment and forests ministry to back its decision to impose a moratorium on the GM brinjal showed that a study proposal to assess its need and its possible socio-economic impact on farmers was never pursued.         
	A technical committee set up by the ministry had in October 2007 highlighted the need to evaluate whether there was any ground-level requirement for the GM brinjal at all.         
	A three-member technical sub-committee had met in Varanasi and developed a detailed methodology for the study, which was to be conducted by the Indian Council of Social Science Research with government funding.         
	But the (socio-economic assessment) study was never commissioned nor done, S. Parasuraman, the director of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, wrote in a communication sent to environment minister Jairam Ramesh.         
	Ramesh, while announcing the moratorium yesterday, had said there was no tearing hurry to make the GM brinjal Indias first engineered biotech food crop. Sections of farmers have opposed the introduction of the GM brinjal.         
	Parasuraman said a comparative analysis of the costs of production of the GM brinjal and its impacts on the potential market and market value should be performed before it was released for commercial cultivation.         
	It is possible that high costs associated with the crop (GM brinjal) could push small farmers away from being able to cultivate brinjal, Parasuraman had told The Telegraph in an interview. We need a socio-economic analysis of what could happen.         
	A socio-economic assessment submitted by the developers of the GM brinjal to the ministry was defective in its methodology, said Parasuraman, who was one of the three members of the sub-committee.         
	The ministry said yesterday that the moratorium on the GM brinjal would remain in place until there was scientific consensus on the safety of the product demonstrated through independent studies.         
	Indias department of biotechnology and sections of crop scientists have argued that the brinjal is safe for cultivation.         
	Environmental groups have claimed that some farmers are worried about the economic impact of the introduction of the GM brinjal.         
	In central Maharastra, farmers are concerned about a possible glut in the brinjal, said Kavitha Kuruganti, an environmental activist campaigning for sustainable agriculture.

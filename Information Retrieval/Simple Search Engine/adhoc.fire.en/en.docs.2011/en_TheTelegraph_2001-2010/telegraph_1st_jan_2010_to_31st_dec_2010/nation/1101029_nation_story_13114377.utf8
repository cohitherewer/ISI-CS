	Oct. 28: Some 300 income-tax sleuths today carried out simultaneous raids nationwide on 50 premises belonging to four Commonwealth Games contractors and seized documents relating to contracts and sub-contracts, sources said.        
	In Calcutta, tax officials raided the office of MBL Infrastructure Limited, promoted by Ram Gopal Maheshwari, which was awarded road and city beautification contracts in Delhi ahead of the Games.        
	A tax official, though, said: This (raid) has nothing to do with the Games; this is a regular investigation that the department carries out.        
	The companys officials were not available for comment. MBL had secured Games projects worth Rs 725 crore from the Delhi civic authorities.        
	Most of the contractors raided in Delhi and its neighbourhood, Bangalore, Mumbai, Jamshedpur and Calcutta  were involved in landscaping, venue beautification, changing of street lamps and laying field tracks, or were in the business of sports equipment and gear, sources said.        
	MBL had secured the following projects:        
	Road construction under bridge on Auchandi Road, connecting to GT Road and Badli Industrial area (on Delhi-Ambala Line);        
	Construction of road under bridge at level crossing on Narela Lampur Road;        
	Streetscaping and beautification of roads (a) around Tyagraj Sports Complex, Siri Fort complex and RK Khanna Tennis Stadium; (b) around Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range and JLN Sports Complex; and (c) around IGI Stadium.        
	Sources said the probe will look into the contracts awarded by the Suresh Kalmadi-led organising committee, the role of its officials and bribery charges. Yesterday, the ED grilled committee director-general V.K. Verma for 10 hours.        
	The CVC is probing allegations that top Games official V.K. Gautam, said to be close to Kalmadi, had amassed Rs 200 crore. Gautam was not available for comment.        
	Animal rescue        
	Over 120 animals have been rescued from various Games venues and the Games Village, the NGO Wildlife SOS said today. It said 122 animals  including four cobras, a krait, a blind snake, a red sand boa and a wolf snake as well as monkeys, monitor lizards and birds  were rescued.

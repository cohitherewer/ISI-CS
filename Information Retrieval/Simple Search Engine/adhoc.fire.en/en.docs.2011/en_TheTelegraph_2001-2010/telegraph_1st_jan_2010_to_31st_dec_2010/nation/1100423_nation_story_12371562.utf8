          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 22: Thirteen parties led by the Left today declared they would move a cut motion in the Lok Sabha for a rollback in the hike in petrol, diesel and fertiliser prices and observe a nation-wide general strike on April 27.        
	CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said they had worked out a strategy to move the cut motion and an amendment to the finance bill but insisted the move wasnt aimed at destabilising the Centre. It is not about destabilising the government. It is aimed at bringing relief to the people, he told a joint news conference.        
	Among the others present at the conference were leaders of the ADMK, Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Telugu Desam and the Rashtriya Lok Dal. Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and RJD boss Lalu Prasad did not attend the conference but sent their party leaders to represent them.        
	Asked about Mayavatis BSP, Yechury said they had appealed to the party to join them and were waiting for a response.         
	Principal Opposition BJP also said it would move a cut motion in the Lok Sabha for a rollback in the increase of prices of petrol, diesel and fertilisers.

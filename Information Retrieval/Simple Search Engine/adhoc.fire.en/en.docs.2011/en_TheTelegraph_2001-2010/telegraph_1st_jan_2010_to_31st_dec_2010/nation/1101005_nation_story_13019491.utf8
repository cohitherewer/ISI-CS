          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 4: The Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena today wrote to TV channel Colors, which kicked off reality show Bigg Boss 4 last night, to immediately remove the two Pakistanis among the 14 participants.        
	The Pakistanis are actress Veena Malik, former girlfriend of cricketer Mohammed Asif, and chat show host Begum Nawazish Ali.        
	The Shiv Sena has threatened to launch an agitation and stall the show if it continues with the Pakistani artistes, prompting police to beef up security outside the Colours office at Andheri.        
	We will not allow the show to run, party spokesperson Sanjay Raut said. If Pakistan can ban Indian TV channels, why should Indian TV channels want Pakistanis on their shows, he asked.        
	Minutes later, MNS chief Raj Thackeray said: Great singers like Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle were never allowed to perform in Pakistan. I cant understand why we need Pakistani artistes on Indian shows.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal high on aptitude test America wants to scrap

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                            
	New Delhi, April 21: A growing number of US colleges are veering away from reliance on scholastic aptitude test scores to screen student applicants, citing concerns ignored so far by the Indian government which wants to clone the SAT for college admissions here.        
	Over a third of all accredited American colleges no longer require all admission-seekers to submit SAT scores, having concluded that such standardised tests discriminate against students from deprived communities and define merit uni-dimensionally.        
	These institutions, which include some of the best in the world, instead set their own admission criteria that allow them to define merit, a cross-section of these colleges and researchers have told The Telegraph.        
	Our experience in the US shows a strong correlation between standardised test scores and family incomes. The test screens out minority and poor children and serves to reinforce class and race, said Bob Schaeffer at the Boston-based National Center for Fair and Open Testing (NCFOT).        
	Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal had in February declared plans to shift to a nation-wide aptitude test for college admissions across streams, modelled on the SAT, instead of the myriad admission tests held at present.        
	Sibals ministry subsequently asked a team of IIT directors to consider replacing the Joint Entrance Examination and other engineering entrance tests with a single aptitude test modelled on the SAT.        
	In the US, colleges are not bound to select their students on the basis of SAT scores but the HRD ministry plans to make its standardised test mandatory for all undergraduate institutions.        
	Sibal has argued that multiple tests, often specific to sets of institutions like the IITs or the national law schools, increase the pressure on students who have to prove their ability separately to the various institutions they apply to.        
	But ministry officials confirmed that they had not yet studied the concerns that are propelling an increasing number of US colleges to no longer demand SAT scores from applicants.        
	From about 275 in 1998, the number of SAT-optional colleges has swollen to 847 out of a total of about 2,500 accredited colleges in the US, according to the NCFOT, which maintains a database of such institutions.        
	Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, was the first in 1984 to admit students without demanding SAT scores. A quarter of a century later, the high-ranking liberal arts college has seen its applicant pool double with just a one per cent difference in graduation rates between students who submit SAT scores and those who do not.        
	The college will be presenting a 25-year study of its admission policy at a conference in Yale this May.        
	We were worried about the inability of standardised tests to capture the ability of disadvantaged groups  women, rural students, blue-collar students, immigrants, said William Hiss, Bates vice-president for external affairs who was dean of admissions in the years when the new policy was established.        
	Organisers of standardised tests like the SAT maintain that the test does not discriminate, but independent researchers have questioned this claim.        
	In their 1994 academic publication titled The Bell Curve, which became a mainstream best-seller, researchers Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray cited an example from the verbal reasoning section of the SAT to buttress their argument.        
	Test-takers were asked to pick the best analogy for marathon: runner from among five options  envoy: embassy, martyr: massacre, oarsman: regatta, referee: tournament and horse: stable.        
	The correct answer  oarsman: regatta  is fairly easy for those who know what both a marathon and a regatta are, a matter of guesswork otherwise. But how would a black youngster from the inner city ever have heard of a regatta? Herrnstein and Murray asked.        
	Colleges have also ended their dependence on the SAT because a single standardised test, they argue, restricts their ability to pick students on the basis of qualities that specific institutions want in their students.        
	Undergraduate colleges in the US follow a standard four-year structure where students major in a particular subject only towards the end of the course, unlike in India where students specialise straight after school.         
	But different US colleges follow different philosophies even if they offer the same bouquet of major subjects to students.        
	Franklin and Marshall in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, is a 233-year-old college that focuses on the liberal arts like several other colleges in the country. But it concluded that the SAT was not necessarily the best judge of writing  a skill it considers important for its students to possess. Students who apply under the SAT-optional policy now submit two written samples graded in high school.        
	(Without the SAT-optional policy) we would miss out on some tremendously impressive students with exceptional high school records and talents as deep and awe-inspiring as they come, said Sara Harberson, dean of admissions at Franklin and Marshall.        
	The concern over standardised tests limiting a colleges ability to pick students with specific skill sets appears particularly pronounced among institutions offering speciality curricula  like in dance, music or art  said Hiss.        
	Berklee College of Music, the largest independent college of contemporary music in the world, conducts auditions to pick students.         
	The school has legends like Quincy Jones and Joe Satriani, Aerosmith members Joey Kramer and Brad Whitford, and Ehsaan Noorani of the Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy trio among its alumni.        
	It seems hard to imagine how a single test would predict performance equally for wildly different curricula, said Hiss.

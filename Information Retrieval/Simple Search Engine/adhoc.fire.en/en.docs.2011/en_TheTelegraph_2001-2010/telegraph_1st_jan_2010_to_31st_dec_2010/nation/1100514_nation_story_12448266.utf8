The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sexist taunt at BJP legislator 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sexist taunt at BJP legislator 
          RASHEED KIDWAI                                          Speaker Ishwar Das Rohani breaks down. (PTI)       
	Bhopal, May 13: This could be a first event for Indias politicians: someone from a crowd of male MLAs allegedly threw a sexist taunt at a passing woman legislator, with a reference to her personal grooming habits.        
	The alleged incident involving a Congress MLA and a woman BJP lawmaker today apparently caused the Madhya Pradesh Speaker to weep in anguish and the BJP to demand an apology from Sonia Gandhi.        
	Congress and BJP legislators have been locked in a tussle in Madhya Pradesh, with the Opposition party boycotting a special Assembly session called to discuss development in the state.        
	The 60-odd Congress MLAs were sitting on dharna at the Assembly gates when BJP member Lalita Yadav passed by. Apparently, a Congress member commented that Yadav was late because she was coming from a beauty parlour.        
	The MLA from Chhattarpur complained to Speaker Ishwardas Rohani, who retired to his chamber and broke down  as TV images corroborated. Rohani then returned to the House to say he was ashamed to learn that a Congress MLA had taunted a woman member and made a sexist remark.        
	The Congress denied the allegation and accused the BJP of shedding crocodile tears. An aggressive Kalpana Parulekar, a Congress MLA, said: No derogatory remarks were passed. I was present there and as a woman I vouch for it.        
	She wondered why the government had chosen to wait till evening to pass a censure motion when the alleged incident had taken place sometime earlier. Parulekar also wondered why Rohani had not reacted in the past when some MLAs had made double-meaning references inside the House.        
	Senior Congress leader Ajay Singh, son of former Union minister Arjun Singh, said he was ready to apologise if any MLA had felt offended.        
	Narrottam Mishra, state parliamentary affairs minister, said Sonia owed an explanation and an apology as her party MLAs had displayed unbecoming behaviour.        
	The special Assembly session has been enmeshed in controversy from the start. A day before it began, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan had written to Sonia requesting her to ask her party MLAs to attend the session.        
	The Madhya Pradesh Congress responded with a letter to BJP chief Nitin Gadkari asking him to check Chauhans misrule. Both Sonia and Gadkari ignored the correspondence.        
	The special session to discuss ways of making Madhya Pradesh a golden state, implying development and prosperity, was mooted a month ago and cleared by an all-party business advisory panel. The Congress, however, later claimed the procedure adopted was unconstitutional.

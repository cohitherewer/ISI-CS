	Jamshedpur, May 29: Ghatshila sub-division of East Singhbhum district is on alert after the police received intelligence about a group of Maoists, including women, that had sneaked into the area from neighbouring Bengal.        
	Last week, after the two-day rebel bandh in five districts of Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand on May 19, as many as six high-ranking rebel cadre, including two women, had set up camp in the hilly hamlets of Dangrapahad and Pawadapahad.        
	SSP Naveen Kumar Singh said the police were aware that rebels from West Midnapore in Bengal were frequently crossing over to Ghurabandha, Dalbhumgarh, Chakulia and Ghatshila.         
	We have information about rebels having sneaked into Ghurabandha from Bengal and have started operations at various places, including areas considered Naxalite strongholds, senior superintendent of police Naveen Kumar Singh said.        
	According to intelligence sources, the two women anchored in Ghurabandha were Jagori Baske and Debjani, both senior rebels who were apparently handpicked for their ability to communicate both in Bengali and the local tribal dialect.        
	The sources added that unlike earlier occasions when rebels would come from Bengals West Midnapore district for shelter in Ghurabandha, this time they were camping in these areas with a purpose.         
	The rebels from West Midnapore are active across the Ghurabandha block and parts of Dumaria and Dalbhumgarh. They are meeting villages to persuade them to stay away from central schemes, namely the job scheme, said a source.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Strike at Tata Haldia plant
                            
	Tamluk, June 12: Around 300 Citu-affiliated contract labourers called an indefinite strike today at the Tata Steel-owned Hooghly Met Coke and Power Co Ltd in Haldia, demanding higher wages.        
	However, 400 contract labourers, most of whom owe allegiance to the Trinamul Congress, and an equal number of permanent staff did not join the strike at the Durgachak factory, the largest coke plant in India.        
	A factory official said production was not hampered although handling of raw materials was affected a bit.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bihar shows off surplus
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi arrives in the Assembly to present the state budget in Patna on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Patna, Feb. 25: Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi today presented a Rs 6,557-crore surplus annual budget (2010-11) that promised more for improvement of infrastructure, education, social welfare and rural development. The total size of the budget was Rs 53,927 crore.        
	Stressing on the governments commitment to bring about a marked improvement in infrastructure, education and social welfare, Modi, who is in charge of finance, said the budget stipulated Rs 3,555 crore for road construction, Rs 2,500 crore for human resources and Rs 1,577 crore for social welfare.         
	The budget also announced a plethora of concessions for traders who do business worth Rs 40 lakh or less and deal in locally grown cotton and silk cloths.        
	Modi pointed out in the Assembly that the state was able to present a surplus budget despite implementation of the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission, problems of flood and drought and global recession.        
	According to the budget, the capital outlay, which means expenditure on infrastructure and other sectors of development, increased from Rs 9,417 crore in 2009-10 to Rs 10,434 crore in 2010-11.        
	This is about nine times more than the Rs 1,205 crore total capital outlay in 2004-05 that the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government had inherited, Modi remarked.        
	Bihar, according to the budget, was all set to achieve two important debt management landmarks in 2010-11.        
	The public debt to the gross state domestic product ratio has been brought down to 28.20 per cent and the ratio of interest payment to revenue receipts would be brought down to just under 10 per cent, he said.        
	The development would increase the states credit rating and help it borrow at cheaper interest rates, he added.        
	Modi remarked that the state generating surplus budget and increasing the outlay on the plan expenditure in successive years despite the central government not giving it any special package or denying it special category status is not a mean achievement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP skirts blame-game, demands policy that will not be soft 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP skirts blame-game, demands policy that will not be soft 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          An injured policeman is assisted by comrades at a government hospital in Dantewada on Monday. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, May 17: The BJP emphasised it would not indulge in a blame-game over the latest Maoist massacre in Chhattisgarh nor was it out to score a brownie point over the Congress-led UPA or sound partisan.         
	The party said its immediate concern was the need for a comprehensive and uniform policy that would not treat the problem in a soft way.        
	Spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman told The Telegraph: The first thing we need is more facts on what caused this attack before we jump to conclusions on whether it was intelligence failure of something else.         
	Aware that Chhattisgarh is BJP-ruled and the target of the big Maoist attacks in the recent past, Nirmala admitted that no one state police unit can match the resources of a Naxalite unit or independently handle the strikes. The first thing we need is comprehensive attacks on their armouries.        
	In a nuanced departure from the Congresss policy of using counter-insurgency and development initiatives simultaneously instead of prioritising one over the other, Nirmala stressed that security and safety will have to take precedence over development activities.        
	What are we talking about? Nothing reaches the pockets controlled by the Maoists. They blow up schools and hospitals, they will not allow essential supplies, medicines to reach people. It is clear that we cannot take development to the districts that are ruled by their guns.        
	First and foremost, these islands have to be reclaimed by the Indian state. They dont make a distinction between civilians and security forces. What sin did the busload of passengers who were killed today commit? asked the spokesperson.                    
	Nirmala said the Maoists were waging an ideological warfare that was predicated on a negation of the Indian state and Constitution. In such circumstances, we have to be clear we will not negotiate with them unless they recognise the Indian state, abjure violence and lay down arms, she said.        
	Despite her assertions not to politicise the episode, Nirmala claimed that the battle in Chhattisgarh got considerably enfeebled when in 2005, its neighbour, Andhra Pradesh, negotiated with the Peoples War Group without pre-conditions, except for a three-month ceasefire.         
	When the talks broke down, fighting intensified. The Andhra government unleashed its might on the PWG after its activists migrated to Chhattisgarh and consolidated their base in the state, she said.        
	That was a setback to the effort to put the Maoists down. Because Chhattisgarh and Andhra are not independent entities and Naxalism is not confined to one state. If one state adopts a soft approach and the other a hard policy, the mixed signals will embolden the Maoists. Therefore, we need a uniform policy, Nirmala said.

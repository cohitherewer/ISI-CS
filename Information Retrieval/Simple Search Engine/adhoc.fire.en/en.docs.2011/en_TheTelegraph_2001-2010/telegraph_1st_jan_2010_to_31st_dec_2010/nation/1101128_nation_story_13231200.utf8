          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 27: Bengal Congress chief Manas Bhuniya today met governor M.K. Narayanan with an appeal to call an all-party meeting to discuss the states deteriorating law and order as the government had lost all credibility to do so.        
	Sources close to the Congress said that while pointing out the devastation wrought by armed CPM musclemen, Bhuniya also said the Trinamul Congress was equally to blame for the cycle of violence and counter- violence.        
	The sources said Bhuniya hadnt forgotten how he was heckled by Trinamul supporters in East Midnapore in July. Others saw in his appeal an attempt to get the states main Opposition to sit across the table with CPM leaders.        
	A source close to Bhuniya said that while the Congress has attended all-party meetings called by the state government, Trinamul has refused to do so. If the governor calls such a meeting, Trinamul would be in no position to refuse as that would amount to snubbing Narayanan.        
	Bengal leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee, however, made it clear his party would not attend any meeting where the CPM is present. Why should we attend any meeting where those who have unleashed a reign of terror in Bengal will be present? the Trinamul leader said tonight.         
	In a representation to the governor, Bhuniya said that with rampant political murders, clashes and disruption of public life, the administrative machinery had become paralysed.        
	Unless immediate corrective steps were taken, Bengal could drift towards a civil-war-like situation, he said, urging Narayanan to call an all-party meeting to work out an approach to peace based on the widest possible consensus.        
	A Congress source said Bhuniya also wanted to apprise the governor of Trinamuls growing muscle power as the Congress itself had been at the receiving end sometimes.        
	Bhuniya had earlier accused Trinamul of harbouring anti-socials and urged Mamata Banerjee to weed out the unwanted elements.        
	Bhuniya, however, wouldnt say if he had Mamatas party in mind while appealing for widest possible consensus. I am not mentioning the name of any political party. I told the governor that only if he calls an all-party meeting will it ensure the participation of all parties, he said.         
	Sources close to the Congress said it was possible that with elections approaching, the party too wanted to distance itself from the Left, and hence asked the governor to call such a meeting.

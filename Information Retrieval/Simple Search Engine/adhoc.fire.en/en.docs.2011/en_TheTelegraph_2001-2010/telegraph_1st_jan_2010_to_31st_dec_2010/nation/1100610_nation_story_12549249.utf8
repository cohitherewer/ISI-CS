          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A child protests the gas tragedy verdict at a rally in Bhopal on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, June 9: The Centre today re-constituted a group of ministers (GoM) to examine a range of issues concerning the Bhopal gas tragedy with the focus on rehabilitating the victims.        
	The move came in the wake of nation-wide criticism of the court verdict on the worlds worst industrial disaster.         
	The GoM will be headed by Union home minister P. Chidambaram. The earlier GoM was presided over by Arjun Singh, who was chief minister of Madhya Pradesh when the gas tragedy happened in December 1984.        
	The Congress, facing a volley of uncomfortable questions after fresh controversies erupted clouding the role of its governments in Madhya Pradesh and the Centre at that time, appeared defensive today.        
	The party said the focus of the GoM should be on rehabilitating the victims and ensuring that such tragedies did not recur, instead of on a post-mortem of the incident.         
	The GoM will make recommendations relating to the relief and rehabilitation of the victims and their families.         
	Although Congress spokesperson Jayanthi Natrajan admitted that fresh efforts should be made to bring Warren Anderson, the Union Carbide chief at the time of the gas leak, to India for trial and expressed outrage at the woefully inadequate sentence and compensation, her replies were generally evasive.         
	She did not give a clear answer when asked what legal course should be pursued now. Nor did she shed any light on Arjun Singhs silence on why he had arranged a state government plane to fly Anderson to Delhi.         
	Other than the announcement of the GoM, the Congress, which had remained silent for two days, had nothing to offer. Natrajan said: This is the best any government could have done. The GoM will study all the issues pertaining to the legal framework required, compensation and punishment.        
	She said the CBI and the foreign ministry had made efforts to seek Andersons extradition.         
	Natarajan made it clear she was not defending anybody and would not want to be in a position to be seen as defending Anderson.        
	She said it was the Supreme Court that had reduced the charge from culpable homicide, as mentioned in the chargesheet, to one of causing death through negligence.         
	Natarajan said questions could also be asked of the other governments that had come to power at the Centre and Madhya Pradesh in the past 26 years.        
	Besides Chidambaram, the other members of the GoM are Ghulam Nabi Azad, M. Veerappa Moily, S. Jaipal Reddy, Kamal Nath, Kumari Selja, M.K. Alagiri, Prithviraj Chavan and Jairam Ramesh.        
	The Madhya Pradesh minister in charge of rehabilitation of the victims will be a permanent invitee.

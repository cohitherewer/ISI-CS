	Cuttack, April 11: The Football Association of Orissa (FAO) has decided to allow foreign players to play for local clubs in the Cuttack League. The participating clubs will also be allowed to recruit players from outside the state.        
	The committee in its first meeting yesterday decided to start the Cuttack League soon after the elections on June 27, as the Barabati Stadium will be available for football till August 31. We have decided to allow the competing clubs to recruit overseas players and players from outside the state. But their number will be restricted in the league, said Asirbad Behera, the convener of the ad hoc committee.        
	The first and second division Cuttack League will have 26 participating teams and players will be recruited by June 15. A club will be allowed to recruit 22 players, but only two can be foreigners and four from outside the state.

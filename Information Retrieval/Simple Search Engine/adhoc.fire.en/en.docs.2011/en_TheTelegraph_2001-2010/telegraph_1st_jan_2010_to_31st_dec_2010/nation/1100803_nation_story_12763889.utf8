          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 2: The CBI today filed a curative petition in the Supreme Court for tougher punishment in the Bhopal gas case to set right a colossal injustice, 14 years after the court had diluted the charges helping the accused escape with two-year jail terms.        
	The petition, however, was silent on former Union Carbide chairman and key accused Warren Anderson, who fled India in the wake of the December 1984 tragedy. Anderson is in hiding in the US.        
	Several lawyers dismissed the petition as too little, too late and warned that it could set the stage for a retrial that could take years.        
	The petition came less than two months after a trial court sentenced then Carbide India chairman Keshub Mahindra and six other former officials to two years in prison  for the death of at least 15,000 people  but spared them jail till their appeals were disposed of.        
	The original charges against the seven accused included culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which carries a jail term of up to 10 years. But in its 1996 order, the top court had reduced the charge to causing death by negligence, which carries a maximum term of two years.        
	The CBI today said: The accused getting away with minimal charges has resulted in a colossal failure of justice. This adversely affects not only the victims but also the society and the nation as a whole.

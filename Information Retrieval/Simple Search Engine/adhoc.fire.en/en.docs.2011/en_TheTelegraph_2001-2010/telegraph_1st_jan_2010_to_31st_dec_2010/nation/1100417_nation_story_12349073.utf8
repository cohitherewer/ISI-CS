          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              Brinda Karat and Sandeep Dikshit      
	New Delhi, April 16: Having his love life dragged into controversy was bad enough; now Shashi Tharoor appears to have fallen victim to another mans failed love affair.        
	A west Delhi businessman was arrested today for allegedly sending at least 40 threatening or lewd text messages to about a dozen politicians  including Tharoor and CPM member Brinda Karat  in a bid to frame the boyfriend of a woman he fancied.        
	Police said 27-year-old Narendra Khosla, a manpower supplier, had confessed sending the messages using a SIM card he had procured with the identity details of Manik Verma, a gym instructor. Khosla claimed Verma was having an affair with a woman he had a crush on.        
	The police were earlier in a flap after receiving a flood of complaints from politicians in Delhi about SMS threats. Officers said over 100 such messages had been sent in the past 10 days, and that the police had traced them all to two numbers.        
	The police then questioned the two men under whose names the SIM cards had been procured but both turned out clean.        
	Verma, an instructor at the Constitution Club gym in central Delhi, revealed he had lost his driving licence and suggested others had used it to procure the SIM card. The other suspect questioned, a man identified as Yashpal, too was given a clean chit.        
	The police have not so far accused Khosla of using the SIM card procured in Yashpals name.        
	Around 40 of the messages were sent on April 13 and 14, including the ones to Tharoor and MPs Brinda, Mehmood Madani, Rasheed Alvi, Om Prakash and Sandeep Dikshit.        
	The threat to Tharoor was messaged to his officer on special duty, Jacob Joseph, on Wednesday. The sender claimed to be acting on behalf of Dawood Ibrahims gang and warned the minister to apologise to Lalit Modi or prepare to die.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | North unswayed by wind of change
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      North unswayed by wind of change
          OUR BUREAU                              
	June 2: By the time they reached north Bengal, the winds of change had petered out into a mild breeze.        
	If one region resisted the change that swept across vast swathes of Bengal today, it was the north where seven municipalities went to polls last Sunday  four in Cooch Behar district, two in Malda and one in Jalpaiguri.        
	The Left retained three, the Congress maintained its hold over one, one saw a tie and two returned a fractured verdict.        
	Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress made marginal gains in the four municipalities in Cooch Behar, but it was status quo in all except Mathabhanga, where Trinamul and the CPM won 6 wards each.The toss of a coin will decide who forms the board.        
	The Left retained Dinhata and Toofanganj, while the Congress emerged the single-largest party in the Cooch Behar municipality but would have to fall back upon Trinamul to again form the board.        
	The Dinhata results were particularly disappointing for Trinamul, as it was from here that the party had made its first major breakthrough by defeating the Forward Bloc on its home turf in the last Assembly elections.        
	In Jalpaiguri, the Congress maintained its 2005 tally, winning 16 of the 25 wards that went to polls on May 30.         
	In Malda district, the Left retained Old Malda, while Englishbazar saw a hung verdict.        
	So what happened to the winds of change?        
	While campaigning in north Bengal, Trinamul Congress leaders only harped on Singur and Nandigram and highlighted their allegations about the CPMs terror tactics. These events have been taking place too far away for the electorate here to sit up and notice, said Sanjoy Chakrabarty, secretary of the Jalpaiguri Welfare Organisation.        
	Another factor, Chakrabarty said, was Mamata rarely visited north Bengal. She visited the closed Kanthaguri tea garden in August 2007, five years after it was shut down, he said. Chakrabarty, however, pointed out that north Bengal, except for Cooch Behar district, has been a Congress belt. The Left has retained the Old Malda municipality and the Congress fared marginally better in Englishbazar, he added.        
	Other observers said Trinamul leaders never touched upon the situation in the hills, closed tea gardens and the overall underdevelopment of the region. CPM and Congress leaders, like Nirupam Sen and Deepa Das Munshi, were very prompt in raising these issues, said an observer.        
	Trinamul district leaders blamed the leadership for the poor show. We had to put up with the money and muscle power of the CPM and the Congress during campaigning, said a senior leader in Cooch Behar. Very little was sent to us from Calcutta.        
	Trinamul state committee member Babla Sarkar said the party would have certainly done better in Englishbazar had the top brass concentrated a little more rather than focus entirely on Calcutta and south Bengal. We had Partha Chatterjee campaigning for the party on one occasion and it was clear he was just going through the motions, he said.

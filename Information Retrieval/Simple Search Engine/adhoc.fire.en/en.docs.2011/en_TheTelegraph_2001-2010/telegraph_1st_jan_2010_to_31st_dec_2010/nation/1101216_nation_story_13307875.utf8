	New Delhi, Dec. 15: The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan is mulling capacity expansion in its over 1,000 schools so that general category seats are not affected while implementing a 25 per cent quota for poor students under the Right To Education Act.         
	The policy is similar to that followed by centrally funded institutions that have added seats to accommodate a 27 per cent OBC quota without reducing their intake of general-category students.        
	As of now, nine seats in a class of 40 are kept aside for SC/ST students, which makes 22.5 per cent of the class (15 per cent for SCs and 7.5 per cent for STs). The other 31 are general-category students. In these three categories, too, there is a sub-category of 3 per cent for the physically challenged. So, in the 15 per cent reserved for SCs, 3 per cent is for the physically challenged among children enrolling under this category. Same for the ST and general categories.         
	If the Kendriya Vidyalayas implements another 25 per cent quota, its mandate of fulfiling the education needs of children of government employees will be diluted, a source said. There are about 10 lakh seats in the 1,073 Kendriya Vidyalayas across the country.         
	The Sangathan wants to increase the seats by expanding the infrastructure so that the seats available to children of employees are not affected. This is in the same pattern as the 27 per cent OBC quota is being implemented by the centrally funded educational institutions, the source said.        
	For implementing the OBC quota, the higher educational institutions are in the process of increasing their seats by 54 per cent. This would not affect the existing seats for general category students.         
	The Right to Education Act also bans screening of any kind for school admission. A section of academicians thinks that the weightage given to children of government employees could amount to a kind of screening.         
	A Sangathan official, though, pointed out that screening has been described as a merit-based test. The KVS does not conduct any such test. The ministry will take a view on the issue.         
	Educationist Shayma Chona said children from weaker sections were already getting admission in the Kendriya Vidyalayas. The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan caters to a special segment  the children of transferable government employees. Those children cannot be denied education as the Right to Education Act says that every child has the right to quality education. So the weightage given to such students should not be considered as sort of screening, she said.

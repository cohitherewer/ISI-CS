The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court to hear plea today
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Court to hear plea today
                            
	Bangalore, Oct. 11 (PTI): The 16 disqualified Karnataka MLAs today filed a petition in the high court challenging the action against them by the Speaker.        
	The hearing on the petition of the legislators, including 11 of the BJP, was adjourned till tomorrow. They have requested the court to scrap the order of Speaker K.G. Bopaiah, terming it a clear violation of rules.        
	The disqualification rules and procedures laid down in the Constitution have not been complied with at all, said the petition, which came up before a division bench of Chief Justice J.S. Khehar and Justice N. Kumar.        
	One of the lawyers for the rebel BJP MLAs argued that the legislators had not given up the membership of their party but had only expressed lack of confidence in the Yeddyurappa government because of rampant corruption and nepotism.        
	We are concerned with constitutional disqualification which can happen only when we (the MLAs) resign from the membership (of the party). The power of disqualification should be lodged not with the Speaker but with the Election Commission, the lawyer said, reading out from the petition.         
	But former solicitor-general Soli Sorabjee, appearing for the government, contended that the order was in full compliance with natural justice under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution. When Chief Justice Khehar sought some clarifications, Sorabjee sought time till tomorrow and the proceedings were adjourned.        
	But another government counsel, Satyapal Jain, said outside court that the MLAs move to meet the governor and express lack of confidence in the government led by their own party was tantamount to voluntary withdrawal from the membership of the party.              
	Other lawyers for the MLAs described the whole procedure (of disqualification) as mala fide and alleged that it was done with the sole intention of saving his (Speakers) chair and the chair of chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa. They claimed the Speaker had served no notices before disqualifying the MLAs.

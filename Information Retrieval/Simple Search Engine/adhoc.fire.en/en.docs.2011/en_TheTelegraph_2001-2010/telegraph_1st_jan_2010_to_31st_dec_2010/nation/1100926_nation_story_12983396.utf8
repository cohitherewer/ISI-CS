	Durgapur, Sept. 25: An Asansol college girl was dragged out at gunpoint from a bus this afternoon and whisked away in a car but was rescued late tonight from Hazaribagh, police sources said.        
	The sources said four youths had been detained in the Jharkhand district after the girl was traced.         
	The third-year BA student, daughter of a local cloth trader, was going for tuitions with a classmate when a silver-coloured Indica with three youths screeched to a halt in front of the bus around 5.30 near Asansol railway station, about 240km from Calcutta.        
	After blocking the road, one of the three youths, armed with a revolver, boarded the bus and pointed it at the driver. The other two youths dragged the girl out of the bus, bundled her into the car and drove away before anybody realised what had happened, said an officer of Asansol South police station.        
	He said none of the passengers raised a cry as the abductors sped away with the 21-year-old.        
	The girls friend Ankita Singh took an auto-rickshaw to reach the cloth shop of her classmates father, Pramode Singh, who lodged a police complaint.        
	A police officer said the complaint had been lodged against two youths  Sanjoy Jadav and Akash Singh  both in their twenties.        
	Preliminary investigation reveals that one of the youths has an affair with the girl. We are probing all angles, said an officer.         
	In Asansol, additional superintendent of police Prasun Banerjee said the police had detained a youth who was being interrogated.        
	Late tonight, Pramode Singh said the police had informed him that his daughter had been found.

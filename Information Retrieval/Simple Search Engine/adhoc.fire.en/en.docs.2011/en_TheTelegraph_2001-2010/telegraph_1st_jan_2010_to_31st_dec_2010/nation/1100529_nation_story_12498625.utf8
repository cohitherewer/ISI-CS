          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 28: The Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti today intensified its agitation after the government started a survey on Tuesday for the South Korean steel behemoths proposed greenfield project near Paradip.        
	Today, the association  spearheading the anti-Posco Steel plant movement  sealed the boundary of Dhinkia panchayat, the epicentre of the agitation. If anyone tries to trespass without obtaining necessary permission from the association, he will be taken to task. If government officials try to sneak in, they will have to face severe resistance, warned samiti leader and local sarpanch Sisir Mohapatra.        
	Besides erecting wooden and bamboo barricades at the entrance of each village connecting Dhinkia, it has also cut off roads at many points.         
	To garner public support, the samiti also organised a meeting at Gobindpur today, one of the three villages  the other two being Trilochanpur and Dhinika  of the panchayat. Addressing the gathering, samiti president Abhay Sahu said they would continue to oppose the Posco project. The entire Posco project should be shifted from the proposed site, he said.        
	Jagatsinghpur superintendent of police Devdutt Singh said the administration would ensure that no inconvenience was caused to the villagers.

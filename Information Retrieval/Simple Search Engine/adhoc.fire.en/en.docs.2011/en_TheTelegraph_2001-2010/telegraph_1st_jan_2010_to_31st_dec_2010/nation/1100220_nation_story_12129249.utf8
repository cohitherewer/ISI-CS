          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	Indore, Feb. 19: The BJP national council meeting today turned its focus to inflation and announced a signature campaign against the Centre, a day after president Nitin Gadkaris remarks on Ayodhya created conflicting perceptions.        
	Today, Gadkari didnt utter a word on Ayodhya, and his party said its signature war on price rise would culminate with a rally in New Delhi on April 21, when Parliament reconvenes for the second leg of the budget session.        
	Gadkaris silence on one of the BJPs pet themes came a day after he declared that if land was available somewhere close to the Babri complex, Hindus could consider allowing a mosque to be built on it. The remark caused some consternation in the RSS and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, but according to spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Gadkari meant land would be given to Muslims only if the players concerned agreed.        
	Intervening in the debate on price rise at the meeting earlier in the day, Sushma Swaraj, Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha, explained what she described as the partys new movement. People are angry and desperate but they are not united. It is incumbent on political parties to bring them together on this issue.        
	Sushma called on the delegates, party leaders and workers, to mobilise protesters. Get signatures on the pro forma that will be handed out today. But do not stop with just signatures. Every worker needs to get at least one member of every family to travel to Delhi for the rally. Every big work needs a worker and every worker needs a big work, she said.

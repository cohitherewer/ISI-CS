          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 16: Orissa has opposed introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops, including Bt brinjal.        
	Union environment and forest minister Jairam Ramesh, who attended a public consultation here today, said he had received a letter from Orissa agriculture minister Damodar Rout that his government was opposed to GM crops, including Bt brinjal, on principle. Earlier, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had said no to GM crops including Bt brinjal, he said.        
	We had sought views of seven states and so far received replies from two (Bihar and Orissa), said Ramesh, adding that Bengal was also opposed to Bt brinjal.        
	Bihar, Orissa and Bengal produce 60 per cent of brinjal, he said, and views of these states were important. But so were those of consumers and stakeholders across the country.         
	Ramesh met agitators outside the meeting venue opposing introduction of Bt brinjal. I have taken note of their protest, he said.

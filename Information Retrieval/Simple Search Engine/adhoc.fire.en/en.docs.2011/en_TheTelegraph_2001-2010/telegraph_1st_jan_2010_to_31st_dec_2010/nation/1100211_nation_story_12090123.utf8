	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 10: In less than 48 hours, Maoists blew up railway tracks in Sundargarh district again, derailing eight wagons of a goods train.        
	Continuing with their attacks on the railways in protest against the Centres proposed offensive against them, Naxalites assembled between Bisra and Bhalulata stations of the district around 2am and triggered the blast.         
	A three-day Maoist bandh in five states ended last midnight. But the Naxalites also extended the bandh in Sundargarh district by seven days, demanding immediate release of two rebels detained a couple of days ago.        
	On Monday, the rebels had blown up a railway track between Bhalulata and Jareikela stations, derailing two wagons of a goods train.        
	Besides the derailment, last nights blast also snapped overhead electric cables. However, no casualty or injury was reported. The train was travelling from Jareikela to Bisra in Chhattisgarh.        
	The incident led to disruption of services on the Howrah-Mumbai route. Trains on the Howrah-Mumbai main line have been controlled at different stations, said East Coast Railway chief public relations officer Soumitra Majumdar.        
	The Utkal Express, Mumbai-Howrah Mail, Azad Hind Express, Gitanjali Express, Ahmedabad Express, Sambaleswari Express and Tata-Alleppey Express had been held up at different stations.         
	The restoration started at 7.20am after a two-hour check by security personnel. Normal train services resumed at 1pm.        
	Majumdar said several trains had been diverted via Hatia-Muri-Tatanagar.         
	The CRPF, Special Operations Group of the state police and Government Railway Police personnel have begun combing operations in the area.        
	CPI(Maoist) Chhotanagpur zonal committee secretary Samarji told reporters over phone: The police should release the activists or forward them to court immediately.        
	The two activists allegedly detained by Bisra police were Anita, a member of Krantikari Mahila Sangathan, and Marshal Horo.        
	The bandh in Sundargarh district will affect train services on the Howrah-Mumbai route. Movement of major trains, including Gitanjali Express, Howrah-Mumbai Mail, Jnaneswari Express and Ispat Express among others, are likely to be disrupted.

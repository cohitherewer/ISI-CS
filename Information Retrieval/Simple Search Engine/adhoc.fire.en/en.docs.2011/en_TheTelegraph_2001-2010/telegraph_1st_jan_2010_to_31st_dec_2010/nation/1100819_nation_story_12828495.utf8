	New Delhi, Aug. 18: The Centre has set up a six-member panel to examine the regulatory mechanism for higher education institutions, including the IITs and the IIMs, and suggest modifications to give them more autonomy.        
	The panel, constituted by the HRD ministry in the first week of August and headed by professor Madhava Menon, will evolve a comprehensive policy and submit its report within three months, a ministry official said.        
	The mandate of the committee is to examine the existing regulatory mechanism and see whether the regulations are too excessive. The panel will suggest the extent to which regulatory bodies should control the functioning of the institutions, the ministry official said.        
	The panel itself was set up on the recommendation of another committee. That committee, headed by professor Yashpal, had suggested that universities should be free from the control of regulatory bodies so they can excel in academic and research activities.        
	At present, the institutions have to seek permission from the University Grants Commission , All India Council of Technical Education , Medical Council of India , National Council for Teachers Education and the Distance Education Council to start technical and professional courses.        
	Such an arrangement, several experts have reckoned in the past, has reduced varsities to mere affiliating institutions for degree colleges, with the main powers of control invariably vested with the regulatory agencies.         
	The IITs and IIMs, too, have demanding greater administrative and financial autonomy.        
	Other members of the Menon-headed panel are Sayed Hasnain, vice-chancellor of Hyderabad University, Pankaj Chandra, the director of IIM Bangalore, M.S. Ananth, the Director of IIT Madras, Mihir Choudhary, vice-chancellor of Tezpur University in Assam and Ved Prakash, the vice-chairman of the UGC.

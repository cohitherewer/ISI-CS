          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Dhoni                                  
	Calcutta, April 17: Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has moved Calcutta High Court against a Calcutta-headquartered sports promotion agency for allegedly breaching an advertisement deal and underpaying him.        
	Gameplan Sports  a company that deals in sponsorship sales, media syndication, advertisements and endorsements  had published ads featuring Dhoni this IPL season, one of the cricketers lawyers said.        
	Dhonis petition, filed yesterday, claims the company failed to pay him the agreed sum and violated some other terms of the agreement too.        
	High court sources said the matter would be heard by Justice Sanjib Banerjee on April 26, with lawyers Anindya Mitra and Pratap Chatterjee representing Dhoni.        
	The company had refused to pay him (Dhoni) the amount agreed upon for the publication of these advertisements. The details will be revealed only to the court, one of Dhonis lawyers said.        
	Jeet Banerjee, a partner in Gameplan, said: Since the matter is sub judice        
	, I should not make any comment. But we will oppose the petition and the truth will be made known to the court.

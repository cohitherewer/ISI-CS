          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, July 4: A Class IX girl was burnt alive in an Andhra village by a construction labourer whose advances she had rebuffed, highlighting a recent trend where jilted lovers were going beyond the more common acid attacks.        
	Satish Kumar, 22, barged into the home of his neighbour Sushila, 14, last evening when her family had gone out for a wedding.         
	He closed the door, poured kerosene and burnt her. The victims screams for help were muffled by the heavy rain.        
	Sushilas father Devrajulu, a farm labourer, and others in the family arrived after some time to find her burnt. They rushed her to hospital but the doctors declared her dead and said she had suffered 80 per cent burns.         
	Satish and his family members are absconding. A murder case has been registered and a hunt is on for them.        
	Satish had been asked to stay away from the girl by the head of the village, Appayyagaripalli in Chittoor district, around 600km from Hyderabad, after her parents complained he was pursuing the teenager and harassing her.

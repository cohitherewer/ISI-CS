	New Delhi, April 29: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today hinted in Parliament that the National Technical Research Organisation will be brought under his control in wake of allegations of phone-tapping against the agency.         
	Chidambaram told the Rajya Sabha: I had met the Prime Minister and I said it (the NTRO) should be placed under a minister so that the minister is accountable to Parliament.

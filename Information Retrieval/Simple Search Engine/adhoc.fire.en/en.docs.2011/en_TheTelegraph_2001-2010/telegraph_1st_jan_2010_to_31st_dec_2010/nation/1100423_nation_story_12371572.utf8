	New Delhi, April 22: As the IPL controversy brought Sharad Pawars NCP under the glare, the Congress has denied that it is out to torment its ally.         
	Congress leaders, worried about such misgivings, assert that ongoing investigations have a limited purpose of unearthing the rot in the IPL.         
	Government sources said it would be illogical to push the NCP around at a time the ruling UPA was trying to persuade other parties to defeat the cut-motion planned by the Opposition on April 27 on the fuel price hike.         
	The Congress, which has already issued a three-line whip to its members to be present in the House and asked all its 274 supporting MPs to do so, was negotiating even today with the hostile BSP to oppose the motion.        
	The BSP has said it is ready to walk out of the House  after attacking the government for raising the fuel prices  as it doesnt want to be seen with Mulayam Singhs Samajwadi Party, which has aligned with the Left again.         
	Some other parties and individual MPs are also being worked upon. Under such circumstances, a PMO source said, it will be unthinkable to antagonise ally NCP, on whose support the Maharashtra government runs, too.        
	A Congress leader, who is a key minister in the government, said today: The government or the party has no intention of dragging any party or individual into this (the IPL mess) and we are surprised the NCP is giving so much clarification.         
	The investigations being done are only for IPL dirt, not against anyone, he asserted, adding so far, there is nothing against the NCP or its leaders anyway.         
	The minister, however, suggested that the government would crack down on the IPL, dubbing it a complete money-laundering business. What are the companies based in tax havens doing here? Should the government close its eyes to all this? The BCCI will have to clean up the IPL. The government will have close it down otherwise.         
	He, however, added that if something comes up during investigations against any individual, he will have to answer for it.         
	We have sacrificed our own minister (an allusion to Shashi Tharoor). We will not protect anybody. I dont think any of our allies also expect us to defend them in case of wrongdoing. Let the investigations be done independently and let politics be separate from that.        
	 Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari has also said earlier there is a Chinese wall separating the IPL and politics and the relations with the NCP wont be affected.        
	Congress leaders realise a lot of confusion has been created because NCP leader and civil aviation minister Praful Patels daughter works for the IPL. An email allegedly sent from Patels office to Tharoor on IPL valuation has also caused a storm but Congress sources pointed out that it was a public document.        
	Sharad Pawars daughter Supriya Sules clarification on her husbands equity in a broadcasting company that has IPL rights also appears to have convinced the Congress. She said the equity belonged to her father-in-law since 1992, when the IPL was not even born.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi-bashing after blind eye to riots
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Modi-bashing after blind eye to riots
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          The advertisement showing Modi and Nitish Kumar                                  
	Patna, June 12: The BJP is wondering why Nitish Kumar feels it necessary to periodically assert his secularism, with Narendra Modi as the focus of the exercise.        
	BJP leaders are not willing to criticise Nitishs position in public. In private, they say that a person who did not protest the Gujarat pogrom of 2002, and unquestioningly bought the state governments version of the Godhra fire, cannot suddenly be seized with pangs of concern about how Bihars Muslims may be feeling about Modi setting foot in their state.        
	Neither does Nitish seem too worried about having Sushil Modi, a kar sevak who was in Ayodhya when the Babri Masjid was pulled down, as the deputy chief minister and Ashwani Choubey as a senior minister.        
	So why does he have these qualms about Modi?        
	A Janata Dal (United) leader, who is quietly sustaining Nitishs secular image, put it down to the two chief ministers high ambition. Modi sees Nitish as his only worthy non-Congress competitor in the national arena. He will do everything to demolish him and thats what he has tried now.        
	The reference was to the ad blitz by Modi attempting to sell himself as a role model for the Bihar chief minister.        
	Unlike Modi, whom many in the BJP consider an arriviste with aspirations exceeding his real worth, Nitish is seen as a silent player who would not reveal his hands prematurely.        
	For instance, Nitishs only apparent agenda for the moment is to retain power in the year-end elections. However, if he wins the polls, its anybodys guess whether he would set his sights on Delhi in the 2014 battle, his supporters say.        
	Even his critics, such as a Rashtriya Janata Dal MP who spoke off the record, admire Nitishs political dexterity. Nobody remembers that he was part of the BJP coalition when Gujarat happened. What everybody marvels at is how he takes on Modi, the most powerful BJP leader, the MP said.        
	If Lalu Prasad is spoken of as the wizard of the politics of symbolism, Nitish is described in Bihar as the best practitioner of the politics of symbolism overlaid with substantive messages.        
	Messaging was just what Modi was trying by unleashing the ad campaign that combined a new-found love for Muslims with claims of being a model chief minister.        
	Modis regular blogs reveal his makeover attempt. Having cut the RSS to size in Gujarat and bullied the state BJP into submission, he has found new backers in actors Amitabh         
	Bachchan and Ajay Devgn who have praised his achievements in development and governance.        
	Nitish, however, said all these advertisements were unauthorised without clarifying whose authorisation was needed. I was not informed about them. We will take legal action against the (ad) agency, he said.        
	A government source said the advertising agencys Patna office had been raided and arrests were likely tonight. It wasnt clear what the agencys offence was.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dam and curse in development debate
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Dam and curse in development debate
          ASHUTOSH MISHRA                           Mugi point, where the Sabari and Sileru rivers meet, near Mottu in Malkangiri. Telegraph picture                                  
	Mottu (Malkangiri), Sept. 11: Perched on the southern tip of Orissa, this nondescript habitation of Koya tribals and Telugu settlers is in ferment, reflecting the pulls and pressures churning the development debate in the country.         
	Concern is writ large on peoples faces who fear the worst from the Rs 10,150-crore Polavaram multi-purpose project coming across the border in Andhra Pradesh, about 80km from here.         
	The project has not only become a bone of contention between BJD-ruled Orissa and Congress-ruled Andhra but has also given Naveen Patnaik ammunition to target the UPA after Rahul Gandhis foray into the tribal hinterland in the eastern state.        
	Naveen blames the UPA for clearing the Andhra project that has fuelled fears of submerging several villages in Orissa, while slamming the brakes on the Vedanta project in his state.        
	Pointing to what residents call the Mugi point where the Sabari and Sileru rivers meet, a stones throw from the villages, Lakshmayya Kora, a young Koya tribal, says: These two have been our curse for some time. We lost everything in the floods four years ago. Now they are building a dam at Polavaram on the Godavari which would make heavy discharge downstream, inundating our villages. We may have to move out of here.                         Lakshmayya Kora, who spoke of the curse of the rivers    
	Lakshmayya, who owns 10 acres on which he grows paddy and cereals like moong which have a good market in Andhra, is not the only one to voice such fears.        
	The ward member of Mottu gram panchayat, L. Ram Babu, says the construction of the dam at Polavaram would affect at least 14 villages in Mottu and Pusuguda panchayats which suffered massive damage in the floods of 2006 when hundreds of houses collapsed and standing paddy crop in almost all the villages was destroyed.         
	Now another catastrophe stares us in the face. Our government should do something about this. After all, the talk of Polavaram has been going on for the last 15 years, said the elderly man.         
	Being illiterate, most Koyas, however, do not understand the deeper issues involved in the Polavaram controversy which has turned into a political issue with the BJD planning a rally tomorrow to protest against execution of the project by the Andhra government without taking Orissas concerns into account.                     
	The Orissa government is against the implementation of the project in its present shape, saying it will devastate croplands in the Mottu and Pusuguda panchayats of Malkangiri.         
	Although aware of the rally being planned by the ruling party, Mausam Bhima, a Koya tribal from Kataguda village, deep inside the forests of Mottu, is bitter with the government.         
	The rally is not going to serve any purpose unless the government takes it up with Andhra Pradesh which is believed to have completed 90 per cent of the work. The ruling party MLA, Mukund Sodi, who is a Koya like us, has not even bothered to visit us after the elections, said Bhima.         
	His friend Mottumi Irma, who owns three acres which, he says, are not enough to feed his family of five, agreed. In fact, we have been getting more support from people from Andhra Pradesh areas like Chintur who also face a threat from the dam. A few years ago, they came here to mobilise support against the project which would hit them just as badly, said Irma.         
	The project, according to Mottu tehsildar Gobind Dandesna, will inundate 4,932.22 hectares, including 1,451.51 hectares of agricultural land, in 11 villages of Mottu and Pusuguda panchayats.        
	Over 10,000 people, mostly tribals, will be affected, he said, adding that the government of the neighbouring state had not bothered to take the initiative for holding gram sabhas or conducting public hearings to seek public opinion on the project.         
	We are yet to get a request from them in this regard, he said. The tehsildar suggested that experts from the Centre and the states concerned should visit the project area and the Orissa villages to be affected to work out a solution.

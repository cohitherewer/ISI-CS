	New Delhi, Aug. 9: The Centre is set to regulate the operations of private universities that are often found opening off campuses illegally and duping students by offering unapproved courses.        
	The University Grants Commission (UGC), which regulates higher education, will consider tougher norms for the opening and operation of private universities at its meeting on Thursday, official sources have told The Telegraph.        
	A committee set up by the UGC has prepared new regulations saying such institutions need at least five years of standing to be eligible to open a campus outside the state where it is established.        
	After a review of the 2003 regulations, the committee comprising Prof. K. Ramamurthy Naidu, R.K. Chauhan and Amitesh Kumar  has suggested that private universities will be allowed to open off campuses only after their financial strength and experience are ascertained. The UGC will send committees to the institutions to check out both.        
	The private university will have to demonstrate that it has the funds to establish labs and other facilities at its off campus in accordance with parameters set by regulatory agencies like the UGC, the All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) or the Medical Council of India.        
	The private university will also have to get the consent of the state government where the parent institution is located as well as that of the state where the off campus will come up. To start campuses abroad, it will have to take the permission of the parent state government, the Centre and the foreign country.        
	The parent state government and the private university are also mandated to inform the UGC about the establishment of the new campus after the legislature enacts a law to that effect.        
	At present, private universities are not bound to inform the UGC about their establishment and functioning. The UGC gets to know of them when they approach it for grants or permission to open off campuses. According to UGC records, there are 63 private universities in the country.        
	The new regulations say private universities can only offer courses approved by the UGC at off campuses. If they want to start a new course, they will have to get it approved by the UGC.        
	Once the UGC takes a decision on the new regulations, they will be sent to the human resource development ministry for approval. They will then be notified, the sources said.        
	Private universities are set up either by an act in the legislature or Parliament. Their operation is limited to the territorial jurisdiction of the state that has passed the law for their establishment. They are allowed to open off campuses with the approval of the UGC, AICTE and the Distance Education Council.        
	However, the UGC has found that several private universities have opened off campuses without the permission of the regulatory bodies. Many have also been offering unapproved courses. The UGC has issued public notices many times cautioning students against taking admission for such courses.

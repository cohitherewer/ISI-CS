The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CM Maoist finger at Trinamul
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CM Maoist finger at Trinamul
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, May 21: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today accused some state-level Trinamul Congress leaders of having regular contact with Maoists.        
	Four or five state-level Trinamul leaders have links with the Maoists. We know who these leaders are and who they are meeting, Bhattacharjee said in an interview to STAR Ananda tonight.         
	Asked why his administration was not arresting these leaders, the chief minister said: We have arrested a few leaders at the grass roots. We are keeping a watch on these state-level leaders. We want to see how far they can go.        
	Bhattacharjee said he had information that these Trinamul leaders had recently got in touch with the Maoists before organising a meeting in West Midnapores Pirakata, which is 27km from rebel hotbed Lalgarh. We have documents to prove Trinamuls direct contact with the Maoists, he added.        
	The chief ministers allegations evoked strong protest from Trinamul leaders who termed his comments as rantings of a person of unstable mind.         
	Convinced that the people will oust the CPM in the civic polls, the chief minister is talking rubbish against us. But the people will not buy his comments, said Trinamul state president and MLA Subrata Bakshi.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata would give a fitting reply to the chief ministers allegation when she resumes her civic poll campaign in Calcutta on Sunday. The Trinamul chief today left for Delhi to attend the UPA IIs first birthday bash tomorrow.         
	Bhattacharjee conceded that the Left had fared badly in the Lok Sabha elections because the people were not properly convinced about our decision to withdraw support to the UPA government at the Centre.         
	He claimed that the result of the Lok Sabha polls would have no bearing on the civic elections.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nalini freedom plea rejected second time
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nalini freedom plea rejected second time
          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, March 29: Nalini Sriharan will continue to serve out her life term for Rajiv Gandhis assassination, with a prison advisory board rejecting her request for premature release for the second time.        
	The DMK government quickly endorsed the boards decision and informed the Madras High Court bench hearing Nalinis petition for premature release on the ground that she had completed the minimum 14 years in jail 19 years in all. A government order has been issued to endorse the recommendation of the board.        
	The board, headed by Vellore collector C. Rajendran had on January 20 heard Nalini and two others at the prison. Rejecting her plea, it said the gravity of her crime was heinous. She had acquired degrees and diplomas which does not mean that she has changed her attitude. Even now she does not admit her guilt and she has no regrets for her act. Considering the social history of circumstances of criminal behaviour and the degree of her criminality her case is not fit for recommendation of premature release, the board said.        
	Chennai police, too, had serious misgivings about the 42-year-old Nalinis possibility of living with her mother in the citys Royapettah area, home to many VIPs and the US consulate. The police feared her presence could create law and order problems.         
	But what was not said in the government order was the nagging apprehension among central and state intelligence agencies that Nalini could emerge as a rallying point for pro-LTTE forces which have been rudderless after the decimation of the Tamil Tigers.         
	Although we cannot say it in black and white, Nalinis appearance on a public platform can be converted into support for and justification of Rajiv Gandhis assassination, which is not acceptable to any state government, said a senior intelligence officer.        
	Nalinis release would have also angered state Congress leaders, who are hyper-sensitive about any lenience towards Rajiv Gandhis killers  three of them on death row and two, including Nalini, serving life terms.        
	Many had even frowned on Priyanka Gandhis secret visit to the Vellore prison two years ago to meet Nalini. With Assembly elections due next year, the ruling DMK does not want a grouchy Congress as its ally.        
	State Congress leaders welcomed the decision. The Tamil Nadu government has taken the right decision with courage and conviction as any gesture towards Nalini could be misconstrued as a licence for anti-national forces in the state to unleash their anti-India and pro-LTTE propaganda, said former Union minister E.V.K.S. Elangovan. MLA C. Gnanasekaran said the DMK government had respected the sentiments of lakhs of Congressmen who were still feeling the pain of Rajiv Gandhis death on Tamil soil.        
	An earlier prison board had in September 2008 rejected her plea for release saying she might resort to unlawful activities because of her sympathy for the LTTEs cause.         
	Nalini challenged the order in the high court claiming the board had not been properly constituted. The court directed that her case be examined afresh by a reconstituted board. But, as it now turns out, the new board too has stuck to the earlier decision.        
	Nalini was sentenced to death by a Tada court in 1997 for the May 20, 1991, assassination. But her death sentence was commuted to a life term on a personal appeal by Sonia Gandhi as Nalini has a daughter.         
	In prison, Nalini secured a masters degree in computer applications from Ignou. Her husband, death-row convict Murugan, has completed his BCA and also edits the prison Tamil magazine, Prison Birds.         
	Their 16-year-old daughter Meghara, staying with relatives in Sri Lanka, is awaiting an Indian visa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ideal scam goes back to NDA days
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ideal scam goes back to NDA days
  - Housing scandal came to light because of heightened concern for coastal security, say officials         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      The Adarsh Housing Society building at Colaba that is at the centre of the controversy. File picture                                
	New Delhi, Nov. 1: Adarsh means ideal and in the corridors of the defence ministry today the buzz is that the apartment allotments in south Mumbais Colaba high-rise make for an ideal scam.        
	There are so many hands in the till, officials in the ministry are now letting on, that it involves politicians across parties and senior commanders who have served in sensitive posts right from the time of the NDA regime when George Fernandes was the defence minister.        
	The officials also say that the whiff of corruption would not have touched the high-rise if it were not for the increased awareness of security threats along the coast that has followed the 26/11 terror strikes.        
	As A.K. Antony, the defence minister, and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was Antonys predecessor, decide on Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavans offer to resign, separate inquiries have thrown up questions on the monitoring mechanism in the ministry itself.        
	A navy source today said the Mumbai-based western naval commander, Vice Admiral Sanjeev Bhasin, first flagged it in September last year.         
	This was in the wake of a reinforcing of the coastal security network that followed 26/11.        
	The 31-storeyed building is a kilometre (as the crow flies) from the navys air station, INS Shikra. The western navy commander asked for a list of the occupants and told the Maharashtra government that the height of the building could give a potential threat a vantage point over the military installation.        
	For six months Vice Admiral Bhasin did not get a response. In July this year, he raised the level, and wrote to the chief of naval staff, Admiral Nirmal Verma, who informed the ministry of defence of its concern in August this year.        
	But a defence ministry official today claimed the ministry had no role and the matter was never referred to it. The ministry had found, however, that the land on which the high-rise was built was declared to be an ecological park in 1996. About four years later, in 1999-2000, the land-use was changed.        
	In 1999, India and Pakistan waged war in Kargil. The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance with Narayan Rane as chief minister was in power in Maharashtra. At the Centre, it was the NDA government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, riding high on the crest of what it claimed was a victory and George Fernandes was the defence minister.        
	The now retired General Nirmal Chandra Vij, who currently heads the National Disaster Management Authority with minister of state rank at the Centre, was the Director General of Military Operations during the war. He went on to become the army chief. Generals Vij and Deepak Kapoor and retired Admiral Madhvendra Singh have offered to give up their flat allotments in Adarsh now.        
	A defence ministry official said the minister was still waiting for a report from the navy.         
	The army was also considering appointing a Court of Inquiry with the current General Officer Commanding, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Goa area command, Major General Sanjeev Chopra, at the head. Its terms of reference have not yet been decided.        
	The navys report is expected shortly, the official said. The ministry wants to decide on a course of action  after the political inputs  by November 9.         
	Four other army officers, who went on to become generals are also allottees in Adarsh. They are Major General T. K. Kaul, who was a sub-area commander in Mumbai, Major General V. S. Yadav and Lt General Tejinder Singh.

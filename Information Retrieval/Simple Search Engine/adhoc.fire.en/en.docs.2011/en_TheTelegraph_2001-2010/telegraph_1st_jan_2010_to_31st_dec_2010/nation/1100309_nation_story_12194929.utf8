	New Delhi, March 8: The imminent loss of the support of 47 Lok Sabha MPs was the reason the government and the Congress got cold feet on the womens reservation bill in the Rajya Sabha today.        
	These MPs include 22 from the Samajwadi Party, 21 from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and four from the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).        
	If they withdraw support, the UPA government would be reduced to a majority of four --- a thought that did not please Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, an aide said.        
	The Samajwadis and the RJD issued pullout threats today. I have announced it openly before the media that I will take my support back if the government goes ahead with the bill, RJD chief Lalu Prasad said.        
	He, however, stayed non-committal on whether he would give this in writing to the President  a formal requirement.        
	The governments decision was prompted by many factors, the Prime Ministers aide said.        
	First, without the Samajwadis, RJD and the BSP, the ruling alliance would be left with 274 seats  just one above the majority mark in a House of 544.        
	That would make the government over-dependent on the Independents and unattached MPs such as Jaswant Singh and Jaya Prada to get the crucial finance bill passed amid Opposition threats of cut motions.        
	It would also give allies like the Trinamul Congress and the DMK an opportunity to extract concessions.        
	Second, the government wasnt too happy with the growing Left-Samajwadi-RJD bonhomie and felt it was important to keep Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav away from Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury.        
	Third, the Congress felt that while it made political sense for it to go solo in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, it might be forced to do business with the Yadavs if the state elections threw up hung Assemblies.        
	The Prime Minister reminded his colleagues that without the Samajwadi bailout, his government and the nuclear deal would have gone out of the window in 2008, the aide said.        
	So, why did the government and the Congress not speak to Samajwadi, RJD or BSP leaders even once even as Lalu Prasad kept asking for an all-party meeting? Political sources blamed a sense of complacency and the absence of political management in the UPA.        
	We thought that if we had the numbers from the BJP, Left and other parties, the bill would sail through, a Congress minister said.        
	Nobody anticipated the Opposition turning so violent. We thought that at best, the Yadav leaders would attack (Veerappa) Moily (the Union law minister who moved the motion), so we concentrated on protecting him.        
	Today, the leader of the Lok Sabha, Pranab Mukherjee, spoke to Lalu Prasad and Mulayam but RJD and Samajwadi sources said it was too little too late. By the time they were consulted, Lalu and Mulayam had sensed that the tide had turned in their favour, at least for the moment.        
	The BJP too began enjoying the governments discomfiture. It insisted that the bill should not be passed without a debate, unlike the Left which saw the futility of having one amid such pandemonium.        
	A monumental constitutional amendment of this kind cannot be passed without a debate with the nation looking on. It will lack legitimacy, said Arun Jaitley, Rajya Sabha Opposition leader.        
	The BJP accused the government of inept floor co-ordination. It wondered why the Prime Minister and his colleagues had met the Telugu Desam at 4pm today with the BJP and the Left when the southern partys pro-bill position was known all along.        
	And why was there no attempt to contact the Janata Dal (United)? a BJP leader asked.        
	The Dal (United), which did not issue a whip to its Rajya Sabha MPs, has decided to issue one if and when the bill comes up for voting in the Lok Sabha, where it is likely to oppose the legislation.        
	The three Yadavs  Lalu Prasad, Mulayam and Dal (United) boss Sharad  are to meet the Prime Minister tomorrow.

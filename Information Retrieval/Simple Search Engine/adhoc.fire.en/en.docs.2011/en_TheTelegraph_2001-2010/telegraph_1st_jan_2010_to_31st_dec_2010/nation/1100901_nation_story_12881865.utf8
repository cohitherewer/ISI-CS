          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Aug. 31: Andhra Pradesh has picked as its police boss the brain behind its successful anti-Maoist offensive, superseding two senior officers following a prod from the Union home ministry.        
	K. Aravinda Rao, whose strategies were key to Andhra becoming the only state to virtually drive the Maoists out, took over as director-general of police (DGP) from Girish Kumar who retired today.        
	Rao had set up a special intelligence cell, planned covert operations and infiltrated the ranks of the Maoists. It allowed him to track the guerrillas movements and gain precise information about their leaders, many of whom were eliminated.        
	The 1977-batch IPS officer had also been accurate in assessing the Maoists firepower and finances and identifying their acquaintances in government and political circles.         
	Although Rao has hardly 10 months left before he retires, the Union home ministry apparently wanted a strategist at the crease in case a major offensive was launched against the Maoists in neighbouring states or peace talks began.        
	Rao has two main tasks at hand. One, he must prevent the Maoists from returning to Andhra if they face the heat in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Orissa. Two, he has to prepare the state police for a possible flare-up of the Telangana statehood agitation.        
	Raos elevation comes after a career setback last year when he was shunted out of the police intelligence wing following allegations of excesses and made additional director-general of police (ADGP) in the anti-corruption unit.        
	Chief minister K. Rosaiah had earlier stoked controversy by appointing Girish Kumar as police chief in preference to several senior officers. At that time, S.S.P. Yadav and A.K. Mohanty had challenged Kumars appointment at a tribunal and also moved court. The court, however, ruled in Kumars favour following a report by a three-member expert committee.        
	Bitten by past experience, Rosaiah this time formed a three-member panel of senior bureaucrats to choose the new police chief and acted on its recommendation.

	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 3: An 11-member team of diplomats from eight European countries today interacted with the director-general of police, senior police officers and representatives of civil society for an update on the post-riot situation in Kandhamal.        
	They expressed satisfaction over the measures taken to usher in peace after the 2008 communal violence, DGP M.M. Praharaj told The Telegraph.        
	The team also congratulated the police for ensuring peaceful Christmas celebration for the past two years, said Praharaj.         
	The team members wanted to know the action taken against the culprits involved in the communal violence, said a senior police officer.        
	The team  which faced protests from Hindu organisations, including the Bajrang Dal, upon their arrival last night  was told that more than 800 criminal cases had been registered against the culprits and chargesheets of 75 per cent cases had been filed. Trials were going on smoothly at various courts in Kandhamal. Investigation into important cases including the nun rape case was being conducted under the supervision of Supreme Court, said sources.        
	The delegation  led by Christopher Manet, the counsellor (head of political affairs) of European Commission delegation to India  comprised diplomats from Hungary, Polland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain, Finland and Sweden.        
	Later, they interacted with media and civil society representatives. We are diplomats and we have no mandate to conduct any study of communal situation, said one of the diplomats during the interaction.        
	The team members, however, said they would tour Kandhamal during the next couple of days.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik said: They have come on a short visit to see the post-riot situation. They will monitor what has been done in the (riot-hit) area.        
	In the evening, the team met Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese archbishop Raphael Cheenath and held discussions for over an hour. However, the contents of the discussion were not disclosed.         
	Its a private visit, said Father Joseph Kalathil at Bishops House.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | $340-million rot mission
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      $340-million rot mission
  - Cash for 1m tonnes can feed 2m homes        JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AND R. SURYAMURTHY                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: Amount of rotten wheat India is likely to end up with  1 million tonnes.        
	And thats just official estimates.        
	Money spent on buying this 1 million tonnes of wheat  $340 million. Enough to feed roughly 2 million families in a year.        
	That, in a nutshell, is the story of Indias wheat purchase and wastage.        
	Days after the Supreme Court ordered the government to distribute grain free to the poor instead of letting stocks rot in the open, figures revealed the extent of the wastage.         
	Sources said the government had grain silos with a capacity for storing 39 million tonnes, but had a stock of 57 million tonnes, resulting in a situation where nearly 18 million tonnes were lying in temporary storage or even in the open, under tarpaulin covers.        
	This 18 million tonnes cost the government approximately $6 billion to buy, store and transport.        
	China has the capacity for storing up to 200 million tonnes of wheat and paddy.        
	Officials say the government will end up with some 1 million tonnes of spoilt wheat, though traders put the figure at 8 million tonnes.        
	Rains have been late and heavy in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh where the grain is lying in tarpaulin-covered heaps. We expect at least 40 per cent of the stuff lying in the open to rot, said Jagdamba Gupta, a grain trader and exporter.        
	This is despite purchase of wheat from farmers at a price higher than what the grain costs in the global market.         
	India buys wheat from its farmers at Rs 11,000 or $230 a tonne, the price set independently by a government-appointed committee. Taking the cost of storage and transportation, a tonne ends up costing the government $340.         
	In the global market, wheat costs $260-270 a tonne, despite a 60 per cent increase over June this year.        
	The wastage could have been reduced had the government not slept over recommendations made by the countrys best-known agricultural scientist, M.S. Swaminathan, about half a decade back.        
	The man, known as the father of the Green Revolution, had suggested that the government set up ultra-modern grain storage facilities at 50 locations in the country, with each capable of handling one million tonnes of wheat or rice.        
	There is an urgent need to increase the storage capacity in the country as rotting grains add to the food subsidy bill of the government, said Y.K. Alagh, former Union minister and economist with the Sardar Patel Institute of Economic and Social Research.        
	The government has budgeted an expense of Rs 68,181 crore as subsidy for the year 2010-11 for buying and storing grain for sale at cheaper rates through the public distribution system.        
	It would also be good if the courts order the government to create additional storage capacity. We would then not have to face this kind of a situation next year or the year after that, where we are unable to store a bumper crop, said T. Haque, former chairman of the agricultural prices commission and a well-known agricultural economist.

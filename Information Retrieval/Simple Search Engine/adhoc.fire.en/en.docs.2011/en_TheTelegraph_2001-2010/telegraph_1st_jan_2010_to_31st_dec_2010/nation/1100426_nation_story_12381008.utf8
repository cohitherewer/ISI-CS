The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Board, not Lalit, is boss

	New Delhi, April 25: Lalit Modi may find himself on slippery terrain if he challenges the suspension order served on him tonight by the Indian cricket board.        
	The Board of Control for Cricket in Indias constitution allows it to make or unmake the IPL and, by corollary, its governing council, lawyers told The Telegraph.        
	The board, a society registered in Mumbai, even pays the IPLs taxes, a senior lawyer said. The IPL was created by amending the societys memorandum of association to undertake commercial activities.        
	Therefore, however successful a brand the IPL may be, it is not an independent identity but just an appendage of the all-powerful board, the lawyers said.        
	Modi had initially objected to board president Shashank Manohar calling an IPL governing council meeting tomorrow. Today, Modi had announced he would attend the meeting and chair it, after all, and claimed to have set the meetings agenda too.        
	However, with the board now suspending him, theres little that Modi can do even if he refuses to accept the order, the lawyers said.         
	The board rules give the president the biggest say in punishing any misconduct by anyone involved in the game, and implicitly authorise him to suspend an accused for six months pending an inquiry.        
	A suspended person cannot participate in any of the affairs of the board until final adjudication, sources said.        
	It is the boards prerogative to decide what constitutes misconduct. Section 32(i) of its constitution empowers the board to frame as well as change bye-laws regarding discipline and conduct.        
	Subsection IV of the boards Memorandum and Rules and Regulations says that if any board administrator commits any act of indiscipline or misconduct or acts in any manner which may (be) or (is) likely to be detrimental to the interest of the board or the game of cricket the secretary, in consultation with the president, (may) issue a showcause notice to that person.        
	If such a showcause notice is issued, the matter is referred to a three-member disciplinary committee that includes the board president.        
	The committee conducts a hearing and submits its findings to the board, which then calls a special general meeting to take appropriate decision by (a) majority of 3/4th members present and voting.        
	If an administrator is found guilty and is expelled, he or she cannot hold any position or office in the board or any of its affiliates.        
	The expelled person can make a comeback after three years, provided the re-admission is voted in by a 3/4th majority at a general body meeting.        
	The Jagmohan Dalmiya and I.S. Bindra precedents do not bode well for Modi. Former board president Dalmiya was suspended over financial irregularities; and Dalmiya had suspended Bindra  now one of Modis staunchest backers  just days before a crucial meeting.

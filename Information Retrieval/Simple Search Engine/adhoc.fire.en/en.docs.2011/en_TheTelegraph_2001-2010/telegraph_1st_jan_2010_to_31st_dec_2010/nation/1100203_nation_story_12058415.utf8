          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, Feb. 2: Hrithik Roshans Pied Piper act appears to have been music to Jamiat-e-Ahli Hadees, one of Jammu and Kashmirs largest Muslim groups.        
	The Jamiat is arming thousands of its imams, clerics and other members with mobile connections of one brand Reliance Communications  for the propagation of its teachings, making it possibly the only religious group in the country to start such an initiative.        
	The mobile-savvy Jamiat is known for its puritanical views and supports the separatist movement. It claims to have more 15 lakh members in Kashmir, including children and women. If true, the number will be equal to around 20 per cent of the states Muslim population.         
	We are picking up 20,000 post-paid SIMs of Reliance in the first phase and have already distributed 7,000 among members. By using the SIMs of one service provider, we can make calls to each other free of cost. This will help us communicate our party programmes with ease, Jamiat chief Molvi Showkat Ahmad said.        
	The group, which prides itself in preaching against shrine worship, common in the Valley, has 750 mosques and many schools to carry out its activities. We plan to bring more and more members, perhaps all if possible, into the (SIM card) programme, Ahmad said.         
	Jamiats initiative comes a week after the Centre lifted its two-month-old ban on pre-paid mobiles over security concerns, a widely criticised restriction that had left 38 lakh of the states 45 lakh mobile users without connections.        
	For Reliance Communications, whose ads feature actor Roshan playing a Pied Piper in an apparent attempt to wean customers away from rivals, the Jamiat plan represented an irresistible opportunity. Jamiat is our biggest client in Jammu and Kashmir and its offer to give us such a huge number of subscribers was irresistible, an official of the company said. A fool-proof verification mechanism  a key condition set while ending the ban  has been put into place to ensure the SIM cards dont end up in wrong hands, the official said.        
	Sanjay Sazawal, the companys Kashmir head, said Jamiat had been given a special corporate package, with lower rates, something no other Valley group enjoyed. They are charged Rs 49 per connection as rental. Reliance to Reliance calls are free. The rate is 50 paise per minute for a local call and Rs 1.5 for an STD call. The group has committed 20,000 connections and a good number of them have been given.        
	Mobiles apart, Jamiat plans to set up a state-of-the-art Trans World Muslim University in Kashmir where modern and Islamic subjects will be taught. The land for the institute has been identified. The group has also established a modern medical diagnostic centre.

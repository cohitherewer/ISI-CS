          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 5: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described the rise of smaller parties as evidence of deepening democracy in India but also conceded the process has posed new challenges for governance.        
	Addressing the 20th Conference of Speakers and Presiding Officers of the Commonwealth, the Prime Minister said: In recent times, democratic representation has deepened as more and more sections of the electorate are gaining a political voice. In India, this has become manifest in the growing number of regional and sub-regional parties and a concomitant rise in coalition politics.        
	The Prime Minister added: This has not only presented a challenge for governance but also for the conduct of the system of parliamentary democracy as the voices of the smaller parties have found greater resonance.        
	Singhs measured statement came against the backdrop of the government coming under pressure from a regional party, the TRS, for Telangana.        
	The Prime Minister made an indirect and cautious reference to such pressures by saying: The aspirations of smaller parties may often be anchored in narrower considerations but they carry great weight for their constituents. In the end, democracy must respond to these everyday concerns of the common man, and Parliament should be the forum to articulate and address them.         
	Singh said consensus-building took time but, in the end, the decisions that emerged from such democratic processes were durable.

	New Delhi, April 14: The IIT-Joint Entrance Examination held last Sunday carried contrasting marking schemes for students who took the test in Hindi and those who took it in English, suggesting that the instructions in one of the languages were incorrect.         
	The declared marking scheme for section four of paper two in the English version of the examination said students would receive up to eight marks for each correct answer. But the Hindi question paper awarded only three marks for correct answers to the same questions.         
	Officials at IIT Madras, the institute organising this years JEE, blamed the confusion on a printing error in the Hindi paper and clarified that the English version was correct.         
	But the relatively low marks listed in the Hindi paper may have dissuaded students from answering the question, depriving them of equal knowledge of the questions weightage, critics today argued.

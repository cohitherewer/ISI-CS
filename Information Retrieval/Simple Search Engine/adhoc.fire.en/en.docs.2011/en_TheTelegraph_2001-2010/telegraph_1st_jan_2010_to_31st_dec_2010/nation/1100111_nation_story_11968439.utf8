          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 10: The central government has decided to make each of its 6,000 websites disabled-friendly.        
	Under new government guidelines, the visually challenged will be able to use a screen reader software that will read out the text that appears on a computer monitor. People who have difficulty handling a mouse can use the voice recognition software to work the computer with verbal commands.         
	The websites will provide features like iconic learning for those with autism and learning disabilities; keyboard support for those with visual or upper limb impairment; and navigation facilitation for those with visual and learning disabilities. They will offer transcripts of the audio-video content for the hearing impaired as well as changes in colour schemes.        
	The Centre will institute three awards for the best disabled-friendly websites in the government, public and private sectors.        
	Early this week, the social justice and empowerment ministry became the first to make its website compliant with these guidelines.        
	This is a significant contribution to addressing the profound social disadvantages faced by persons with disabilities. I am sure other central ministries and government departments will soon make their websites accessible as well, social justice and empowerment minister Mukul Wasnik said.        
	A ministry official said: Although screen-reading technology has provided power to visually impaired people, it has hardly reached the broader population in the country and has remained limited to a small, fortunate English-speaking minority. But our website will be supporting several Indian languages, including Hindi, Sanskrit, Tamil, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada and Telugu.        
	The official added: Once all government websites become disabled-friendly, it will be the turn of bank ATMs and railway kiosks.

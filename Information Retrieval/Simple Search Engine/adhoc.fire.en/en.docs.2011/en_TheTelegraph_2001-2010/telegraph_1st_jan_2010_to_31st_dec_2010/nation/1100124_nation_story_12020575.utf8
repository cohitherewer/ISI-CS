The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Soren moots talks first rebel plan 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Soren moots talks first rebel plan 
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, Jan. 23: Chief minister Shibu Soren today insisted that he was not against anti-Naxalite operations, including Operation Greenhunt, but first he wanted to talk to the rebel outfits.        
	He said if the rebels did not shun violence, police action would follow, adding that he expected the Centre to launch Operation Greenhunt after proper consultation with his government.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph exclusively, the chief minister explained why he wanted to give the rebels a chance to put forward their point of view, something that his been frowned upon by the Centre, prompting Union home minister P. Chidambaram to leave out Soren from a security meet he chaired in Raipur yesterday.        
	The rebels have given a 72-hour bandh call in Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. But Jharkhand has been exempted. This proves that they too have faith in our government and are ready for talks. They too are like our children.        
	He said the Maoist issue should have been handled with more sensitivity and hasty steps would only aggravate the situation. Hence, he needed to find out what they wanted before taking action.        
	I will raise these issues during my meeting with the Union home minister in Delhi on January 28. We have identified certain pockets, where strong anti-rebel operations may be needed. But, I cannot allow the men in uniform to wreak havoc all over the state. Every state has its own problems, which can be dealt with only by the popular government concerned, he added.        
	He clarified that no one will be allowed to take the law into his hands. Curbing rebel violence and controlling crime topped his priority list and lax officials would be taken to task, he promised.         
	Police are the first representatives of the government. I changed the police chief to restore peoples faith in the force. I have categorically told the new DGP to get strict with the SPs, who in turn should pull up their erring subordinates, Soren said.        
	The chief minister did not rule out major administrative reshuffles either. We are not going to disturb hard working and honest officials. But, non-performers will have to go. Transfer and posting of officials will happen according to requirements, he added.         
	Soren said he would soon meet his alliance partners to work out a common minimum programme. He added that he was committed to supplying foodgrain and other essential commodities to every BPL family at subsidised rates.        
	My political rivals ridiculed the BJPs promise of foodgrains at Re 1 per kg. They said the state would not be able to bear the financial burden. My point is we are already supplying grains free of cost to BPL families. The scheme will continue till March. Revision of the BPL list is on, the chief minister argued.        
	Soren is also considering contesting either from Jama or Jamtara Assembly seat. While Jama is represented by his daughter-in-law, Sita, the Jamtara MLA is Vishnu Bhaiya. Sources, however, said Soren would contest from Jama and send his daughter-in-law to the Rajya Sabha in February. But the man himself was holding his cards close. I have learnt enough lessons from my experiences in Tamar. Something will be done very soon. But I need to consult my party cadres, Soren said.

  - Apex court dismisses eight-year-late case as dilatory         OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, April 18: The Supreme Court has said land acquisition should be challenged within a reasonable period because a judicial review is not permissible at a belated stage.        
	If an interested person allows grass to grow under his feet by allowing acquisition proceedings to go on (and later challenges it), the slumbered person would be told off the gates of the court, the court said quoting an earlier order.        
	In another judgment, the Supreme Court said that acquired land cannot be de-notified without hearing all the parties involved.        
	A group of Haryana landowners had challenged the acquisition of their plots by the state government, which had notified the acquisition in 2001 and taken possession after the award was made in 2004.        
	The landowners first challenged the award in Punjab and Haryana High Court in May 2009 and, after the case was thrown out on grounds of delay, appealed to the Supreme Court six months later.        
	Dismissing the appeal, the apex court observed: These petitions make it evident that litigants are eager to abuse the process of the court, having no idea about the law of limitation/delay.        
	It quoted an earlier judgment: To have sat on the fence and allowed the government to complete the acquisition and then to attack the notification would be putting a premium on dilatory tactics.        
	The court dismissed the petitioners claim that they had been unaware of the acquisition proceedings, although the state had published the 2001 notification and a 2002 declaration in newspapers.        
	When the petitioners claimed these newspapers did not have wide circulation, the court said the acquisition would have been the talk of the town anyway since a huge tract belonging to a large number of tenure holders had been notified.        
	The judgment on de-notification, by a different bench, related to land acquired by the Karnataka government for the Mysore Development Authority (MDA). Later, the government had de-notified part of it, and the landowners sold off their plots.        
	The MDA, however, complained that the state had not heard it, prompting the government to withdraw the de-notification circular. The landowners challenged this. The high court rejected the petitions of both the MDA and the landowners.        
	The top court set the high court order aside making two points:        
	One, a government cannot de-notify land after taking possession. Two, if possession has not been taken, the government can de-notify acquisition but only after hearing all parties, especially if the acquisition was made for a public purpose.        
	Both judgments were delivered a few days ago.

          CITHARA PAUL                                    
	New Delhi, Jan. 4: Planning to go for a jungle safari? Be prepared to shell out more. And dont also forget to book well in advance.        
	The tourism ministry has decided to restrict trips to national parks and wildlife sanctuaries by limiting the number of visits and making them costlier.        
	The move follows the realisation that increased tourism-related activities in these places are seriously affecting the natural environment and ecology of reserved forests.        
	Wildlife tourism is a major attraction for tourists visiting India. But we have decided to curb tourism-related activities because you have to think about the future, said an official with the tourism ministry.        
	India has 38 tiger reserves, 357 wildlife sanctuaries and 96 national parks. Around 1,000-1,500 tourists visit these forests every day, the most sought-after among them being the Jim Corbett National Park (Uttarakhand), the Sunderbans (Bengal) and Kaziranga National Park and the Manas Tiger Reserve in Assam.         
	The official said the ministry had been getting a number of complaints from environmentalists regarding wildlife tourism going hyper.        
	There have been reports regarding destruction of forest reserves due to increased tourism activities and we felt it was high time (to limit the visits), he added.        
	The ministry of environment and forests had recently asked the tourism ministry to curb tourist visits near forests. It had pointed out that increasing number of tourists and tourism-related constructions in and around forests had been disastrous to the ecology of reserves, national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. There have also been reports of number of tigers dwindling in reserved forests.        
	To begin with, the ministry is planning to restrict the number of visits every day and also to fix a monthly quota of visitors. These measures, officials hope, will cut the number of visits by at least half, which means tourists will have to book much in advance.         
	The ministry is also planning to hike the fees for visiting reserved areas or a wildlife sanctuary. The ministry will also restrict licences to open new hotels and resorts in these areas.         
	If the above measures do not work as we expect, the ministry might even consider banning all future projects in reserved areas for at least five years, the tourism ministry official said.        
	The ministry has also agreed with the forest ministrys suggestion to insist on environment clearance for all upcoming and even existing tourism projects in these areas.        
	Tour operators are not amused. Wildlife tourism has been one of the major attractions of Incredible India. If the ministry goes ahead with these restrictions, it should also be prepared to lose a good chunk of wealthy tourists, said Anand Mahajan of Indiawildlife, an agency that specialises in wildlife tourism.

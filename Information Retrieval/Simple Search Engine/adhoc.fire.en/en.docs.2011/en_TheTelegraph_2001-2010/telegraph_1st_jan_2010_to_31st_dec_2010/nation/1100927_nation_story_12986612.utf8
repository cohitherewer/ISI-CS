          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A Kashmiri child looks at a soldier when his family was stopped at a checkpoint during curfew in Srinagar. File picture                                  
	Srinagar, Sept. 26: Omar Abdullahs plan to keep schools open in the middle of curfew has met with Hurriyat resistance a day before its implementation.        
	Separatist hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani has appealed to people not to send their children to school, days after declaring he was in touch with parents on a new programme to spare exam days from shutdowns.        
	Geelani said the separatists movement came before everything else. His statement said: We urge all parents not to send their wards to schools. All teaching and non-teaching staff are also asked not to join duty and strictly observe the civil curfew. By this gesture, people of Kashmir shall show to the world that they prefer the movement (the agitation) over everything.         
	The Hurriyat hawk pointed a finger at the Centre too, blaming it for killing the Valleys youths in police firing over the past few months and then showing sympathy. It is an irony that on one side Delhi does not hesitate to kill our youths and on the other, they try to show sympathy and concern about students. Their one aim is to scuttle our peaceful struggle, which is giving sleepless nights to the people at helm.         
	State education minister Peerzada Mohammad Sayeed hit back at the separatists, saying they were bent on thwarting the reopening when some of them had sent their own children outside Kashmir for studies. The (separatist) leaders send their own children outside the state for studies. They should have mercy on the lakhs of students who have to appear in exams. Let them not instigate any person to create violence.        
	The government, the minister added, cannot be oblivious to the fact that the majority of children belong to poor families who cannot study outside Kashmir. Some affluent families have sent their children outside while one local (upscale) school has sent its entire Class XII batch outside Kashmir. (But) no government and no civil society can afford to keep their children illiterate.        
	Sayeed said sufficient security measures were in place but warned that the responsibility for any untoward incident lay with the trouble makers. The steps were finalised at a meeting chief minister Omar had chaired yesterday to discuss the reopening plan and save education from the cycle of disruption.        
	Under the plan worked out by the government, school buses will be allowed in curfew-bound areas. All students in uniform will be allowed to move in their school transport. Parents can also accompany their wards. Identity cards of teaching and non-teaching staff will be treated as curfew passes, a police officer said.         
	Omar has appealed to parents, students and the civil society to help him save children from losing a year of their career no one can return to them.

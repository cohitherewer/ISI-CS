          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: From being one of the safest states for women in 2000, Bengal has sunk to being one of the most dangerous.        
	According to the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Bengal has climbed to the third spot on the list of crimes against women in 2008, after Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. In 2000, Bengal was 22nd, bureau officials said.        
	Of 1,95,856 reported incidents of crime against women both under IPC and other women laws  in 2008, Bengal has logged 20,912 cases. Andhra topped the list with 24,111, followed by Uttar Pradesh with 23,569 in the same year.        
	Crime against women has increased manifold in Bengal. The figures draw a grim picture about the state of affairs there, an NCRB official said.        
	However, it is not only in Bengal that the situation has worsened. According to the latest findings, there has been a marginal increase in crime rate against women countrywide from 16.3 per cent in 2007 to 17 per cent in 2008. In 2008, Tripura reported the highest rate at 40.2 per cent while Bengal was at 23.7 per cent.        
	Crimes against women are rising all over the country, the official said. We are trying to empower women by initiating income-generating schemes.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee conceded crimes against women were on the rise in Bengal but pointed out it was a nation-wide trend and not unique to Bengal.        
	The growth in crime across the state is a matter of concern. But let me remind you that the number of crimes is increasing across the country. Crime rate is on the rise in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, Bhattacharjee said, in a reply to Congress legislative party chief Manas Bhuniya.        
	If it was going down across the country and on the rise here, it would have been a reason for concern, he said. I am not stating this in defence. Im just stating facts.        
	The figures for domestic violence are not very encouraging either. Bengal is second on the list of cruelty and domestic violence against women by husbands and relatives. Of 81,344 reported instances in 2008, about 13,663 were from Bengal.

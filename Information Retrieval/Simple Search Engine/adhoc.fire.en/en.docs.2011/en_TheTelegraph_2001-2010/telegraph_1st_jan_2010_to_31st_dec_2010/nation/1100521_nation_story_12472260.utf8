	Raipur, May 20: Suspected Maoists waylaid a truck carrying 16 tonnes of ammonium nitrate in Chhattisgarhs rebel-affected Bastar before offloading the consignment in a highway heist that experts said could be used to trigger at least 300 powerful landmine blasts.        
	The hijack, on the busy NH 43 that connects Chhattisgarh with Andhra Pradesh, came days after Maoist rebels blew up a passenger bus in Chhattisgarhs Dantewada district, killing 24 civilians and 11 special police officers.         
	Bastar police chief P. Sunderraj said the rebels intercepted the Raipur-bound truck carrying ammonium nitrate, used as an oxidising agent in explosives, between Kondagaon and Ghodagaon under Bhanpuri police station, about 300km from here.        
	The rebels took the vehicle deep inside the forests and offloaded 16.5 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, the police officer added.        
	Sources said the rebels overpowered the driver and the cleaner of the vehicle, which was coming from Visakhapatnam. The 16.5-tonne consignment had been booked by one Sanjay Chowdhary of Raipur.        
	Bomb experts said the consignment was enough to trigger nearly 320 powerful landmine blasts. The rebels had been using 25kg of explosives earlier but, of late, they have been planting 50kg or more to inflict maximum casualty, an expert told The Telegraph.         
	The driver, Papa Rao, who was later released by the rebels, drove to Bhanpuri police station late last night. But as he is from Visakhapatnam, he couldnt tell police officials the route the Maoists had taken after hijacking the truck.         
	Rao, however, was sure that the truck was driven 50-60km into the forests. Sources said the Maoists gave a letter to the driver in which they claimed to have offloaded the explosives. It (ammonium nitrate) is of our use and we have taken it, a source said quoting from the letter.         
	Senior police officers from Jagdalpur, the divisional headquarters of Bastar, have reached Bhanpuri to question the driver. A search operation has been launched, but no breakthrough had been reported.

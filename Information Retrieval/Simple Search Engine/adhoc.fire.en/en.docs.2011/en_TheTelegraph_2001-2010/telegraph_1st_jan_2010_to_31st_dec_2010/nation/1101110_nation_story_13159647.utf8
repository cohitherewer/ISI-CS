The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi enigma in Sino-US currency clash
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi enigma in Sino-US currency clash

	Nov. 9: India seems to be caught in a crossfire between the two economic superpowers  the US and China.        
	The G20 nations are preparing to huddle in Seoul on Thursday and Friday to grapple with the idea of a new currency deal to smoothen out a legacy of global trade surpluses and deficits that President Barack Obama believes undermines the chances of a world economic recovery.        
	On Monday, in response to a question on the US Federal Reserves move to shovel another $600 billion into the American economy by buying back government bonds, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said anything that would stimulate the underlying growth of entrepreneurship in the US would help the cause of global prosperity. The reply was interpreted as a tacit suggestion that the Federal Reserves step could not be faulted.        
	But officials in the finance ministry are increasingly uncomfortable with the idea that Singhs statement yesterday at a joint media conference with Obama in Delhi should be read as a signal that India will support the US in the fierce currency battle that looms in Seoul later this week.        
	The Federal Reserves move to print more dollars and, thereby, weaken the value of the currency has already drawn flak from Germany and China  the two principal trading partners of the US. The Americans have been sorely upset with the large trade surpluses that both nations have built up through their trade with the US.         
	Equally, Germany and China are worried that the Feds action will make the imports of a range of products from the two countries unattractive in the US.        
	The Americans have been pressing China to raise the value of the yuan in order to trim its huge trade surplus that is expected to swell to $25 billion in October from $16.9 billion in September. The Chinese trade surplus with the US this year is expected to top $200 billion.        
	Matters are expected to come to a head in Seoul when a joint US-Korea plan is expected to be broached that will seek to limit trade surpluses and deficits and yoke them to currency values.        
	Last month, G20 finance ministers had agreed to set indicative guidelines to determine what constituted an excess deficit and surplus.        
	At Seoul, Obama is going to push harder for a definitive formula that will seek to limit the size of the surplus to 4 per cent of the gross domestic product. If it tops that level, China will have to raise the value of the yuan to bring it line with the formula.        
	Both Germany and China are vehemently opposed to the formula. The US already has the support of the Koreans.        
	The Indians are decidedly reluctant to take sides on what promises to be a full-scale battle between the two superpowers.        
	Finance ministry officials feel that supporting the US in a row with other G20 leaders  including China, Germany and Brazil  will neither be prudent for its diplomatic relations nor will it make sense to Indias exporter community.        
	The US has to take steps to revive its industry thats natural and we cant really cry about it too loudly. But when those steps start hitting our exporters, we have to plan our own moves, an official said.        
	Till now, the G20 has taken steps more or less in concert mainly because developing nations like India, China and Brazil have co-operated in formulating policies. It may not be wise to go against our natural partners simply because President Obama seeks our support, the official added.        
	The anticipated flood of dollars will drive up the value of the rupee as well. Finance ministry officials admit that the biggest losers could be Indian infotech firms, garment exporters and auto parts factories that sell to the US.        
	There are both positive and negative aspects to this debate, said Ficci secretary general Amit Mitra. If the dollar weakens, our imports will become cheaper, which would mean our economy would benefit from higher efficiencies. On the other hand, our exporters  38 per cent of whom are small and medium enterprises  will face exchange rate problems, especially as they suffer from high capital borrowing costs. The way out is for the government to offer interest subvention to a wider section of exporters.        
	Samiran Chakraborty, regional head of research at Standard Chartered Bank, said India was unlikely to push for any particular agenda at Seoul since its economy was growing at a robust pace, unlike some of the other participants.         
	India has been able to dominate the mindshare of global leaders and it would like this to continue, Chakraborty added.        
	Analysts contend that the US Federal Reserves decision to pump more dollars into its economy will drive down the value of the greenback. As a result, commodity prices - especially oil and metals - will start to rise since they have an inverse relationship with the dollar.        
	Said Saugata Bhattacharya, economist at Axis Bank: The quantitative easing in the US will impact the rupee (which will tend to harden). But the most significant risk we face is the impact that it will have on commodity prices.

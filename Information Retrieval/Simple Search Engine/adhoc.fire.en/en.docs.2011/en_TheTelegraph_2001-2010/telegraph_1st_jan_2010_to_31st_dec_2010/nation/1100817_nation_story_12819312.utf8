The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shoe thrower Valley hero
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shoe thrower Valley hero
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Bandipore, Aug. 16: The missile missed Omar, but Kashmir got its own version of Muntazer al-Zaidi  and a hero to boot.        
	Suspended cop Abdul Ahad Jan, who threw a shoe at chief minister Omar Abdullah at an Independence Day event in Srinagar yesterday, is in line for a bravery medal.        
	We will give him a bravery medal for his gallant act of throwing a shoe at Omar Abdullah, said Aasiya Andrabi, chief of separatist outfit Dukhtaran-e-Milat.        
	In 2008, Iraqi journalist Muntazer had thrown a shoe at George W. Bush. This is a goodbye kiss from the Iraqi people, dog, he had cried before hurling the shoe, which narrowly missed the then US President.         
	A shoe was also flung by a journalist at Union home minister P. Chidambaram during a news conference in April 2009. Earlier this month, Pakistan President Asif Zardari had shoes thrown at him in Britain.        
	Thousands today marched in Kashmir to Jans home before heading towards a local idgah where they offered prayers. When a rumour spread that Jan had died in police custody, it led to an instant uproar, with the crowd deciding to attack government installations. Calls from loudspeakers finally pacified the mob.        
	We thank God that he is alive, said Azad Jan, a relative. For the second consecutive day today, so many people came to our house to felicitate us, said Jans son Mehraj. We feel honoured.        
	Jan, under suspension after his arrest in a criminal case, shouted we want freedom before hurling the shoe.         
	It is better to raise slogans and hurl shoes but avoid stone-pelting, an unruffled Omar said, alluding to the stone-throwing mobs that have paralysed the Valley.        
	Although Jan missed, the security breach left the police red-faced. Sources claimed Jan had been approached by a political leader but refused to say who it was.        
	A police spokesperson said Jan had been arrested in a robbery case in 2008 and had been under continuous psychiatric treatment.

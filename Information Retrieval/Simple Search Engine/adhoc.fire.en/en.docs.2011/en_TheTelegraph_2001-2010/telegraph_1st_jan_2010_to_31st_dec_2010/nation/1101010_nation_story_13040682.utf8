The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cruelty? Not tiff with in-law

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 9: The Supreme Court has held that stray incidents in which a woman insults her in-laws cannot be construed as cruelty and refused to grant divorce to a man on this ground.         
	Making certain statements on the spur of the moment and expressing displeasure about the behaviour of elders may not be characterised as cruelty. Mere trivial irritations, quarrels, normal wear and tear of married life, which happens in day-to-day life in all families, would not be adequate for grant of divorce, a two-judge bench said.         
	The court said sustained unjustifiable and reprehensible conduct affecting the physical and mental health of the other spouse would qualify as mental cruelty, not a few isolated instances over a period of years, and rejected the divorce appeal of Gurbux Singh, the principal of an ITI college at Sirhali, Amritsar.        
	Singh had married Harminder Kaur, a librarian in a government institute in Amritsar on November 23, 1997. He alleged that Kaur disliked his family from the start and treated his parents with cruelty and disrespect. On their first Lohri  a winter festival  after marriage, Kaur abused his mother in filthy language in the presence of relatives. She insisted she could not live with his parents and pressed him to take up a separate place.         
	A son was born to them on May 15, 1999. Five days before the childs third birthday, she left his home without the child and went to live with her parents for good, Singh said.         
	The additional district judge, Amritsar, ruled in 2006 that Singh had failed to substantiate the allegation of cruelty and dismissed his plea. The high court also dismissed his plea in 2007.         
	In the Supreme Court, Kaur denied the allegations. She said Singh had forcibly taken her son away and beat her up when she refused to bring cash from her parents. On February 4, 2000, her parents gave him Rs 50,000 and only then did he let her stay, Kaur said.        
	Rejecting the divorce appeal, the bench said although no uniform standard of mental cruelty could be laid down, some behaviour would qualify, such as acute mental pain, agony and suffering that would make it impossible for the couple to live together.

          ANTARA BOSE                              
	Jamshedpur, March 11: Students of the XLRI School of Business and Human Resources here have mostly ignored foreign companies at their campus placement, opting for only one  Novartis  out of half a dozen.        
	The Swiss pharmaceutical major had offered a package of $110,000 (roughly Rs 50 lakh) a year, the same as last time. The highest domestic package was Rs 26 lakh  against Rs 22 lakh in 2009  offered by a Mumbai-based consultancy.        
	The students were possibly sceptical of the situation overseas and decided that Indian companies were less susceptible to global economic fluctuations, said Rajiv Misra, the head of XLRIs placement committee. We bagged 100 per cent placements in business management (120 students) and personnel management and industrial relations (60 students), Misra said.        
	The B-school saw a hike of Rs 2 lakh in the average package, from Rs 12.12 lakh last year to Rs 14.20 lakh, during the February 9 to 14 placement week. Misra said 75 companies had visited the campus, including Edelweiss, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Hindustan Unilever, Johnson amp; Johnson, ITC and Procter amp; Gamble.        
	About 28 per cent students accepted jobs in the finance sector, 30 per cent in marketing, 25 per cent in consultancy and the remaining 17 per cent in general management.        
	XLRI introduced the concept of deferred placement this year, with business management student Shwetank Jain registering for it. Deferred placement is a process to encourage entrepreneurship. A student signs a two-year contract. If the start-up fails, he or she can return to attend placements for the next two years, said Venkatesh Kominen, placement committee secretary.

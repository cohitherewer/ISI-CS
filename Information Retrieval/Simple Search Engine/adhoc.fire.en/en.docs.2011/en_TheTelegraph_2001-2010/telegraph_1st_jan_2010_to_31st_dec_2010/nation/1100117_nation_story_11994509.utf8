                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi takes disappointment to Prachanda 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                          SM Krishna (left) with Prachanda in Kathmandu on Saturday. (PTI)                                   
	Jan. 16: Foreign minister S.M. Krishna today conveyed to Nepal Maoist chief Prachanda his deep disappointment at the baseless attacks on New Delhi by his party leadership.        
	Former Prime Minister Prachanda later told reporters the interaction had been very good and frank and had opened the doors for talks with India.        
	Prachanda met Krishna, who is on a three-day visit to Nepal, at the Indian ministers hotel in Kathmandu this evening.        
	Krishna told him the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) should honour its commitment to facilitate Nepals transition to a new constitution and multi-party democracy.        
	In New Delhi, the foreign ministry spokesperson said: The external affairs minister conveyed his deep disappointment at the baseless attacks on India by the Maoist leadership which vitiate the age-old and time-tested friendly relations between India and Nepal and the people of the two countries. He emphasised that such baseless propaganda has a negative impact on Indian public opinion.        
	During their meeting, the external affairs minister stressed the importance of rebuilding consensus among political parties in Nepal to conclude the peace process and to draft the new constitution within the stipulated time frame (May 28).        
	The Nepal Maoists had launched an anti-India campaign on the streets of Kathmandu in the last fortnight of December as part of their anti-government protests. Prachanda, who resigned as Prime Minister in May last year after his move to sack the then army chief was thwarted, has been accusing India of interfering in Nepals internal affairs.        
	He today told reporters his expression of concern over various issues was not to disturb relations with India. He said he had been pressing for a revision of the unequal 1950 Indo-Nepal Friendship Treaty so that a more positive, more scientific basis could be created for strengthening bilateral ties.        
	Krishna had yesterday promised a review of the treaty, according to Nepal foreign minister Sujata Koirala.        
	Prachanda told reporters: We want to develop good relations with India, not with old basis but new basis. Without creating the new basis, it is very difficult to strengthen relations with India.        
	He added: We (he and Krishna) had very good interaction. We put our position in very clear and very frank way on all problems of the old treaty and how it is necessary to replace the old treaty with a new one.        
	Prachanda said the people of Nepal wanted a change in the countrys policies. We have to develop a new foreign policy, and particularly our party wants to develop a new basis to have good relations with India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Probe focus on forest strategy

          BIBHUTI BARIK                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 6: In the wake of at least 12 elephant deaths inside Similipal Tiger Reserve, as claimed by wildlife activists, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has asked for an independent assessment by a team of experts.        
	The two-member team would submit its report within two weeks.        
	The team  comprising Wildlife Protection Society of India executive director Belinda Wright and wildlife activist Biswajit Mohanty  will concentrate on two major aspects. First, they will take a look at the enforcement of conservation strategies at ground level and secondly, suggest measures how to improve them after doing a rapid assessment work.        
	Wright told The Telegraph that not only elephants or tigers, the team would look into the conservation aspect of each and every endangered species inside the Similipal forests, as all the animals have their own importance secured in the ecological pyramid.        
	As Orissa is a major habitat of Asiatic elephants in the country, Wright said apart from poaching or ivory trade issues, the team would also look into the conflict issues relating to habitat and anthropogenic pressures. The two-pronged approach of the team will also consider assessment of strategies to ensure absolute protection or conservation approach to have a healthy future of forests and wildlife, she said.        
	On man-animal conflict, she said the tribals should get good opportunities in education, healthcare delivery and deserve a better life.         
	However, on the other hand, better wildlife protection strategies, intelligent management of people and better intelligence sharing among people and forest officials were the needs of the hour, she added. Only designating more reserved territories will not ensure that our animals are better protected, rather the protected areas must ensure that the wild animals and plants are legally protected, she observed.        
	Asked about the effect of industrialisation on wildlife protection, the conservation activist said balanced development should be the objective, as we cannot grow without industrialisation. However, unplanned mining activities without proper conservation strategies were affecting animals and mainly elephants and their corridors, Wright said. She also referred sites like Dhamra port and its impact on the Olive Ridley sea turtles breeding sites.        
	The team, which will enter Similipal today from Baripada end, also includes Mohanty, who said lack of proper intelligence sharing was perhaps the greatest cause in wildlife mismanagement. The state government should also ensure an intelligence mechanism system for the wild animals across Orissa and there must be a designated cell to look into its various aspects, he added.        
	The NTCA-designated team would also study aspects relating to Similipals overall protection, he said.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      IIT retirement age raised to 70 to beat faculty crunch 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: The Indian Institutes of Technology, facing a severe faculty shortage, can now retain any teacher up to five years beyond the retirement age of 65.        
	The Union human resource development ministry said in an order that the board of governors of an IIT can give an extension of three years initially and another two years later to any faculty member.         
	The statutes of the IITs have been amended with the approval of the Visitor, the President, to allow them to retain teachers up to the age of 70. No extension will be allowed beyond 70 years.        
	In 2007, the retirement age for IIT teachers was raised from 60 to 65. Higher education institutions, including the IITs, are facing a severe shortage of faculty.         
	According to government data, there are 4,267 sanctioned teaching positions in the seven older IITs  Kharagpur, Delhi, Madras, Bombay, Kanpur, Roorkee and Guwahati  but only 2,983 faculty members.        
	However, the decision to allow extensions has been criticised by a section of teachers who feel favouritism will come into play. Those faculty members who are not liked by the managements may not get further extension. This will make the faculty susceptible to the pressure of IIT managements, an IIT professor said.        
	The HRD ministry order also said that the retirement age of IIT directors can be raised to 70 years from 65 now. This will help in the re-appointment of certain incumbent directors who are yet to turn 70.

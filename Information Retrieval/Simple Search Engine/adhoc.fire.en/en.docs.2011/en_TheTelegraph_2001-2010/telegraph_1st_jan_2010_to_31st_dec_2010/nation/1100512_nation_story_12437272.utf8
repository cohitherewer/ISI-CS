          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Kailash Nahak at Bhubaneswar station on Tuesday. (Priya Abraham)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 11: All he wanted was recognition, not the cash and jewellery worth Rs 3 lakh that was in a passengers vanity bag, which he could have chosen not to return.        
	Last evening when Kailash Nahak was felicitated for honesty and integrity, he was happy. Not because of the praises and rewards that were showered on him, but because the railways finally promised him a porters licence.         
	I have been struggling for it for long, said the 35-year-old, who has made platform No. 4 of Bhubaneswar railway station his home for the past three years ever since he left his remote village.        
	On many an evening, Kailash has to skip dinner as his earnings arent enough to afford two square meals. On May 6, the homeless man had the opportunity to change his fortune as he found a bag containing diamond and gold jewellery, cash and a cellphone that had been left behind by a woman in hurry to catch a train.        
	Sweta Sinhal had got down from the Puri-Guwahati Express along with two children. The luggage  three suitcases, two travel bags and the vanity bag  was quite heavy and she called out for Kailash. I asked for Rs 50, but she bargained and I settled for Rs 30, he recalled.         
	Soon after Kailash loaded her luggage onto her coach, the Rourkela-bound train started to roll, forcing Sinhal to pay him through the window. As Kailash turned to go, he noticed a blue vanity bag that had been left behind by her on the platform.        
	He picked up the bag and opened it to find cash, ATM cards, a mobile phone and diamond and gold jewellery. Perplexed, he walked with it to a railway constable he knew. I showed him the vanity bag and we went to the GRP inspector-in-charge, he said.        
	There was cash and jewellery amounting to over Rs 3 lakh, said GRP inspector-in-charge Smruti Ranjan Kar, who then used the cellphone to call up her acquaintances.         
	Having realised the blunder, Sinhal got off at Cuttack and rushed back to Bhubaneswar by a taxi. At the station, Kar handed her over her bag. She checked to find that nothing was missing, Kar said.        
	She gifted me Rs 1,000, said Kailash with a smile.         
	Its hard to believe that such people exist in this world, said Uma Charan Sahoo of the East Coast Railway Porters Association, which felicitated Kailash with Rs 500, a certificate and a flower bouquet yesterday.        
	What more does a porter like me need than a little recognition and two square meals a day? What would I have done with that money? said Kailash.

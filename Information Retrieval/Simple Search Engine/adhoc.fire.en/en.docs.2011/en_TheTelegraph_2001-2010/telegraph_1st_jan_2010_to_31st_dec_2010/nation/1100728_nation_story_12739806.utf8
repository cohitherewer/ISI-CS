                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Guess wholl be delighted if Games are rained out
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             (From top) Mani Shankar Aiyar, the former sports minister; the inauguration of the remodelled Jawaharlal Nehru stadium, the showpiece venue for the Commonwealth Games, in New Delhi on Tuesday;   and Suresh Kalmadi,the chairman of the Commonwealth Games organising committee. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, July 27: Rain, incomplete stadiums, dug-up roads  and Mani Shankar Aiyar. The Commonwealth Games has many enemies.        
	The former sports minister, who sees the Games as a wasteful expenditure, today said he was delighted after a heavy downpour hit preparations for the October 3-14 showpiece event.        
	I am delighted in a way because rains are causing difficulties for the Commonwealth Games. Basically, I will be very unhappy if the Games are successful because then they will start bringing the Asian Games, Olympic games and all these.        
	The comments came at a time a gag order is in force in the Congress.        
	If Aiyar rubbed salt into the wounds of the organisers  few would dispute that most of the projects have failed to meet deadlines  the man in charge of the event hit back swiftly.        
	Indian Olympic Association chief Suresh Kalmadi said it was a relief Aiyar was no longer the sports minister.        
	Nobody can spoil the Games. Things are on track, he asserted. If Mr Mani Shankar had continued to be the sports minister, probably we would not have seen these stadiums. I thank (sports minister) M.S. Gill that he took up the incomplete job and created miracles in helping set up world-class stadiums.        
	Gill was appointed sports minister in April 2008 replacing Aiyar, who was shifted to another ministry following his constant criticism of the decision to host the Games. Gill retained the portfolio in UPA II.        
	Aiyars party, the Congress, said: We dont know in what context Mr Aiyar said what but we hope the Games would be a grand success.        
	Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit backed Kalmadi, saying the Games were not threatened. Everything will be ready by September. There are problems during first rains but, as Kalmadi said, it will be the best-ever Commonwealth Games, she said.        
	If that was cutting a brave front, Aiyar injected a play of God-versus-evil into the debate.        
	Those who are patronising the Games can only be evil. They cannot be God, he said.        
	Aiyar, who had earlier asked why the Games was being held in Delhi and not Dantewada, in a dig at the Centres Maoist policy, said that instead of spending Rs 35,000 crore on the event, the money should have been spent on children.         
	Thousands of crores are being spent on circuses like these while the common children are being deprived of basic facilities to play, he said.        
	Aiyar also said all expectations from the Games had been belied.        
	Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari did not want to join the issue with Aiyar but said the Games would make India proud.        
	Time to call for the oracular octopus Paul?

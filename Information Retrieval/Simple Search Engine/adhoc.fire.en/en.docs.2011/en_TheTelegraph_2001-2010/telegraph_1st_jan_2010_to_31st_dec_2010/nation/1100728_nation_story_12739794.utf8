The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihari identity past old equations
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bihari identity past old equations
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR AND NALIN VERMA                           Nitish Kumar                                  
	Patna, July 27: Chief minister Nitish Kumar has flung the gauntlet early in election year, saying his chief rival and overlord of yesteryear Bihar, Lalu Prasad, will be swept aside because his politics and ideas have become outmoded.         
	There has been a paradigm shift in Bihars politics which my opponents are in denial of, Nitish told The Telegraph in an exclusive interview at his 1 Aaney Marg residence.         
	My government has enabled a new Bihari identity to emerge that has moved beyond old caste and social equations. Those who refuse to understand this will face the consequences. The ground has shifted from Lalujis brand of politics, he will be swept away, his calculations have become irrelevant. This election will play havoc with all those who are stuck on the old caste and social matrix, he said.        
	Consistently during the hour-long conversation over tea and biscuits in his back verandah, the chief minister refused to be tied down to any discourse over caste and creed configurations that have so dominated Bihars politics and proclaimed the arrival of a new voter ethic.         
	The old order is breaking down, believe me, he insisted. It is not about this caste or that religion, it is about being Bihari, especially with women and young people. It is nothing you can measure yet on a scale but it has become a palpable feeling. You will see wholesome demolition of old patterns of thinking and voting, people who cant sense it are in for a nasty surprise.        
	The chief minister made even lighter of the Congress, which is haplessly trying to regain long-lost ground in the state. They seem to be in preliminary preparation mode, he said, a touch mockingly. It appears they want to make some sort of beginning.         
	But far more pointed was Nitishs caveat to his own ally, the BJP, with which he has a viable government but often a volatile political relationship. Social peace and cohesion, he emphasised, was the bedrock of his scheme and he wouldnt allow anything or anyone to upset that.         
	We have very painfully built an atmosphere in which no section of society feels threatened or alienated, he said. There can be no compromise on consolidating that composite society.         
	Asked if Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modis presence in Bihar threatened his composite society, Nitish demurred from a direct answer, as if not wanting to re-open battles he has already won.         
	But he indicated sharply that his message to the BJP leadership on Modi had gone home: I think this is a mature alliance and the partners realise fully well that it runs on the basis of not creating any social tensions.         
	Nitish has been blunt to the point of being rude with his ally on the Modi question, withdrawing a dinner invitation to BJPs top league convened in Patna last month, returning a cheque his Gujarat counterpart had written  and publicised  for the Kosi flood relief.         
	Those are rebuffs the BJP has quietly decided to live by, and they now define the lakshman-rekha of this alliance: the support of Bihars minorities is not something he is willing to lose, Modi is an irritant and he is not welcome in Bihar, its nothing Nitish Kumar feels the need to state again and again.        
	On the recent uproar over unaccounted withdrawals from the exchequer and irregularities in flood relief, issues that Lalu Prasad believes he can use to drive Nitish to ground, the chief minister appeared remarkably unperturbed.         
	These are procedural not political issues, he countered, bills have to be presented for money spent and there has been a delay, that will be corrected. But there is no embezzlement, we are already in the process of correction.        
	Sombrely confident that charges of corruption will not stick on him, Nitish said: The real issue is something my adversaries are still running away from. It is the new air of social peace and development that has come over Bihar. It is both a physical and a psychological sense and the elections will demonstrate that people do not lose that sense. Ek naya ehsaas hai logon mein, aur log usse khona nahin chahte. (The coming election will see a vote across old caste and social barriers, it will be a vote for preserving what the people think they have got in the last five years).        
	He was equally dismissive of suggestions that as elections approach, he is moving to strike deals with criminal and indicted elements in politics to shore up his prospects.         
	Asked about a recent visit to the home of convicted former MLA Anand Mohan Singh, the chief minister said, Please do not attach any political meaning to this; there was a social event in the family and I was invited, some social obligations need to be fulfilled. We have worked very hard to free Bihar of crime and criminals, we have not achieved one hundred percent perhaps, but people feel more secure, why would I do anything to shake that sense among the people?        
	Nitish recalled, in this context, his victorious campaign of 2005 and said: I had announced then that I will work for four and a half years and return to politics only in the last six months of my term, I have worked an extra two months and now the politics begins. I had told the people I will not return to seek votes if I think I havent worked to my promises.        
	Has he then? You will have to ask the people, he said, a secure smile widening on his face, or just wait for the elections.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: The fraction of Scheduled Caste children enrolled in schools is dropping even though Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes are improving their presence in admission rosters, the governments latest statistics show.        
	The number of enrolled Scheduled Caste children for every hundred students has dropped for a second consecutive year, the statistics released today by the National University for Educational Planning and Administration revealed.        
	The statistics were collected by the district information system for education that the Centre uses to monitor every school offering education from Classes I- VIII.        
	In 2006-07, Scheduled Caste students formed 19.87 per cent of the children enrolled in primary (Classes I to V) and upper primary (Classes VI to VIII) schools. It dropped to 19.83 per cent in 2007-08 and further dipped to 19.72 in 2008-09, the statistics read.        
	Even Uttar Pradesh under Mayavati has seen a decline in the fraction of Scheduled Caste students, from 27.10 per cent in 2006-07 to 26.95 per cent in 2008-09.        
	In the corresponding period, the fraction of Scheduled Tribe students rose from 10.69 per cent in 2006-07 (for Classes I-VIII) to 10.95 per cent in 2007-08 and then to 11.04 per cent in 2008-09.        
	The OBC enrolment fraction rose from 42.18 per cent in 2006-07 to 42.35 per cent in 2007-08 and 42.39 per cent in 2008-09.        
	The report merely gives statistics but does not explain the trends.        
	But education officials said the dip in fraction of Scheduled Caste students might be an unforseen consequence of an extensive focus on OBC and Scheduled Tribe students.        
	The dip is certainly worrying and we will need to examine it in greater depth. But it is possible that this is a consequence of inadvertent laxity by state governments in their focus on Scheduled Caste children vis-a-vis Scheduled Tribe and OBC children, an official said.

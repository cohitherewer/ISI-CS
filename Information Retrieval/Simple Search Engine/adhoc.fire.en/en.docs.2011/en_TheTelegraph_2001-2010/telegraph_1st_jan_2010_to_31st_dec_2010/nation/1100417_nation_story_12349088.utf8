The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Muck flies, political cracks deepen
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Muck flies, political cracks deepen
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sharad Pawar                                  
	New Delhi, April 16: The IPL twister has deepened the Congress-NCP fissures and exacerbated relations between the Congress and the BJP after their fleeting bonhomie over the womens reservation bill and anti-Naxalite operations.        
	It is understood that Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is not amused by the income tax raids on IPL chief Lalit Modi, while the BJP has sniffed vendetta in the attempts to drag Narendra Modi into the mess.         
	The NCP is yet to firm up a counter-strategy against the Congress. But the BJP plans to use whatever opportunity it has in the ongoing budget session to get back at the government. If Shashi Tharoor is the apple of the Congresss eye, Modi is the jewel in our crown. The Congress cannot tolerate the slurs Tharoor has been been subjected to, we will not brook attempts to defame our (Gujarat) chief minister, a BJP leader said.        
	NCP boss and agriculture minister Pawar is said to have gently reminded his friends in the Congress that while the swoops had been received in the intended spirit, the principles of coalition politics ought to be respected and followed.         
	The message, it seems, has sunk in. A Congress central minister said: We had to do a balancing act and appear to be fair. Hence, Kochi Rendezvous promoters were also searched as were those of the other teams.        
	The Congress-NCP relations, shaky at the best of times, plummeted recently when their workers clashed over alleged fake voting in Navi Mumbais civic elections, where the NCP trumped the Congress and swept the polls.        
	Another ally ache seemed to have started for the Congress this evening with National Conference leader and Union minister Farooq Abdullah suggesting Tharoor should quit to protect the honour of the government.        
	Well, then my decision would be to (step aside). I would go... not only for honour of mine but for that of the country and the government, Abdullah told CNN-IBN when asked if he would have stepped down if he were in Tharoors place.        
	Another Congress leader suggested that the IPL row had blurred political lines. The (Lalit) Modi-Tharoor feud cannot be called a proxy Congress-NCP war. There are people in our party who support Modi as staunchly as Pawar. Although hes supposedly linked to the BJP, there are BJP leaders who hate him. So if Modi is hit beyond a point, there may be protests from our ranks, he said.        
	A Gujarat business conglomerate that was keen to relocate Rendezvous from Kochi to Ahmedabad, allegedly at Narendra Modis behest, is said to be the main beneficiary of a liberal food import-export policy of Maharashtras Congress-NCP government. It will be dishonest to just pick on (Narendra) Modi as the main instigator of the anti-Kochi campaign. Other party leaders are equally interested, a source said.        
	There is another reason why the Congresss campaign against Lalit, starting with last nights swoops, may flounder. Nobody from the Congress could tell for sure if their own ministers, MPs and MLAs and their associates were not linked to the IPL teams covertly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bargain begins on hung civic bodies
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bargain begins on hung civic bodies
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      A day after victory, the many moods of Mamata Banerjee at a news conference in her Calcutta residence on Thursday. Pictures by Amit Datta                           
	Calcutta, June 3: Trinamul Congress and the Congress began rebuilding their fractured Bengal alliance to form civic boards jointly in hung municipalities, but the bites given by Mamata Banerjee indicate the Congress may have to bargain hard.         
	Yesterdays results have delivered a hung verdict in 29 municipalities in the districts. The Trinamul hinted today that it might insist on the chairmanship of some of the nine municipalities where the Congress has fared better.        
	This was evident in Maldas Englishbazar municipality where Trinamul leaders said they would support the Congress, which has more seats, in board formation only if their party was offered the chairpersons post.        
	The mood in the Trinamul camp was evident from what Mamata told a news conference in Calcutta today. We must remember that in this election, it is Trinamul that has emerged victorious across Bengal, Mamata said. We were not in alliance with any party and now we will form the board in at least 50 municipalities. The figure could rise to 55, she added.        
	Among the 29 hung municipalities, Trinamul is ahead of the Congress in 20. So even after an alliance is worked out, and assuming that the party which has the highest number of wards gets to have its own chairperson, Trinamul will still be eight short of the 55-mark as it has a clear majority in only 27 municipalities.        
	But Mamata also added, rather quizzically, that there was no fractured mandate in these civic boards as reported in some of the newspapers.         
	These reports are misleading. In fact, we backed some Independents in those boards following local-level pre-poll understanding and we shall form the boards there with their support.         
	However, in none of the municipalities that saw a close Congress-Trinamul fight can Mamata form the boards with the support of Independents as there is only one to fall back on in one municipality, in Burdwans Dainhat (see chart).        
	Asked about the post-poll alliance, K. Keshava Rao, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, said today that his party would collaborate with Mamata to form civic boards in such municipalities.                    
	We fought the civic elections in Bengal independently because of the collapse of the (pre-poll) alliance. But we are always with Mamataji and will tie up with her for the Assembly polls in 2011. The simple reason for this is our common goal, which is to put an end to the CPMs misrule, he said.        
	Rao denied suggestions that the Trinamul chiefs relations with some state Congress leaders had become strained.         
	Mamataji respects every leader in Bengal. But newspapers try to create an impression that we are at loggerheads, he said.        
	The Congress said it was willing to follow the norm of letting the partner with the higher number of wards get the chairmans post.        
	State party working president Pradip Bhattacharya said: It is an established norm that the party with more seats gets the chairmans post. So, this should be followed by our partner as well. At least that is our hope.

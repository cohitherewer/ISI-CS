          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 9: Alleging that both the state government and the railways were involved in the multi-crore mining scam, the Opposition today pressed for a CBI inquiry.         
	Describing the mining scam as one of the biggest scams of the century, Opposition chief whip Prasad Harichandan alleged that the state government had ordered a vigilance probe to cover up its involvement.        
	Harichandan said the Assemblys public accounts committee had found during its visit to mineral-rich Keonjhar district on January 21 that about 15,000 tonnes of manganese ore were stacked in the Banspani railway siding. But nobody could tell who had stacked these minerals. The committee also found from the railway records that 62 and 63 rakeloads of illegally procured ores were despatched to various parts of the country from Banspani and Jurudi railway sidings, respectively, during January.         
	But its a mystery that the consignee and consignor could not be located, he said.        
	The state government claims that the deputy director of mines based at Joda had suspended 103 storing, dumping and loading licences in Jurudi and Banspani railway sidings in the first half of January and all loading, unloading and other activities had been suspended at the two locations.        
	At the same time, the state steel and mines minister said 67,811 tonnes of iron and manganese ore and 30,080 tonnes of manganese and iron ore had been seized from Jurudi and Banspani railway sidings by March 8. Quoting railway staff posted at Banspani railway siding, Harichandan said rail rakes had been allotted on the instruction of senior officials of Chakradharpur division.        
	Since the railway officials were involved in transport of illegally procured minerals, only CBI was competent to investigate, argued the Opposition pressing for a probe by the central agency.                                
	Alleging that the Naveen Patnaik government was not sincere to crack the mines mafia and illegal mines operators, BJP legislature party leader and former minister K.V. Singhdeo rued that the government had not taken action against companies like Ram Bahadur Thakur Limited, Arjun Ladha amp; Co and BC Deb, against whom the Opposition had furnished prima facie evidence.        
	Rejecting the Opposition demand for CBI probe as unjustified and politically motivated, steel and mines minister Raghunath Mohanty said the vigilance inquiry was going on satisfactorily which led to registration of nine criminal cases and arrest of seven government officials and two private individuals.        
	A high-level committee has been constituted, headed by chief secretary, to study the system of transportation of minerals by railways. Besides, enforcement squads have been set up to check illegal mining activities, he said.

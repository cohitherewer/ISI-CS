          ANANYA SENGUPTA                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: Two umbrella bodies of authors and publishers have taken Google to court for copyright violation and demanded that the digital database service of the Internet search giant delete all works of Indians.        
	The Indian Reprographic Rights Organisation (IRRO) and the Federation of Indian Publishers (FIP) today told a US court that Google Books had been scanning works free of charge and reaping revenues from advertisements but not compensating the creators and original publishers.        
	In our objections, we have stated that Google should immediately delete all material they have of Indian authors from their database in Google Books which have been acquired without permission. There might be millions of authors all over the country who might not even know their rights are being violated, said Siddharth Arya, counsel for the IRRO, which represents many authors and publishers in the country.        
	The IRRO and the FIP together represent around 500 Indian publishing houses with 16,000 authors.         
	Indian publishing houses, however, seemed to have woken up late as today was the last date for filing objections to a settlement proposed by Google after allegations of copyright infringement.        
	The search giant, which has since 2004 scanned and uploaded as many as 10 million volumes in 100 languages and been involved in lawsuits with the US Authors Guild and The Association of American Publishers, had earlier reached an out-of-court settlement.        
	The settlement was, however, widely criticised and Google was asked to file a fresh one. The court, which received the new settlement called GBS2.0 in November last year, gave three months to all interested parties to file objections.        
	Among the others who have recorded objections are the American Society of Journalists and Authors and new-age giants like Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo. British authors J.K. Rowling and Philip Pullman today threatened to boycott Googles new digital library over copyright issues.        
	The current scope of GBS2.0 covers books that are either registered with the United States Copyright Office or are published in the UK, Canada and Australia. Many of the approximately 5 lakh books Indian authors produce every year are published in these countries.        
	The settlement also has an opt-out structure which, in effect, allows Google to use works without authorisation of the copyright holder, Arya said. This means if a copyright holder remains silent or does nothing, he becomes bound by the terms of the settlement agreement.        
	Arya said it would place an undue burden on copyright holders if they had to maintain Googles lists and file claims to receive any benefit under the settlement. In India, how many authors can actually keep track of this?        
	What has also sent alarm bells ringing in India, says Arya, is that Google continues to have access to works whose copyright holders cannot be located. Publishers say that in a vast country like India with an active vernacular press, this kind of infringement is difficult, if not impossible, to trace.        
	In the name of innovation, Google wilfully chose to bypass all international and national laws. In India, copyright laws are so stringent that violators can go to jail, Arya said.        
	Copyright experts agreed. Works cannot be reproduced under any circumstances without the permission or prior knowledge of the owner. What Google is doing is denying the author or publisher the power to bargain for his work, said copyright expert Ranjan Negi.        
	The case will come up for hearing on February 18.

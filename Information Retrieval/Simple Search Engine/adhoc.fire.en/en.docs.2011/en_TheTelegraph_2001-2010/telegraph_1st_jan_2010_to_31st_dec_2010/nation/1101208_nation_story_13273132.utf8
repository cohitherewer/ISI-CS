The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Honeymoon murder finger at husband
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Honeymoon murder finger at husband
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Dec. 7: An Indian husband whose bride was shot dead in South Africa last month while the couple were on honeymoon was today accused of plotting her murder.        
	But a spokesperson for the husband, Shrien Dewani, ridiculed the allegation that he had connived with a local taxi driver to get rid of his wife, Anni.        
	 British papers have been full of the murder of Anni, a 28-year-old from Sweden who had married Shrien, 30, a UK resident, at a lavish ceremony in Mumbai.        
	The couple were on holiday in Cape Town when their taxi was hijacked in the township of Gugulethu by two men, who threw out Shrien and drove away with Anni. A few hours later she was found shot.        
	The taxi driver, Zola Tongo, 31, was quickly arrested after the killing. Now, after more than two weeks in police custody, he has confessed to his own involvement, entered a plea bargain with the South African police and claimed Shrien had offered him 15,000 rand (about 1,300) to have his wife killed.        
	In an open and shut case, without his account being tested, Tongo has been given 18 years.        
	The police have arrested the two men allegedly hired by Tongo  Xolile Mnguni, 23, and Mziwamadoda Qwabe, 25  and charged them with murder.         
	 Western Cape director of public prosecutions Rodney de Kock told judge president John Hlophe: The alleged hijacking was in fact not a hijacking but part of a plan of subterfuge which Shrien Dewani, the husband of the deceased, and the accused had designed to conceal the true facts, to wit that the deceased was murdered at the instance of her husband.        
	Not everyone is convinced by the South African police version of events. One view is that since the countrys tourism industry has been badly damaged by the murder shifting the blame to the husband would enable the authorities to claim this was an exceptional crime  and that South Africa is safe for tourism and investment.        
	Annis father, Vinod Hindocha, was present in court today and left with tears in his eyes.        
	In London, publicist Max Clifford, who has been acting on Shriens behalf, described Tongos accusations as the latest in a string of false allegations against his client.        
	Clifford pointed out that Tongo had been in police custody for two weeks: What do you expect? The confession must be seen in that context.        
	South African police have not suggested why Shrien would have wanted his wife dead since there is no insurance money involved. When Annis father spoke to his daughter shortly before the hijacking, she said she and her husband were enjoying their trip.        
	Shriens family issued a statement: He is totally innocent of any involvement in this heinous crime. These allegations are totally ludicrous and very hurtful to a young man who is grieving the loss of the woman he loved, his chosen life partner. South African police have never sought to speak to Shrien regarding the allegations. Instead two weeks have been spent negotiating this confession from the taxi driver while the two others accused have complained of torture and false confessions. Shrien remains in the UK where he has been receiving medical treatment as well as trauma and bereavement counselling.

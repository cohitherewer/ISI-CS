	Srinagar, Feb. 5: A Srinagar teenager died after allegedly being fired at by security forces today, the death coming in the middle of a backlash over the death of a 13-year- old in tear-gas shelling days back.        
	Residents said Zahid Farooq Shah, 16, was playing cricket with his friends on a ground near a CRPF camp at Nishat, on the citys outskirts, when he was shot at.        
	Two security vehicles halted near the ground. The personnel asked the boys to leave, but they refused. The troopers then opened fire, hitting Zahid in the chest, a resident said.        
	Zahid died in hospital. He was the only son of his parents and had passed his Class X exams last month, he added.        
	Police called the case a mysterious death, but said a probe was on. The allegation that some passing vehicle (belonging to the security forces) had opened fire is also being looked into, an officer added.        
	Zahids death  the third of a Srinagar teenager in the past month  came amid protests against the death of Wamiq Farooq, who died after a tear-gas shell fired by the police hit him on Sunday.        
	In another incident, militants opened fire on the police after Friday prayers in Sopore, killing a cop and a civilian.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Science step in South Pole 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Science step in South Pole 
          G.S. MUDUR                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 29: Indias first science expedition has reached the South Pole, with five scientists, two vehicle mechanics, and a doctor driving 10 days across 2,350km of icy and crevassed terrain where temperatures at one point dropped to minus 64C.         
	It feels really great. Were on top of the world even at the bottom of the world, said Rasik Ravindra, a 62-year-old glaciologist and the leader of the team, who spoke via satellite phone to Shailesh Nayak, Indias earth sciences secretary in Delhi.         
	The team had set out on November 13 from Maitri, Indias scientific outpost in Antarctica, riding on Arctic trucks that have specialised spiked tyres and high clearance to negotiate the rugged and crevasse-infested terrain.         
	Along the way, the scientists used ground-penetrating radar to study the bedrock hidden beneath the ice, collected ice cores to study snow physics and chemistry, and studied the glacial landscapes.         
	Its bright and sunny  and there is snow and snow all around us, Ravindra said.         
	In the southern hemispheres Antarctic summer, the sun shines nearly 24 hours a day but the temperature on the South Pole during the teams visit was nearly minus 40C.         
	The scientists planted an Indian flag, collected data for some more of ice chemistry and physics, and were preparing to make a courtesy call at an American South Pole station close by.         
	The journey was delayed by a few hours when the axle of one of the vehicles broke. This was corrected and the team moved on. We have vehicle engineers who are experienced in working in sub-zero temperatures, Nayak said.         
	This expedition is part of our efforts to expand Indias activities in Antarctica, added Nayak.         
	We have a station (Maitri) on eastern Antarctica and our second station will be up on the western side next year, he added.         
	Nayak said there are no immediate plans for a second South Pole expedition. But if we feel that there is a need to repeat scientific observations anywhere along the route, well certainly do that in future missions, he added.         
	But Ravindra and his team arent the first Indians to reach the South Pole. In the 1970s, Paramjit Singh Sehra was the first there as part of a Soviet expedition. In 1989, Col. J.K. Bajaj had joined an international expedition to visit the South Pole.

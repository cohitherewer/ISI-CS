          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 16: A newly formed association of universities has criticised several proposed laws to reform higher education, saying they would over-regulate the sector and undermine the autonomy of institutes.        
	Among the bills the Indian Council of Universities (ICU) has opposed is the educational tribunals bill, which seeks to set up specialised tribunals to adjudicate disputes in higher educational institutions.        
	The ICU, which has some 50 institutions as members, most of them private universities, has also opposed two other bills tabled by the human resource development (HRD) ministry. They are the prohibition of unfair practices in technical educational institutions, medical educational institutions and universities bill; and the national accreditation regulatory authority for higher educational institutions bill.        
	These bills seek to over-regulate the higher education system with a heavy penalty structure, including imprisonment for the administrators for any small violation of the norms prescribed on faculty position and infrastructure, etc. The autonomy of the universities will be scuttled by these laws, said ICU secretary-general D.S. Chauhan.         
	The bill on prohibition of unfair practices lays down punishment structures, including imprisonment and fine, for malpractice.        
	 The accreditation bill prescribes minimum standards for establishing and functioning of institutions.         
	The ICU held a meeting here today and discussed in detail the provisions of all the three bills, which have been introduced in Parliament.        
	The association also criticised the higher education and research bill, which is yet to be introduced in Parliament. This bill seeks to set up a national commission for higher education and research as an overarching body to regulate higher education.         
	The meeting was attended by Congress leader Oscar Fernandes, the chairperson of the parliamentary standing committee on human resource development. The parliamentary panel had recently suggested a number of modifications to the educational tribunals bill. The bill, passed by the Lok Sabha, has been deferred by the Rajya Sabha after leaders from across the political divide opposed it.         
	ICU president Surjit Singh Pabla, who is also the vice-chancellor of Sikkim Manipal University, said Fernandes asked the ICU members to put their views on the reforms bills before the parliamentary panel.         
	He said the ICU had been formed a few months ago to work for autonomy of universities and to facilitate involvement of chancellors and VCs in education reforms.        
	The ICU is seen as a rival to the Association of Indian Universities, which counts over 250 varsities as members but hardly any private university.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: The Centre today told the Supreme Court it would give a fair hearing to all deemed varsities found wanting on several counts by a review panel before deciding to strip them of the status.        
	  Institutions deemed to be universities which prima facie do not deserve to retain their status, as recommended by the review committee, will each be communicated the shortcomings found against them and will be afforded an opportunity to show why their declaration as institutions deemed to be universities should not be revoked by the government, an affidavit filed by the human resource development ministry said.        
	Action will be taken against the institutions, found by the high-level review committee to have poor management, educational and research standards, after hearing them within a reasonable time frame, the affidavit said.         
	Several of the deemed universities under the scanner had objected to the governments move at the last hearing, saying they had not been given an opportunity to defend themselves or rectify their shortcomings.        
	The panel had recommended that 44 such institutions could be given an opportunity to rectify the problems within three years. Forty-four others, it said, do not have the attributes to retain their status as they neither had a past nor a future. It said only 38 institutions could be allowed to continue as deemed varsities.                    
	The review was based on interactions with institutions and their answers to questionnaires. The committee had invited all 130 deemed varsities in the country to the assessment sessions but only 126 turned up.         
	Acting on the committees report, the government had said at the last hearing that it would take action against the laggard institutions, which meant they would have to revert to their earlier status as colleges affiliated to a state university. But the government had promised to take care of the interests of the affected students. The response came on a court notice on a PIL filed by a consumer activist, Viplav Sharma, who sought judicial intervention to control the mushrooming of such varsities and arrest the falling education standards in the country.

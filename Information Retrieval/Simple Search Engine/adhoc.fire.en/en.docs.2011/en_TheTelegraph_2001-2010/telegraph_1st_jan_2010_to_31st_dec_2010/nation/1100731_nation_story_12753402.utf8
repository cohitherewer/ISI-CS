The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shah case net to widen, says CBI
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Shah case net to widen, says CBI
          OUR BUREAU                              
	July 30: The CBI today told the Supreme Court the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter probe may go beyond former Gujarat minister Amit Shah, sources close to the agency said in a fresh indication of trouble for Narendra Modi.        
	The sources said the Gujarat chief minister could be the next to be questioned in the case that has landed Shah, his former minister of state for home, in jail custody along with 14 policemen.        
	The CBI statement apparently came in a sealed status report it submitted to the apex court, which had handed the case over to the agency in January this year.        
	There has been a buzz about the noose tightening around Modi ever since the CBI charged Shah last week with ordering Sohrabuddins murder. The chief minister held the home portfolio and Shah, his junior, would not be expected to take major decisions unilaterally.        
	Modi, sensing trouble, has stepped up his rhetoric with an eye on the October-November civic polls. Dont try to frighten Modi. Modi will not be intimidated, he said today.        
	Last evening, virtually launching the BJP campaign for the civic polls, he had said: No political game using the CBI will bring success in Gujarat. The Congress has already conceded defeat in the forthcoming civic polls.        
	The sources said the CBI might now ask the Supreme Court to transfer the case outside Gujarat, and to shift the accused to a Mumbai jail.         
	The CBI, which was to complete the probe this month, is likely to seek at least three more months, the sources said. The investigation may spill over to Rajasthan, with the agency drawing the courts attention to the involvement of top Rajasthan police officers, the sources added.        
	Officials in Gandhinagar said the CBI might ask the court to hand over the Tulsi Prajapati case to it too. The agency says Prajapati was killed by Gujarat police because he was the sole witness to the cops abduction of Sohrabuddin and his wife Kauser Bi prior to their murder in November 2005.        
	The Gujarat CID today filed a 1,000-page chargesheet in the Prajapati case in Danta court of Banaskantha district, accusing seven policemen. They include then state anti-terrorism squad chief D.G. Vanzara, then Banaskantha district police chief Vipul Agrawal, and a Rajasthan officer, Dinesh M.N.        
	Vanzara and Dinesh are accused in the Sohrabuddin case too and have been in police custody for over three years.

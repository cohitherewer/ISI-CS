          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: Gung-ho over the promise of US support to get to the high table since Barack Obamas visit, the Centre is set to introduce a major reform of the defence industrial sector in January that will force defence public sector units to compete for orders with the private sector.         
	Defence industry reform has been tardy not only because trade unions have viewed it with suspicion, but also because players within the security establishment have been selective of foreign collaborations. But that is now set to change.        
	The first defence production policy will be announced soon, defence minister A.K. Antony said here today.        
	A growing nation like India, a nation aspiring for the membership of the UN Security Council, a place on the high table of the nations still depending heavily on foreign countries for supply of defence equipment is not good for us, Antony told an audience comprising Ordnance Factory, defence public sector and Defence Research and Development Organisation chiefs and executives.        
	The announcement that there will be a new defence production policy comes as US firms increasingly compete for billions of dollars worth orders from the Indian armed forces. During Obamas visit, the air forces order for 10 Boeing-made C-17 Globemaster III aircraft was formally announced.        
	Indias military industrial complex is inadequate to meet the demands of the armed forces. Even then, there are nine big PSUs, including Hindustan Aeronautics, and 40 Ordnance Factories that manufacture and supply military products to the armed forces and police.        
	In 2009-2010, the 40 Ordnance Factories produced weapons and hardware worth Rs 8,751 crore while the total value of production by the nine defence PSUs was Rs 28,703 crore.        
	From January 2011 onwards we hope to introduce the new defence production policy as well as the (updated) defence procurement policy. So now we are going to take some more drastic steps to achieve our goal of speedy indigenisation, the defence minister said.        
	Our aim is to have a strong defence industrial base in India, because a country like India cannot indefinitely depend on foreign suppliers for majority of our equipment. At the moment, 65-70 per cent of the equipment is imported. We have to reverse this trend, he said.        
	The PSUs produce hardware largely under transfer of technology and licence agreements from foreign suppliers. With an offset clause in most defence procurements requiring the foreign vendors to re-invest at least 30 per cent of the value of an order into the country, both defence PSUs and private defence players such as the Tatas, Mahindras and Larsen amp; Toubro will be seeking to tie up with global majors.        
	So far, Indian defence PSUs have collaborated largely with Russian and to a limited extent with British, French and Israeli firms. Antony said that already public sector shipyards like Garden Reach Shipbuilders have been asked to complete with private shipyards for naval and Coast Guard orders.        
	We will continue to support the PSUs, but at the same time PSUs alone will not be able to meet the requirements of the Armed Forces. That will help us to have a strong defence industrial base in India, he said.        
	Antony assessed that there was enough space and opportunity for the public and private sector companies to co-exist. There is no option, but to remain globally competitive and efficient and not rest on past laurels, or achievements, he said.

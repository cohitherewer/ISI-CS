	New Delhi, Dec. 19: The Congress has begun to showcase Rahul Gandhi as its future leader.        
	Rahul today publicly requested Congress chief ministers and ministers to spare time for party workers, breaking a self-imposed regimen of not advising seniors.        
	Since September 2007 when Rahul took over as party general secretary, he had consciously avoided acting as part of the high command or issuing any guideline to his senior colleagues.        
	But today, echoing Sonia, Rahul told the Burari plenary: There are ministers sitting here and also chief ministers here. I want to request them that they should give some time to party workers.        
	Wherever I travel, there is always a complaint among party workers... ministers need time to devote to their official work, but they should also give some time to party workers.        
	Many union ministers facing Rahul shuffled uneasily while chief ministers of the party ruled-states, sitting on the dais, craned their necks to read the young politicians face.        
	This afternoon, when Rahul rose for a brief intervention, the delegates were expecting him to hit out at the RSS-BJP on homegrown terror and comment on the political situation in Jammu and Kashmir. But Rahul did not address these issues.         
	Instead, Rahul showed shades of a younger Rajiv. As if addressing a US-model party primary, Rahul sold many dreams to the party rank and file. Each of his remark, crafted in the mould of Obama-speak, was lustily cheered.        
	For those familiar with the inner dynamics of the Congress, it was a signal that both the leadership and the delegates were actively thinking in terms of greater role for Rahul in both the organisation and possibly the government.        
	There is no sign of a timetable yet but at least three senior Union ministers, Ambika Soni, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Kamal Nath, are said to have envisaged interest in working for the party in exchange of their ministerial berths.        
	These politicians who cut their teeth during the Sanjay era are known to be astute weather cocks. Their interest in organisational work indicates that given a chance, they would love to be part of Team Rahul.        
	Asserting that the UPA government had established a relationship between growth and distribution of opportunity, Rahul said it was important to build a system in which a common man progressed not on who he knows but on what he knows.        
	Rahul said the true strength of the country lay in unlocking the potential of each individual. I am a young politician and I have a lot to learn. But there is one thing I am certain of. We will never build a nation until we start recognising and respecting the common man. We will never build a nation until we build a system in which this mans progress is based not on who he knows but on what he knows. This is the challenge of our generation, he said.        
	Without referring to any of the scandals, Rahul said: We require accountability... severe punishment should be given to the corrupt. Corruption snatches away the common mans opportunity to progress.        
	Footnote: Congress delegates did not miss the chance to point out that Rahul had spoken out on a day Sachin Tendulkar completed his 50th Test century. On September 24, 2007, the day Rahul took over as AICC general secretary, the Indian cricket team lifted the Twenty20 World Cup under M.S. Dhonis leadership.        
	The next day, Congress circles, which have a way in spotting such factors, had then dubbed the coincidence a great omen for the scion.        
	Today, no such interpretation was heard. Perhaps, the Congress is waiting to see what will happen in Centurion tomorrow.

	New Delhi, Sept. 24: The culture ministry today unveiled the Tagore Commemoration Grants Scheme to provide up to Rs 5 lakh in assistance to non-profits involved with the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Rabindranath Tagore.        
	The launch came nearly four months after a national committee on the celebrations, headed by the Prime Minister, asked the ministry to fund organisations or universities with at least three years standing and having professional expertise on Tagore and his works.        
	This scheme is a follow-up to the decision taken by the national committee on celebrations on Tagore, Jawhar Sircar, secretary, ministry of culture, said.        
	The scheme will help non-profits conduct lectures, seminars, workshops and cultural shows as well as hold literary festivals that could include documentary films and audio-video presentations on the poets life and literary works.        
	We are encouraging the expression of Tagore in different languages, Sircar said.        
	The scheme will remain in operation till May 2012. The government will provide assistance of up to 75 per cent of the project cost subject to a maximum of Rs 5 lakh. Details are available at www.indiaculture.nic.in.        
	The culture ministry has set up zonal Tagore commemoration committees at Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Chandigarh, Udaipur, Guwahati and Allahabad. Organisations can apply to these centres to participate in the scheme.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Asim taxes luxury goods, targets minister menus
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Asim taxes luxury goods, targets minister menus
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 12: You will be shelling out more for a new car or microwave oven and ministers will be sacrificing sumptuous meals at their meetings so that Bengal can weather its financial troubles.        
	Asim Dasgupta today announced a one per cent hike in value-added tax (VAT) on luxury goods and pledged to reduce avoidable non-plan expenditure to generate extra revenue and tackle a financial problem that he largely blamed on Delhi.        
	We are yet to receive more than Rs 7,000 crore (in dues) from the Centre. The situation is of great concern in the context of the drought that hit 11 districts. So, we have decided to hike VAT on luxury and other items to 13.5 per cent from the existing 12.5 per cent from November 15. Similarly, we will cut down on non-essential non-plan expenditure by 10 per cent, the state finance minister said.        
	The government has decided to keep all food items free of tax and not increase the existing VAT (four per cent) on essential items and inputs for agriculture and industry, he added.        
	The VAT hike is expected to generate an additional Rs 2,400 crore a year while raising the prices of, among other things, air-conditioners, cooking ranges, cosmetics, dishwashers, electronic music systems, gas ovens, microwave ovens, TV sets and cars.        
	It has also been decided that the government will cut down on expenses such as luxurious dcor in offices, unnecessary travel, lavish eating arrangements during meetings and other government programmes and needless use of government vehicles, Dasgupta said.        
	He said these cuts on non-plan expenditure had been decided after consulting chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and would save around Rs 1,200 crore a year.        
	Dasgupta said the VAT hike was consistent with the discussions by the empowered committee of state finance ministers.        
	A similar decision has already been taken by a majority of the states (17 of them) and many more are expected to introduce it soon. We could not have done this when inflation was high; nows the right time.        
	Governor M.K. Narayanan has signed the ordinance imposing the hike. We could not have waited till the next Assembly session to introduce a bill and enact this provision, the finance minister said.        
	He refused to acknowledge that the government faced a financial crisis and described it as a financial problem. The problem (has arisen) primarily because of non-receipt of central funds, and has been aggravated by the drought and the impact of the implementation of the last pay commissions recommendations, he claimed.        
	According to the state government, the Centre owes Bengal Rs 4,833 crore in coal royalty, Rs 700 crore (a part of the Rs 1,450 crore earmarked for Bengal) under the 13th Finance Commission recommendations, Rs 736 crore as drought relief, Rs 900 crore as the Centres share in the two per cent relief offered in goods and services tax in inter-state trade, and Rs 676 crore (this years installment out of Rs 5,032 crore) as Aila relief.        
	It adds up to well beyond Rs 7,000 crore (Rs 7,845 crore). But the state needs Rs 7,000 crore as soon as possible from the Centre, Dasgupta said.

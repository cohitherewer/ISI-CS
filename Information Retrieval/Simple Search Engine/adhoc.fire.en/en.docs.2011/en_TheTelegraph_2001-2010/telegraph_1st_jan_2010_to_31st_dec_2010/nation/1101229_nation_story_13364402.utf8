The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hindu terrorist mystery deepens
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hindu terrorist mystery deepens
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Dec. 28: The mystery of Gurukanth Desai, one of nine men accused of plotting Mumbai-style massacres across several British cities, including London, deepened yesterday.        
	Among the nine men who appeared yesterday at Westminster Magistrates Court were three from Cardiff  Gurukanth Desai, 28, of Albert Street; Omar Sharif Latif, 26, of Neville Street; and Abdul Malik Miah, 24, of Ninian Park Road.         
	Observers were puzzled initially at the inclusion of Desai in the group, whose other members are Muslims.        
	But the court was yesterday also told that bearded Miah and clean-shaven Desai are brothers. Further, Miahs wife is five months pregnant and Desai is a father of three young children.        
	A police source contacted by The Telegraph could provide no explanation as to how Desai, obviously a Hindu, and Miah, obviously a Muslim, could be brothers.        
	Without knowing the answer, he wondered if one had converted to Islam but had forgotten to change his name legally.         
	A local newspaper, the South Wales Echo, doorstepped the addresses of the three men.        
	It said neighbours of the charged trio spoke of their shock. The accused were described by residents in Riverside as Muslim family men who generally kept to themselves. Gurukanth Desai, Omar Sharif Latif and Abdul Malik Miah all lived within a few minutes walk of each other in the city suburb.        
	The paper said police returned to the mens homes on Boxing Day (December 26) but it was understood that the properties had been empty since the arrests on December 20.        
	Neighbours of Desai, who lived at Albert Street, said he had moved into the terrace house five months ago with his wife and three young children, said the South Wales Echo.         
	A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: When they came here we thought they were good family people. He was a really nice guy and spoke very politely. Another Albert Street resident added, I know he was a family man and I just thought they were a normal family.         
	Yesterday, the court was told that the men had carried out reconnaissance in London apparently with a view to cause explosions. High profile people in public life had also been selected.        
	Potential targets included the tourist attraction London Eye, the Stock Exchange and Mayor Boris Johnson, it was claimed. The Dean of St Pauls Cathedral, two rabbis and the US embassy in Grosvenor Square were also said to have been listed for possible attack.        
	Big Ben was allegedly visited, while the Palace of Westminster was among other key landmarks said to have received their attention.         
	The prosecution alleged the suspects had also conducted live tests on explosives as part of their unlawful and malicious conspiracy.        
	Some of the men, described as being of Bangladeshi origin, were either born in the UK or had arrived when they were young, attending school and working in Britain.         
	A covert surveillance operation was carried out by the police and MI5 that involved following the suspects and recording conversations, the court heard.        
	Prosecutor Piers Arnold said Trafalgar Square was visited and then Westminster, where a mobile phone was allegedly held up and pointed at Big Ben.        
	Surveillance teams then followed their quarries to the South Bank and the London Eye giant ferris wheel, which was being observed intently. They moved on to look at the Church of Scientology building on Queen Victoria Street near Blackfriars, before visiting a branch of McDonalds (which is not thought to serve halal meat).        
	After the arrests on December 20, searches at one of the addresses uncovered a handwritten note containing the contact details of six individuals, Arnold said.         
	It had the full addresses of the Dean of St Pauls and the Chapter House, two rabbis and their synagogues, the US Embassy, London Stock Exchange and the work address of Boris Johnson, according to the Daily Mail.        
	In court yesterday, the three from Cardiff all looked relaxed, and Latif even winked and gave a thumbs-up as he was led from the dock.         
	The involvement of a Hindu in militant Islam is not without precedent in the UK.        
	On November 7, 2006, Dhiren Barot was sentenced to life imprisonment, after pleading guilty to conspiracy to murder. It was recommended that he serve a minimum of 40 years, which was later reduced to 30.         
	Barot was born in Baroda on December 1, 1971, into a conservative Hindu family. His parents moved to the UK from Kenya in 1973 to escape violence and discrimination in Kenya, when he was only one year old. Barot converted to Islam at the age of 20 in the UK. He attended the Kingsbury High School in north London.        
	He adopted a number of aliases: Bilal, Abu Musa al-Hindi, Abu Eissa al-Hindi, and Issa al-Britani. He took part in militant campaigns against Indian forces in Kashmir.        
	Rather like the nine in court yesterday, Barot admitted plotting to blow a number of targets but in New York  the Stock Exchange, the International Monetary Fund headquarters and the World Bank, among other targets. He had also planned to use limousines packed with explosives and radioactive dirty bombs for the attacks.         
	Some still think his plans verged on fantasy.         
	His elderly parents were forced to withdraw from polite Gujarati society in London. They had not been in touch with their son for some year and did not know he had taken up with jihadi groups.        
	Followers of Bollywood will recall that in the 2007 film, Guru, Abhishek Bachchan played Gurukant Desai, a ruthless businessman said to have been inspired by the late Dhirubhai Ambani.        
	To show the equality of three great religions, the 1977 blockbuster, Amar Akbar Antony, told the story of three brothers who adopted three different faiths.

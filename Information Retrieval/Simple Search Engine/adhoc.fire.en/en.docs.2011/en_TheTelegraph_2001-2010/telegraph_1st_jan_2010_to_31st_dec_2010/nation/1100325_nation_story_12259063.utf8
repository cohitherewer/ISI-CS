          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 24: Nitish Kumars mantra of inclusive growth and development finds an echo in his party as well with the JD(U) accommodating the dissidents besides a large number of women and minorities in the jumbo executive committee of poll-bound Bihar.        
	While BJP chief Nitin Gadkari faces revolt in his party for leaving out senior leaders from the region, dissident leaders like former JD(U) state chief Rajiv Ranjan Singh, alias Lallan Singh, and Prabhunath Singh have found place in the 262-member executive committee.        
	State JD(U) chief Vijay Choudhary said: We have given representation to all with ignoring none.        
	Choudhary said: The executive committee has 42 vice-presidents, 87 general secretaries, 58 secretaries and 75 members with women and party workers from the Muslim community given a very large representation.        
	The executive committee has highest ever number of women this time, Choudhary said, indicating the panels support to Nitish, who has been spearheading the womens reservation bill against the wishes of JD(U) chief Sharad Yadav, who along with Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav, have been opposing it.        
	The womens reservation bill has split the JD(U) with Nitish taking a line quite opposed to Sharad Yadav. Nitishs stand, however, embarrassed Sharad Yadav for all the five MPs in the Rajya Sabha on the day of voting supported in favour of the bill.        
	Hari Prasad Sah, Nitishs close confidant, has been made chairman of the state parliamentary board and former MLC Vinay Kumar Sinha its treasurer.

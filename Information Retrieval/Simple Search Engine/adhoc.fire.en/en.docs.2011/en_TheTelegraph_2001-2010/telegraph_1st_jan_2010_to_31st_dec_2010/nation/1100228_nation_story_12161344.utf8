The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UGC nod faces govt veto
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      UGC nod faces govt veto
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                       The Supreme Court                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: The human resource development ministry has told the Supreme Court that it can withdraw deemed university status from institutions even if the University Grants Commission disagrees, challenging a key argument that could save 88 substandard varsities.        
	The ministry, in an affidavit filed before the court this week, has controversially argued that it can reject the positive advice of the UGC, Indias apex higher education quality regulator, on the deemed university status to institutions.        
	How the apex court evaluates the argument at a hearing on March 8 is critical as two independent probes into deemed universities by the UGC and the ministry threw up opposite suggestions.        
	The ministry probe found 88 deemed universities unfit for the tag, and recommended that the status be withdrawn from 44 of these immediately, and from the remaining 44 after three years unless they improved.        
	The probe was announced by HRD minister Kapil Sibal within days of taking charge last year and was showcased by the UPA as indicative of the governments intention of ridding higher education of corruption.         
	But the UGC probe recommended that all of Indias 130 deemed universities  including the 88 found unfit by the ministry probe  should be allowed to continue with the tag.         
	The HRD ministry argument, sources said, represents a pre-emptive attempt at countering the strongest charges likely to be made before the apex court by deemed universities under the ministrys scanner.        
	The court, in an order on January 25, had stopped the ministry from acting against indicted deemed universities for the time being.        
	The apex court had impleaded the 44 deemed universities, which the ministry wanted to act against immediately, to give them an opportunity to represent themselves.        
	Both the ministry and the deemed universities are aware that the UGCs clean chit to the blacklisted institutions represents their biggest window to escape government action.        
	Under Indias higher education structure, regulatory authorities like the UGC  for universities  and the Medical Council of India, the apex medical education watchdog, are responsible for ensuring standards.         
	The UGC consists of experts and it is on their recommendation that the HRD ministry may grant deemed university status, under the UGC Act.         
	But the act is silent on whether the HRD ministry similarly needs the recommendation of the UGC to withdraw deemed status.        
	In this case, the UGC has expressly stated that these institutions should be allowed to continue as deemed universities.        
	The deemed universities under the ministrys scanner are likely to question how the HRD ministry can overrule recommendations of the body of experts  the UGC  tasked to determine whether an institution is fit.        
	But the HRD ministry has argued that the act says that the government may, on the advice of the UGC, award deemed university status.        
	The advice of the commission to declare an institution a deemed-to-be university is not binding on the central government. The discretion lies with the government, the ministry has argued in the affidavit.        
	The ministry, explaining its argument in detail, has said that it does not disregard the UGCs advice against granting deemed status to some institutions.         
	But it may reject such positive advice and refuse to declare the institution in question as a deemed-to-be university.        
	The same reasoning, the ministry has contended, is applicable where the existing deemed status of an institution is to be reviewed by the HRD ministry.

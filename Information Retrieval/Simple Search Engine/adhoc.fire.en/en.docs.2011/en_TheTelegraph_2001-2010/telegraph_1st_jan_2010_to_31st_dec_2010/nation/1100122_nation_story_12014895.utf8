          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 21: The cabinet has approved plans to set up model colleges in 374 educationally backward districts, but has modified the human resource development ministrys proposal because of concerns raised by the Planning Commission.         
	The ministry blueprint granted eligibility to colleges set up after the National Development Councils approval to demand central grants. But the plan panel demanded that the model college scheme be applicable only to those institutes that have been set up after the cabinets approval.         
	The cabinet decided that all colleges that begin admissions after January 21, 2010, will be eligible to benefit.         
	Education tribunal        
	A group of ministers have approved proposed legislations to make accreditation of higher educational institutions mandatory, and to set up educational dispute redressal tribunals.

	Srinagar, Sept. 11: Id celebrations in Kashmir, which have been trouble-free in two decades of insurgency, today turned into a swell of support for azaadi with the streets of Srinagar taken over by violent protesters.         
	The protesters marched in large numbers to the citys commercial hub Lal Chowk and set fire to symbols of government, including police posts at Hazratbal, Kashmirs most sacred shrine.         
	Hazratbal, where chief minister Omar Abdullahs family traditionally offers Id prayers, was where trouble first erupted. Omar decided against going to the shrine, seen as a National Conference bastion, at the eleventh hour yesterday and prayed instead at a mosque near his house in high-security Gupkar.         
	Hurriyat Conference hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani had plans to offer prayers at Hazratbal in what was seen as an attempt to wrest control of the shrine from the Abdullahs, but was arrested two days ago. Several leaders of his group, however, reached the shrine and addressed a huge gathering.         
	After the prayers were over, the mob went on a rampage and torched the police posts. The police fired in the air to disperse them.         
	Timely and prompt action of the fire service and police stopped the fire from spreading. The mob was dispersed. However, the situation is tense. Some policemen have got injured, said a police spokesperson, who blamed the Geelani faction for the trouble.         
	Even as smoke was billowing out of the police posts at Hazratbal, bigger trouble was unfolding at the Eidgah lawns 8km away. More than a lakh people had joined prayers at Eidgah in response to a call by moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and new ally Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Yasin Malik.         
	But the two sprang a surprise when they announced a march to Lal Chowk, the commercial hub where most sensitive government installations are also located. Thousands of people, many waving green and black flags, heeded the call.         
	In the past two years, the government has repeatedly foiled proposed separatist marches to the venue but was caught off guard today, expecting Id to be trouble-free. It had pulled out police and the CRPF from many places to avoid confrontation.         
	The police said the Mirwaiz was permitted to take out an Id procession after he pledged it would be peaceful.         
	The procession did remain peaceful as it marched through the volatile Old City roads. But at Lal Chowk, the Mirwaiz and Yasin addressed gatherings. Then several protesters climbed the clock tower, where the Tricolour is hoisted on Independence Day and Republic Day, to hoist green flags. A part of it was torn down amid a climbing competition among youths.         
	After the rally ended, a mob gathered at Jahangir Chowk and set fire to the office of the power departments chief engineer and the crime branch headquarters.         
	The police fired in the air to quell the mob and CRPF reinforcements were rushed to give cover to fire tenders fighting the flames. State police chief Kuldip Khoda told a news conference in the evening that the Mirwaiz had been given permission to lead an Id procession up to Lal Chowk.         
	He promised that it will be a completely peaceful procession. But he addressed a mammoth gathering of 2,000 people at Lal Chowk and immediately after that the Power Development Department headquarters was set on flames. You can now yourself assess what they mean by peaceful procession, Khoda said.         
	Mirwaiz, however, condemned the violence and blamed it on miscreants. He had earlier rejected what he described as the Centres half-hearted solutions  a reference to the proposed move to partially lift the Armed Forces Special Powers Act.         
	We need a political solution to the Kashmir issue, he said. It is hardly the time now to satisfy Kashmiris by a partial review of AFSPA.

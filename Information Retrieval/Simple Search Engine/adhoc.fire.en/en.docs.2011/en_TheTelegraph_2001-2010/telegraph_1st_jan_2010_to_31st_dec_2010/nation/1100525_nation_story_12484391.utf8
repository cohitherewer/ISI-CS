          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 24: A terribly embarrassed BJP leadership today acknowledged that it was a big mistake on their part to try and form a government in Jharkhand along with the JMM and ruled out the possibility of making any attempt in the future.         
	BJP tried its best to lead a non-Congress government in Jharkhand. The moment we realised that enough was enough we called it off, the partys leader in the Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley told reporters, underlining that the decision to withdraw support was taken unanimously.         
	Will the BJP again change its position if Soren tomorrow assures support to it? Such a possibility is ruled out. Our decision to pull out is final, Jaitley said, as he tried hard to defend the party taking so long to take the final call. You dont call off on the first day.        
	Enough is enough should have been said much earlier. Why did we allow the matter to linger for such a long time? We have made our partys decision making look like a theatre of the absurd, remarked a senior leader of the party, indicating that fingers would now be raised against party chief Nitin Gadkari, who is at present holidaying in Europe and is expected to return to Delhi on Thursday.         
	Senior BJP leaders blamed Gadkaris weak leadership for the partys face loss in Jharkhand. Advaniji had strongly opposed the idea of leading a government in Jharkhand. He was overruled and Gadkariji gave the go ahead and left for Europe, said a leader.         
	Jaitley stressed that the decision was taken last evening in consultation with all members of the partys parliamentary board. Everybody agreed that we should pull out, Jaitley said.         
	Interestingly, the BJP earlier had decided to take a final call over Jharkhand at a parliamentary board meeting tomorrow.

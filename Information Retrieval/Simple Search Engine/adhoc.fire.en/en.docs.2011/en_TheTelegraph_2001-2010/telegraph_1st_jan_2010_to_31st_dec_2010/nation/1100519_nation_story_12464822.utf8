The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Needed: unified command and trainers with tactical skills
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Needed: unified command and trainers with tactical skills
          K.K. GANGOPADHYAY                              
	On May 17, Maoists struck again, killing people travelling in Dantewada in a civil bus.        
	It is amply clear that the Maoists do neither have the capability to usher in an era of development in the tribal areas, nor are they interested in doing so. They want to create a so-called liberated zone in the vast area, approximately 3,500sqkm, dominated by them, where they should be able to run a parallel Maoist government. Eventually, some day, they hope to overthrow the democratically elected government in New Delhi.        
	In the meantime, they are using the poor tribals as pawns to practice Maoists concepts which the entire world has rejected.        
	However, every banned underground armed revolutionary organisation has created an overground organisation as their civil face which supports the underground cadres in a variety of ways.        
	They interact with national and international print and electronic media, seek financial, moral and material support from foreign embassies, and arrange legal support for arrested underground cadres, by employing prominent lawyers, even interacting with security forces, to resolve various social problems concerning relatives of their armed cadres, arrange medical help for sick or wounded cadres, and also gather intelligence for the movement.         
	I have seen and interacted with such groups in Jammu amp; Kashmir, Punjab, Assam, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and in Sri Lanka. They go by various means like citizen forums, human rights organisations, mothers front, tribal welfare organisation etc. They try to highlight alleged or imaginary atrocities committed by the security forces. The aim of these protests or allegations is to put the security forces on the defensive, to reduce the pressure on the terrorist groups.        
	They at times even project important personalities to mediate between the government and terrorist organisations to bring both the parties to the discussion table for peaceful settlement of the problem or gain time for the terrorists to regroup.         
	Indian democracy provides ample space for allowing such dissenting views and voices displaying solidarity with organisations like the NSCN, Ulfa or CPI (Maoists) etc. Pushpa Kumar Dahal (Prachanda), the Nepali Maoist leader, has realised the strength and resilience of democracy and opted for joining the national democratic process in Nepal.        
	The nation, through Parliament, has spoken that the Maoists armed movement needs to be put down but the method employed by the government appears to be inadequate. The responsibility rests with affected state governments. The central government will help the state with central police, paramilitary forces, on as required basis.        
	It must be understood that the interstate boundaries have no meaning for the Maoists. The state and central forces must train together, fight under one unified command. The state police and CRPF units are so heavily committed in protecting vulnerable areas and vulnerable points, providing security to VVIPs and other law and order problems that they do not have any time for individual, physical or arms training.        
	Training of junior leadership, tactical training for these constables is probably unheard of. Even the IPS officers, responsible for planning and conduct of operations lack combat experience, necessary knowledge and expertise.        
	The job of police and paramilitary forces is no longer confined to crime detection and maintaining law and order. They have to face deadly terrorists in their area of responsibilities  low-intensity warfare. It is true that a few states have raised specially trained police battalions to fight the Maoists. But the force is too inadequate to cover 3,500sqkm with thousands of villages and 15,000 armed Maoists. Every state must create such special units.        
	How should this challenge then be met, short of relying on army units? It is already too late to raise properly trained units for this job. Any delay would make the job more difficult.        
	Fortunately, they as yet, do not have any common border with a foreign country, nor a suitable coastline for easy import of weapons and explosives. In this connection, reports of their attempts to create a base in the Sunderbans are ominous.        
	Immediate problems can be overcome by employing a few Rashtriya Rifles (RR) battalions withdrawn from Jammu and Kashmir for a year or so.        
	Training of special units must be completed within this period. IPS officers must be made to work in infantry or RR battalions, employed in counter-insurgency operations, and only officers found suitable should be allowed to join paramilitary units trained to fight the Maoists.        
	I have no answer how to create junior leadership in the CRPF. Maybe, a few selected volunteer infantry junior commissioned officers (JCOs) can be posted on deputation to overcome immediate problems till trained CRPF cadres are available.        
	Junior officers and JCOs are the most important elements in fighting counter-insurgency operations. Junior officers can hardly be spared by the battalions. I feel this is the weakest link in the structure in the CRPF battalions for low intensity warfare.        
	Everyday one hears exchange of fire has taken place with the Maoists but there are no casualties. This is because of lack of knowledge and application of tactics. No fire should be returned unless the target is seen and within killing range. Security forces must learn to close in on the Maoists by using fire and move tactics, cutting off escape routes and laying of ambush.        
	Again, they are not considered as enemy; as such, every effort must be moved to capture them alive. All civilian and police vehicles must move in convoy with escorts after road opening and deployment of road opening parties.        
	Last but not the least, is the overall concept of operations. No matter what is the provocation, no innocent civilian should get killed or hurt. No villager should be harassed, not to think of torturing them. Let a hundred Maoists get away but not one innocent get hurt.         
	Maoists believe they must align with the people in the affected areas like fish in the water. Hence they should be denied that opportunity. Maoists must be isolated from the people. The only way to do so is to treat the local people with utmost courtesy, love and respect, particularly the women folk. In fact, the aim of counter-insurgency operations is to win the heart and mind of the people of the affected area. This should be in conjunction with massive development activities.        
	The commanders at various levels have to devise own ways to win the confidence of the people. This will give out-of-proportion results.        
	The above concept is not a theory but I was successful in applying the same in the Punjab, Nagaland, Manipur and Sri Lanka.  
	 Major General K.K. Gangopadhyay VSM (Retd) served the Indian Army for 36 years as an officer in 9 Gorkha Rifles. He fought in the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971 as well as insurgents in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Assam, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Sri Lanka (IPKF)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP plans freeze beyond winter 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP plans freeze beyond winter 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                               Sushma Swaraj, Sharad Yadav      
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: The BJP and its allies are planning to carry the 2G spectrum agitation beyond the winter session of Parliament that will close on Monday without conducting normal business for even a day.         
	With the main Opposition party not showing any signs that it would drop the demand for a joint parliamentary probe in the budget session next year, the government will have to find a way to ensure that session does not go waste too.         
	Right now, other than hoping that the BJP will tire itself out and the Opposition will crack under its contradictions, the Congress appears clueless about how to handle the looming crisis.         
	NDA leaders met this morning to outline the contours of their agitation that remained fuzzy because the coalition was unsure about roping in parties such as the Biju Janata Dal, Asom Gana Parishad and the Indian National Lok Dal.         
	Alliance convener Sharad Yadav said that since he was still on the job, he would like to keep the process under wraps.         
	The NDAs proposed sit-in in the Parliament complex on Monday might not see the participation of parties other than the four that form the coalition  the BJP, Janata Dal (United), Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal  and Yadav is focusing on organising a show of strength for the December 22 rally in the capital. The rally is the important thing, the Janata Dal(United) president said.         
	As a strategy, the NDA has decided to drop its name from the banners in case the other parties have an issue with the BJP. We will name it an Opposition rally, BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said.         
	Sources in the Asom Gana Parishad more or less ruled out being part of the NDA enterprise, keeping the April Assembly elections in mind. We have to think of the 35 per cent minority vote. The moment we are seen with the BJP under any banner, this vote will consolidate in the Congresss favour. After the elections, depending on the verdict, if we have to work with the BJP, we will see. In future if they need our support to set up a non-Congress coalition in Delhi, we might consider giving it, a party source said.         
	Biju Janata Dal MP Bhartruhari Mahtab said: I dont think we are joining because if we had to, we would have communicated the decision by now. But let me also clarify that we do not treat the BJP like a pariah or a communal force. We formed a government with them twice in Orissa. The way the UPA government is damaging systems of governance, it is important for the Opposition to fight unitedly.         
	INLDs Rajya Sabha MP Ranbir Singh Parjapati said while his party would join Mondays dharna, it was unlikely to be a part of the rally.         
	The Delhi rally will be followed by others in major cities and towns.         
	The BJP sees in the telecom scam an opportunity to reclaim its urban voters who went with the Congress in 2009. The partys feedback is that its stalling of Parliament had not put off voters like it had in the UPAs first term when L.K. Advani and the party were blamed for obstructing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	Swaraj said: I have been attending several weddings over the past few weeks where people said to me, Behenji, you are doing a great job, corner these people, stall the House, do whatever you can to pin down this government.         
	The Commonwealth Games scam followed by the telecom scam was the game-changer, the BJP believes.         
	It was compounded by the Prime Ministers silence. Hes giving an impression that he is least concerned with whats happening. Added to that is the perception that while Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are ever willing to take credit for the good things of the UPA, in a crisis they makes themselves invisible. It looks like theres no central command, a party leader said.         
	A Congress minister admitted that the partys efforts to counter the BJPs offensive through an attack on the Yeddyurappa governments omissions and commissions and the NDAs dubious record on telecom did not prove adequately effective.

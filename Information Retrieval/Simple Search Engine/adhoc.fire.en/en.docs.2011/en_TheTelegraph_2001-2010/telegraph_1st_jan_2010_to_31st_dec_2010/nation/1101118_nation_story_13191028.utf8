                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mumbai rape cop sacked
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 17: Senior Mumbai police inspector and controversial encounter specialist Arun Borude, absconding since he was accused of raping a 15-year-old, was today sacked without inquiry.         
	Commissioner Sanjeev Dayal announced the dismissal of Borude after the inspector kept dodging the police and remained untraceable. The director-general of police, D. Sivanandan, ordered Borudes dismissal under Article 311 of the Constitution on grounds of immoral conduct, Dayal said.        
	Borude is the fourth policeman and the second encounter specialist in five years to be sacked under this provision, which empowers the police chief to order a dismissal without even a departmental inquiry.         
	Borude has been absconding since the family of the 15-year-old lodged a complaint in the Powai police station on November 1.         
	The complaint said the girl was forced into prostitution by their neighbour Shantabai Gaikwad, who took her to a flat where she was repeatedly raped by different men.        
	Gaikwad was arrested a day later, and revealed that Borude and two estate agents had raped the girl in a flat officially sealed by court orders.         
	The estate agents, Mohanchand Shyam, 45, and Satyanarayan Gupta, 45, were arrested from Chandigarh.        
	The case came to light on October 17 when the rape victim gave birth to a premature baby at Rajawadi hospital.

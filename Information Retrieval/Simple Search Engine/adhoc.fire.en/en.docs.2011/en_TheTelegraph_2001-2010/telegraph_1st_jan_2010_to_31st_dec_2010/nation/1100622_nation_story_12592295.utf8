The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP puts Bihar pot before pride
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP puts Bihar pot before pride
  - Snub swallowed but threat remains        OUR BUREAU                             Nitish Kumar (top) and Nitin Gadkari				                                       
	June 21: The crisis in Bihars ruling coalition appeared on the mend today with the BJP blinking first, though with reservations and the potential to threaten the alliance in future.        
	The BJP indicated that in the larger interest of Bihars development, it was willing to digest the snub from Nitish Kumar and continue its tie-up with the Janata Dal (United).        
	Nitish had on June 12 virtually told a visiting Narendra Modi he was unwanted in Bihar, irked by patronising ads published by the Gujarat government. He recently returned the Rs 5-crore flood aid sent by the Modi government in 2008.        
	The situation is under control, BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said.        
	A potter cannot break the pot he himself has shaped, he added, making it evident that senior leaders such as L.K. Advani and Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Modi wanted the tie-up to continue.        
	Hussain and Bihar BJP chief C.P. Thakur had briefed Advani for an hour in the morning, and party chief Nitin Gadkari was expected to meet the veteran tonight.        
	Nitish and Sushil Modi showed up together at the oath-taking of the states first woman chief justice but were not seen speaking to each other. Sushil had yesterday skipped a Viswash Yatra meeting attended by Nitish.        
	There is no tension, so relax, Nitish said, speaking for the first time to the media on the rift.        
	Problems remain, though. The BJP would not say if Narendra Modi might campaign in Bihar in the run-up to the state polls. Another attempt by the minister to embarrass Nitish could still cause the alliance to come unstuck.        
	That the BJP had adopted the Advani line was evident when Hussain said that with the exception of the Shiv Sena, the Dal (United) had been the BJPs oldest ally in the years since the temple agitation. The Dal (United), in its earlier avatar as the Samata Party, had been one of the first to embrace the untouchable BJP in the early 1990s.        
	However, the BJP is hurting from Nitishs move to return the flood aid cheque, and from the fact that it had to call a truce unilaterally.        
	This money wasnt a wedding gift to be returned when the relations between the bride and the groom break down, a senior leader said.

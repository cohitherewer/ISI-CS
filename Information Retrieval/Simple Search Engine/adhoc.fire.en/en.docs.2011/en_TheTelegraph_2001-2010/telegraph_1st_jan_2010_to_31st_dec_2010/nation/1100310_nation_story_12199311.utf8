	New Delhi, March 9: India has agreed to formally associate itself with the Copenhagen Accord, iterating that the document that emerged at the UN climate conference last year should be neither legally binding nor lead to a fresh track of negotiations.         
	Environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh today told Parliament that India has, after careful consideration, agreed to be listed as a country that participated in the negotiations on the Copenhagen Accord and stands by it.         
	But he added: The accord is a political document and is not legally binding. The Copenhagen Accord is not a separate track of negotiations.

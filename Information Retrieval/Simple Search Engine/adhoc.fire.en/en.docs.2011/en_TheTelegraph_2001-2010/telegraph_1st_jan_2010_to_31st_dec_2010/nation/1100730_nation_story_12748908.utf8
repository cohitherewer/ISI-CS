The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BlackBerry fears ease
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BlackBerry fears ease
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Keep calling      
	New Delhi, July 29: The BlackBerry isnt being plucked out for now.        
	The Centre does not plan to ban the smartphone after Research in Motion (RIM), its Canadian maker, promised to do more to address Indias concerns stemming from a technology in the gadget meant to prevent snooping.        
	RIM has assured the ministry of home affairs that the issue of monitoring of BlackBerry services will be sorted out soon. I am sure we will soon be on the same page and our concerns will be addressed, U.K. Bansal, the chief of internal security in the ministry, said today.         
	His statement has raised hopes about the continued availability of the services. It comes after almost two years of reminders to the company that Indian law-enforcement agencies need to monitor BlackBerrys for security purposes, but the secrecy mechanism keeps them from accessing messages and other data.        
	The home ministry had earlier said that BlackBerry services in India would have to be shut down if its email and other services do not comply with formats that can be monitored by security and intelligence agencies.        
	The worries arent unique to India. A few days back, the UAE dubbed the BlackBerry a security threat saying it allowed people to misuse the service, causing serious social, judicial and national security repercussions.        
	At the heart of the objections is the lack of access to the encryption key  a code that allows the BlackBerry data, converted into unreadable formats for secrecy, to be read. Intelligence agencies insist that RIM should either give them the key or locate its servers in India so that it is possible for them to monitor the services.        
	The UAE authorities, too, said the main problem was that RIM servers were located, echoing a concern of many Asian governments which suspect that the secrecy devices are a way to circumvent security agencies.        
	RIM had earlier told the department of telecom  which regulates phone services  that BlackBerry was created to ensure secrecy in corporate deals and communication. That secrecy, the firm argued, will be compromised if it had to part with the encryption key.        
	But the home ministry has pointed out that RIM has been addressing security concerns of many other countries, including the US, where it operates and there was no justification not to comply with similar Indian demands. Suspicion about the dual approach deepened after reports that RIM was setting up servers in China on Beijings diktat.        
	Even though it is the home ministry that wants the company to specify when it would hand over the BlackBerry encryption key, Bansal, the internal security chief, made it the telecom ministry would take the final call.        
	Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar, Reliance Communications, Tata Teleservices, BSNL and MTNL offer BlackBerry services.

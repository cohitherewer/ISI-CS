          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: The tourism ministry is availing itself of the services of some 20 India Tourism Development Corporation employees without paying them a single penny.        
	This is in spite of a September 2009 directive from the PMO that ministries are not to use central public sector enterprises (CPSE) under them as milch cows.        
	The ITDC staffers have been deployed at various levels. Five are with tourism minister Kumari Selja and two with junior minister Sultan Ahmed. Some are with tourism secretary R.H. Khwaja and other senior officials.        
	Some of them have completed 15 years in the ministry while others have just joined. Down the years, the ITDC has been paying the salaries of these 20 employees.        
	This is in gross violation of the cabinet secretary directive against using manpower belonging to PSUs for the benefit of ministry officials, said an ITDC official.        
	The September 2009 directive had come after a controversy in May last year involving the petroleum ministry and the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation. The PMO had stepped in after the ONGC complained that the ministry was forcing it to provide cars and mobiles to officers as well as pay their mobile bills, air fares and hotel expenses.        
	The PMO then set up a core group of officers to look into the issue. The group, comprising the expenditure, personnel and public enterprises secretaries, had recommended that facilities from CPSEs for personal use should be strictly prohibited, but officers could avail of them for official purposes after approval by the secretary concerned.        
	However, the PMO did not approve this recommendation. On May 27, 2009, it wrote to the cabinet secretary that allowing the use of manpower, laptops, mobiles and vehicles in exigencies of work would suggest that ministries with CPSEs had more work than those without them and that these ministries were under-provided. Permitting some ministries to obtain such facilities from CPSEs is problematic. They tend to become perks that other ministries do not have. This also creates a perverse incentive for officers to prefer ministries with CPSEs, the PMO had said.        
	Apart from this being unfair and inefficient, it has the potential to compromise the independence of the government direction.        
	The PMO had also said that a fair and efficient system would be to assess the needs of each ministry and give them the facilities directly instead of sourcing them from CPSEs.        
	If ministries/officers are not entitled to them or those are considered unnecessary, then there is no case for permitting them through CPSEs.        
	It is learnt that the ITDC has so far paid around Rs 7 crore as salary to these employees, although none of them has been doing any service to the organisation.        
	Asked about the illegality of the appointment, ITDC chairperson and managing director Lalit K. Panwar said: It is not illegal may be improper. Tourism secretary Khwaja has yet to respond to an email sent last Thursday.        
	Sources said the staff deployment practice had been going on as it suited both the ministry and the employees. The ministry is happy because it gets so many additional hands without shelling out an extra penny. The employees are happy because they feel that working with the ministry is more prestigious than with a PSU. The only loser has been ITDC, an official said.

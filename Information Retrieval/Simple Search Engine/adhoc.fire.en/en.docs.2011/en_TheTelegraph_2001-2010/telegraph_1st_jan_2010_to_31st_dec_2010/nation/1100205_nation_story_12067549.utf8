          SUBRAT DAS                          European diplomats at Nandagiri in Kandhamal on Thursday. (Arabinda Mahapatra)                                  
	Nandagiri (Kandhamal), Feb. 4: Pramila Naik waited patiently from morning today to speak to the European Union delegation that was visiting their homes, a rehabilitation colony set up for the victims of the 2008 Kandhamal riots.         
	We are happy that the district administration has provided four decimals of land for building homes. We have also been provided with house building assistance from the state. But we do not have any job to sustain us, the 35-year-old told the visitors from Europe, who, however, chose to only listen and not respond to their grievances.        
	We expect positive results. Rehabilitation work may be expedited now that a team from Europe has come to see us, hoped Naik, one among 55 families of riot victims who refused to go back to their villages for fear of retribution from Hindus and decided to settled down at the colony.        
	Besides, there was lack of drinking water and no electricity, rued other riot victims. Sister Soma of the local Believers Church helped interpret the victims grievances.        
	We are concerned about our childrens education since there is no school nearby. We do not have a place to pray either, said Sabita Naik, when asked about her views on the conditions at the colony.        
	At Hatapada, residents alleged that the local BDO had asked them to vacate the colony a day before the delegations visit. However, sarpanch Namita Pradhan claimed most of the riot victims had returned to their villages and were leading normal lives. In all, 12 families stayed back in the temporary relief camp.        
	The next stop was Nilungia village, where the group of diplomats from eight European countries went to a local upper primary school and interacted with students. The team members wanted to know whether the children were staying at their homes and whether both Hindus and Christians were attending classes.        
	The students, it seemed, were prompted to answer in the affirmative. But according to a teacher, Christian students had apparently stopped coming to schools after the riots.        
	Some of the villagers alleged that the assistance paid by the state government for rebuilding damaged houses was not adequate.        
	Later, the delegation visited the pastoral training centre at K Nuagaon and spoke to the inmates. The diplomats will discuss their findings and the prevailing rehabilitation measures with district officials tomorrow.

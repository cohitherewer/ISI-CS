	Bangalore, March 9: The largest batch at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM-B) here in five years found jobs in just five days, a reflection of the economys transition from gloom to boom, almost.        
	As many as 90 students of the batch of 270 were hired on the first two days of the placement process, dubbed Slot Zero. Placements began on March 4 and ended yesterday.        
	It (placements) has been much better than last year, said professor P.D. Jose, chairperson, placements. Over 10 companies, which were regulars earlier but did not recruit last year after the economic meltdown, returned to the campus with offers.        
	Last year, the placement process for the batch of 249 students had taken nine days, with several companies staying away in the wake of the financial crisis that saw the fall of investment banks such as Lehman Brothers, a big-buck recruiter in the past. The crisis had also meant that the salaries offered were lower.        
	The institute does not reveal salary figures as a matter of policy.        
	Since the economy had one year to recover, we have again come back to the good times. So this time it was rather positive with lateral placements (for students with work experience) also going off very well that gave positive vibes for final placements, said Aruna Ranganathan, who has taken up a marketing job with FMCG giant Procter amp; Gamble.        
	For the first time, a hospital group, Narayana Hrudayalaya, run by cardiologist Devi Shetty, recruited six graduates for senior management positions.        
	We will be looking at strategy and marketing operations, said Akshay Oleti, one of the six who joined the hospital group. In his previous job with a software products firm, Oleti, a computer science graduate from BITS Pilani, had worked on developing software for hospitals.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jairam Ramesh at the press conference where the MoU was announced. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 6: Seven Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) have plunged into a government effort to clean the Ganga, promising to recommend a slew of river management and technology strategies to improve its ecological health.         
	The 2500km Ganga is one of the countrys most polluted rivers laced with sewage and city waste although the government has spent about Rs 900 crore over the past two decades on a clean-up plan initiated in the late-1980s.         
	An IIT consortium will develop a Ganga River Basin Management Plan within 18 months under an agreement signed today by the Union environment ministry and the IITs at Mumbai, Delhi, Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Chennai and Roorkee.         
	The plan will take into account the future growth of populations and the increasing demand for land, energy and water as well as requirements of sewage treatment plants in cities along the river. The consortium will also recommend strategies to maintain river flow.         
	We expect the IITs to examine new technologies such as bioremediation to clean up the river, environment minister Jairam Ramesh said. Bioremediation involves the use of micro organisms to mop up contaminants.         
	The management plan will also recommend strategies to maintain and augment water flow in the river, said Vinod Tare, professor of civil engineering at the IIT Kanpur, who is coordinating the IIT participation.         
	Poor flow can change the ecology of the river, he said.         
	Under current plans, no untreated municipal sewage or industrial effluents from 2020 can flow into the Ganga. The Union government has asked states along the rivers course to submit project proposals to restore the river. Ramesh said projects worth Rs 1,400 crore have already been sanctioned in five states Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Bengal.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 16: The army is set to take over the Bilaspur airport in Chhattisgarh, defence minister A.K. Antony told Parliament today.        
	This would be the first military airport in the state where Maoist insurgency is taking a heavy toll on security forces. Bilaspur is 110km north of the state capital Raipur.        
	It also signals the rising threat-perception in the government from the Maoists. The army has already been allocated land near Raipur to set up a sub-area command.        
	The army special forces training school in Nahan in Himachal Pradesh is also likely to be moved to Chhattisgarh.        
	Responding to a question by Jaywantrao Awale on the number of army-controlled airports and whether the defence ministry had requested the civil aviation ministry for the Bilaspur airport, Antony replied: Ministry of defence has requested ministry of civil aviation to lease Bilaspur airport to the army. Ministry of civil aviation have intimated their consent for transfer of Bilaspur Airport on leased basis to ministry of defence.        
	The Army Aviation Corps controls helidrones at Nashik road and Jhansi. It does not have a single airport under it. Bilaspur would be the first.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: India is ranked 123, two rungs below China, in a new assessment of the performance of nations worldwide in addressing pollution control and managing their natural resources.         
	The global environmental performance assessment, conducted by two US Ivy League universities, has ranked India above 100 on several key criteria  urban air pollution, environmental health burden and sanitation.         
	Iceland leads the world in pollution control and natural resources management, according to the 2010 Environmental Performance Index produced by a team of environmental experts at Yale University and Columbia University.         
	The index has ranked the US at 61, assigning it strong points for safe drinking water and good forest management practices, but weak on greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution levels.         
	Among newly industrialised countries, China is ranked 121 and India two rungs lower. The Columbia-Yale team has said this reflects the strain that rapid economic growth imposes on the environment.         
	But Brazil  another large developing country  is ranked 62, suggesting that the level of development is just one of several factors that affect the position of a country on the environmental performance scale.         
	The index has ranked India at 114 on the environmental burden of disease, 125 on urban air pollution and 130 on air pollution and its effects on people.         
	Theres nothing surprising about these findings, said Anumita Roychaudhuri, associate director at the Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi, a non-government agency that was not involved in the assessment.         
	Weve had local initiatives to improve the environment, but theyre not sustained. Given Indias economic growth, the momentum on actions to control pollution would have to be equally aggressive, Roychaudhuri told The Telegraph.         
	The Columbia-Yale team said the assessment suggested that income was a major factor for environmental success.               
	But at every level of development, however, some countries achieve results that exceed what could be anticipated  showing that policy choices also influence performance.         
	Chile, for example, which has invested substantially on environmental protection, ranks 16, but its neighbour Argentina, which has done much less to improve its pollution control and natural resources, lags at 70, the team said. Or, Bangladesh, as another example, is ranked 112 on the environmental burden of disease, two notches higher than India.         
	The assessment, based on data drawn from international organisations such as the World Bank, the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation and various other agencies, is expected to help policymakers identify priorities for action.         
	High-quality data combined with statistical analysis can help policymakers identify problems and trends and more effectively leverage public investments, said Jay Emerson, professor of statistics at Yale University and a lead author of the assessment.

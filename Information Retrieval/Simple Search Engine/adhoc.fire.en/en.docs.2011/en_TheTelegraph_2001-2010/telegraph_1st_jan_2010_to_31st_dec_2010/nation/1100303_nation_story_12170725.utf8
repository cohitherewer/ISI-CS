          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                   
	New Delhi, March 2: The Congress today conveyed its displeasure to Shashi Tharoor and asked him to be extra-cautious while expressing his views.        
	Party sources said they were now confident that the junior foreign minister, who found himself at the centre of another controversy over his comments on a Saudi Arabian interlocutor, would mend his ways.         
	However, many Congress leaders believe that he should be shifted out of foreign affairs ministry. These leaders do not rule out Tharoor getting a new portfolio as and when the Prime Minister shuffles his ministry.         
	Tharoors visit to the AICC headquarters this evening triggered speculation that he was summoned in the wake of the Saudi Arabia controversy. Tharoor had earlier clarified that he did not mean Saudi Arabia should mediate between India and Pakistan.        
	AICC media department chairperson Janardan Dwivedi, whom Tharoor met, claimed that the meeting had been fixed a week ago. He, however, added that Tharoor had explained his position on the latest controversy during the one-hour meeting.         
	Dwivedi expressed satisfaction at Tharoors explanation and hoped that such controversies would not recur.        
	Sources said Tharoor claimed that the media had misunderstood his remark and there was no question of his suggesting that Saudi Arabia would mediate between India and Pakistan.

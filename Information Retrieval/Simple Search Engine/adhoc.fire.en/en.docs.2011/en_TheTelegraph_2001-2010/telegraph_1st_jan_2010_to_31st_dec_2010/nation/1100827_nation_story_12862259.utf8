The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | No magic but Nitin transfixed
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      No magic but Nitin transfixed
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, Aug. 26: BJP president Nitin Gadkari today lamented that his recent tour of 24 states in 48 days did not grab attention the way Rahul Gandhis tours do.        
	Was it because of the magic of Rahuls charisma? Certainly not, it would seem from the BJP bosss reply.        
	Waise Rahul Gandhi ke paas aisa koi karishma nazar nahin aaya hai. Uttar Pradesh aur doosri Assembly elections mein woh koi karishma nahin dikha paye (I have not noticed any magic in Rahul Gandhi. In Uttar Pradesh and other Assembly elections he was not able to do any magic), Gadkari said.        
	The barbs at Rahul flew when a journalist asked Gadkari if the Gandhi scions projection as a future Prime Minister worried him. He rejected the idea. Yeh unka aantrik mamla hai (it is the Congresss internal matter), he said, and then went on to dismiss the talk of the young MPs perceived charisma.         
	Gadkari said he had risen in the ranks as an ordinary party worker to become the BJP president, something he said, would not have been possible in the Congress. In the Congress, only someone from the Nehru-Gandhi family can aspire to be the party president, he said.         
	The BJP chief also lashed out at Union home minister P. Chidambaram for harping on saffron terrorism. This was the Congresss way to appease minorities, he said.         
	I do not believe that there is any such thing as saffron terrorism. The Congress talks about it only for its vote-bank politics. Long back, secularism used to mean respect for all religions, but for the Congress today it means only appeasement of minorities, Gadkari said.

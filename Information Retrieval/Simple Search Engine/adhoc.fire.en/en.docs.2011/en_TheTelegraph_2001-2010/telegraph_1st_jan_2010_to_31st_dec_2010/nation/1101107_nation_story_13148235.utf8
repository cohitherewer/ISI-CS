                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      4-hour wait for handshake 
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          The President shook hands with me and said you did a good job. I am overwhelmed to meet him. This is a big thing for me Vishnu Zende, The railway announcer who alerted commuters on 26/11 and saved many lives                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 6: Moumina Khatoon, a 30-year-old mother of four, shook hands with Barack Obama at the Taj hotel today after waiting four hours to meet him.         
	She was overwhelmed that a man as big as the President of USA had shaken hands with a poor, illiterate woman like me.        
	But the handshake will not get Umar back. So I did not bother to ask what his words addressed to me meant. It does not matter. Must be some sympathetic words, said Moumina, who lost her husband in the 26/11 terror attack.        
	Mohammad Umar was driving his taxi when a bomb planted in it by Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving attacker, went off near Vile Parle.         
	Moumina, who lives in a slum at Govandi in Mumbais central suburbs, was among the family members of 26/11 victims that the US President met.         
	I went there at 10am and it was a long wait. I felt lost as the security did not allow my brother-in-law to enter. They had earlier said he could come. I was crying inside. I was scared too, she said.         
	Many of the 26/11 victims who watched the Obama speech on television, said they were disappointed with the service.        
	The single white rose the US President placed on the memorial for the 26/11 victims did not mean much to many who had lost their own in November 2008.        
	Bharat Waghela, who owns Chamunda Chemists near Leopold Caf, a 26/11 target, lost his brother Subhash.         
	I watched the whole Obama show on TV  I would call it just that, a show, nothing more, he said.        
	After the service, autograph seekers mobbed Obama, some of them among the VIPs present.        
	He obliged many, including Mumbai mayor Shraddha Jadhav and her deputy Shaileja Girkar.        
	Many in the gathering also wanted him to sign copies of his books and Obama gladly agreed.        
	Ratan Tata, whose industry group owns the Taj hotel, received the American President for the memorial service and also saw him off.

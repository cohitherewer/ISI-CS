The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoists on mind, govt mulls mining law
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Maoists on mind, govt mulls mining law
  - Proposal to arm NIA with probe powers to check illegal quarrying           NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                    
	New Delhi, June 24: The government is thinking of bringing in a law that would allow the National Investigation Agency to probe cases of illegal mining.        
	The proposal for arming the NIA with this power had come from the Prime Ministers Office. Sources said the objective was to enable the Centre to break the mining mafia.        
	If passed, the proposed legislation will also enable the government to scrap leases of companies engaged in illegal operations, like in Karnataka, and also leases of companies allegedly paying Maoists or other insurgents for hassle-free operations.        
	These levies are believed to be a major source of funds for the insurgents.        
	Under the draft bill, companies found guilty of paying Maoists or engaging in illegal mining could also be barred from carrying out future mining operations.        
	The draft is currently with the PMO and will be taken up for discussion by the group of ministers constituted for this, led by the finance minister (Pranab Mukherjee), mines minister Bijoy Krishna Handique told reporters today.        
	Eight rounds of consultations have been held with the various stakeholders, Handique added.        
	The sources said the multifaceted draft legislation now with the PMO was facing opposition from the powerful mining lobby.         
	For one, if cleared by Parliament, the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 2010, will allow the NIA  formed after the Mumbai attack to look into offences that affect national security  to investigate any mining company paying levies to Maoists. Several mining areas happen to be rebel zones.        
	Two, it will enable even an ordinary citizen to file a police complaint against illegal mining. Now, only a state government can file a case against illegal mining.        
	If the law is enacted, the sources said it would help avoid situations like the one in Karnataka, where Justice N. Santhosh Hegde yesterday resigned as the state Lokayukta in protest against the governments alleged apathy to illegal mining.         
	The draft bill also recommends setting up 50 special courts to try cases of illegal mining. But significantly, it will allow the Centre to intervene in what is now a state subject.        
	Last year, the Centre had detected 41,824 cases of illegal mining. Sources said there have been 5,016 court cases and fines amounting to Rs 72 crore have been collected so far, while operations in 483 mines have been suspended and 38 cancelled.        
	Following rampant violations in the Aravallis, 948 mines have been closed on court orders in Haryana, Maharashtra and Rajasthan.        
	The bill also calls for allotting 26 per cent free equity to those whose plots are being taken over for mining operations.        
	The draft bill also proposes that a mining company has to provide employment and/or other assistance in accordance with the rehabilitation and resettlement policy of a state government concerned.        
	The sources said the partnership plan was aimed at weaning tribals away from the rebels. One reason the Maoists have succeeded in extending their domain is because they have been able to tap tribal anger over inadequate compensation for land acquired by mining companies.        
	But the Federation of Indian Mineral Industry and some private corporations have been opposing the equity plan for the landlosers, mainly tribals in states such as Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.         
	They are agreeable to annuity but not equity, said a source.        
	While annuity means annual payment to landowners, equity would mean shares in the mining companies.         
	Apparently, some objections have also come in from the steel ministry, which wants some exemptions for public sector units.        
	The sources said the legislation would be a major institutional weapon for the home ministry in its fight against the Maoists.         
	They hoped the group of ministers would clear the draft legislation in time so that it could be introduced in the winter session of Parliament.         
	Handique said the bill might become an act next year.

          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 6: Among the 1,000-odd rebels who lay in wait this morning in Dantewada, some of them may have just waded across a river from neighbouring Orissa.        
	Police and intelligence sources in Orissa said Maoist cadres in the state might have played a role in todays attack as the site of the ambush is close to the border between Chhattisgarh and its rebel-hit neighbour.        
	The possibility of Maoist cadres crossing the border and joining the Dantewada operation cannot be ruled out, said Anadi Sahu, a former inspector-general of Orissa police.        
	Sahu said tribals from Podia and Motu in Malkangiri regularly visit the Kunta weekly market in Chhattisgarh by crossing the Sileru river. Kunta is close to Tarmetla forest in Dantewada, where the Maoists ambushed the CRPF and police personnel today.        
	Illiterate Koya tribals, who live on either side of the Orissa-Chhattisgarh border, are influenced by the Maoists, Sahu added.        
	Intelligence sources said Motu, Kalimela, Podia, Bhejangiwada, Chitrakonda, Malkangiri and Balimela were some of the major Maoist support bases in Malkangiri district that the rebels have declared liberated zones.        
	The sources said there were around 250 to 300 Maoist cadres in the border area under the command of the Orissa Andhra Border Zonal Committee of the banned CPI (Maoist).         
	A senior intelligence officer from the region echoed Sahu, saying Maoist cadres from Malkangiri district might have been used in the Dantewada attack as foot soldiers.         
	They (the Maoists) have no border. There is every possibility that rebel cadres from border areas of Orissa participated in the Dantewada operation, said T.J. Jacob, deputy inspector-general of the CRPF group centre at Bhubaneswar.        
	However, state director of intelligence Prakash Mishra, who was in Visakhapatnam to meet the police personnel injured in Sundays landmine blast in Koraput, said he had no such information. I dont have any intelligence input in this regard, he told The Telegraph.

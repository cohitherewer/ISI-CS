	New Delhi, Jan. 11: A Rajasthan High Court ban on elections at teachers bodies today drew expressions of surprise from a Supreme Court bench when an appeal against the order came up for hearing.        
	How can the high court give such a ruling? Chief Justice of India (CJI) K.G. Balakrishnan asked.        
	The Rajasthan University Teachers Association has challenged the high courts May 2005 order, arguing it violates teachers fundamental right to form associations. The high court had also banned elections at students unions, which, too, the teachers association has challenged.        
	While banning teachers elections in the state, the high court had said teachers were nowadays interested only in politics and not in teaching. The CJI hinted that mechanisms already existed to discipline erring teachers.        
	They (the teachers) are employees, and the college can always take action against them as employees. They are on the staff of the university. There is the vice-chancellor to proceed against them, the CJI said.        
	With the student election ban, the high court was taking a step ahead of what the Supreme Court has mandated for the entire country  that students union elections be held according to the stringent guidelines laid down by former chief election commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh.        
	The apex court has endorsed Lyngdohs guidelines, which aim at curbing the influence of money and muscle power in campus polls, instead of banning student elections.        
	Referring to Lyngdoh in this context, the Supreme Court today said even these guidelines could not be extended to teachers elections. Teachers and students cannot be treated on the same footing, the CJI said.

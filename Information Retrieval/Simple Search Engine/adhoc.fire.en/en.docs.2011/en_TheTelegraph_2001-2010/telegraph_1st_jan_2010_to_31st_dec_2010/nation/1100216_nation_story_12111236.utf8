	New Delhi, Feb. 15: Defence minister A.K. Antony today said the army was strengthening its presence in the Northeast along the border with China but India was not a war-mongering country.        
	Antony confirmed for the first time that the army was raising two new mountain divisions in the Northeast, specifically for Arunachal Pradesh, a move resented in China.        
	The two divisions being raised were not against China but is part of an overall policy to strengthen the apparatus of the army.        
	We have to be on guard and ensure that our armed forces are an effective deterrent, he said.         
	The confirmation today from Antony added to the perception that much of Indias planned large-scale arms purchases were driven by New Delhis wariness of Chinas growing military might. Antony has himself admitted in the past that across the boundary, Chinas border infrastructure was superior to Indias.        
	The minister was speaking at a news conference in Defexpo 2010, Asias largest arms bazaar, that he opened this morning, and was watched by representatives of military hardware and software companies from across the world.        
	A division has between 15,000-17,000 in the plains but a mountain division is larger. Last June, Arunachal governor and former army chief, General (retired) J.J. Singh said India was adding about 50,000 troops in the Northeast.        
	As a general policy, our government is trying to be friendly with all our neighbours. With China also, in many areas our relations are improving, he explained when asked about the reinforcing of the army in Arunachal.        
	We will not take an inch of soil from any country but we will also not give away an inch of soil. We are strengthening our armed forces to act as an effective deterrent, he said.        
	Earlier, opening the exhibition, the minister said the Indian economy was slated to grow by 8 to 10 per cent. Defence expenditure was between 2.3 and 2.5 per cent of the GDP. Capital expenditure on defence acquisitions will rise proportionately.         
	In the last five years alone, he said, capital expenditure on defence was more than double the amount spent in the previous five years.        
	Antony said that along with an amended defence procurement policy (DPP) in about two months, the government was also crafting a defence production policy that would encourage greater participation by Indian companies in defence acquisitions.         
	Currently, more than 70 per cent of Indian defence acquisitions is through imports.         
	According to one industry estimate, Indian defence purchases in the decade till 2020 could top $100 billion.

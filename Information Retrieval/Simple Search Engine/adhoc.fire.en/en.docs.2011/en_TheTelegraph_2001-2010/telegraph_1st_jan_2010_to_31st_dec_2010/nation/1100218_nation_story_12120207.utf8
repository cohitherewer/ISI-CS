	Patna, Feb. 17: Apparently cautious about the pros and cons of the Centres tough stand on Maoists in what is an election year for him, Nitish Kumar has adopted a different approach to tackle the problem.         
	The Bihar chief minister, who did not deliberately attend the meeting convened by Union home minister P. Chidambaram in Calcutta recently, said: I am opposed to the use of force against Maoists. Development and democracy at the grassroots level are the ways to tackle the Maoists.        
	Nitish described as unfortunate the rebel raid on the Silda police camp in neighbouring Bengal that left 24 jawans dead. In such a situation, the state machinery must respond in the manner prescribed by law, he added.         
	Explaining for the first time his deliberate decision to boycott Chidambarams meeting on Operation Greenhunt, Nitish said: The state should take care of human rights first.        
	He described corruption and failure of the system to deliver the benefits of the development at the grassroots level as principal causes of the problem. Our government has introduced a special court act, which will go a long way in curbing corruption in bureaucracy and giving relief to the people from corruption which is at the root of alienation.        
	The chief ministers soft-stand towards Maoists is believed to be a part of his overall strategy not to antagonise rebels  or their supporters  operating in over 22 of Bihars 38 districts, that too in an election year. In fact, senior CPI(Maoist) leader Kishenji has profusely thanked Nitish for not singing in tune with Chidambaram.        
	About the rebel leader showering praise on him, Nitish was quite measured in his response. I believe in democracy. We are sparing no effort to bring the alienated section of society to the mainstream. After all, the rebels, too, are people. We must try to go into the genesis of why they have taken up arms.        
	Rather than responding positively to Chindambarams idea of dealing with the rebels, Nitish offered his own model to end the crisis.         
	We have carried out a sarkar aap ke dwar (government at your doorstep) programme in 67 panchayats primarily representing very poor people. This means I take myself and the government machinery at peoples doorsteps to solve their grievances. But the Centre is not co-operating by providing us funds, he said adding that the Centre should hold similar programmes in all Maoist-hit states instead of using force.        
	Barring the Jamui and Munger regions on the Bihar-Jharkhand border and railway property on Lakhisarai-Patna-Gaya sections, a large part of the state has remained relatively free from Maoist terror in the past four years.        
	May be that explains Nitishs stand. In fact, he is the first chief minister in the past two decades to address public meetings at places like Imamganj and Dumaria in Gaya district, a rebel stronghold.

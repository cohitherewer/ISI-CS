          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                                                    Madhab Chandra Dey and Nirmal Mondal      
	Calcutta, July 19: North 24-Parganas is struggling to come to terms with todays train crash  both drivers of the Uttar Banga Express who died after their engine rammed into the Vananchal Express are from the district near Calcutta.        
	Madhab Chandra Dey, 58, was from Kaugachhi in Barrackpore, while his assistant, Nirmal Kumar Mondal, 40, hailed from Barasats Nawpara.         
	For a while, their families and neighbours couldnt believe what had hit them.        
	Deys wife Kalpana has still not been informed about his death. She is a cancer patient and probably wont be able to bear the shock. She has only been told that her husband has suffered injuries in an accident. His three daughters, all of them married, were informed by Deys colleagues. The daughters then told the neighbours.        
	We are shocked to hear the news of Madhabdas death. Madhabda was very popular in the area and an active member of our local club despite his age, said Arun Saha, a local resident. We told Kalpana that he was injured. We also told her that Madhabdas eldest daughter Juthika and his sons-in-law have gone to the accident spot, Saha added.         
	Madhab had left for duty on Saturday evening. The daughters recalled him lodging a complaint about his faulty landline phone from an adjacent STD booth just before he went. He was scheduled to return home this afternoon.        
	Madhabdas daughters and their husbands came to the house this morning and informed Kalpana that he has been injured in the accident. The two younger daughters, Munmun and Soma, stayed back at the house to look after their mother, said a member of the Jagarani Club of which Dey was a member.         
	The picture wasnt different at Mondals home in Barasat. Neighbours of the assistant driver wondered how such a cautious and careful man could die in an accident.         
	Nirmal was very cautious and careful. He even avoided sitting beside the driver in autorickshaws or hanging on the footboards of buses. It is difficult to believe that he can make mistakes in his job that might lead to such a tragic accident, said Arup Samanta, a relative of Nirmal in Nawpara.        
	Officials of Eastern Railway informed Mondals wife Ratna about his death around 7.30am, about six hours after the crash in Birbhums Sainthia. Ratna is an assistant teacher at Bira Girls High School in nearby Ashoknagar. The couple have two children  son Rajarshi, 9, and daughter Srestha, 3.        
	According to family members, Nirmal had last spoken to Ratna on Saturday evening from Malda and told her that he would be returning this afternoon. Mondals brother Bikash has gone to the accident spot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Antony seeks cyber shield
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Antony seeks cyber shield
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 16: Defence minister A.K. Antony today asked the armed forces to prepare an action plan to counter cyber-attacks, about a week after Canadian and US experts exposed the infiltration of computers in India by hackers from China.        
	Antony, addressing the Unified Commanders Conference here, said that while the defence services have taken steps to counter cyber-threats, there is still a requirement to ensure that all loopholes are suitably plugged.        
	Extraordinary and unprecedented cyber-crimes have taken place across the globe, Antony said. A few recent cases are reminders of our own vulnerabilities. Close interaction with national agencies ... to prepare a crisis management action plan for countering cyber-attacks and cyber-terrorism is essential, he told the conference attended by the top brass of the armed forces, including the three service chiefs.         
	Last week, a Canadian-US cyber-security team had reported its discovery of a sophisticated cyber-espionage operation that had succeeded in infiltrating 35 computers in India, some of them in high security establishments.         
	The operations staged by Chengdu in China had picked personal and financial information of officials, and documents from sensitive offices like the National Security Council Secretariat and military offices.         
	Indian cyber-security specialists have said computers with sensitive information should not be, and are unlikely to be, linked to an open network. However, certain practices such as remotely reading office email from free networks or carrying files from secure computers to personal computers through email or discs may increase the vulnerability of a cyber-attack.         
	Antony called for close interaction between national agencies such as the Computer and Emergency Response team, the National Technical Research Organisation and the ministries of home, defence, and information technology.

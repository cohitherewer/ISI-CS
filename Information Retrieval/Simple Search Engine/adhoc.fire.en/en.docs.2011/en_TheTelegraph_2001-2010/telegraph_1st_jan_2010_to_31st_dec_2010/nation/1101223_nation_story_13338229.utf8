The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Raja quiz on Christmas Eve
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Raja quiz on Christmas Eve
          G.C. SHEKHAR AMP; PTI                              
	Chennai, Dec. 22: A. Raja will appear before the CBI on Friday for questioning over the alleged 2G spectrum scam.        
	I will appear before the CBI on December 24 at 10am. I will appear for interrogation, the former telecom minister told reporters on arrival in Delhi tonight.        
	Hours back, the DMK leader had declared in Chennai that he would co-operate with the CBI. Ive informed the CBI that Ill be in Delhi for the next two days and co-operate with them. I had made the request for (appearance) December 24 to the CBI and they have accepted it, he said before leaving for the airport.        
	The 47-year-old leader will be the most high-profile figure to be questioned in the 2G scam by the CBI, which had been asked by the Supreme Court why he was not been summoned for grilling. The apex court has asked the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate to submit probe reports by February 10, the next hearing date.        
	Corporate lobbyist Niira Radia, who came under the scanner after her taped telephone conversations with industrialists, politicians and journalists became public, was quizzed yesterday at her south Delhi house for four hours.        
	Former Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) chairman Pradip Baijal, has also been questioned in connection with the case. The CBI searched the premises of Raja, Baijal and Radia earlier this month.        
	The DMK, however, has thrown its weight behind Raja. It will launch a weeklong campaign in Tamil Nadu highlighting its point that Raja has committed no wrong and has been a victim of a conspiracy to malign him.         
	The campaign will also touch on the past corruption allegations against rival Jayalalithaa, who has attacked the ruling DMK over the 2G scam.         
	DMK chief M. Karunanidhi has defended Raja. In return, Raja has reportedly promised his boss that in the worst-case scenario, he would take the final rap and ensure no member of the Karunanidhi family would be affected.        
	Karunanidhi has reiterated that the party will punish Raja only if he is convicted. Politically, at least, Raja appears safe till then.

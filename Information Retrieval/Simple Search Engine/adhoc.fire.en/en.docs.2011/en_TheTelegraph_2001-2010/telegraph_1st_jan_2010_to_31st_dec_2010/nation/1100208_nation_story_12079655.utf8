The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Britain tightens student   entry rules
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Britain tightens student   entry rules
                                  
	London, Feb. 7: (PTI) Britain has announced new measures to cut the number of student visas and prevent abuse of its immigration system, days after the issue of such visas was suspended for north Indian students.        
	Home secretary Alan Johnson, who outlined the measures, said Britain would continue to welcome genuine foreign students, but would come down heavily on those who used student visas to come mainly for work. We remain open to those foreign students who want to come to the UK for legitimate study  they remain welcome. But those who are not seriously interested in coming here to study but come primarily to work  they should be in no doubt that we will come down hard on those that flout the rules, Johnson said.        
	Under the new measures, applicants from India and other countries outside the European Union will have to meet higher English language requirements. Students taking courses below degree level will be allowed to work for only 10 hours a week instead of 20 at present. Those doing courses under six months will not be allowed to bring in dependants, while the dependants of students in courses below degree level will not be allowed to work. Visas to students for pursuing courses below degree level will be granted only if the institutions they attend figure in a new register, which is known as the Highly Trusted Sponsors List.        
	 Ministers believe the new rules  to be introduced before the general election this summer  will slash the numbers by tens of thousands. Around 2.4 lakh student visas were issued in 2008-09.

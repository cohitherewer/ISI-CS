The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Random test on cell tower
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Random test on cell tower
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 31 (PTI): The government will start random testing of mobile towers from next month and has proposed a huge penalty in case norms are flouted.         
	The decision comes in the wake of reports pointing to a clear link between ailments and strong radiation emanating from mobile towers.        
	Nationwide random testing of radiation emitted by mobile towers will commence from November 16, 2010, by the department of telecom. The operators not complying with the defined norms will be punished, minister of state for telecom and IT Sachin Pilot said.        
	The minister recently held a meeting with telecom companies and other stakeholders and ordered self-certification of radiation levels for all towers by the telecom companies by November 15, 2010.        
	The companies were asked to submit the certificates to the telecom engineering and resource monitoring cells by November 15, 2010.        
	Pilot had earlier warned the companies that non-compliance would mean a fine and penalty of Rs 5 lakh for each mobile tower.        
	The electromagnetic emissions from mobile towers in India are governed by guidelines drawn from the recommendations of the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection.        
	Telecom operators contend that there is no link between disease and radiation from telecom towers, citing studies by scientific bodies such as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a premier medical research organisation.        
	The telecom operators, through industry lobbies Cellular Operators Association of India and the Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India, have written to the telecom department downplaying the fear of disease because of the radiations.         
	But the government is not convinced. Congress leader Manish Tiwari had recently called for a scientific study on the health hazards of radiation from mobile towers.        
	The stakes are big, as the demand for passive telecom network infrastructure, such as towers, is expected to spike, especially when telecom operators are in the process of rolling out third-generation (3G) services.         
	Several telecom tower operators have emerged in India over the past few years. Among the largest companies is Indus Towers, a joint venture between Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, and Idea Cellular, with over 1 lakh towers. GTL Infrastructure and Reliance Infratel are other major players in the telecom tower business.

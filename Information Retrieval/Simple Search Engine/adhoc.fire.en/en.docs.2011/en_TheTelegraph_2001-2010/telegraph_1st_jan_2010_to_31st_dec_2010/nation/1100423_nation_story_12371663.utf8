The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Not a tax raid
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Not a tax raid
                                          
	Q: What did the income-tax department do on Wednesday?        
	A: It conducted a surveyat the offices of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Gameplan Sports Private Limited as part of its nation-wide probe into the ownership and funding patterns of the IPL franchises        
	Q: Was it a raid?        
	A: No, it was just a survey. In a raid, the homes of a companys key officials too are searched. A survey is restricted to business establishments        
	Q: What did the survey find?        
	A: Too early to say because income-tax officials are yet to examine the seized documents in detail. Some key papers, such as those of the KKR-CAB (Cricket Association of Bengal) and Gameplan-KKR deals, are yet to reach the department        
	Q: What is the department doing to get these papers?        
	A: It has asked for details of the KKR-CAB deal for the year 2010 to be sent from the KKRs Mumbai offices. Gameplan too has been asked to produce the papers of its deal with the KKR        
	Q: Has the department issued summons?        
	A: Yes, while wrapping up its survey on Wednesday night, it issued summons to both the KKR and Gameplan, asking them to turn up and clarify their positions on the surveys findings. I-T insiders say that after a survey or raid, the company officials are usually given a chance to state their position, usually through their lawyers. Therefore the summons        
	Q: Did anyone turn up in reply to the summons?        
	A: Yes. Representatives from both companies turned up on Thursday and sought time. So, they were asked to appear again on Monday. In the meantime, income-tax bosses in Calcutta will collect information from Mumbai about the KKR        
	Q: What has emerged so far about the KKRs holding pattern?        
	A: The company is registered as Knight Riders Sports Private Limited with its two offices in Mumbais Churchgate and Khar areas. It appears that Shah Rukh Khan owns about 55 per cent of the stake in the company in his name. The rest is owned by Jay Mehta, owner of Sea Island Investments Limited, a Mauritius-based company         
	Q: What about the Calcutta operations?        
	A: The KKR operated from a makeshift office at the Eden and elsewhere only when its matches were on. The rest of the work would be done by officials from Gameplan         
	Q: How much did the KKR pay the CAB?        
	A: Apparently, Rs 50 lakh per match. The CAB appears to have already received most of the payment for the seven matches played at the Eden

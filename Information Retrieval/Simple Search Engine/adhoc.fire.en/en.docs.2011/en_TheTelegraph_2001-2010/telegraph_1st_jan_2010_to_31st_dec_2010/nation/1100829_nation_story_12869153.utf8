          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: Defence minister A.K. Antony is set to order a fresh probe into the case of a 29-year-old army officer whose death was passed off as a suicide but four years on is suspected to be a murder.        
	Captain Sumit Kohlis body was found in his camp in Kupwara, North Kashmir, on April 30 2006 Four months before that, on Republic Day, he was awarded the Shaurya Chakra for a conspicuous act of gallantry in the line of duty.        
	His mother, Veena Kohli, and her lawyer, Major (retired) Guneet Choudhury, met Antony today after obtaining case documents through an order of Delhi High Court.        
	The documents show that it was impossible that Sumit had committed suicide. The defence minister has told us he will order another investigation after reviewing the papers, Choudhury said after the meeting. He claimed the post-mortem report on Sumit did not tally with the report of the regimental medical officer.        
	An army court of inquiry had concluded that Sumit shot himself with his service weapon, an AK-47.

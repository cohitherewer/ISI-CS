  - HRD ministry faces budget shortfall under 65:35 ratio of cash-sharing        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                  
	New Delhi, April 12: Human resource development ministry sources have questioned the plea by several state governments that they are too cash-strapped to contribute their share to the implementation of the right to education law.        
	These sources say the states may actually have to spend less than they are doing now, and that its the HRD ministry that needs a steep hike in funds allocation to meet its commitments under the law.        
	The states that are crying they dont have the money for the landmark law drew flak from HRD minister Kapil Sibal last week.         
	If the state says it does not want to contribute, the message to the people of the state is that they are not interested in education, Sibal, who is visiting Australia and New Zealand, told a news agency in Melbourne.        
	India is banking on the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Mid Day Meal (MDM) schemes to serve as the vehicles to implement the right to education law, under which children between 6 and 14 years can demand free schooling.        
	The centrally run National University for Educational Planning and Administration has estimated that the Centre and state governments will together need to spend Rs 171,000 crore on implementing the law over the next five years.        
	Under this estimate  which the HRD ministry has accepted  annual public expenditure on implementing the law is expected to be about Rs 34,000 crore.        
	The Centre and states now share the SSA funding in a 55:45 ratio. But the HRD ministry wants the Centre and states to share the right-to-education costs in a 65:35 ratio, and plans to approach the cabinet soon. The Centre will bear 90 per cent of the financial burden for the northeastern states.        
	If the 65:35 ratio is accepted, the Centre will need to allocate Rs 22,100 crore annually on an average to meet its commitments. But under the 2010-11 budget, the HRD ministry has received Rs 14,433 crore for the SSA and the MDM together  an outlay short by over Rs 7,600 crore.        
	In contrast, the effective financial burden on the states over the next five years is likely to ease, although individual states facing an overall financial crisis may struggle to meet their commitments, according to data with HRD ministry officials.        
	The states will together need to plough in Rs 11,900 crore a year on an average to meet their 35 per cent commitment. But they will be assisted in this by a Finance Commission grant of Rs 25,000 crore over five years, or Rs 5,000 crore annually on an average.        
	Therefore, the average amount the states will together need to allocate annually will come down to about Rs 6,900 crore. They spent about Rs 8,000 crore together in 2009-10 on the SSA and MDM schemes, according to top HRD ministry officials.        
	By demanding that the Centre bear a burden of more than 65 per cent, states basically want to spend even less than they currently are spending, a senior HRD ministry official said.

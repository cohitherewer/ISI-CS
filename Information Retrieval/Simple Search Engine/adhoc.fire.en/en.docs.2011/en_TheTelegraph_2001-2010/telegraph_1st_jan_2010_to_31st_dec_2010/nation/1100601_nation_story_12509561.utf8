	New Delhi. May 31: The department of food and public distribution under Sharad Pawar has ordered the Food Corporation of India to allow states to lift foodgrains for the mid-day meal scheme without demanding prior payment.           
	The order has resolved for this year a potential crisis over shortage of foodgrains for the scheme over upcoming months. But the crisis could be repeated next year, as the dispute that triggered it remains unresolved. The FCI has over the few years repeatedly demanded that it be paid by the human resource development ministry prior to the release of foodgrains to the states. But the finance arms of the government have on each occasion demanded the release of foodgrains before any payment is made.           
	The mid-day meal is the worlds single largest scheme to feed school children.                   
	 Thiruvananthapuram (PTI): The Centre has said that even if any of the victims of the May 22 Air India Express crash at Mangalore carried a fake passport, their family would receive compensation, according to Kerala Congress leader Oommen Chandy.                   
	Bhopal (PTI): A bomb squad searched the Indore-Jammu Tawi Malwa Express at Dewas and Ujjain railway stations on Saturday after police received an anonymous call saying a passenger was carrying explosives. It turned out to be a hoax.                  
	 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): The family of a rape victim allegedly paraded the brother of the accused on the streets after beating him and cutting off his hair, police said. The boys family later filed a complaint.                  
	Jammu (PTI): Heavy snowfall on May 28 and 29 has resulted in the death of about 3,000 livestock in the upper reaches of Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir, a senior officer said. Two teams of police and civil administration are being sent to assess the damage caused by the untimely snowfall.

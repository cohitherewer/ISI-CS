	London, March 14: Swraj Paul, who was investigated by police over his expenses, has repaid the controversial 38,000 that was at the centre of the probe.        
	Paul, a major Labour party donor, was told by Scotland Yard last week that he will not face charges over his expenses claims. However, he now faces a House of Lords investigation into his conduct by a subcommittee chaired by Baroness Manningham-Buller, the former head of MI5.        
	Political sources have revealed that Paul  who is one of Britains richest men and worth an estimated 500 million  has quietly and voluntarily repaid the 38,000.        
	The peer has admitted that he never spent a single night at an Oxfordshire flat that he registered as his main home while claiming money in overnight expenses for a London property.        
	Opposition MPs seized on the move on Saturday night as an admission that the expenses were not justified.        
	Graham Stuart, the Conservative MP for Beverley and Holderness, said: Lord Paul has been shamed into returning the money he should never have claimed in the first place.         
	Stuart has written to Downing Street seeking answers to four questions about Paul, including what led to the Labour peer being appointed to the Privy Council last year  a status which entitles the peer to use the words the right honourable in front of his name.         
	Paul, the Indian-born steel tycoon, also disclosed last week that he was giving up his tax-advantageous position as a non dom  a status used by Labour politicians to attack a Tory peer and deputy chairman.        
	Non doms do not have to pay tax on their overseas earnings.        
	Paul has denied breaking the law or acting improperly despite having never staying at what he called his main home. Its true I never slept there. But it was available. I submitted the claim and I gave the flat as my address because I have it as a place to stay. The question is, what are the rules? I know that I have followed the rules, he had said in the past.         
	A spokesperson for the peer declined to comment on the repayment of the 38,000.        
	However, his supporters deny any admission of guilt and say the money was repaid in the hope of drawing a line under the affair.        
	It is understood to have been repaid well before last weeks announcements relating to the police and House of Lords inquiries.        
	Paul has donated, through his company, more than 400,000 to the Labour party.        
	He also gave 45,000 to Gordon Browns leadership campaign, as well as buying 6,000 copies of the Prime Ministers book Courage to distribute to secondary schools.        
	Brown has publicly referred to the peer as a great friend and a great businessman.        
	On Thursday, three Labour MPs and a Tory peer appeared in court to face charges over their expenses.         
	On Friday, Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, attacked House of Lords officials for making it impossible to bring charges against another Labour peer, Baroness Uddin, over her expenses. He said the rules were too lax.

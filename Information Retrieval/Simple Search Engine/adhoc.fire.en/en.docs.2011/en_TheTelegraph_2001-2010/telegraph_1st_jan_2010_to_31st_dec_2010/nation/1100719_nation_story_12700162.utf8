The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Admission flaw spares IISERs a headache
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Admission flaw spares IISERs a headache
          G.S. MUDUR                              Ashwini Nangia (left) and Charanjit Aulakh				                                 
	New Delhi, July 18: The controversial cut-off marks set by the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER) may have prevented thousands of high-scoring students from applying, but they seem to have given the institutes themselves one apparent advantage.        
	These cut-offs kept the number of applications small.        
	That the institutes would see this as an advantage was clear from a remark by the head of their joint admission committee (JAC), Swapan Datta, who said even the 900 applications received for the five IISERs 300 seats was a headache.        
	Datta said the institutes had limited capacity for handling applications and added: As it is, we are having a headache arranging for (the screening of) the nearly 900 students.        
	The headache remark has surprised physics professor Charanjit Aulakh, who with fellow academic Ashwini Nangia, had exposed the flaws in the way the institutes set the cut-offs for applications, as reported in The Telegraph on Saturday.        
	The IISERs have accorded higher priority to keeping the number of applicants for their screening test (held today) as low as possible than to be fair to all top-scoring students, said Aulakh, who teaches at Panjab University, Chandigarh. Many universities routinely conduct entrance exams for thousands of students with far inferior resources.        
	Institutions such as the Centre for Basic Sciences, Mumbai, and the National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, he said, conduct an entrance exam where about 20,000 students apply for 110 seats.        
	The IISERs need to look at this for next years students and for themselves. Arbitrary rules like these will hurt their own image, said Nangia, a chemistry professor at the University of Hyderabad.        
	The IISERs in Bhopal, Calcutta, Mohali, Pune and Thiruvananthapuram, which are offering a five-year, integrated masters course in science from this year, had allowed students to apply on the basis of their Class XII board exam marks.        
	But they used the top one per cent scores from the 2009 board exams  separately for each board  as cut-offs for applications in 2010 without distinguishing between arts, commerce and science streams.         
	The use of the one per cent cut-off from 2009 results to accept applications for 2010, without correcting for year-to-year fluctuations of up to five per cent in the same boards, is unscientific, Nangia said.        
	Its like trying to measure an amoeba using a six-inch scale, he said. You cant do it. Given the fluctuations within the boards, a three per cent cut-off instead of a fine one per cent would have been scientifically acceptable.        
	A three per cent cut-off would take the year-to-year fluctuations into account but may have flooded the IISERs with thousands of more applications.        
	Aulakh and Nangia  both of whom have a daughter who graduated from Class XII in the science stream this year say the fuss they have kicked up over the cut-offs isnt personal. Nangias daughter has secured admission at BITS, Hyderabad, and Aulakhs daughter, the science topper in the Chandigarh tricity results, has joined a microbiology course at Panjab Univer- sity.        
	JAC head Datta said the institutes could not afford to wait for the 2010 marks. But even with the 2010 marks, students of some boards would have lost out (for instance, if the top commerce students scored very high in that board in 2010) while those from other boards would have benefited (if, say, the marks were higher in 2010 than last year).        
	Datta, however, said: Overall, it still balances out from the IISERs point of view. For the individual student, naturally, it may seem unfair.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Summer heat on Maoists
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Summer heat on Maoists
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, March 6: Jharkhand has intensified anti-Maoist manoeuvres with the onset of the ideal early summer season, buoyed by joint planning with Bengal and a more than doubling of its central paramilitary battalions.        
	Full-fledged operations are expected to begin in the coming weeks, especially if the rebels fail to accept the Centres suggestion to lay down arms and start peace talks, senior police officers said.        
	The onset of summer is the ideal time to launch operations in areas covered by dense forests, an inspector-general said. Visibility is good and air surveillance fetches better results. There are also a lot of dry leaves on the ground which make a lot of noise when someone walks over them at night.        
	Jharkhand, where five central paramilitary battalions were stationed so far, has now received six more and is expecting a 12th soon. The BSF too has agreed to open a sector office in the hinterland state.        
	State director-general of police Neyaz Ahmed confirmed to The Telegraph that internal operations had begun. Dont ask me to name the places where these operations are being carried out. We are using our available resources, he said.        
	The latest crackdown began after the police forces of Jharkhand and Bengal agreed to carry out joint operations. Deputy inspectors-general from both states recently met in Jamshedpur and Purulia to discuss joint action. The Jamshedpur meeting was held about a fortnight ago and the Purulia talks in the middle of this week.        
	Sources said the offensive was focused on Red zones like Saranda, the Bengal border near Ghatshila in East Singhbhum, sensitive pockets in Latehar, Lohardaga and Gumla districts, Jhumra Pahar in Bokaro district, Giridih and Chatra.        
	Officers said the rebels and the security forces had sized each other up during the negotiated release of Dalbhumgarh BDO Prashant Kumar Layek, whom the Maoists had kidnapped.        
	We had surrounded Layeks abductors and the only fear was that the hostage could have been killed in the operation, an inspector-general said. The government struck a deal with the abductors but did not accept their unjustified demands.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Maoist jab in House, Mamata defenceless
          J.P. YADAV                              
	New Delhi, April 15: Not one of the Trinamul Congresss 21 MPs was present in Parliament today to defend Mamata Banerjee when the Opposition dubbed her a half-Maoist during a discussion on the Dantewada attack.        
	The only party MP present in Delhi, member from Hooghly Ratna De Nag, reached Parliament for a brief while but left after a visit to the library. The rest were busy with Bengali New Year celebrations back home or were campaigning for the coming civic polls in the state, party sources said.        
	The leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley, alleged there were half-Maoists on the treasury benches, alluding to Mamatas demand to call off the joint operation in Bengal and her assertion that there are no Maoists in the state.        
	The CPMs Basudev Acharya, too, accused Mamata of being hand in glove with the Maoists. In the past, such allegations had triggered ruckus in the House but today, not one of the partys 19 Lok Sabha members and two Rajya Sabha members were present to hit back.        
	Trinamul chief whip Sudip Bandopadhyay claimed party MPs had decided to skip Parliament for three days to protest the attack on two party ministers, Mukul Roy and Sultan Ahmed, in Bengal yesterday.        
	Two of our Union ministers were attacked by CPM goons. So we have decided to abstain from Parliament for three days in protest against the CPMs state-sponsored terrorism, Bandopadhyay said over the phone.        
	Some other Trinamul members, however, appeared ignorant of any such decision to abstain from the House.        
	When contacted, junior rural development minister and Kanthi MP Sisir Adhikari said he was busy with party work and would reach Delhi tomorrow. I had informed (the party leadership) that I would not be available. I dont know whether other party MPs attended Parliament, he said.        
	De Nag, too, did not mention any decision to abstain from Parliament. I did not attend the Lok Sabha. I went to the Parliament library to collect a book, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tatas allege pipe bias   in Bengal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tatas allege pipe bias   in Bengal
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                    
	New Delhi, July 16: The Tatas have complained to the Bengal government that a pipe-making joint venture they set up in the state last year is being unfairly denied civic orders because of conditions tailored to favour a Calcutta rival.        
	The municipalities Tata Metaliks Kubota Pipes Ltd has named include the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and others won in the May civic polls by the Trinamul Congress, blamed for driving the Tatas Nano project out of Bengal.        
	Kubota Corporation is a $12-billion Japanese firm specialising in making ductile pipes. The joint venture factory, set up at a cost of Rs 200 crore, is located in West Midnapores Kharagpur.        
	The rules that Tata Metaliks Kubota claims are loaded against it were framed much before, but the company will now have to negotiate with many Trinamul-run civic bodies to have its grievances addressed.        
	Bengals annual requirement of such pipes is between 35,000 and 50,000 tonnes. In value terms, the orders could be worth Rs 125 crore to Rs 150 crore.         
	 These kind of restrictive clauses are not there in tenders in other states... we have invested in this plant in Bengal and provide direct employment to 400 persons, Tata Metaliks Kubota MD Rajesh Mishra said in a letter to Subrata Gupta, managing director of the state-run West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC).        
	The key restrictive clause, according to the Tatas, is the one that requires a potential supplier to have three or more years of experience. Tata officials claim only one manufacturer, a Calcutta-based company, meets the condition.        
	Kubota has 50 years experience in making such pipes but somehow the Bengal municipalities, led by the CMC, do not take that into account. They only want to know the age of our joint venture, a company official said.        
	Other than the CMC, the municipalities which the Tatas feel have applied such restrictive clauses are those in Durgapur, Khirpai, Kharar, Gayeshpur and Gurulia.         
	Durgapur is with the Left  there was no election there in May  as are Khirpai and Gayeshpur. The Kharar civic body was won by the Trinamul, while the one in Garulia is now run by the Trinamul and the Congress together.         
	Even tenders of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, which builds several city infrastructure facilities, have such clauses.         
	The Tatas claim their rival  the letter to the WBIDC does not name the company  have been influencing the municipalities to draw up tender terms in such a manner that their firm is automatically eliminated in the bid evaluation stage.        
	The Tatas have said several other riders in the tenders are outdated.        
	Mishra, the Tata Metaliks Kubota MD, warns in his letter that the problems being faced by his firm could impact other Japanese investments in Bengal.        
	We request you to advise the government bodies of the state (the municipalities) to remove these restrictive clauses so as to allow us to participate in future tenders, Mishra has said in his letter.        
	The company insists it is not possible for any new pipe-maker to meet such requirements. It also points put that there are only four manufacturers of the pipes in the country.         
	One of those is in Andhra which, it says, is a group firm of the Calcutta company.

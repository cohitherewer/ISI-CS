The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amar whines on big brother Bachchan in blog 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Amar whines on big brother Bachchan in blog 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Amar Singh                                  
	New Delhi, July 3: Amitabh Bachchans snub to Amar Singh has prompted a loud lament from the former Samajwadi Party general secretary.         
	In his latest blog on July 1, posted shortly after Big Bs rebuff, Amar wrote: The threads that make up a relationship are so delicate that to keep these intact somebody has to bend and if not, snap them. Whoever is older and abler has to be accommodative.         
	For the first time, Amar threatened to spill out family secrets. He hinted that Jaya Bachchan was pressured by Amitabh to turn down the Samajwadi Party offer of a Rajya Sabha seat and wondered why he had done it at the peril of disrupting his familys peace for his (Amars) sake.         
	The word from the Samajwadi Party was that Jaya was keen on the renomination which is why, unlike fellow actress, Jaya Prada, also a Samajwadi MP, she did not quit the party after Amars expulsion.         
	It was said that Samajwadi president Mulayam Singh Yadav had sounded Jaya out on the Rajya Sabha seat after speaking to Amitabh. Later after a meeting with Amar, Jaya rejected the offer.         
	Amitabh is nearly 10 years senior to Amar but failed to live up to the latters expectation when they happened to be vacationing in London at the same time around last month.         
	When Amar, his wife and their twin daughters checked into St James Court hotel  which he described as an adda of holidaying Indians they learnt that the Bachchans were in an apartment next to theirs. Amar informed Amitabh ostensibly in a text message.         
	His prompt reply to me was I am leaving for Mumbai today. Well, by telling him that I was in London, I fulfilled my responsibility, Amar said.         
	That neither was aware of the others visit to London is a surprise considering that Amar, the Bachchans and Anil and Tina Ambani were a cosy extended family for years and perhaps spent weeks together in London and other places.                   Amitabh Bachan      
	Amars anguish was discernible when he wrote of his daughters wanting to know if taiji (Jaya Bachchan) and Shweta didi (their daughter) were staying next door. I kept mum. Whats the point of telling them that taiji is now with Mulayam Singh Yadav and perhaps in the company of his son, Akhilesh and his wife, Dimple somewhere in London? Politics can be impossible.         
	He underlined the bizzare ways of politics while recounting a meeting he had with the former Labour Party foreign secretary, David Milliband. Amar learnt that David and his brother, Edward Milliband are locked in a contest for the Opposition leaders post. Its not all that surprising considering that power politics does not allow even a devar-bhabhi (brother-in-law and sister-in-law), who are separated by a wall to see each other, he remarked.         
	He alluded to Jaya, who acquired the status of his sister-in-law after Amitabh adopted him as a younger brother following his estrangement from his blood brother, Ajitabh. If only Amitji is aware of this separation. For not standing with me there was a reward in the form of a Rajya Sabha membership, wrote Amar. Why then was she deprived of it? The family would have remained happy. After all, who am I? There was no family (meaning his and the Bachchans), there is no family and there is unlikely to be a family.         
	Amitabhs response came in his blog. The world dwells in perception.... Perception once formed takes an eternity to erase; that is if you want to. Many do not. They sometimes feel that wrong perceptions are meant not to be disturbed.... And I ask today from those of my extended family, is he the wisest that clears perception or he that shoulders the responsibility of it....

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 5: The Centre is considering proposals to fortify the Press Council of India to fight the paid news phenomenon, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni told the Rajya Sabha today.        
	Responding to a calling attention notice on the problem that came into focus in states like Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh in recent elections, Soni termed paid news advertorials masquerading as news stories in favour of candidates  as serious because it influenced medias independent functioning. Candidates unable to buy such influence were blanked out, she alleged.        
	The minister stressed the need to protect peoples right to correct and unbiased information. When paid information is presented as news content, it could mislead the public and hamper their judgement to form a correct opinion.         
	Soni called on politicians and the civil society to reflect on the issue as it has wide-ranging implications for our democratic structure.        
	The BJPs Arun Jaitley, the leader of the Opposition in the Upper House, called the trend bribery of the media. It interdicts the process of free and fair elections. It violates the limits set out by the Election Commission for expenditure in elections. Black money as consideration of paid news violates provisions of the income tax act.        
	Jaitley argued that paid news was not free speech and, therefore, not protected by Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution  which guarantees the right. It can, he said, be restricted by enacting a law that empowers the Election Commission to refer paid news matters to a tribunal headed by a serving judge, and provides for exemplary punishment.        
	The CPMs Sitaram Yechury wanted government ads stopped to those purveying paid news. The press council has set up a sub-committee to look into the issue, and its report is expected by the end of the month. After that, the government is expected to draw up rules giving the council more powers to tackle the problem.

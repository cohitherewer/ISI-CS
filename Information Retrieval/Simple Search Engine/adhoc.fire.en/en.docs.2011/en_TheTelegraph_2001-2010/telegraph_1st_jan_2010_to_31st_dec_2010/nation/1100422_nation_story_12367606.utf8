The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wary of delay, Congress pins hope on Pawar 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Wary of delay, Congress pins hope on Pawar 
          SANJAY K. JHA                      Sharad Pawar                          
	New Delhi, April 21: The Congress leadership appears to be heavily relying on Sharad Pawar to cut IPL commissioner Lalit Modi to size as securing court conviction in financial offences can take years.        
	The government is keen to have some immediate result in the middle of frenzied expectations created by the much-publicised multi-dimensional investigations.        
	Except for administrative action at the IPL level, we should not hope for any immediate punitive action despite a clear case of wrongdoing on the part of Modi, a Congress leader said.        
	While cases like tax evasion and money laundering may yield results after long-winding legal pursuits, getting conviction on betting charges are even more difficult. Betting in cricket is nothing new. Even the CBI probed it. Many players were driven out of the game. But where is a legal conviction? Betting is still rampant, the Congress leader added.        
	The Congress leadership heaved a sigh of relief when Pawar came around and expressed his willingness to act against Modi. The government had to show Pawar evidence contained in the preliminary report of investigations to convince him that Modis case was indefensible.        
	But there was no legal instrument available with the government to sack Modi from the IPL, and Pawars manoeuvring skills were required to set the stage for a face-saver for the government.         
	The hype generated by the government could be viewed as a pressure tactic to get immediate result because avenging Shashi Tharoors exit had almost become necessary as Modis brazen ways were seen as a challenge to the Centre by some sections of the Congress. The government wanted to intensify the pressure and hence raids continued all around.        
	Another senior cabinet minister Farooq Abdullah, who was seen to be sympathetic towards Modi, was worked upon and today he sang a different tune. He emphatically contested suggestions that he was Modis saviour.        
	The government is determined to dig out skeletons in Modis cupboard and go to any extent to bring him to book. But the nature of evidence available so far does not empower the government to either arrest him or file a chargesheet straightaway. Sources said that if Pawar helped at this juncture, the relations between the Congress and the NCP would improve. Pawar himself is under pressure to act as he cannot brush this apparent scam under the carpet barely months before he is scheduled to become the president of the International Cricket Council.        
	Asked if the IPL row had escalated tension between the two allies, a Congress general secretary said: Not at all. The relations will improve and you will see this in a month. Another Congress leader said: Whenever cricket is mentioned, insinuations are made against Pawarsaheb. In his long political career, he might have mentored many people and Modi could be one of them. But that does not mean he will defend Modi against all odds.        
	This is definitely a different tune as the very mention of Pawar used to put Congress leaders in a critical mode. The sympathetic attitude now in evidence was not demonstrated when price rise dominated the public discourse. Congress leaders at all levels had put Pawar in the dock then.        
	It is difficult to say if the Congress has adopted this approach because it may have bitten off more than it can chew but it is certain that fixing Modi will be difficult without Pawars support.        
	In this hazy scenario, some Congress leaders today came up with unusual suggestions. One senior leader said the best way to curtail Modis clout was to end the monopoly of the IPL. Legalise other T20 leagues like the ICL (run by Zee). If the IPLs monopoly ends, even the IPL czars monopoly will end. If you give Modi freedom, he will do what he is best at.        
	Pawar, on the other hand, refused to speculate on Modis future, saying he would be in a position to talk about it with greater clarity only after two days.

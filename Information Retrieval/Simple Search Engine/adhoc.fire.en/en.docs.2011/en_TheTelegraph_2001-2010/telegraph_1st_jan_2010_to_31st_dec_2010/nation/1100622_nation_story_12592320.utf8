The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hyderabad officials in rail scam glare
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hyderabad officials in rail scam glare
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, June 21: The busted railway job scam may have involved recruitment exams in the Mumbai zone but its railway officials in Hyderabad who are likely to feel the heat of the investigations the most.        
	Many serving and former South Central Railway officials are under the scanner for having helped the kingpin, Arun Kumar Jagannatham, run the question-leak racket from Hyderabad for 20 years, CBI sources said.        
	Jagannatham was transferred out of South Central Railway after a question leak in a 1990 exam organised by the Railway Recruitment Board (RRB), Hyderabad, following which he was arrested but had to be let off for apparent want of evidence.        
	But his links with top Andhra Pradesh politicians meant he continued to run the racket from Hyderabad. He had established a network with subordinates and junior assistants in RRB Hyderabad. He operated the ring with the connivance of all senior bosses, a CBI source said.        
	The noose is now likely to tighten on at least half-a-dozen retired South Central Railway officials of the rank of divisional and additional divisional railway manager.        
	Asked who Jagannathams political patrons were, CBI officials said they would reveal everything only after catching the key figure.        
	The railway police and the CBI had probed question paper leaks in the Hyderabad zone in 1990, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008 but failed to touch a hair on Jagannathams head.        
	The candidates who were caught, and the few junior railway officials who were made scapegoats, would all name Jagannatham every time. But each time the trail would have to be abandoned because of high-level political interference, the source said.        
	Jagannatham had begun diversifying his racket to other zonal railways after things temporarily became a little hot for him in Hyderabad in 1997. That year, after investigations into past question leaks, the railways sacked 123 employees appointed through his route.        
	CBI officials said Jagannatham had told interrogators that the chairpersons of eight of Indias 20 RRBs, which conduct the recruitment exams, were in collusion with him. The railways have suspended RRB Mumbai chairperson S.M. Sharma, a Mamata Banerjee appointee, after the racket was busted and Jagannatham was arrested with seven others on Thursday.        
	The CBI sources said Jagannathams gang organised coaching classes for his candidates at several towns a few days before the exams. Some 500 were coached in Sholapur and Nagpur for the June 6 and 13 exams, whose question leaks had led to the racket being busted. Some 150 of the candidates were allegedly from Andhra, 50 from Bengal and 200 from Karnataka.        
	Earlier, coaching classes had been held in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Anantpur, Warangal, Tirupati, Mangalore, Hassan, Mysore, Hubli and Bellary, a source said.        
	The gang apparently hired a fleet of Volvo buses and booked at least 50 hotel rooms for the classes. They made advance bookings, a hotel owner in Hyderabad said, adding he had been facilitating the classes for two years. The tutors, appointed on contract, stayed with the candidates for three to four days at a stretch. The candidates deposited Rs 50,000 in a bank account and paid the rest of the Rs 3-4 lakh in cash, a CBI source said.              
	In South Central Railway circles, the question paper racketeers are known as the Mirjalaguda gang. Jagannatham lived at Mirjalaguda near Malkajgiri in Secunderabad.        
	The gang had agents across eastern India ----- in Bhubaneswar, Calcutta, Ranchi, Patna and Raipur, the venue of Jagannathams previous posting as additional divisional railway manager.

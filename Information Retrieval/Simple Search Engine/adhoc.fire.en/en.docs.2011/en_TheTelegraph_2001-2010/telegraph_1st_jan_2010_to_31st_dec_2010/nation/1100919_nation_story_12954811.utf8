          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept.18: A BSF delegation will visit Dhaka next week for talks with its Bangladesh counterpart as the two forces aim to deepen ties since the Indian side helped defuse the crisis after last years mutiny across the border.         
	While fencing and border management will be the focus, finding ways to control smuggling of fake currency will also be discussed.        
	During the September 22-27 meet, the BSF will also hand over to the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) a list of about 70 Indian insurgents believed to be hiding in Bangladesh. The two delegations will be led by BSF director-general Raman Srivastava and his BDR counterpart Major General Rafiq ul-Islam.         
	The insurgents list includes the names of Jeevan Singh, the chief of the north Bengal-based Kamtapur Liberation Organisation that has links with militant outfits Ulfa and the NDFB. India also believes fugitive Ulfa chief Paresh Barua has travelled to Pakistan on a Bangladeshi passport.         
	The two sides have enjoyed friendly relations since 2006, but the ties deepened after the BDR mutiny when the BSF supported Dhaka.

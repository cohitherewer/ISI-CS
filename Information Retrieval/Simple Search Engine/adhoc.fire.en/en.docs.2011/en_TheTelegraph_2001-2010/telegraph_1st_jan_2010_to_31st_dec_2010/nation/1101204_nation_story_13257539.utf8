The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court lifts bird sanctuary shadow on Maya park 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Court lifts bird sanctuary shadow on Maya park 
                              Mayawati                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 3 (PTI): The Supreme Court today upheld environmental compatibility of a proposed park in Noida that Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati wants to turn into a memorial to B.R. Ambedkar and her mentor, the late Kanshi Ram.         
	A special forest bench headed by Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia upheld the legality and eco-friendliness of the 34-acre park, coming up close to the Okhla bird sanctuary, saying that the project is not so calamitous or ruinous for the bird sanctuary that it needs to be altogether scrapped.         
	Reading the judgment for the three-judge bench, Justice Aftab Alam said: We have found that it is not on forest land.        
	The bench, however, rued that the ministry of environment and forests had not conducted the environment impact study for the project.         
	The bench said: We see no justification for directing the demolition of the constructions made in it. We would rather allow the completion of the project, subject, of course, to the conditions suggested by the three expert bodies appointed by the project proponents.         
	The bench, however, stipulated that no more than 25 per cent of the 33.43-acre park area should be utilised for masonry work of any kind. No more than 25 per cent of the park land should fall under any hard (concrete) surface, whether covered or uncovered, including pathways and boundary wall, etc, said the bench.         
	It stipulated that 50 per cent of the park area, closer to the bird sanctuary must have a thick cover of trees, adding that the remaining 25 per cent of the area could be used for green landscaping.        
	The court would have been more comfortable if the environment impact studies were conducted by the ministry of environment and forests or by any organisation under it, the bench said.         
	Directing strict compliance of various remedial measures, the court ordered formation of an expert panel within a fortnight to supervise execution of the project.         
	The panel would include an ornithologist, besides senior advocate Harish Salve.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, July 7: Srinagar today woke up to a sight that had almost faded in the past decade and a half: the army on the streets.        
	The men in olive green staged a flag march today after four more persons, including a woman, died in security forces action on protesters yesterday, taking to 15 the number of casualties in the latest wave of demonstrations that has buffeted the Valley for almost a month now.        
	The army, which the Omar Abdullah government decided to call in yesterday after the police and paramilitary forces couldnt quell the flare-up, today enforced a curfew and helped the authorities restore an uneasy calm. Several towns, including Anantnag, Pulwama, Bandipore and Kupwara were under curfew. Army flag marches were held in Baramulla and Sopore.        
	In Srinagar, army vehicles filled with troopers in battle gear criss-crossed the uptown areas but avoided the more restive downtown zones. One army officer said they would avoid any direct confrontation with the protestors.        
	In the Batamaloo-Tengpora area of the city, which witnessed three of the four killings yesterday, protesters hit the streets despite the fact that the army was close by.         
	We were left with no other option (but to call the army), a senior government official said, after thousands of CRPF and policemen  35,000 personnel in Srinagar alone  failed to bring the situation under control.        
	The armys entry came on a day eight cops were attached  a jargon used in the administration for benched  for having used excessive force on protesters in Anantnag that killed three persons recently, according to PTI. An inquiry is on against the policemen  one inspector, two sub-inspectors and five constables.        
	The authorities cancelled the curfew passes issued to newspersons. The police were also accused of snatching the cameras of some TV channels. Police sources said patients had a tough time reaching hospitals as ambulances were being repeatedly frisked. There are unconfirmed reports that a lady who was on way to a Srinagar hospital from Kupwara died en route at Sopore after she had to wait an hour for being allowed to get through, an official said.        
	Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who heads the Hurriyats hardline faction, today gave a call for 48-hour sit-in and asked people to come out of their homes. They should even have food on the roads to show the world that they want right to self-determination, he said.        
	The army, along with the CRPF first and the BSF later, was used in Srinagar for counter-insurgency and crowd management operations when militancy started in 1990. It was gradually withdrawn to show normality had returned, though it continues to man the LoC and conduct anti-insurgency operations in rural areas.        
	Pak firing         
	BSF havaldar Hari Prasad died in firing by the Pakistani Rangers in the Akhnoor sector of Jammu last night. The death came a day after another jawan, Sultan Ali, was killed in firing from the across the border in the same area.

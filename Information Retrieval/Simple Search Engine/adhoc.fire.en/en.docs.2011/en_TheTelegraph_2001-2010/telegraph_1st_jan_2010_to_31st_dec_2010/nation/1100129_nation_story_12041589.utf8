The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gay film poses tolerance test
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Gay film poses tolerance test
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, Jan. 28: The Internet posters show two half-naked young men locked in passionate embrace.        
	Bollywood movie Dunno Y...Na Jaane Kyun is set to test tolerance in Indian society after Delhi High Court last year legalised adult, consensual gay sex.        
	The film, which promises to be Bollywoods boldest portrayal of a serious and explicitly sexual relationship between two men, is months away from release but the excited Internet chatter it has generated has provoked strong emotions, especially among religious leaders.        
	The first reaction from Hindu and Muslim clerics and priests, who have opposed the high courts overturning of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code that criminalised homosexuality, is: Told you so.        
	Bollywood will now market homosexuality as the law has been amended. We were against the repeal of the law. Now filmmakers will exploit the situation, emulating their western counterparts to popularise gay culture, said All India Muslim Personal Law Board member and noted cleric Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangimahali.        
	Deoband cleric Maulana Sufiyan Kasmi, who admitted to having seen the poster on the Internet, said: We will warn Muslims not to watch the movie since in Islam, homosexuality is a sin that cannot be pardoned.        
	Ayodhya priest Satyendra Das and Akhara Parishad chief Gyan Das urged the filmmakers to show some sanity in their depiction of the subject. Glorifying the aberrations of a gay relationship would amount to insulting God, Gyan Das said.        
	Voluntary organisation Naz Foundation, which works for gay rights and fought the high court case, welcomed the film.        
	We are amused to learn the reactions of the religious leaders, a Naz spokesman said. The picture of two semi-naked men embracing should not shock them if they are not shocked to see a semi-naked man and a woman locked in the same position.        
	Till now, Indian films have mostly depicted homosexuals as effeminate, comic characters. Last year, Dostana portrayed two straight men who pretend to be gay to persuade a pretty girl to become their housemate.        
	Dunno Y will deal with the subject with seriousness and honesty, its director Anil Sharma has told reporters in Mumbai.         
	The film stars Kapil Sharma, a debutant who plays a gay model forced to compromise his morals to further his career.        
	Gay rights campaigners, however, have told The Times, London, they would reserve judgement till they see the film. Just having two gay men on screen doesnt mean they will depict a gay relationship, Gautam Bhan, a leading activist, told the newspaper.

	New Delhi, Aug. 11: Two bone fragments embedded in layers of ancient volcanic deposits in Ethiopia have provided scientists the earliest evidence of stone tool use and meat eating by ancestors of humans 3.4 million years ago.         
	An international team of researchers has identified cuts and strike marks on the bones that could push the antiquity of tools by some 800,000 years.         
	Until now, the oldest evidence of stone tool production had come from Gona in Ethiopia, where scientists found tools 2.6 million years old  from the reign of a human ancestor Homo habilis.         
	In tomorrows issue of the journal Nature, an eight-member team has described 3.4-million-year-old bones from a site called Dikika with unambiguous stone tool marks. The bones  a rib fragment of a cow-sized mammal and a thigh bone of a goat-sized hoofed animal  show cuts for removal of flesh and percussion marks indicating the use of blunt stones, possibly to extract the marrow.         
	Meat eating and stone tool use are now pushed deeper into our evolutionary history  to a time long before the first members of the genus Homo appear, said Shannon McPherron, an American paleolithic archaeologist working at the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology, Germany, and a team member.         
	Scientists believe the only species that could have used stone tools in this way at the time was Australopithecus afarensis, the earliest full-time bipedal creature that lived in the region from 3.9 million years ago to 2.8 million years ago. This is the first time that stone tool use and meat eating have been associated with this species  Australopithecus afarensis, McPherron said.         
	The scientists said it was unclear whether Australopithecus afarensis used naturally-occurring sharp-edged stones or were making tools.         
	The most famous among Australopithecus afarensis skeletons was named Lucy, a creature that lived about 3.2 million years ago, whose remains were discovered in 1974.         
	The new bones were found near a site where Ethiopian and US scientists had found a young Australopithecus afarensis skeleton  named Selam. It is likely that Selam carried stone flakes and helped her family as they butchered animal remains, said Zeresenay Alemseged, Dikika project leader at the California Academy of Sciences.

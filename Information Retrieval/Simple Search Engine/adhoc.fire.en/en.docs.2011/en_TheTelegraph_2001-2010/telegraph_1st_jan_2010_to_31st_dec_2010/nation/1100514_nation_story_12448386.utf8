          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                            
	New Delhi, May 13: Breaking rules to help private firms may be fine for a top government executive as long as there is no evidence that he received any favours.        
	The Centres top corruption watchdog has exonerated the vice-chancellor of Indira Gandhi National Open University although it accepts he broke rules to effectively benefit select firms, because he has not signed a final deal with those companies yet.         
	The Central Vigilance Commission has, in its inquiry report accessed by this newspaper, confirmed that Indias largest open varsity flouted norms to pick three private firms for a Rs 384-crore teacher training project in Bihar.        
	The CVC has said Ignou vice-chancellor V.N. Rajasekharan Pillai flew free of cost to Patna on a chartered flight with a senior representative of hardware major IBM, one of the beneficiary firms.         
	The commissions inquiry has found the university guilty of violating statutory norms requiring it to obtain the sanction of the National Council for Teacher Education before starting a teacher training programme.         
	But the commission in its report has concluded that there is no evidence of mala fide interests behind the breaking of the rules or that of any favours received by Pillai.         
	The CVC took up the probe after allegations that Pillai took favours from Infrastructure Leasing Financial Services, Core Technologies and IBM to break rules and hand them the Bihar project without a transparent tendering process.         
	The Telegraph, in reports on November 6 and November 8, 2009, reported how flight manifests and Ignou documents suggested that Pillai and Ignou had broken government rules, effectively favouring these firms.         
	Evidence collected by this newspaper was also used by the CVC to conclude that Pillai travelled free of cost to Ignou on a chartered flight with IBM country director S. Kaushal to sign the deal with the Bihar government.         
	But the commission concluded that there was no evidence to show that IBM or the other two beneficiary firms paid for the flight. The report was silent on who did pay for the flight if none of the beneficiary firms nor Ignou did.         
	The CVC inquiry found that tendering norms were violated by the university despite a formal warning from pro-vice-chancellor Om Prakash Mishra to the registrar that the varsity was breaking norms.         
	This finding suggests that Ignou broke government norms knowingly to award the three select firms a share in the Bihar scheme, titled project Samarth.         
	But the CVC report has suggested that Ignou broke the rules to pick IL amp;FS without open tendering based on the suggestion given by the government of Bihar  without explaining how this exonerates the university.         
	Moreover, the work connected with project Samarth has not yet commenced and been awarded to M/s. IL amp;FS and its partners (IBM and Core Technologies) by Ignou so far. Thus, no mala fide intent on the part of VC, Ignou is made out, the commissions report says.         
	The commission has confirmed that the decision to go ahead with the Bihar project without the NCTEs approval was taken despite a warning from the human resource development ministry against flouting this rule. But it has dismissed the violation as a procedural lapse.

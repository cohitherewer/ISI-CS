          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, May 4: The young woman was smart, but not smarter than the video cameras.        
	Even in the crowd of wedding guests, she couldnt escape their impersonal eye.        
	Chennai police yesterday arrested the 32-year-old, who targeted marriage halls, and confirmed through the video-recording of a wedding that the wily transgressor had been the one walking away with jewels and cash.        
	Police sources said S. Shanthi was behind several recent robberies at weddings in north Chennai and had confessed.        
	But before she was caught by the brides relatives yesterday stealing silverware, Shanthi had been a smart purloiner.        
	Shanthi, the police said, would survey charts at marriage halls to scan the days booked for weddings. After choosing her target, she would arrive at the hall the day before a wedding, accompanied by her husband Selvaraj and seven-year-old daughter. She would introduce herself to the hall manager as a relative of the bride or groom and say she wanted to take a look at the arrangements.         
	Once inside, Shanthi would scan the entire hall, especially the rooms normally allotted for the bride and the groom, and the exits. As some halls have installed closed-circuit TV cameras, the recce helped her make sure no hidden eye would survey her movements.        
	Since she would come with her family, hardly anyone suspected anything. And when she showed up the next day at the wedding, the hall staff would already be familiar with her, said ACP V. Kumar.        
	Police said Shanthi would walk into the brides room posing as a close relative of the groom and help in decorating the bride. As her daughter would be with her, she rarely aroused suspicion.        
	Yesterday, too, she tried the same act at a wedding at Washermanpet in north Chennai. But the brides aunt became suspicious about Shanthis frequent trips to the bathroom with her huge handbag. She cornered Shanthi and asked her the name of the grooms father.        
	Shanthi tried to bluster her way through but soon other relatives surrounded her and checked her handbag. Inside they found silverware the bride was to gift her soon-to-be husband.        
	Since we already had the video of another wedding last month where 40 gold sovereigns had been stolen, we played that and found Shanthi and her daughter very much part of the wedding crowd, said inspector M. Vijayaragahvan.        
	The officer said Shanthi had told her interrogators she had been targeting marriage halls for over a year now and that her husband would sell the stolen jewels.        
	The police are searching for her husband. Their daughter has been lodged in a government home for children.

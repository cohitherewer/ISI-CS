The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish to PC: Talk less
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitish to PC: Talk less
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Chidambaram (top), Nitish                                 
	New Delhi, April 10: Talk less, work more.        
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has advised P. Chidambaram to speak less and let his work as the countrys home minister do the talking.        
	I respect Chidambaram. My advice to him is he should not talk so much. I will advice him to modulate the tone and tenor (of his speech). It doesnt help to talk too much, Kumar told reporters today, a day after the Union minister accepted full responsibility for the Maoist massacre in Chhattisgarh.        
	Nitish, who has to contend with Maoist insurgency in his state, also rapped Union home secretary G.K. Pillai for making political statements. Pillai had accused Nitish of going a little soft in taking hard action because of Bihar elections later this year.        
	Asked if Pillai was deliberately trying to put down non-UPA-ruled states that were battling the Maoist menace, Nitish said: His statements smack of immaturity. What is happening to the home ministry? He has no business to issue political statements, it is for the political executive to do it, if necessary.        
	The NDA leader went on to add why he did not join issue with Pillai. How can I react to a bureaucrats statement? I could have asked one of my officers to respond but I chose not to, he said.        
	Nitish said the Centre had an either-you-are-with-us-or-against-us approach on tackling the problem. You (the Centre) have formulated a view on your policy. If anyone differs with it, you hit him. They have to understand the federal structure where every party has to respect others and work in a spirit of co-operation, he said.        
	Insinuating that the Centres approach was about treating the symptoms rather than the cause, Nitish said he followed a two-step policy in Bihar.         
	Naxalism cannot be tackled by operations alone. Certain pockets are demolished in police action but they spring up again. When the situation demands, operations are needed. It happened in Bihar and we recovered large caches of arms. At the same time, you should bring development with justice at the grassroots. Development is not about putting up big factories and projects but about ensuring that the benefits reach the poorest of the poor and the delivery mechanisms are in place, he said.        
	After counselling Chidambaram to be reticent, the chief minister cited the Jehanabad experiment he had tried in January 2006 as a model for quelling Left-wing extremism. It was about saturating development. Give everyone roads, Indira Awas Yojna houses, irrigation, electricity, PDS and sustain the process without talking about it, he said.        
	Nitishs subtle criticism of Chidambaram was in contrast to his ally BJPs unequivocal endorsement of the minister.         
	Although the BJP has been his ruling partner since 1995, Nitish made it clear that politics in Bihar would be on his terms and not necessarily the BJPs. He said Bihar BJP leaders were more than competent to handle the impending state elections and there was no need for Delhis intervention.         
	The sub-text was the BJP would be well advised to keep Narendra Modi and Varun Gandhi out of the campaign so that Nitish can sell his pro-Muslim agenda credibly.

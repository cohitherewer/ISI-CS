The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court seeks affidavit on behalf of PM
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Court seeks affidavit on behalf of PM
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Manmohan Singh      
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: The Supreme Court today sought an affidavit on the Prime Ministers behalf from any official after the government informed the court that those in authority had acted most appropriately in dealing with a petition seeking sanction to prosecute A. Raja when he was telecom minister.        
	 if serious accusations have been made, first we must know if anything has been held back, a two-judge bench of Justices G.S Singhvi and Asok Kumar Ganguly said.         
	The affidavit, a sworn statement under oath, is to be filed by Saturday. Petitioner and Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy is expected to reply to the assertions by Monday, following which the case will be heard on Tuesday.         
	The government will produce a list of dates to show that the complaints had been dealt with, solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium said.        
	The tone of the proceedings today was muted, compared with the mood on Tuesday.         
	Initiating the arguments today, the solicitor-general said every letter of Swamy had been dealt with. Subramanium said he had personally gone through the records and had been satisfied that Swamy had been answered adequately.         
	The solicitor-general said he was willing to make submissions to that effect. The truth is transparent, he said.         
	Justice Singhvi then sought the response of Swamy, who insisted that the only response he got from the Prime Minister was in March this year. The Prime Minister had in his reply said that the CBI was still looking into the matter and that the plea for sanction was premature.         
	When the court said that these facts have to be brought on record, Subramanium said he would consult the records and place the facts before the judges. We have taken the courts observations and remarks positively. It is a privilege to be an SG for a PM who has maintained the highest traditions and propriety, he said.         
	Justice Singhvi observed Swamy had also given a similar certificate to Manmohan Singh. The allusion was to media reports in which Swamy had praised Singh.         
	The court granted the solicitor-general time till Saturday to file the affidavit. The affidavit will have to be filed by an official on behalf of the Prime Minister.        
	The court has not yet issued notices to the Prime Minister (as the authority competent to sanction Rajas prosecution) but had directed that the affidavit be filed on his behalf.         
	Speaking to reporters later, the solicitor-general said an official in the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) would now be authorised to file the affidavit. It would be on the PMOs behalf and not on the Prime Ministers behalf, he said, although the government was yet to make a formal application to remove the Prime Ministers name from the petition.         
	Subramanium said the PMO as an institution would place facts on record to show that Swamys letters were all replied to. He also cautioned the media not to take court observations as a reflection on the Prime Minister as an individual.         
	 Court questions are part of the adjudicatory process. They cannot be viewed as conclusions or as comments on an individual and I think it is important that we must respect the adjudicatory process, he said.         
	The SC only wanted what was being said orally put on an affidavit because it also wants to know whether the petitioner (Swamy) has made full disclosure, he said, accusing Swami of holding back some crucial communication from the former telecom minister.        
	In another petition filed by an NGO seeking monitoring of the CBI probe into the 2G spectrum allocation, lawyer Prashant Bhushan said the final CAG report on the matter was very damaging.        
	The court said it would have a look at the CAG report before hearing arguments in the case.

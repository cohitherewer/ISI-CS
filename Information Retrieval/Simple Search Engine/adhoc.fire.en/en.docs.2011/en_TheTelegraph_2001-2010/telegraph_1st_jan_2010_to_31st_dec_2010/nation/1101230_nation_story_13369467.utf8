	New Delhi, Dec. 29 (PTI): Environment minister Jairam Ramesh has claimed that MPs have approached his ministry on behalf of companies they are involved in, a violation of norms that may lead to a serious conflict of interest.        
	In a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, Ramesh urged her to dissuade MPs from meeting officials directly. He said MPs often used such meetings to put pressure on his ministry.        
	Raising issues of serious conflict of interest, Ramesh said: The first category of MPs approach me on behalf of the companies they run or with which they are closely associated.        
	This is a blatant violation of norms. I have tried to discourage this but have not entirely succeeded, he said.        
	Ramesh said he had also found objectionable the instances when MPs approached him and pleaded for or against projects that were neither in their state nor in their constituency.        
	I find this also objectionable, especially when the same letter is signed by MPs from different states, he said.        
	But the minister said he would meet MPs regarding projects that were in their state or constituency, and had no problem with such representations.        
	I would request you to please take note of the first two categories of MPs. Serious ethics issues are involved here. I would like you to dissuade MPs from meeting officials directly. Such meetings are often used to put pressure, Ramesh said.

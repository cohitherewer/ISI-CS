The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US boost for Indian women
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US boost for Indian women
          LUBICA HAUSWALDOVA                            Shahnaz Husain (top), Hillary Clinton				                                 
	Washington, April 29: Women in India can now take advantage of two new programmes announced here yesterday by US secretary of state Hillary Clinton at the Presidential Summit on Entrepreneurship, organised as a follow-up to President Barack Obamas landmark speech last year in Cairo reaching out to the Muslim world.        
	At a breakfast for women entrepreneurs from countries with large Muslim populations as part of the two-day summit, Clinton launched the Secretarys International Fund for Women and Girls, focused on providing flexible, rapid, targeted and high-impact grants to non-government organisations working to meet the critical needs of women and girls around the world. Six Indians attended the summit.        
	The fund will support efficient and innovative ways in combating violence, improving health and education, promoting climate change solutions as well as creating economic and political opportunities for women and girls.        
	Shahnaz Husain, known for her Indian herbal and natural cosmetic treatments, a Padma Shree awardee and one of the Indian delegates at the summit, spoke enthusiastically to this writer soon after attending Clintons breakfast about a second initiative which she announced on the occasion: the Secretarys Innovation Award for the Empowerment of Women and Girls.         
	Husain was ecstatic at the prospect that any woman or girl in India now has a chance to receive a grant of up to half a million dollars thanks to the initiative.         
	The new award, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, seeks the most pioneering approaches to the political, economic and social empowerment of women and girls across the globe. There will be two award winners in 2010. All those interested have to submit an initial paper by June 1. In the second round, a jury will invite a subset of contributors to submit a full proposal.        
	However, Indian women entrepreneurs have not been merely recipients at the summit. They equally contributed to the proceedings by sharing their business experiences as well as their commitment to community service, emphasised by Obama in his address to the participants. The US President spoke of my own mother, who worked with the rural poor from Pakistan to Indonesia, of how a simple idea, began with a single person, has now transformed the lives of millions. That is the spirit of entrepreneurship.        
	Husain made a mark as she spoke about her work for the less privileged in India through free training courses to the deaf, mute and blind students. Started in 1984, she runs four-month courses round the year with 15 students in every batch as part of her corporate commitment to the physically challenged.         
	Handicapped graduates who have taken these courses have found jobs either in her clinics or other beauty salons, she said.        
	The experience of Husain, unusual for an audience here for her track record of building a successful business empire without traditional western marketing or advertising techniques, impressed the organisers of the summit as well as Harvard University.         
	She delivered a lecture at the Harvard Business School just before the summit. They ask me how I did it, said Husain. Its simple: My product has to be really good. It has to speak for itself. Samuel Hayes Jacob H. Schiff, professor at the Harvard Business School, said while introducing her for the lecture that you violate every norm that we teach.        
	Another woman participant from India, Shaheen Mistri, is a founder and managing director of the Akanksha Foundation, a non-profit organisation that educates thousand of under-privileged children across India.         
	Over the past 19 years, the organisation has expanded from 15 children in one centre to over 3,500 children in 58 centres and six schools. Recently, Akanksha joined hands with Sachin Tendulkar, Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh, and the entire Mumbai Indians cricket team in promoting the organisations objectives.

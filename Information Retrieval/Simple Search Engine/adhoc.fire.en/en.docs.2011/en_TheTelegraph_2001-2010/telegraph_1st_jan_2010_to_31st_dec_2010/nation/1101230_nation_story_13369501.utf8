          SADAF MODAK                                           Aditya Thackeray      
	Mumbai, Dec. 29: Bal Thackerays grandson Aditya today won a Mumbai University election, two months after the Shiv Sena patriarch anointed the young man his political successor.         
	The Bhartiya Vidyarthi Sena (BVS), a part of Yuva Sena, of which 20-year-old Aditya is the president, contested all 10 seats in the senate, and made a clean sweep of the five seats for which the results were declared today.         
	All five winners belong to the reserved categories. The counting for the remaining five seats is on, and the results are likely to be declared tomorrow, university officials said.         
	The BVS supporters said they hoped to win nine out of the 10 seats.         
	The elections were held on December 26 in colleges affiliated to the university. More than 40,000 registered voters in over 40 centres participated.         
	The 10-member senate is the students body that takes key decisions on academic matters of the university and the colleges affiliated to it.         
	What made Adityas political debut special was that the BVS candidates scored over those of the Maharashtra Navnirman Vidarythi Sena, the students wing of his uncle Raj Thackerays MNS.        
	The BVS also trumped the Swabhiman Sanghatana, which is run by Congress minister Narayan Ranes son Nitesh.         
	Both Raj and Rane had quit the Sena following differences with Adityas father and Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray four years ago.        
	Even before the senate elections, we started employment-related programmes for graduates and held classes for them. It was not just a senate election that we were aspiring to win, but we want it to be a platform for reformation, said BVS chief Abhijeet Panse, proclaiming that previous senate elections had never thrown up such a clear verdict.        
	In the last elections, the National Students Union of India won three seats, the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad won two and the Shiv Sena won five.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, April 9: Abused for bearing three daughters in a row, a 35-year-old mother threw all three into a well last night before drinking poison.        
	The girls, aged between three years and two months, are all dead but Gauri Bai today woke up in hospital where she is being treated for severe poisoning.        
	Gauri, a resident of Rajgoliakhurd village in Mahoba district of Uttar Pradesh, about 380km from here, has told police her in-laws began mentally torturing her ever since she gave birth to her third daughter in February.        
	Last evening, she said, she had been subjected to the filthiest abuses after her husband returned from the fields.        
	I couldnt bear it any more. I threw my three daughters into the well at our home and gulped poison late last night, she told the police.        
	Mahoba police officer B.D. Tiwari said the police had recorded a murder case against Gauri and a case of persecution against her in-laws. Gauris husband Ramashankar Patel, 42, and a few of his relatives have been detained for questioning.        
	Mahoba is in Bundelkhand, where less than one in four women are literate and where there are only 850 girls for every 1,000 boys.         
	Daughters here are called paraya dhan (somebody elses property). Every girls birth brings a pall of depression on a Hindu home, said Sampat Pal, a woman rights activist.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat fights WR murmurs
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Karat fights WR murmurs
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Feb. 25: The CPM today stood by its action against W.R. Varadarajan and denied that he had been hounded to death, the explanation aimed at rebutting murmurs that the punishment meted out to the late Tamil Nadu leader was excessive.        
	In a media note, released in Chennai today, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has explained that the state and central committees removed Varadarajan from all elected posts only after a detailed inquiry following charges of sexual harassment levelled against him by a woman in September 2009.        
	WRV was given the opportunity to defend his stand. After a two-hour discussion, the central committee decided to uphold the Tamil Nadu state committees recommendation for disciplinary action. None of the 74 members of the central committee present opposed the action being taken. Five members recorded their abstention during the vote.        
	WRV responded to this by saying that he would submit to the decision of the central committee and that he would also exercise his right to appeal to the central control commission. The above narration of the course adopted in the disciplinary action against WRV is well known to the party members. But it is being spelt out to clear misconceptions which have been purveyed by some motivated reports in the media, Karat said in the note.        
	If the party had not taken cognisance of the complaint and the woman concerned had gone public with her charges, the same media would have gone to town attacking the CPM for ignoring a sexual harassment charge against one of its leaders, Karat argued.        
	Varadarajan was removed following twin complaints lodged by his wife Saraswathi about an extra-marital affair and also by a woman named Pramila, who accused him of sending offensive and inappropriate SMS messages.        
	The ouster has divided the party with several leaders, including Bengal veteran Benoy Konar, voicing doubts about the inconclusive evidence against Varadarajan.        
	Karat, in todays note, acknowledged that Varadarajan had written a detailed letter to him about the action taken against him.         
	In that letter, Varadarajan had stated that charges raised by the woman (Pramila) were false and that the inquiry by the state disciplinary committee was neither fair or nor balanced since the complainant had never appeared before it to press her charges.         
	The CPM boss described Varadarajan as a talented trade union leader. Karat found support from Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen, who said the partys ongoing internal rectification campaign would not be affected by Varadarajans suicide.         
	This is an isolated incident. Our rectification campaign will continue as we had conducted it earlier also, said Sen, now perceived to be close to Karat.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Indian rescue in Kyrgyz riots
          ARCHIS MOHAN                                            
	New Delhi, June 14: Over 100 Indian students, including at least one from Calcutta, trapped in riot-torn southern Kyrgyzstan were today being flown out of the trouble zone to the countrys capital on their way back home.        
	The students were being airlifted from Osh, the epicentre of the violence, in two chartered aircraft sent by the Indian embassy in Kyrgyz capital Bishkek, mission officials said over the phone this evening.        
	One plane had taken off around 9.30pm Indian time with around 99 students who had been stuck in Osh. Another was waiting in the city to bring around 15 students who were being flown in a chopper from nearby Jalalabad. An Indian professor and a businessman stranded in Osh were also being flown out.        
	Most of the students are studying medicine and engineering at various institutes in the central Asian country.        
	Amrit Das, who is from Calcuttas Behala and one of those stuck in Osh, said the students had been provided police escort on their way to the airport in the besieged town where the violence had left nearly 100 people dead and prompted the authorities to issue shoot-on-sight orders.        
	But earlier in the day, Amrit hadnt been sure of moving out. There is no water, no food. Right next to my house, a building is burning. I dont know if I am safe or not. There has been shooting all around. They are burning houses, he had said.         
	The ethnic clashes between the native Kyrgyz and the Uzbeks are the countrys worst since 1990.        
	Sumita, among the 15 to be rescued from Jalalabad, also said the group had been provided security while being taken to the airport. Hours earlier, she had described the grim situation: Shoot-on-sight orders have been issued, so we cant go out. They told us to lock our doors and stay inside. First the gas connection was shut down, then the electricity supply was cut off.        
	Shaheer Khan, who was staying in Osh, had said before taking the plane out earlier in the day: Firing is going on in front of us. Anyone can die any moment. Some of the students said they had been without food, water or power for four days.        
	In Delhi, an external affairs ministry spokesperson said the mission was in touch with Kyrgyzstans foreign ministry and security agencies.         
	Everything possible is being done to ensure the safety and well-being of the Indian nationals within the constraints posed by the difficult ground situation, the spokesperson said.        
	Pakistan has also decided to send a military aircraft to evacuate 247 of its trapped students. A Pakistani engineering student has been killed and 15 of its citizens, seven of them women, have been held hostage, according to Pakistani media reports.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Vested interest plea in House
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Vested interest plea in House
                                        Ramesh      
	New Delhi, Dec. 30 (PTI): Rajya Sabha chairman Hamid Ansari today referred to the House ethics committee Jairam Rameshs complaint about MPs lobbying for projects in which they allegedly have vested interests.        
	The Union environment minister had yesterday written to the presiding officers of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.        
	He had complained about alleged violation of norms by MPs who approached his ministry with matters related to companies they were running or were associated with, even though the projects did not fall in their constituencies. Such breach of rules, the minister had argued in the letter, led to serious conflict of interest.        
	He also urged the heads of both Houses to dissuade MPs from meeting officials directly, saying such interactions were often used to put pressure on the ministry. This is a blatant violation of norms. I have tried to discourage this but have not entirely succeeded, he said in the letter.        
	Ramesh found it objectionable that MPs pleaded with him for or against projects not in their state or constituencies. I find this also objectionable, especially when the same letter is signed by MPs from different states.         
	But the minister said he would meet MPs regarding projects that were in their state or constituency and had no problem with such representations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | ISI used Lashkar against India: UN
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      ISI used Lashkar against India: UN
                            
	United Nations, April 16 (PTI): A UN report today said Pakistan military-backed spy agency ISI had close links with the Lashkar-e-Toiba and had used the militant outfits services to foment anti-India sentiments in Kashmir.        
	Endorsing Indias stand on the issue, the UN-appointed panel probing the killing of former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said: The Pakistani military organised and supported the Taliban to take control of Afghanistan in 1996. Similar tactics were used in Kashmir against India after 1989.        
	The three-member panel concluded that the Pakistan militarys policy of using terrorists as a tool to achieve its strategic objectives against its neighbours resulted in a nexus between the military and the radical Islamists at the expense of secular forces.        
	Noting that the jihadi organisations were Sunni groups based largely in Pakistans Punjab province, the 65-page report said members of these groups aided the Talibans effort in Afghanistan at the behest of the ISI and also cultivated ties with the al Qaida.        
	The Pakistani military and (the) ISI also used and supported some of these groups in the Kashmir insurgency after 1989. The bulk of the anti-Indian activity was and still remains the work of groups such as (the) Lashkar-e-Toiba, which has close ties with the ISI, the panel, headed by Chiles UN ambassador Heraldo Munoz, said.        
	A common characteristic of these jihadi groups was their adherence to the Deobandi Sunni sect of Islam, their strong anti-Shia bias and their use by the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies in Afghanistan and Kashmir, the report added.        
	It said that though several current and former Pakistani intelligence officials told the panel that the ISI no longer had ties with militant outfits, independent analysts provided information to the contrary.        
	The report said Qari Saifullah Akhtar, one of the founders of the extremist group Harkat-ul Jihad Islami (HuJI), was reportedly one of the ISIs main links to the Taliban militants in Afghanistan. Akhtar, the report said, had links with Osama bin Laden, who was in Afghanistan in 2007.        
	Akhtars one-time deputy Ilyas Kashmiri, who had ties with the Pakistani military during the Afghan and Kashmir campaigns, had been a senior aide to bin Ladens deputy Ayman al Zawahiri, the report said.              
	It was such links and connections between elements in the intelligence agencies and militants, which most concerned Bhutto and many others who believed that the authorities could activate these connections to harm her. Given their clandestine nature, any such connection in an attack on her is very difficult to detect or prove, the report said.

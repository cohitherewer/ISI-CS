The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Quell-or-quit notice to youngster Omar   Rahul support for CM with leadership rider
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Quell-or-quit notice to youngster Omar     Rahul support for CM with leadership rider
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                               Omar Abdullah (top), Farooq Abdullah				                                       
	New Delhi, Sept 16: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah is on a perform-or-perish notice, Rahul Gandhis outspoken support to him notwithstanding. The Congress high command has instructed partymen to halt attacks on Omar and assured him an extended run in power but attached an unambiguous caveat to its support: law and order is Omars responsibility and he must find ways to quell tumult in the Valley.         
	This has been conveyed afresh not merely to Omar but also to his father and National Conference (NC) president, Farooq Abdullah, who has suddenly turned pro-active in attempts to secure his familys grip on power. The senior Abdullah held unscheduled discussions with Prime Minsiter Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi in back to back meetings this afternoon to seek reassurance from the Centre. The Abdullahs anxieties were probably spurred by talks that their chief adversary and PDP patron, Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, had with the UPA Big Two last night. Prime Minister Singh is known to share a personal relationship with the Mufti and met him to get a first hand sense from one of the seniormost leaders in Kashmiri politics.         
	Congress sources denied that by inviting the Mufti and his daughter Mehbooba to private parleys, the party was signalling an opening of options in Kashmir, insisting that the NC-Congress alliance was intact. As buttress, they quoted Rahul Gandhi who told a press conference in Calcutta that Omar was in a tough job and needs time and support. Omar is a youngster, Rahul said, Kashmir is a tough and sensitive job, it is not a part-time problem, Kashmir is a difficult place, we have to give Omar time and support. Omar was prompt to thank Rahul from his troubled perch in Srinagar but Rahuls support to Omar was a little open-ended. He said, perhaps pertinently, that the NC was the party the Congress supported and it was for the NC to decides who leads it. A change of guard may not be an immediate option, but it has not been closed.         
	As an all-party delegation prepares to visit the Valley on Monday, pressure is mounting on Omar to demonstrate that he remains the best horse to back in Kashmir. The national and state oppositions  the BJP and the PDP respectively --- have demanded his resignation, and for the angry street, Omar has come to symbolise all thats ill with their circumstances. As one PDP leader put it, Omars removal may not resolve much but it will relieve the situation, someone has to be accountable, in Kashmiri eyes, for more than 80 deaths in the space of three months.         
	Omar, though, appears to have got over his initial frustrations  a period in which he twice threatened to quit saying he could not handle the situation  and is digging in doggedly to hold and assert power. The Centre isnt averse to supporting him but it wants the young chief minister to get down to the business of governance and authority.         
	Apart from deliberating on the mandate and logistics of the all-party delegation, the Congress core group is believed to have discussed the road ahead in Kashmir. Inputs from Farooq Abdullahs meetings with the Prime Minister and Sonia were brought up and a case made for backing Omar on the condition that he shows quick results. But both the government and the Congress remain gloomy on immediate prospects, given the mood of the street. In the absence of any positive breakthroughs, the Centre might actually be banking on negative factors. A month from now, preparations will begin to shift the capital to Jammu and winter will set in. With Omar out of the storms eye and the Valley virtually closed by a chill, there will be more time to be bought, policy-makers hope.         
	For a while this evening, speculation swirled in Delhi and Srinagar that Omar was about to step down in favour of his father in the interest of keeping power within the family. It did not help that while Farooq was meeting Singh and Sonia, Omar drove to Governors house in Srinagar for a meeting with N.N. Vohra and Sonia Gandhi called a meeting of the partys Kashmir core group. But both the chief minsiters office and Farooq himself scotched all conjecture of a leadership change. While sources close the Omar described the meeting with Governor Vohra as routine and described talk of change as motivate hearsay, Farooq himself was categorical. Omar has no plans to step down, he said after his meetings in Delhi, and I have no plans to return as chief minister. I do not know where all of this is coming from.

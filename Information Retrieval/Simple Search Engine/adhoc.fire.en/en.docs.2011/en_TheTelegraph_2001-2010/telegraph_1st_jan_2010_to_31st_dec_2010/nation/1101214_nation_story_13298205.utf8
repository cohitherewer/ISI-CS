	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 13: A fast-track court has found a gangster guilty of killing Biranchi Das, the judo coach who trained a boy from the slums to become the countrys youngest marathon runner.        
	The court convicted Sandeep Acharya, alias Raja, of shooting Das outside his judo centre in April 2008 after the coach tried to stop the thug from harassing an actress. Das had won fame as the man who guided Budhia Singh, a slum kid, to run 60km races at the age of four.

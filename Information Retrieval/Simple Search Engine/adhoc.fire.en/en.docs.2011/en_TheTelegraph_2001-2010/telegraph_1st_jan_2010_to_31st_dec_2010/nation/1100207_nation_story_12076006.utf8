                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Running from tragedy, student dies with friend
          OUR BUREAU                            (From top) The mangled car, Dipanjan and his friend Niraj                                 
	Feb. 6: A Calcutta student headed for Digha to run from memories of his sisters death himself died today along with a friend when his car crashed into a truck near Kolaghat in 4am darkness.        
	When the memories of his elder sisters death in a stove blast got too much for him on the tragedys 13th anniversary last night, Dipanjan Ganguly, 24, climbed into his car at his home in Jodhpur Garden.        
	The student of a PG computer applications course in a Santoshpur college took along three other college students, all Sikkim residents studying in Calcutta and lodgers at Jodhpur Garden.        
	Niraj Bhandari, 20, a second-year history student at Asutosh College, died with Dipanjan at the accident site, 75km from here on National Highway 41, which had only one carriageway open.        
	Ashwin Pradhan and Tshering Wangyal Lepcha, both 19, have been admitted to a city hospital after preliminary treatment at Tamluk district hospital.        
	Tragedy is no stranger to Dipanjans family, whose last member has now died. Dipanjans father had died of illness six months ago and his mother in a heart attack four days later, his friend Mithun Banik said. But it was the thoughts of his sister that occupied Dipanjans mind and grew unbearable yesterday, Banik said.        
	He said he wanted to escape from the memories by setting off for Digha and asked me to come with him but I had other engagements. When I declined, he took along some others.        
	Neighbour Saraswati Barui said Dipanjan used to keep to himself. This was especially so after his father Manoranjan Ganguly died six months ago, followed by his mother, Barui said. Since then, he would hardly interact with us.        
	Dipanjan was at the wheel when the accident happened. Some shopkeepers who had just woken up came out when they heard the crash. They took all the four injured to the district hospital where Dipanjan and Niraj were declared dead on arrival.        
	The truck driver fled under the cover of darkness. We have begun a hunt for the truck driver, said Tamluk additional superintendent of police Dhrubajyoti Dey.        
	Nirajs father T.N. Bhandari, a teacher, was bringing his sons body back and was expected to reach Sikkim tomorrow, the students uncle .P. Bhandari said from Pakyom in east Sikkim. Nirajs sister too studies in Calcutta, he said.

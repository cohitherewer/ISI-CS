The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Six villagers butchered by Maoists
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Six villagers butchered by Maoists
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, May 16: Six villagers were killed by Maoist rebels in the Maanpur area of Rajnandgaon district late last night after being tried in a kangaroo court and declared police informers.        
	Besides the sarpanch (village head) of Taregaon, Veersai Mandavi, the other five victims were from Unchapur and Korcha villages in Maanpur police station area, near the Maharashtra border.        
	According to sources, more than 100 armed rebels raided the three villages  about 150km from here  around 1am. They asked the villagers to assemble at a point where they organised a kangaroo court to try the six people they claimed were working as police informers.        
	A senior police official from Rajnandgaon told The Telegraph that the rebels first assaulted the six men, including Mandavi, in front of the other villagers. They then slit the throats of the six and threw the bodies in a nearby forest, sending out a chilling message to all those present.        
	Sources said Maoist movement in the area which lies between Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra  had intensified in the past couple of months. In July last year, the rebels had killed 36 security personnel, including Rajnandgaon superintendent of police Vinod Kumar Choubey, in the same area.        
	Of late, with the rebels camping in the villages and seeking help, the tide had turned against them.         
	Director-general of police Vishwa Ranjan said the bodies were found in a forest near Unchapur village this morning.         
	Sources, however, said the police failed to reach the spot and recover the bodies. As the rebels had laid an ambush on the way to the area, the security personnel were asked to stay back and send the villagers to collect the bodies instead, a source said.         
	The incident has put the state authorities in a fix. Rajnandgaon happens to be the home district of chief minister Raman Singh. Moreover, superintendent of police Praveer Das is working on a temporary arrangement in the district where the Maoists are reportedly expanding their base everyday. About three months ago, Das was ordered to swap places with Korba superintendent of police Ratanlal Dangi, who, however, is yet to join.

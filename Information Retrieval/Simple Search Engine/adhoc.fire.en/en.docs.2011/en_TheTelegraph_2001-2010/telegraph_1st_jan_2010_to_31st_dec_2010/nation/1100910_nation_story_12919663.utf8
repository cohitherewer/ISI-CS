The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Letter silence in Naveens Andhra roar
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Letter silence in Naveens Andhra roar
          OUR BUREAU                                           
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 9: The Orissa government may be crying itself hoarse on the Polavaram multi-purpose project but chief minister Naveen Patnaik has not found it important to respond to an invitation of Andhra Pradesh chief minister K. Rosaiah for a meeting with him to discuss inter-state water resources.        
	Inviting Naveen to Hyderabad for a meeting, Rosaiah in his letter had said if due to prior commitments you are not able to make a visit, I have no hesitation in coming to Bhubaneswar on a mutually convenient date to us.         
	Although the letter was sent on February 24, Naveen has not replied to the letter.         
	Mr Patnaik has not even acknowledged our chief ministers letter, said an Andhra Pradesh government official on phone while confirming the details of the letter.        
	The principal secretary to the Orissa chief minister, Aditya Padhi, told The Telegraph: I am not aware of it (the letter). I have to find out.         
	He asked The Telegraph to contact water resources secretary Suresh Chandra Mohapatra. The official, who is currently out of the capital, could not be contacted.        
	In his letter, Rosaiah said: I believe taking adversarial position is not only costly but also deprive the people the rightful benefits due to them by harnessing water resources. I also feel that there are no issues which cannot be amicably settled with mutual consultations and in the spirit of realising optimum benefit by the neighbouring states.        
	The letter was sent much before Biju Janata Dal decided to target the Congress-led UPA government for ignoring the interests of Orissa and sanctioning environment clearance for the project.        
	Orissas position on Polavaram has all along been that the neighbouring state is going ahead with the project in violation of the 1978 interstate agreement on the use of Godavari basin water and ignoring the fact that change in the dams design would inundate cultivable land in more than 10 villages in the tribal-dominated Malkangiri district.         
	The state has challenged the project, which received the Centres forest clearance recently, in the Supreme Court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Strategic pause in   JPC nay
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Strategic pause in   JPC nay
  - Centre projects adamant posture but keeps options open with an eye on BJP and Bihar        SANJAY K. JHA                      Pranab Mukherjee                                      
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: The Centre today rejected the Opposition demand for a joint parliamentary committee on the telecom scandal but sources said that despite the decisions apparent finality, it should be seen more as a strategic step in a continuing war of nerves.        
	Although both the government and the Congress ruled out a JPC, insiders admitted that the course of action would depend on how the situation played out over the next few days.        
	The Opposition has so far refused to back down despite mounting criticism of its continued shutdown of Parliament. Sources said the government deliberately gave out a signal with some degree of firmness to see if at least a section of the Opposition would soften and indicate willingness to settle for something less.        
	The situation may become clearer only on Thursday morning, because the focus tomorrow will be on the Bihar election results.        
	Todays Supreme Court proceedings came as a relief for the government as the cloud over the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) appeared to be lightening. If the PMO comes out of the apex court unscathed, the Oppositions charges against the government might lose some of their weight in the public eye.        
	Sources say the government expects a way out of the deadlock if the political atmosphere changes, but do not rule out revisiting the JPC demand if the Opposition continues to paralyse Parliament.        
	The Congress logic in rejecting a JPC is that granting one will hand the Opposition a stick to beat the government with for the next two-three years, as had happened with the Bofors controversy.        
	Sections in the government believe that after the removal of A. Raja and Ashok Chavan, the Opposition would be further emboldened if the Centre accepts the JPC demand.        
	Some Congress leaders feel the entire corruption issue has been mishandled from the start. There are also fears that if a JPC is formed to look into the whole gamut of the telecom scandal, it could possibly lead to uncomfortable revelations.        
	Right now, there is no road map in sight and the government does not expect Parliament to transact any business tomorrow, either.        
	Hours after the governments interlocutor, Pranab Mukherjee, told the Opposition about the Centres inability to accept the JPC demand, the Congress too termed the demand unreasonable and described the long disruption of Parliament as shocking.        
	Party spokesperson Shakil Ahmed said the Opposition should understand that the UPA had a popular mandate to govern this country and, therefore, no protest should drag on long enough to paralyse democratic functioning.        
	We are not running away from debate. Any issue can be discussed. We are not preventing investigation, either: the CBI and the PAC (public accounts committee, a parliamentary body) will probe the scam. The Opposition should return to work, he said.        
	Ahmed also pointed a finger at Karnataka to accuse the BJP of double standards on corruption.        
	The Congress hopes the BJPs failure to sack chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa would increase the Lefts unease and put a strain on Opposition unity. That will embolden the Congress to confront the BJP with greater force.        
	Also, any kind of fractured mandate in Bihar  where, as of now, the BJP-Janata Dal (United) look poised for an easy win  will hand the Congress new ammunition against the BJP.        
	A clear victory for Nitish Kumar, though, may put the Congress under additional pressure to strike a compromise with the Opposition.

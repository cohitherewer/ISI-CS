The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Church backs college on teacher sack
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Church backs college on teacher sack
                            
	Kochi, Sept. 11 (PTI): A Kerala church today backed the action of the college that sacked a lecturer for preparing a question paper the contents of which upset Muslims.        
	Lecturer T.J. Joseph was later attacked and his right palm chopped off by activists of a radical outfit, the Popular Front of India.        
	Coming out in support of the church-run Newman college which faced a public outcry, the Diocese in Kothamangalam in Ernakulam district blamed Joseph for committing an irresponsible act and said the attack on the lecturer did not nullify the crime committed by him.        
	With the Catholic Church justifying the colleges action, Joseph has decided to approach the Mahatma Gandhi University Appellate Tribunal to get his job back.        
	The bishop of the diocese, George Punnakottil, said the college was accused of being an accomplice in hurting the religious feelings of Muslims and its management had to take a decision to distance itself from the act by Joseph.        
	In a pastoral letter which would be read out in the churches during Sunday mass tomorrow, he said the attack on Joseph did not nullify the crime committed by him, but such an irresponsible act cannot be expected from the lecturer.        
	We stand for secularism and we do not want to offend anybody, the bishop said, adding that Joseph can approach court and the management would abide by its decision.        
	Josephs sister Stella said he has decided to approach the tribunal for reinstating him.        
	I do not want to do anything against the Catholic Church. But the college management is forcing me to go to the tribunal, Stella said, quoting Joseph.        
	Even after getting his dismissal order, Joseph had written to the college management to pardon him. He has touched the feet of the bishop and the manager of the college seeking pardon, she said.        
	Stella, a nun, said she had also met the bishop on July 2, before Joseph was attacked, on behalf of her brother.        
	The family is also upset by the pastoral letter written against Joseph. Stella said the entire family was upset and scared.

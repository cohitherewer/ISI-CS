The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tougher than porcelain, tiptoe past 26/11
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Tougher than porcelain, tiptoe past 26/11
          ARCHIS MOHAN                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: The joint communiqu issued by India and China today had no reference to 26/11, nothing on Pakistans export of terror and no unambiguous support from Beijing for New Delhis bid for a permanent UN Security Council seat.        
	The communiqu had nothing definite either on China taking visible time-bound steps to help India reduce its burgeoning bilateral trade deficit or on allowing greater market access to Indian agro products, IT and pharmaceuticals.         
	The Chinese were not even ready to resolve the issue of stapled visas without detailed discussions.         
	Did this reflect a fragility in the India-China relationship as Chinese envoy to New Delhi Zhang Yang had said on Monday? Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao disagreed. Let me put it this way. This is not a relationship made of porcelain China, she said.         
	Rao stressed the incremental nature of the India-China relationship after the 1962 war and said its foundations had become far more stable.         
	I do not subscribe to any extreme judgement about fragility or that one issue of complexity can shake this relationship at its very foundation, she said.         
	The foreign secretary said the relationship would become stronger with more summit meetings like this one. India and China have agreed to establish a mechanism for regular exchange of visits between the heads of state or government. The hotline between the two Prime Ministers was operationalised three days back.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his speech at the delegation-level talks said he had met Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and President Hu Jintao over 20 times since 2005. Later, Rao stressed how the Prime Minister and Wen enjoyed a good rapport as this was their 11th meeting. India sees Wen as a friend in the Chinese establishment.         
	The foreign secretary said terrorism featured in the talks between Singh and the Chinese Premier. India conveyed its concerns on terrorism emanating from Pakistani soil.         
	Wen, who flies to Islamabad tomorrow, said the Chinese had great sympathy on how Mumbai was attacked. He also talked of terrorist activity in Chinas Xinjiang region. Rao said the Premier detailed Chinas understanding of the situation in Pakistan but refused to divulge the confidential details.         
	In a concession, China agreed that the UNSC resolution number 1267 should be implemented. Beijing had earlier blocked Indias move to have Jamaat-ud-Daawa and its leader Hafiz Saeed included in the resolution which sets out to ban and impose sanctions on all outfits linked to al Qaida and Taliban.         
	Rao said the Chinese Premier brought up the issue of stapled visas himself and said Beijing took Indias concerns very seriously. Wen suggested officials of the two countries should have in-depth consultations to resolve the issue satisfactorily. The ball is in their court, she said.         
	New Delhi has conceded ground on bilateral defence exchanges that it had put on hold after Beijing denied a visa to an army general a few months ago. Both countries should endeavour to create a basis for defence exchanges to continue, Rao said.         
	The two Prime Ministers also discussed the need for reforming the UN Security Council. The joint communique said: China... understands and supports Indias aspiration to play a greater role in the UN, including in the Security Council. However, this is no different from Chinas present stand.         
	The issues of trade imbalance and market access continued to gall the Indians. I think our Chinese friends must know and should know that there is a big imbalance in trade between our two countries.... We have very legitimate concerns in this regard. We need more market access in pharmaceuticals, IT where we are brand leaders in the world, said Rao.         
	In a departure from the last three joint statements, todays did not mention India supporting the one China policy. The issue did come up for discussion... it is not a bone of contention, said the foreign secretary         
	So why did the Prime Minister and the Chinese Premier refuse to hold a media conference? You should ask the Chinese this, she said.         
	Tibetan activists         
	A dozen-odd Tibetan protestors managed to reach the gates of Hyderabad House where the two sides were meeting for their delegation-level talks and shouted slogans asking the Chinese Premier to free Tibet.

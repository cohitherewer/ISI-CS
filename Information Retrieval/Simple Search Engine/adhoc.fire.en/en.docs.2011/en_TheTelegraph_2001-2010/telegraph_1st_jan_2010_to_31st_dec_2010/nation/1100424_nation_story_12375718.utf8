          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rajasthan Royals co-owners Shilpa Shetty and husband Raj Kundra at an IPL awards event in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, April 23: IPL chief executive Sundar Raman today appeared before income-tax authorities and submitted documents the sleuths had sought as part of their probe into the leagues finances.        
	The documents handed have details of franchisees and their ownership, deposits and advances and payments by the franchisees to the IPL. Also made available were copies of final accounts of the IPL since it began in 2008.        
	Raman, who led a team from the cricket board, the BCCI, admitted to the tax officials that service tax dues had been delayed. Revenue officials said the IPL officials told them taxes of around Rs 200 crore had been deducted.        
	The Finance Bill, 2010, makes it clear that the exclusion (from service tax) relating to sponsorship pertaining to sports is being removed. I-T officials have been collecting service tax on sponsorships given to IPL matches. I-T officials may extend their probe to the sponsors to check whether any money over and above what was publicly declared changed hands, and whether any IPL official was a personal beneficiary of such backdoor deals.         
	Of particular interest to the sleuths is how various incomes were treated, and the nature of deals between MSM-Sony and World Sports Group (WSG), the marketing arm of the IPL. MSM tonight denied any wrongdoing and said all deals had been done in a transparent manner, in keeping with applicable laws. The statement, by MSM Satellite (Singapore) Pte Ltd, came against the backdrop of reports that I-T officials were looking into the alleged payment of $80 million as facilitation fee to WSG.        
	Details of player auctions and the conditions attached to player payments have also been given. There is a cap on what teams can pay players but I-T officials have evidence suggesting some got more than their contracted incomes.

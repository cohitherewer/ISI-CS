	Lucknow, Feb. 21: An engineer is missing after alleging that he received death threats from an MLA of Mayavatis BSP, prompting a probe and reviving memories of the murder of an engineer by a ruling party legislator in 2008.        
	Shiv Das, 51, an executive engineer in the irrigation departments Etawah office, had written to chief minister Mayavati and 12 senior government officials alleging that Bhimrao Ambedkar threatened to kill him if he did not install handpumps in the MLAs constituency. Ambedkar has denied threatening him and said Das, who had expressed his desire to quit, was framing him at the behest of rivals.        
	Das has been missing since Friday when his letter reached the chief ministers office. Today, a probe was ordered, almost 48 hours after he wrote to the authorities and the news of his disappearance filled TV channels. The principal secretary (irrigation), K.S. Atoria, will conduct the probe and submit a report in two days.         
	The Uttar Pradesh Association of Engineers has asked the authorities to find him. We dont know where he is. It is the governments duty to bring him back, said an association spokesperson.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Former maids rape finger at diplomat
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Former maids rape finger at diplomat
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: A senior Indian diplomat has been accused by his former maid of raping and torturing her when he was deputy high commissioner in Kenya between 2007 and April 2010.        
	The maid, who is believed to hail from Jharkhand, lodged a complaint against Ketan Shukla with Motinagar police station here last night.        
	An officer said a case of rape and criminal intimidation had been started, and added that the woman had also accused Shukla of failing to pay her dues.        
	Shukla, who is in his late 40s, is now posted in Ahmedabad. He has denied all the allegations, claiming the woman was paid to tarnish my image.        
	The maid has also approached the National Commission for Women, which has sought an action-taken report from the foreign ministry and Delhi police.        
	We have asked for reports from the police and the ministry. We will set up a committee to probe the allegations and necessary action will follow, commission chairperson Girija Vyas told The Telegraph.        
	The matter has just come to the ministrys attention, the ministry spokesperson said. It will be looked into with all the seriousness it deserves. The ministry has always thoroughly investigated every complaint against its officials and taken prompt and suitable action wherever required.        
	The police are yet to question Shukla. A senior officer expressed surprise that the maid, who left Shuklas employment after he returned to Delhi in April, had taken so long to lodge a complaint.        
	An official of an NGO that helped the maid file the complaint said the woman was afraid because Shukla is a senior government official.        
	This is shocking for me and my wife, Shukla told TV channels from Ahmedabad. We treated her like our daughter. She came back to India with us and all her accounts were settled. She never complained to any of her relatives.        
	The maid apparently has an aunt in Delhi whom Shukla knows.        
	Even 10 days ago, she requested my wife for a job. If there was a complaint, she would never have asked us for a job again, Shukla said.        
	It seems she made a complaint against me for money and some people misguided her. I dont know the details of this complaint, but I will definitely take legal action, even (file a case for) defamation.        
	An officer said the maid would undergo a medical examination tomorrow, although the alleged assaults are said to have taken place months ago.

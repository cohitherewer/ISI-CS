          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 12: Prakash Karat today rejected the group of ministers panel formed by the Centre to look into the Bhopal gas tragedy and demanded an independent probe to ascertain how Warren Anderson was let off the hook.         
	Speaking on the sidelines of a tribal convention organised by the party, the CPM general secretary said: It is clear that both the Centre and the state had connived to exonerate Anderson (the Union Carbide chief when the gas leak happened). Therefore it is time for a comprehensive inquiry into how this happened. This cannot be done by a Group of Ministers. It has to be done independently.         
	Asked what kind of an independent inquiry he was demanding  whether it was a CBI probe that he wanted  Karat said his party was in discussions with groups concerned with the matter and would come up with suggestions later.         
	Karat also demanded once again that the Civil Nuclear Liability Bill should be scrapped as it could lead to a worse situation than the Bhopal gas tragedy. Minor changes would be insufficient. Its a shocking piece of legislation. It should be scrapped, Karat said.         
	A number of senior CPM leaders  Sitaram Yechury, M.K. Pandhe, Biman Bose  attended the two-day national convention for tribal rights, aimed at countering Maoist influence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RBI cloud on foreign players payment
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      RBI cloud on foreign players payment
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, April 26: Rajasthan Royals may have to fend for more than their complex stake-holding patterns.        
	Income-tax officials have claimed to have stumbled upon documents that show that at least 33 foreign players, including those from Rajasthan Royals, were paid without clearance from the RBI to play in the IPL.         
	The income-tax claim figures in an interim report of the special investigation team of the department which is probing the IPL.        
	It is not just the Royals, the contract fee of almost all foreign players amounting to Rs 7.63 crore was paid in violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema) norms. They did not have the mandatory clearance from the RBI, a tax official said.        
	In the case of the Rajasthan Royals, the report says, the money was sent from two companies in the UK and Mauritius to the team holding company in India, overlooking the RBI rules.        
	During questioning by tax officials, apparently neither the BCCI nor the IPL officials could give any satisfactory explanation about how the franchise agreement had been signed by Jaipur IPL Pvt Ltd  the holding company of the Rajasthan Royals  when the franchise was won by Emerging Media Cricket Ltd, UK, in the January 2008 auction.        
	Although the franchise money was paid to the BCCI by EM Sports Holding, Mauritius, in which Emerging Media has a stake, it was Jaipur IPL that had claimed the deposit amount, according to documents with the tax department.        
	BCCI president Shashank Manohar said as much at a news conference today.        
	We are asking (suspended IPL chief) Lalit Modi, how can he sign an agreement with A when the bid came from B? he asked.        
	Manohar added that some important papers were missing and the I-T department is buzzing daily about these documents.        
	BCCI chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty said Modi did not provide the board with the original papers of some of the contracts, including those of three losing bids in the inaugural IPL and the media rights deal with Multi Screen Media.

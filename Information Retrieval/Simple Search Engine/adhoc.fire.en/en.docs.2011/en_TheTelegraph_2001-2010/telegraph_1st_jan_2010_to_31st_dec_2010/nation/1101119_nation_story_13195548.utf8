	Chennai, Nov. 18: The messenger was as important as the message he conveyed  the choice of Pranab Mukherjee to represent the Congress at the wedding of M. Karunanidhis grandson in Madurai today was the partys way of saying lets move on.         
	It was Pranab who had played the hatchet man on Sunday when he conveyed to the DMK chief that the Prime Minister wanted telecom minister A. Rajas head over the spectrum scam. Today, the suave Bengali Brahmin turned the smooth harmoniser, blessing the couple  Durai Dayanidhi and Anusha Seetharaman  who got married in Dravidian style.         
	The DMK-Congress alliance formed in 2004 had contributed to the socio-economic progress of the country under UPA I and II, the finance minister said, and added he was confident the two parties would continue to work together for the rest of the UPAs term.         
	In the remaining three-and-a-half-year period, we shall be able to do much more as we remain firmly allied to each other, Mukherjee said, bringing smiles from the DMKs top leadership on the dais.         
	By spelling out that the two parties would complete the UPAs second innings in each others company, Mukherjee reassured the DMK that the Congress was not looking for another ally in Tamil Nadu in the wake of the offer of support from Jayalalithaa. The AIADMK chief was not invited.         
	The choice of the No. 2 in the cabinet to apply the balm on the DMK was a thoughtful tactic by the Congress leadership to heal the wounds of the past few days.         
	The Prime Minister and the UPA chairperson sent their greetings for Durai, the only son of Karunanidhis elder son and Union minister M.K. Alagiri, and Anusha, the daughter of a Chennai lawyer.         
	Manmohan Singh, in his message, said he could not attend the wedding because of a busy schedule. He congratulated the couple and wished them all the best. Sonia also wished the couple a happy married life.         
	Karunanidhi, who had made a desperate effort to save Raja, today devoted a solid portion of his speech to draw parallels between the union of hearts of the young couple and the political coming together of the DMK and the Congress.         
	The presence of senior Congress leaders Pranab Mukherjee and P. Chidambaram at this wedding only illustrates the depth and strength of the bond between our two parties, he said.         
	Raja was present at the wedding.         
	The wedding saw the DMKs first family looking united in contrast with the divisiveness witnessed when the brothers  Alagiri and Stalin  were pushing for Rajas ouster while their half-sister Kanimozhi was backing the former minister.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NRI college quota under SC scanner

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 9: The Supreme Court today questioned the rationale of government colleges having a separate quota for NRI students.         
	Why should government colleges have an NRI quota? a two-judge bench, headed by K.G. Balakrishnan, the Chief Justice of India, said.         
	Calcutta High Court had in September 2004 struck down a decision by the Bengal government to set aside 50 per cent of the seats in two of its medical colleges  the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education amp; Research (better known as SSKM), Calcutta, and the Midnapore Medical College  for NRI-sponsored and NRI students.         
	The high court ruled that such a quota was against Article 14 of the Constitution and struck it down.         
	The state had then appealed in the apex court. Some students too came to the top court alleging discrimination.         
	The Supreme Court initially just slashed the quota percentage from 50 to 15 as permitted in aided and private medical institutions. This led to several NRI students losing their seats to those in the merit category.         
	The Bengal government had announced the scheme in 2003 and filled 50 per cent of the 200-odd seats with NRI students in these institutions for a higher fee of Rs 1 lakh.         
	Under the state rules, these students did not have to sit for an entrance examination and just had to have 50 per cent marks in their Class XII examinations.         
	However, after a prolonged hearing, the apex court today disposed of the petitions after Bengal government counsel Tara Chand Sharma said the scheme had been discontinued. All the students admitted under the quota have graduated.         
	The top court left the question of whether such quotas were violative of the Constitution open, to be decided when the need arose. But not before it had expressed its disapproval of the quota.         
	The counsel for the students, Sanjeev Sen, said the case represented a huge victory for merit over quotas. Though the top court left the issue open, the high court has already struck down NRI quotas as violative of Article 14. That still stands, he said.         
	He said that most of the students admitted under the NRI quota in the 2003-2004 academic year had been sponsored by their NRI relatives or friends. In that sense, the NRI quota was only seeking to create a rich class of students, he contended.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ideal in church,   villain   in film
          JOHN MARY                                                
	Thiruvananthapuram, Sept. 2: Robes off, arc lights on.        
	A Kerala Catholic priest has quit the order to pursue god-given talents, especially acting. And he seems to have reeled off instant success: his debut Malayalam film Nirakazhcha is playing in theatres.        
	Johnson Karoor, in his late 30s, says acting is a worthy vocation, no less than the religious duties he performed for nearly 12 years. But he insists he quit on his own and doesnt have quarrels with the Church.        
	It was in June when I decided to inform my superiors that it was time for me to leave the profession and I did that. They (the Church authorities) published in the official bulletin that henceforth I shall not discharge my sacramental duties. I have the same mobile number I have been using for long (to suggest he is not keeping the career switch a secret) and I still have links with my church and superiors, said Johnson.        
	But the clergy may not be amused. The ex-priest of Malankara Catholic Church has not only taken the unorthodox plunge straight from the pulpit to the screen but plays a villain in the film, an image that may leave queasy many of those who had known him as a preacher until three months back.        
	In Nirakkazhcha (waves of colour), directed by debutant Anish J. Karoor, Johnson befriends an Italian painter (Italian actor Vicenza Bocciarelli) who comes to Kerala to study Raja Ravi Varmas paintings and falls in love with a model.        
	Karoor said his movie had bagged an Italian distributor who would release it with subtitles in over 600 theatres across the European country. The movie featured at the Maratea festival in Italy last month.        
	The director feels Johnson has a bright future under the arc lights, and has decided to cast in his next production, Criminal Love  again a title that sits uneasily with his background.        
	Johnson himself seems keen to break out of the mould for a more exciting life. He has been an orator, has PG degrees in philosophy, psychology, public administration and BEd  he teaches at a BEd college in Alappuzha.        
	Johnson is a singer too, having belted out a devotional music album, and a TV anchor, presenting DD Marathon, a popular sports programme. Now that Im out of the robes, I am trying to pursue my education, acting and whatever I feel like.

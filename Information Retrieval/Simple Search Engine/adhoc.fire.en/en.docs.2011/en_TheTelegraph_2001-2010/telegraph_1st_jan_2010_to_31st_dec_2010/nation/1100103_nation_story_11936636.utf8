The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US defence boss to visit with deals in mind
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US defence boss to visit with deals in mind
          SUJAN DUTTA                          Robert Gates                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 2: US defence secretary Robert Gates is slated to visit India in about a fortnight with the objective of lifting bilateral military relations from a policy-alignment plane to a commercial platform that will translate into larger contracts for American companies.        
	Gates is likely to be in Delhi on a two-day visit in the third week of this month but the dates are yet to be firmed up because he is likely to combine it with trips to other countries as well, a senior government source told The Telegraph.        
	Gates is one of the few key officials in the Bush administration who has been retained by Barack Obama in his cabinet. It was under the Bush administration that military-to-military relations between India and the US were completely transformed, especially after the signing of the 10-year Framework Agreement for the India-US Defence Relationship in 2005.        
	A top defence ministry official confirmed this week that the Defence Acquisitions Council had authorised the outright purchase of howitzers from BAE Land Systems, based in the US, through the Pentagons Foreign Military Sales route. However, India was not closing other options to acquire ultra-light howitzers.        
	Despite the growing closeness in military relations with the Pentagon, there is still some degree of hesitation in New Delhi in awarding contracts in larger numbers for three principal reasons.        
	First, India is unhappy with the level of US military support to Pakistan. Within its defence establishment, senior sources point out that Pakistan uses military hardware received from the US on the plea of fighting the Taliban to reinforce its conventional capabilities against India. They cite the purchase of Harpoon anti-ship missiles that were tweaked for ground-strike purchases.        
	Second, defence minister A.K. Antony is wary of entering into agreements and contracts with the US that could provoke allegations that India was vesting more importance in its military relations with the US despite so long relying mostly on Russian hardware and engaging in defence co-operation with 45 countries.        
	Third, senior defence officials cite a history of sanctions that have thwarted Indias indigenous efforts in defence research and development.        
	Gates last visited India in February 2008. That was followed by Antonys visit to the US in September that year. In November Gates also met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the US.        
	With the two countries agreeing in July last year to freeze a standard text for an end-use monitoring programme of military equipment the US sells to India, America is keen that India also sign a Logistics Support Agreement (LSA) and a Communications Interoperability and Security Memorandum of Agreement (Cismoa).        
	A top defence ministry official said this week that the LSA was still under examination. The likelihood of the agreement, proposed four years back, being clinched shortly is remote. It is more likely that the two sides would get closer to agreeing on the Cismoa.        
	But within the framework of the policy agreements, the US is keener that defence trade should increase after the civilian nuclear deal was clinched.        
	In 2008, India contracted six Lockheed Martin-made C-130J Hercules aircraft for $ 1.1 billion, the largest defence contract to the US. Early last year, India also contracted Boeing-made P8I maritime surveillance aircraft.        
	In October, in the largest deployment of its kind outside Iraq and Afghanistan, the US shipped 17 Strykers, its most modern ground-fighting vehicles to India for the war games christened Yudh Abhyas 09 in the Indian armys armoured training establishment at Babina.        
	The Stryker is capable of carrying 11 troops in its infantry-carrying version. It can be reconfigured for multiple roles  surveillance, attack and heavy mobile firepower and is said to be equipped with gear for protection from chemical, nuclear and biological weapons.        
	Officials from the Pentagons defence sales department and companies Lockheed Martin and Raytheon were present at Babina during the exercise. Along with the Strykers, they demonstrated the shoulder-fired Javelin anti-tank missiles during the 18-day war games.        
	In November, the Indian Army issued requests for information to buy 100 armoured personnel carriers that can be transported in aircraft and by ships. The eight-wheeled Stryker all-terrain vehicles made by General Dynamics are estimated to cost upwards of $ 1.3 million each. It is also the US armys first new armoured vehicle in 20 years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hint of hardball in Headley spar   Pillai says US sat tight on information
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hint of hardball in Headley spar
   Pillai says US sat tight on information          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           The suite at ITC Maurya where Barack Obama will stay                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 27: Union home secretary G.K. Pillai today expressed disappointment that American agencies had not shared information on David Headley with India, the open accusation coming days before President Barack Obama arrives in the country.         
	We were disappointed that the name of David Headley was not provided to us either before 26/11 or post-26/11. If we had known, then we could have nabbed him when he came here in March 2009, Pillai told reporters.         
	Headley was part of the planning for the terror attack on Mumbai and visited Indian cities several times, even after 26/11.         
	Pillais statement suggests Indian authorities are in a combative mood over the US stand on Pakistan and are looking for hardnosed bargaining with Obama. New Delhi is disappointed with Washingtons $2.6-billion aid package to Pakistan, at least part of which will be ploughed into anti-India activity, it feels. It is also unhappy with US aid to Islamabad to build up its conventional warfare capacities.         
	In an interview to a TV channel today, Pillai said: The Lashkar-e-Toiba is now becoming global in its operations. Therefore, it is absolutely essential for all countries to co-operate in the fight against terrorism.         
	Pakistan-based Lashkar is accused of plotting the November 2008 attack on Mumbai.        
	US ambassador Timothy J. Roemer said America could not be accused of not sharing information and that Indian agencies were allowed unprecedented access. We werent afraid of what he would say (to Indian agencies), Roemer said at an event here.         
	Pillai, who had talked tough on Pakistan before the India-Pakistan foreign minister-level talks earlier this year, asserted that the US had not shared any information on Headley till it became public that the Lashkar linkman was arrested in Chicago in October 2009.         
	Roemers remarks appeared to be in reply to the Indian assumption that Headley was a US double agent, which is why information about him was not shared earlier. Headley was arrested only after he went rogue, Indian intelligence agencies have deduced.         
	It appears certain that Headley will be discussed during Obamas visit next month. Sources said the counter-terrorism discussion could centre on 26/11 and Headley.         
	Having learnt a lesson from the Headley experience and given that the US would eventually exit from Afghanistan, the home ministry is planning to de-link Indias intelligence gathering from dependence on US assets in West Asia and South Asia.         
	We would like to depend on our own network which we would expand and strengthen, said a source. External intelligence agency RAWs mandate would then be expanded.

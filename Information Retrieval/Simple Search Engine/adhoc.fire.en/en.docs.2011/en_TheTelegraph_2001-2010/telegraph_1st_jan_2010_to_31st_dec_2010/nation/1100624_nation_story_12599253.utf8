The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Big player test for new IPL chief
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Big player test for new IPL chief
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, June 23: Chirayu Amin faces his first test as interim IPL chief tomorrow when he sits across the table with the franchise owners, most of whom are backers of suspended commissioner Lalit Modi, and thrashes out prickly issues, prime among them player retention for the fourth season next year.         
	The franchise owners are themselves divided on player retention since the three-year contract period is over and all cricketers, including the icon members, are now up for auction.         
	Most teams are plugging to scrap the player retention policy for a more level-playing field. The three-year contract period is over. So let all of them be on the auction table. If teams continue to hold on to their preferred players by paying them huge salaries, other franchisees lose out and never get an opportunity to build squads of their choice and requirement, said a source in Rajasthan Royals.        
	However, a few franchisees, which bank heavily on their icon players to build their city-associated brands, do not agree.        
	We are not comfortable with a situation where we might have to part with Sachin Tendulkar. If player retention is disallowed, we would want a provision that allows us the first right of refusal, said a Mumbai Indians source.        
	Ditto for the Shah Rukh Khan-owned Kolkata Knight Riders, which has Sourav Ganguly as icon player, and current champions Chennai Super Kings, which relies on Mahendra Singh Dhoni.        
	To build consensus among the team owners, a middle-of-the-road solution is being looked at.        
	During the player auction, each team can be given two cards  one for the first right of refusal for one Indian player and another for a foreign cricketer. For example, if the top bid for Sourav Ganguly is pegged at $1.5 million, then KKR could use the card to bid $1.5 million and automatically retain him even if another franchise bids the maximum amount, said a franchise official.        
	Vijay Mallya, the owner of Royal Challengers Bangalore who is considered close to Modi, will be the representative of the franchisees at the meeting.         
	Other prickly issues like the BCCIs suggestions about fewer IPL matches and the possibility of lower central sponsorship revenues due to the entry of two new teams  Pune and Kochi  in the league could raise temperatures.        
	The team owners also want a franchisee to be made a member of the IPL governing council  a demand that may put cricket board BCCI in a spot as secretary N. Srinivasan is the boss of India Cements, which owns Chennai Super Kings.

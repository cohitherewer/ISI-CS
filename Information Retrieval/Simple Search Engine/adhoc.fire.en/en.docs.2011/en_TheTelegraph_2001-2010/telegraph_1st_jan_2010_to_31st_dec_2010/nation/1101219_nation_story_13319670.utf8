The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fake degree row hits Pak 26/11 trial
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Fake degree row hits Pak 26/11 trial
                            
	Islamabad, Dec. 18 (PTI): The trial of seven Pakistani suspects charged with involvement in the Mumbai attacks took an unexpected turn today when prosecutors alleged that one of the defence lawyers possessed a fake degree and should be barred from appearing in court.        
	As judge Rana Nisar Ahmed, of the Rawalpindi-based anti-terrorism court began proceedings, the prosecution team produced an FIR filed against defence lawyer Shahbaz Rajput by officials of the Rawalpindi Bar Association that alleged he possessed a fake law degree.        
	The prosecutors demanded that Rajput be barred from appearing in the court. The prosecution also produced the president of the bar association in court to support their argument.        
	Rajput contested the prosecutions claim during the in-camera proceedings and produced documents saying that his degree had been verified by the Rawalpindi Bar Council, sources said.         
	He said the FIR had been filed against him on December 1 by the president and general secretary of the Rawalpindi Bar Association in a bid to pressurise him to stop acting as counsel for the suspects in the 26/11 attacks.        
	He alleged that the general secretary of the bar association, whose election was declared void by the court, had registered the case against him on behalf of elements who did not want him to defend the accused.        
	This is a malicious, illegal and malafide step to pressurise me. The prosecution wants to remove me from this case but I will continue defending my client because it is my right to do so, he said.        
	The case was subsequently adjourned till January 8 by the judge.        
	Rajput contended that it was the responsibility of the bar council, and not the bar association, to verify the authenticity of the law degrees possessed by the lawyers. I have got my degrees independently verified by the bar council and I have been practising law for almost eight years, he said.         
	The court, so far, has recorded the testimony of only one out of over 160 witnesses while the judge has been changed thrice.

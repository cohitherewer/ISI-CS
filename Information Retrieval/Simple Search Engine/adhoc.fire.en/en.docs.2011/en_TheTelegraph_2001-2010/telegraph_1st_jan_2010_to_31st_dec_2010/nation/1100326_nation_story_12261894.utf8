	Bhubaneswar, March 25: Fish as health food? Think again.        
	Peta (People for the ethical treatment of animals) has come out with a report, Assessment of animal welfare and environmental impact of Indian fisheries and aquaculture, that disputes the idea.         
	Fish accumulates high levels of toxic chemicals in their flesh and fat that are known to cause cancer and brain degeneration. Fish consumption is the sole source of human exposure to mercury that is known to cause severe health problems, including brain damage, memory loss and personality change, says the report.        
	Speaking to reporters, activists of the animal rights group urged people of Orissa to leave fish off their plates for their own good. According to investigators, ponds in many government fish farms were kept in such unhygienic conditions that they were no better than drainage water and many fishes forced to live in dirty water contracted skin diseases.         
	Many fishes went insane from the cramped conditions and lack of space in fish farms. Knocking against each other and the sides of the enclosure caused sores and damaged their fins as well.         
	Because the law does not protect them from cruel treatment, fishes were impaled, crushed, suffocated or sliced open and gutted, all while they are fully conscious.        
	Fish are not swimming vegetables. They feel and experience pain. Every effort must be taken to treat these animals better. What happens to the fish before they end up on your plate is nothing short of cruelty to animals, said senior campaigner Nikunj Sharma. By leaving fish off your plate, youll be doing your part to end their suffering. With so many reasons not to eat fish and so many delicious vegetarian alternatives, choosing a fish-free diet is not very difficult.         
	On the effect of such abstinence on the fishing community and their livelihood, Sharma said the government should provide them an alternative livelihood option just like it did for the tongawalas in Delhi. This has to be done for the larger benefit of the population, he added.        
	One quarter of the worlds fish stocks is over-exploited, depleted or recovering from depletion, according to a 2005 UN FAO report.         
	Oceans would be empty of fish by 2048 because of overfishing, according to another report.        
	India is the worlds third largest producer of fish, accounting for almost 64 lakh tonnes of fish taken from the water every year. Although sharks are protected under the Wildlife Protection Act 72, it has been found that sharks and dolphins were killed openly at government-owned ports, read a report.

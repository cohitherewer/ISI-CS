	Ratnagiri, April 24 (PTI): Income-tax officials have collected some papers from the Delhi office of civil aviation minister Praful Patel in connection with the IPL probe, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said today.        
	The authorities never questioned Patel in this connection. Only some papers were collected from his office in New Delhi, Pawar said.        
	Pawar rubbished the charge that Patel was involved in any wrong-doing.

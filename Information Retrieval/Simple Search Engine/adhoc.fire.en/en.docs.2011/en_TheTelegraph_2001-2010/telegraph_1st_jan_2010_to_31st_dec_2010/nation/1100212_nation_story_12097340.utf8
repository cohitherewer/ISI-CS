	Bangalore, Feb. 11: The head of a radical Hindu outfit whose activists were accused of assaulting women at a Mangalore pub last year had his face smeared with black ink by youngsters during a TV panel discussion.        
	Sri Rama Senes Pramod Mutalik was also yanked off his chair before police and several members of the audience at Bangalores Town Hall, where he was one of the speakers in the discussion on whether Valentines Day should be celebrated.        
	Last year, his outfit had threatened to forcibly marry couples found together on February 14.         
	Mutalik pointed a finger at Youth Congress workers. It is their goonda culture, Mutalik said as he stepped out of the venue where the programme was being filmed for a private Kannada channel.

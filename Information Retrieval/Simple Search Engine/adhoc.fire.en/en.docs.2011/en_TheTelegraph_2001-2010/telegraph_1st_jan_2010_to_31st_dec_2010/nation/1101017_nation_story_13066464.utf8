	Ahmedabad, Oct. 16 (PTI): The Congress has sought a report from the partys Gujarat unit on its recent defeat in six municipal corporation polls.        
	In the elections, the results of which were declared on Tuesday, the BJP won five (Ahmedabad, Surat Rajkot, Vadodara and Bhavnagar) with two-thirds majority while one (Jamnagar) was won by Gujarats ruling party with a simple majority.         
	Congress leaders in the state had blamed electronic voting machines for the partys defeat in the civic elections, saying the machines had been tampered with.        
	However, the Election Commission has said it is not possible to tweak the machines.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong prefers brief central rule in Ranchi
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong prefers brief central rule in Ranchi

	New Delhi, April 28: The Congress leadership is not keen on jumping into the political turmoil in Jharkhand and is in favour of a brief spell of Presidents rule in the state.         
	The party is also denying that it struck a deal with Shibu Soren for securing his vote in Parliament.        
	The Congress restricted its official response to a non-committal wait-and-watch position with spokesperson Manish Tiwari saying the party never takes its decisions in haste.        
	But other leaders claimed that there was no question of propping up a Soren-led government. I rule out that possibility. If the JMM unconditionally extends support to our chief minister, we may consider. But so far, no decision has been taken, a senior leader said.        
	The majority view in the party is that the state is again headed for Presidents rule. Even if some key players prefer fresh elections, I think the Assembly will be placed under suspended animation and the governor will wait for a credible alternative to emerge. We have to take into account Babulal Marandis antipathy towards Soren. It is not going to be easy at all, another leader said.        
	Sources said Marandi, a Congress ally, was not inclined to any understanding with Soren.         
	A few leaders from Jharkhand are lobbying the high command to explore the options of leading the government but the party thinks many issues will have to be settled before getting into any deal with the JMM.        
	The approach to the Naxalite problem is one vital question. The home ministry will have serious reservations against Soren and prefers Presidents rule, a leader said.        
	Keshava Rao, the AICC in-charge of Jharkhand, was evasive. Although he said no decision had been taken, he said nobody was untouchable in politics and all options were open before the party. He held discussions with Jharkhand leaders and is waiting to meet Sonia Gandhi.        
	These leaders said it was possible someone requested Soren to support the government as we did to every party, including the BJP. That does not mean we plotted the fall of the Jharkhand government and promised Soren anything in the state or at the Centre.        
	If we go to election, we will gain. If we align with Soren, it will hurt us immensely. I dont know why should we accept something we rejected in the beginning four months ago, a senior state leader said.        
	The Congress also has problems in getting the support of the RJD because of its fight with Lalu Prasad in Bihar that is heading to polls. Leaders from Bihar will ask the high command to wait for six months if any compromises are necessary in Jharkhand.

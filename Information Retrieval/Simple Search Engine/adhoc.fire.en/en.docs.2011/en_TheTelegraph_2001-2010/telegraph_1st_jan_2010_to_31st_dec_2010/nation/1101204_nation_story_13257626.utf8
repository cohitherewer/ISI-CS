                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      When a rebel carps, groom an heir     -  Jagan lesson for Congress from rivals
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                                      
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: If the Congress is hoping to draw lessons from other parties to tackle rebels like Jaganmohan Reddy, one chapter will stand out: wherever parent organisations could prop a strong local leader, dissidents had not been able to gain much traction.        
	Such revolts can be a blight or a blessing, depending on various circumstances. Not the least on whether the dissident who departs  usually in a blaze of glory, martyrdom and hyperbole  can sustain the simulated aura until the crucial test that awaits him in an election.        
	Uma Bharti is a classic example of a rebel who lost her roar. When she quit mid-course as the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, the BJP feared the worst in a state it wrested from the Congress after 10 years and was understandably keen to hold on to.         
	The party felt that the backward class votes she had regrouped in a long time might scatter away. It was certain that its core Hindutva base might wither away.        
	Worse, for some inexplicable reason, the BJP concluded that the RSS would support her against the party and, therefore, she would carry the cadres with her. Bharti fanned the BJPs apprehensions by blowing hot and cold towards it even when she finally left.         
	But Shivraj Singh Chauhan busted the notions by not only ensuring that the first government completed its term but also by securing a second mandate for the BJP.         
	He delivered on all the pluses attributed to Bharti and more. Unlike the extreme image she projected, especially after the Babri demolition, Chauhan gave an impression that he was not against the minorities and softened the edge of their opposition towards the BJP.        
	Today, out in the cold, Bhartis aides tell journalists every now and then that she would give her right arm to return to the BJP. Its leaders dont want to take a chance yet.        
	On the other hand, Raj Thackeray  of the Amchi Marathi notoriety  has become a thorn in the Shiv Senas flesh. Sena leader Bal Thackeray was able to absorb the blow caused by his nephews exit just once. In the municipal corporation polls that were held shortly thereafter, the Sena came on top and for a while it seemed as though Raj was a political cipher.        
	However, Thackeray seniors heir apparent Uddhav was eventually no match for his charismatic cousin who played the pro-Marathi card with more conviction.        
	The Senas alliance with the BJP, which made no bones about its discomfort with the anti-north Indian migrants plank, diluted its rhetoric. Raj carried no such baggage. The Congress exploited the family fissures to the hilt and secured term after term for itself and the NCP in Maharashtra.                  Congress MP Jaganmohan Reddy, law minister Veerappa Moily and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in Hyderabad. File picture       
	Sena sources admitted that if the Thackeray patriarch did not make up with his estranged nephew before the next Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, the Congress-NCP combine is there to stay, scam or no scam.        
	If Madhya Pradesh demolished the myth of personality over ideology and organisation, Maharashtra held the opposite lesson for the Sena.        
	Uttar Pradesh proved the point about the supremacy of personalities over parties in two cases: when Kalyan Singh revolted against the BJP twice, he caused irreparable harm to it. For a while, Atal Bihari Vajpayees persona saw the party through a couple of Lok Sabha elections.        
	But the Kalyan vacuum remained unfulfilled. Somehow, he was able to ably enmesh Hindutva and a pro-OBC image in his politics and personality like nobody else, an Uttar Pradesh BJP MP said.        
	Uma, too, did it but Chauhan, also an OBC of RSS provenance, slipped into her shoes successfully. There was no Chauhan in Uttar Pradesh.        
	When Azam Khan deserted the Samajwadi Party, Muslims turned against Mulayam Singh Yadav. Khans departure coincided with Mulayams pact with Kalyan. Had he not signed on Kalyan, his close aides said, he could have contained the Khan effect. Mulayam had to reinduct the former rebel to re-establish his pro-Muslim credentials.        
	Mayavati has managed to survive internal insurrections so far. Her Dalit, Muslim and OBC colleagues leave her every now and then. She thrives and the dissidents usually lapse into anonymity.        
	So do the larger parties cope better with insubordination than the smaller ones? Not necessarily. The BJP is regretting the loss of Babulal Marandi in Jharkhand while Nitish Kumar was untouched by the defiance of former lieutenants Lallan Singh and Prabhunath Singh.        
	The Congress, which will find it difficult to come up with a YSR fast, will now have to gauge if Kiran Kumar Reddy has what it took Chauhan to tame the Bharti effect.

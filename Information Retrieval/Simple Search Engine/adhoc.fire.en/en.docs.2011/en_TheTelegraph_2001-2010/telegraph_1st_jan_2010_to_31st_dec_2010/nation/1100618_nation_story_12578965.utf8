	Bhopal, June 17: Manmohan Singhs group of ministers on the Bhopal gas tragedy has competition now.        
	A five-member committee set up by Madhya Pradeshs BJP government wants the state authorities to re-frame charges against the offenders and chase former Union Carbide chief Warren Anderson.         
	The recommendations were submitted, and approved, by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan today  a day before the central ministerial group meets.         
	The state panel has also proposed the Chauhan government file a curative petition against the Supreme Courts 1996 decision, diluting the charges, and appeal last weeks judgment in the sessions court.

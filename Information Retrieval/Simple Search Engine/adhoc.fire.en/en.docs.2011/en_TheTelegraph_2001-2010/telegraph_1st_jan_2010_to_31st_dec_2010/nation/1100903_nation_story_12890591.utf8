	New Delhi, Sept. 2 (PTI): Fundamental rights of an undertrial cannot be violated for the convenience of escorting policemen, a Delhi court has said, dismissing the plea of Tihar jail authorities to handcuff a prisoner.        
	Additional sessions judge Girish Kathpalia cited a Supreme Court order that no prisoner should be handcuffed or fettered routinely, merely for convenience of the custodian or escorts.         
	Even if the report from reliable jail sources is to be believed that UTP (undertrial prisoner) Ravi Kapoor will try to escape from custody, the convenience of the escorting staff cannot be a ground to abrogate the fundamental rights of this prisoner, the judge said.        
	He directed the jail authorities to increase the number of guards with the prisoner if they apprehended that Kapoor could escape. In the present case, jail authorities have not been able to make out any case that there is a clear and present danger of Kapoor breaking out of police control, the judge said.        
	The jail authorities argued that Kapoor, who had allegedly tried to escape from the custody of police escorts in the past, needed to be handcuffed. Kapoor is facing charges in over three dozen criminal cases, including the high-profile murder of TV journalist Soumya Vishwanathan and IT executive Jigisha Ghosh in Delhi.         
	Of the several grounds mentioned by the jail authorities, only the fear that Kapoor could try to escape is worth looking into. None of the other grounds, namely the misbehaviour or threatening attitude, is worth even being looked into, the judge said.

	New Delhi, Sept. 23: Security agencies are listening in to phone conversations to pick up any threat to the Commonwealth Games.         
	A team of eavesdroppers from the Intelligence Bureau and the National Technical Research Organisation is being assisted by interception specialists from the armys 200 Signal Corps.        
	Commonwealth Games, for instance, could be a key word besides others such as bombs or any other anticipated words that could be used by terrorists or anti-social elements, said a source.         
	With threats from the Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammed, the security agencies are trying to make the most of technical intelligence. Anything amiss will be immediately reported to the International Security Liaison Cell set up at Claridges hotel.         
	On a need-to-know basis, information will be routed to Delhi police or any other agency the cell deems fit to handle a particular issue. Delhi police are, however, expected to be kept in the loop at all times.         
	During the trial run, the home ministry was informed of the contents of a call that a young man involved with the management of the Commonwealth Games received from Switzerland because the Games figured in the conversation. It was found to be a harmless call.         
	The security liaison cell holds daily morning briefings under a senior home ministry official with security liaison officers from participating nations.         
	It also reviews daily the security arrangements in Delhi and does an overview of incidents across the country.         
	The phone interception exercise is the latest to be added to a list of several firsts being tried to secure the biggest sports event in the country after the 1982 Asian Games.         
	While the armys signals engineers are specialists in interception, the government has made good use of the air force as well. At least three unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will fly from the Hindon airbase near Delhi on the days of the opening and closing ceremonies on October 3 and 14 to look out for any flying terrorists.         
	The aerostat  an eye in the sky  is also being used to watch the happenings on the ground. The government is worried that para-gliders might attack the Games from the skies.

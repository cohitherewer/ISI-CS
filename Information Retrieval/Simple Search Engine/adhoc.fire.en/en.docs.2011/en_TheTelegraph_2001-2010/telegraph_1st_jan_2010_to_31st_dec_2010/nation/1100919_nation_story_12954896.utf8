	New Delhi, Sept. 18: Qualified rural youth now have a chance to get a government job, if only on contract, with 12 lakh technical vacancies opening up in gram panchayats across the country.        
	The panchayati raj ministry headed by C.P. Joshi has decided that each gram panchayat will be allowed to recruit between four and six persons, including engineers, accountants and computer technicians.        
	There are 2.5 lakh panchayats in the country. The state selection commissions will make the selection and preference will be given to local residents.        
	Most of our panchayats face a severe shortage of efficient hands, especially technical ones. This became evident during the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.        
	Hence, we have decided to recruit more hands. We hope this will create a back-up mechanism for various rural development programmes, a ministry official said.        
	The appointments will be mostly on contract but with all the benefits given to government employees. But unlike the sarkari babus, promotions will be given on the basis of performance, the official said. Our main intention is not just to recruit more hands but to bring professionalism into the panchayati raj system.        
	The scheme will be rolled out first in the gram panchayats in Maoist-affected districts, the ministry official said.        
	The panchayats are now running various flagship programmes of the UPA government, including the NREGA, Indira Awaas Yojana and the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. Hence the proposal to have more hands at the local level did not meet with any resistance, he added.        
	The Centre and the states will share the expenses. The new recruits will help with all aspects of panchayat governance, but their priority will be NREGA. They will be housed in the Rajiv Gandhi Seva Kendras being built across the country as village-level knowledge resource centres.        
	These kendras will act as mini-secretariats which will serve as the nodal point for the execution and monitoring of all rural development programmes, a senior official said.        
	Once the recruitment is completed, all the gram panchayats will be information and communication technology-enabled. A survey by the ministry had found that barely 60,000 gram panchayats have proper buildings while the rest make do with makeshift structures.        
	Joshi is to meet all the state rural development ministers on September 22, when the proposal will be fine tuned. The scheme will be launched within two months.

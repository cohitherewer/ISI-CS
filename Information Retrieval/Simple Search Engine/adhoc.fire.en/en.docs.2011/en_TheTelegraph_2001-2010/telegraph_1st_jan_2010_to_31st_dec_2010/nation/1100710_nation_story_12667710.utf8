          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 9: The Supreme Court today scoffed at a Tamil Nadu law seeking to regulate jallikattu (bullfighting) and asked the government to further tighten its provisions.        
	The court suggested a narrower window in which the traditional sport would be allowed in a year. It expressed surprise over the 2009 law that permits the sport to be held from January to May.        
	Its a harvest festival. It is supposed to be held much before summer. Now you have brought it forward till the monsoons, a two-judge bench said. This seems to have become a money-spinning industry.        
	Some people appeared to be organising the event for commercial purposes, it said. To check this, the state should consider restricting the sport only to January and February, the court said.        
	It also asked the state to consider if the deposit amount mandatory for all persons seeking to organise the event could be increased from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 20 lakh.        
	This amount is kept in the custody of the collector, who sanctions the licences, to award compensation in case of death or injury. The court said Rs 2 lakh was too small an amount.        
	We dont want to hear that there is no money to pay compensation, the bench said. A sum of Rs 20 lakh would be sufficient to cover any compensation and also act as a deterrent, it said.        
	The court had, at the intervention of the Animal Welfare Board, banned the sport only to partially lift the ban at the request of the state, which claimed that peoples religious feelings would be hurt.

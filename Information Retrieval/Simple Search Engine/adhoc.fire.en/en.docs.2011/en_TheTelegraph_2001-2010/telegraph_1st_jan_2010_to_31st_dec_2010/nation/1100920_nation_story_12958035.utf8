	New Delhi, Sept. 19: Former Andhra Pradesh governor N.D. Tiwari has challenged a Delhi High Court order to pay Rs 75,000 as costs for a petition intended to stall the hearing of a paternity suit filed against him by lawyer Rohit Singh.         
	The court, in its August 13 order, dismissed Tiwaris application seeking to delete references to a 2005 incident. Singh, who claims he is Tiwaris son out of wedlock, had sought an appointment with Tiwari. He alleged that the Congress leader had avoided him.         
	The court said Tiwaris application was intended to cause grave prejudice to Singh.

          PTI AND OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: The ordeal of a couple based in Orissa has prompted the Supreme Court to chide airlines for frequent loss of passengers bags and upheld a Rs 9.3 lakh penalty imposed on international carrier Royal Jordanian Airlines for misplacing baggage.        
	Aap log to passengers ko pareshan kar rakha hai (you have harassed the passengers). These days, there are a lot of complaints from passengers that their baggage is missing. The airlines must be made accountable for such losses, a bench of Justices Markandeya Katju and T.S. Thakur said.        
	The apex court made the remarks while dismissing an appeal filed by the airline challenging the findings recorded by the Orissa State Consumer Commission and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. The two consumer bodies had taken up the travails of Niladri Kumar Mohanti and Sanghamitra Mohanti.        
	 Poor people. They were forced to spend 15 days without their clothes. How do you expect them to lodge a complaint immediately? They would first obviously go to the shop to purchase their clothes, the bench snapped at senior counsel A. Sundaram, who was representing the Royal Jordanian Airlines, when he tried to cite technical flaws in the complaint.        
	The couple in their complaint had said that they booked two tickets on the airlines flight from Calcutta to Londons Heathrow Airport via Amman on May 17, 2001. However, their baggage was found stolen in Amman.         
	Although the couple had taken up the matter with the airline, the staff told them to pursue the matter once they reached Heathrow.        
	But even after landing at Heathrow, the airline merely said their complaint had been recorded and they would be informed of further development. The couple had tried to meet the airport manager who avoided them, the complaint said.        
	According to the couple, they were forced to spend 15 days without a change of clothes, toiletries and other necessities in London before returning to Calcutta on June 6, 2001.        
	As the tickets were booked in Cuttack, where the couple lived, they filed a complaint with the state consumer panel, which held the airline guilty and awarded a compensation of Rs 8,02,230 towards loss of baggage and Rs 1 lakh as compensation for deficiency in service.        
	The airline challenged the award before the national commission, which dismissed the appeal and imposed an additional Rs 7,500 towards cost of litigation by the couple.        
	Senior counsel Yeshwant Dass and counsel Sudarsh Menon appeared for the Orissa-based couple.

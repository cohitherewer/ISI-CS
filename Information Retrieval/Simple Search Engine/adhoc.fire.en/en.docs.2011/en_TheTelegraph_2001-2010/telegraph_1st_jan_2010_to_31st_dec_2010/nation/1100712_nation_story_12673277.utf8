The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mehbooba rejects PM appeal
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mehbooba rejects PM appeal
  - PDP chief says government should remove army, rails at Omar for acting like George Bush        MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah speaks at a meeting of National Conference and Congress MLAs in Srinagar on Sunday. (PTI)                                        
	Srinagar, July 11: Mehbooba Mufti has rejected a request from the Prime Minister to attend tomorrows all-party meeting in Kashmir, apparently backtracking on signals emitted yesterday.        
	The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief also accused chief minister Omar Abdullah of acting like George Bush when he rang her yesterday with the same appeal.        
	Manmohan Singh had called Mehbooba last evening within hours of PDP sources saying the party wouldnt heed Omars call but would change its mind if a request came from the Prime Minister.        
	But Mehbooba today said her party would stay away from the meeting because the states ruling National Conference had lost credibility among the people. It was very kind of the Prime Minister that he called me yesterday. I have a deep regard and respect for him, she said. It was painful to convey my inability to attend the meeting. I told him the situation was very bad and that we needed to reach out to the people.        
	Manmohan Singhs intervention has left several National Conference leaders fuming. The PDP is playing politics, first by seeking the Prime Ministers intervention and then by snubbing him. This will help it gain political mileage here and weaken the chief ministers position by projecting that he is not in command, a leader said.        
	He added: Mehbooba praises the Prime Minister but is harsh on the CRPF, though it is under the command of Manmohan Singhs government.        
	Omar has called the all-party meeting to try and evolve a united response to the unfolding crisis in Kashmir, where 15 people have died in alleged security force action in the past month. A police officer said curfew had been lifted in most parts of the Valley today but restrictions remained in some places.        
	Mehbooba berated Omar for his phone call yesterday, saying he had behaved like former US President George W. Bush. He was acting like George Bush, that either you are with us or with them. (He said) if I attended I would become the solution; if I didnt I would become part of the problem.        
	She said her party wanted the Prime Minister to step in and defuse the crisis. There is a need for a bigger initiative that will be taken seriously by the people. Since the Prime Minister has credibility, I request him to intervene.        
	The PDP president suggested the government do four things to restore the peoples confidence: The crackdown by the state government should end; the curbs on the media should be lifted; the Prime Minister should look into the FIR registered against journalists; the army should be recalled.        
	Mehbooba added that the government is hiding its failures and has exhausted all force (options) to suppress the anger. The chief minister has demonised his own people by dubbing the entire population stone-throwers. Therefore, we asked the Prime Minister to excuse us.

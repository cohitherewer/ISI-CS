          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           
	New Delhi, May 23: The government is mulling constituting an independent agency to investigate plane crashes.         
	The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), at present, frames rules for the aviation sector, certifies air worthiness of an aircraft, gives licences to pilots and investigates accidents  a role which has been criticised as a conflict of interest.         
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel has hinted that India may soon have an independent authority on the lines of the US National Transportation Safety Board to investigate aviation accidents.         
	The autonomous body is likely to be called the Civil Aviation Authority of India.

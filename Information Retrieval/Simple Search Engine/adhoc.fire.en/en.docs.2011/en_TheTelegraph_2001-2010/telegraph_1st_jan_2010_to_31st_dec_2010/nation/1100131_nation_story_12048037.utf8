                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Amar discovers virtues of Maya amp; Sonia
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Amar Singh                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: Out on a limb, Amar Singh is trying to tap two women for protection.        
	The former Samajwadi Party general secretary, who hasnt found any takers yet after parting with Mulayam Singh Yadav, has reached out to Mayavati, a sworn enemy till the other day, and Sonia Gandhi whom he once dubbed a pizza queen.        
	Today, he described them as political personalities in their own right.        
	The feelers came even as Amar warned Mulayam not to think he was a domestic dog who would return if he didnt find a shelter.        
	His search for political refuge went back 15 years as Amar said he sensed the pain Mayavati had felt when supporters of Mulayam surrounded a guest house she had locked herself in after withdrawing support to a BSP-Samajwadi alliance.        
	...When she decided to withdraw support and Mulayam Singh lost power, Mulayam Singh and the Yadav clan surrounded her in the guest house and ill-treated her, Amar said, recalling the 1995 incident.        
	Right now, he added, he felt like how Mayavati must have then. I am being treated the same way, Amar said, adding that the BSP boss had proved herself in Uttar Pradesh against all odds.        
	As for Sonia, Amar said the Congress chief had proved herself in India against all adversities.        
	Amar said his former party had made the mistake of thinking he was friendless.        
	As a spokesperson we have misused him very badly, he has fiercely opposed Congress so Congress will not accept him.... He has fought with (L.K.) Advani so BJP will not take him and, in the recent past, he has fought with Mayavati so Maya will not take him. Where can a domestic dog go? He will have to return, Amar told a television channel.        
	(But) I am not a man without alternative, he warned Mulayam.        
	A political source in the BSP and two official aides of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, however, separately confirmed that knowing Mayavati, she was unlikely to respond to Amars feelers.        
	The question doesnt arise. She has tracked his career and seen his penchant for creating trouble within a party, an official aide said.        
	The aide said Mayavatis calculations were solely political. She will assess what she will gain by bringing in Amar Singh. He is not going to bring the Thakur votes because this community rarely gets swayed by its caste leaders and invariably votes with the winning side. Some persons are suggesting that he is resourceful but the chief minister does not need his resources at the moment.        
	Another source said Amars lifeline was the media. He will not fit in with the BSP culture because for us, silence is golden.        
	Despite the public posture, sources said efforts were on to set up a backroom meeting between Amar and Mayavatis emissaries.        
	BSP insiders said Amar was desperate to save himself from impending trouble in an alleged financial fraud. Uttar Pradesh police had last year filed an FIR accusing Amar and his wife of merging some companies they owned to convert black money into white.        
	Amar had threatened to file a criminal defamation case against Mayavati but did not. Without a strong political shield, he is feeling vulnerable, a source close to the BSP chief said.        
	It remains to be seen if Amar also reaches out to two other women  Mamata Banerjee and Jayalalithaa  in his quest for refuge.        
	He once shared a dais with Mamata at a public meeting in Nandigram and has occasionally invited himself to her place for a maach-bhaat (fish curry and rice) meal.         
	In 2007, Amar had roped in ADMK chief Jayalalithaa for a short-lived front floated by the Samajwadi and the Left.

	New Delhi, April 7: Delhi High Court today issued notices to the human resource development ministry and two key decision-making bodies of the IITs on a public interest litigation (PIL) demanding an inquiry into admission discrepancies in 2006.         
	Admitting a PIL filed by lawyer Prashant Bhushan on behalf of Professor Rajeev Kumar of IIT Kharagpur, the court issued notices to the IIT Council and the Joint Admission Board of the institutes. The IIT Council is the highest decision-making body of the IITs while the JAB is the apex body on admission policy.         
	In his PIL, Kumar has demanded an independent investigation into the irregularities of the 2006 IIT-Joint Entrance Examination that led to 994 deserving candidates losing out on seats.         
	The PIL also seeks the formation of a technical expert committee by the HRD ministry to monitor implementation of the IIT-JEE, sources said.

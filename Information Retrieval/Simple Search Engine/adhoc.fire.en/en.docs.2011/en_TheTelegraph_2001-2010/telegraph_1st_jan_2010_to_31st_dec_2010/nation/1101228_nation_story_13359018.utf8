The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Probe call against ex-CJI
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Probe call against ex-CJI
          JOHN MARY                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 27: Jurist V.R. Krishna Iyer has demanded a judicial commission be set up to probe allegations of disproportionate wealth amassed by relatives of former Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan.        
	Iyer, a former Supreme Court judge, was referring to reports of wealth acquired by Balakrishnans son-in-law P.V. Sreenijan in four years after he declared assets worth Rs 25,000 as a candidate for the 2006 Assembly elections.        
	The Congress had fielded Sreenijan from Ernakulams reserved Narakkal constituency but he was defeated. Since then, he has worked as a legal consultant from an office near Kerala High Court.        
	In Kochi, Iyer said: When he assumed charge as Chief Justice of India, I said its going to be Balakrishnans era. But I wont dare say that now... after hearing allegations linking the former CJI.        
	I regret I was also a judge. People have lost faith in the judiciary because of so many allegations against those related to Balakrishnan. Let a commission, comprising three former Chief Justices, probe allegations against Balakrishnan. If he comes out unscathed, fine. If not, he should be punished.        
	Iyer said the episode about former telecom minister A. Raja allegedly trying to influence former Tamil Nadu chief justice H.L. Gokhale via Justice S. Reghupathy was shocking, shameful.        
	Reghupathy, who allegedly got a call from Raja on a lawyers mobile, reported the matter to Gokhale in a letter, who apparently forwarded it to then CJI Balakrishnan. But Balakrishnan denied receiving any letter mentioning Raja. Gokhale later reiterated that Reghupathys letter had mentioned Raja.        
	In New Delhi, senior lawyer Shanti Bhushan demanded a probe into the allegations.        
	Former Ernakulam MP Sebastian Paul urged Balakrishnan to step aside as chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission pending the probe.        
	The pro-CPM Democratic Youth Federation of India claimed it had information on property purchased by Balakrishnans relatives in India and Dubai.        
	When reporters approached Sreenijan in Kochi, he said he would speak later.        
	According to land registration documents, Sreenijan bought 2.5 acres of riverfront property for Rs 14 lakh in Thrissur in 2007. The market rate for one cent (one-hundredth of an acre) now is Rs 2 lakh, according to sources.        
	In 2009, Sreenijan and wife K.B. Sony, Balakrishnans daughter, jointly purchased 30 cents at Elamakkara in the heart of Kochi, paying Rs 1 lakh a cent. The local market rate is Rs 8 lakh per cent.        
	Another 15 cents of land was purchased nearby in the name of Sreenijans mother.        
	In 2007, a Toyota Corolla was purchased in Sonys name and a flat at Edapally in the city.        
	Sreenijans IT returns in 2009 showed his annual income to be Rs 25 lakh and that of his wife, Rs 15 lakh. The source of income was professional consultancy.

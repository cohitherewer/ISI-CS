The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | AI unions hit from three sides
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      AI unions hit from three sides
                              A crash-crippled Air India (AI) may have wobbled to its feet after a 48-hour strike, but huge backlog of flights prompted the airline, which connects Ranchi and Delhi, to cancel its flight on Thursday. According to AI officials, the cancellation of IC 809 to Delhi was announced on Wednesday evening, prompting 80 out of 100 confirmed passengers to cancel their trips.

	May 27 (PTI): Air India de-recognised its two major trade unions, sealed their offices and sacked 58 employees in an unprecedented crackdown, triggering a call for another strike from June 12 by defiant leaders.        
	The unions and management appeared headed for fresh confrontation following todays strike call by the Air Corporation Employees Union (ACEU) given just a day after the state-owned airline crushed the two-day old strike by a section of the employees.        
	The ACEU was derecognised, along with the All India Aircraft Engineers Association (AIAEA).         
	The striking employees accounted for roughly 60 per cent of the airlines staff strength.        
	Clearing the backlog, the airline gradually restored normality by evening, though 25 flights were cancelled for the day. International flights were normal, an official said.        
	Coming down heavily on union leaders and employees shortly after they withdrew the strike following a Delhi High Court order and some tough talk by the government, the management today terminated the services of 41 more employees  some of them Union leaders  taking the total number who were sacked in two days to 58.        
	Another 24 employees have been suspended after nine more faced this action today. This is the first time that employees have been sacked by the airline in large numbers.        
	The ACEU and the AIAEA have been derecognised by the management of National Aviation Company of India Ltd (Nacil) and their offices have also been sealed, sources said today. Nacil is the holding company of Air India.        
	The de-recognition order came in last night and their offices have also been sealed, the sources said. Courts have also been approached for caveats, an Air India official said.        
	ACEU general secretary J.B. Kadiyan said another notice for strike from June 12 has been served by the union.        
	Air Indias CMD Arvind Jadhav is carrying out dictatorship. He is bent on destroying the airline. He is trying to instigate the workers to go for action and then declare a lockout on that pretext, he said.        
	This is a conspiracy, Kadiyan said in New Delhi, accusing Jadhav of following a Hitlerian approach.        
	The ACEU and the AIAEA had gone on a flash-strike on Tuesday to protest a gag order that directed the office-bearers of Nacil trade unions to refrain from making public statements and harming the image of the company.

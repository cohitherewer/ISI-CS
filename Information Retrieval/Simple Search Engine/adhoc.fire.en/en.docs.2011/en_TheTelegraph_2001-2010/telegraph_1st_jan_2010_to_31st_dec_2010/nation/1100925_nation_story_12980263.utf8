The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt stand makes Sonia panel ponder over food bill 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Govt stand makes Sonia panel ponder over food bill 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sonia Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: The Centre has refused to yield too much space to the Sonia Gandhi-headed National Advisory Council on the food security bill.        
	The government wants to continue with differential entitlements for those above the poverty line and those below it instead of a uniform amount for both categories, as desired by food rights campaigners within the panel.        
	Sonia said after a meeting of the council today that the members needed to mull over the governments viewpoints and perspectives and not do anything in a hurry. That appears to put a question mark over whether the bill  showcased as UPA IIs bonanza for the poorest of the poor  will make it to Parliament in the winter session.        
	The meeting was meant to be an exchange of ideas between the council and the Centres representatives. They included Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the Planning Commissions deputy chairperson, and officials of the food and public distribution, women and child development, and housing and urban poverty alleviation ministries.        
	In the month-long interregnum between the last sitting and todays session, the council members working on the bill  including Harsh Mander, Jean Dreze and N.C. Saxena  had held detailed discussions with Ahluwalia and his plan panel colleague Narendra Jadhav, who also doubles as a council member.        
	At one time, it looked as if a system of differential entitlements could fall in place. Under this, a BPL family could be given 35kg of foodgrain each month  rice at Rs 3 a kg and wheat at Rs 2 a kg.         
	For those above the poverty line (APL), the council wants 35kg of grain but at a cost that is 75 per cent of the minimum support price  the rate the government pays for grain bought from farmers for ration shops and which serves as a benchmark.         
	BPL families make up around 42 per cent of the total poor according to a report of an expert panel.        
	The government has been pushing for status quo  at 25kg for each APL family and 35kg for BPL households  citing procurement and delivery problems.         
	Council members said, however, that they were surprised by the argument because agriculture ministry officials had in their earlier discussions with Mander and other council members given an impression that facilities already existed to handle stocks higher than the current limit of 55 million tonnes.        
	Those in the council who favour bridging the APL-BPL divide over fears it leads to errors of exclusion said they were puzzled and disappointed when in the last meeting, Sonia pointed out that the poor might wonder why the rich were given the same entitlements. Her comment almost cleared the way for a system of dual pricing and entitlements.        
	The food rights crusaders on the panel are being pressured by former fellow activists not to give in on their commitment to protect everyone from hunger.         
	The campaigners also want the list of beneficiaries expanded to include those at the bottom of the economic pile as well supply of pulses and oil from ration shops besides grain.

  Trust factor key in hunt to fill vacuum          SANJAY K. JHA                           Prithviraj Chavan (right) is congratulated outside Parliament on Wednesday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: Prithviraj Chavan will be missed in Delhi by both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.         
	Seen as clean and competent, Chavan had conducted himself with dignity as a minister in the Prime Ministers Office and his tenure was free from controversy, sources said. No finger was pointed at him even when the CBI, which falls under the personnel ministry that he held, came in for attack.         
	Although many feel he lacks political management skills, Chavan has the full confidence of both Singh and Sonia, the sources added.         
	Finding a replacement for him in the PMO and to handle the CBI would be difficult, the sources said, because the trust factor is the key for this sensitive job.         
	Sonia had carefully nursed him for a bigger role and made him an AICC general secretary despite the complete absence of political clout and lack of experience in managing or fighting elections. That he was posted in the PMO was also evidence that he did not have any political agenda of his own.         
	Chavans role in the PMO became doubly important after the exit of Suresh Pachauri, another Gandhi family loyalist who was sent to Madhya Pradesh as the state Congress chief.         
	Sources said both the Prime Minister and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee wanted Pachauri back in the government but Sonia could not nominate him to the Rajya Sabha owing to political compulsions. Many leaders feel Pachauri can fill the vacuum created by Chavans move to Maharashtra but it will be difficult to bring him to Parliament within the stipulated six months.         
	Names of some younger leaders such as Jitin Prasada and Sachin Pilot are doing the rounds for the PMO job but senior leaders said no decision had been taken.         
	The other portfolios handled by Chavan will be easily distributed among other ministers. Science and technology has been given temporarily to Kapil Sibal, and might remain with him as the government feels this portfolio should be a part of human resource development.         
	Chavan was also junior parliamentary affairs minister. That portfolio is anyway being handled by cabinet minister Pawan Bansal and another minister of state, V. Narayanasamy.         
	In the party, Chavan was in charge of important states such as Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana. His exit will make it incumbent on Sonia to hunt for another leader to be trained as general secretary. This will not be easy because there will be more vacancies for the general secretarys post as ministers Ghulam Nabi Azad, Narayanasamy and Mukul Wasnik could lose their party assignments under the one-man-one-post rule.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, April 25: Two groups of lawyers clashed on the Madras High Court campus today, giving the countrys law minister and the Chief Justice of India a taste of lawlessness among lawyers.        
	Veerappa Moily and CJI K.G. Balakrishnan had come for the unveiling of a statue of B.R. Ambedkar.        
	The violence broke out when a section of lawyers raised slogans against the Tamil Nadu chief minister as he started his speech. The lawyers waved black flags at M. Karunanidhi and shouted slogans against the DMK government for not taking action against senior police officers after a clash between police and advocates on the court campus on February 19, 2009, left several people injured.        
	A group of pro-DMK lawyers and party cadres then pounced on the protesting lawyers and attacked them with plastic chairs. Television reporters and journalists were also attacked and cameras damaged. City police commissioner T. Rajendran had a camera snatched from his hand and thrown to the ground. Four journalists were injured in the violence.         
	It is not clear if those who indulged in violence were advocates or outsiders, a senior police officer said.        
	The cops did not intervene, though the state police chief and the city police commissioner were both present.         
	Ever since last years violence, the police have adopted a hands-off policy on law and order issues involving lawyers. The police had virtually withdrawn from the high court campus after a two-judge bench frowned upon the heavy police presence that day and slapped a contempt of court notice against four officers.         
	At the end of the day, however, the police booked six lawyers who had raised slogans against the chief minister and charged them under non-bailable sections.

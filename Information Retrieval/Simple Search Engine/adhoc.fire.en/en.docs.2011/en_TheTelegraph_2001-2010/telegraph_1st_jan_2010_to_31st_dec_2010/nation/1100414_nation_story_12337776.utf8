The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Old Boys Club scoffs at rookies slip
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Old Boys Club scoffs at rookies slip
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, April 13: When lightweight Shashi Tharoor did a Mongoose bat, hitting a towering six by helping put Kochi on the IPL map, the Old Boys Club of cricketing politicians were not thrilled.        
	They had just been putting a few cagey fingers in the IPL pie, after years in the labyrinths of the state or national cricket bodies, and here was this rookie upstaging them at their own game of power and patronage.        
	Today, amid the controversy over the free stakes to Sunanda Pushkar, some of them were quick to tut-tut that the junior minister was giving a bad name to politicians involved in the sport.        
	We had seen him with the lady (Sunanda) but had no clue there was a commercial interest in the relationship apart from the love interest, a senior MP and cricket administrator shook his head.        
	What he has done is wrong. It will give a bad name to the politicians involved in the sport, said another.        
	But hasnt the harm Indian politicians have done to sport been repeatedly exposed and panned, from athletics to hockey?        
	The IPL is emerging as a phenomenon and we shouldnt besmirch it, was the reply.        
	From the days of N.K.P. Salve and Madhavrao Scindia to the current times of Sharad Pawar and Arun Jaitley, cricket  especially its celebrity quotient and commercial promise  has enthralled Indias politicians.        
	Those involved in the BCCI or state associations today include the likes of C.P. Joshi, Farooq Abdullah, Lalu Prasad, Narendra Modi and Rajiv Shukla, as well as the youthful Anurag Thakur and Jyotiraditya Scindia.        
	The IPL, with its cash, huge demand for tickets, and possibilities as an instrument of patronage, packed an allure no politician could ignore. Before Tharoor, any links between a high-profile politician and an IPL team had been spoken of only in whispers.        
	Tharoor had picked some of the experienced cricket-politicians brains before the second IPL auction, and they had willingly advised him. He had been told to vet the bidders and eliminate the suspicious ones, sources said.        
	However, since the successful Kochi bid, many of the veterans have been dismissive of Tharoors interest in cricket, describing it as dilettantism compared with their own serious and enduring engagement with the game.        
	Tharoor is perhaps more vulnerable than most politicians to charges of being non-serious  because of his tweet controversies, the way he chaperones his partner even at political gatherings, or his stay in a five-star hotel before he got an official residence. He also has a way of, perhaps unconsciously, rubbing people the wrong way.        
	It was in evidence on a balmy weekend in March when minister Ambika Soni had laid out this winters last outdoor lunch on her sprawling garden. Tharoor turned up in flannels and a cap after his foreign ministry team beat Ficci in a game.        
	So excited was he that, as he got off his car, he barely threw a sideways glance at Congress veterans Janardhan Dwivedi and Motilal Vora who had driven in at the same time. A sacrilege, as those conversant with the Congresss manual of manners would say.        
	The most charitable explanation for the Kochi hullabaloo could be that maybe, somehow, the Old Boys Club had felt seriously threatened by Tharoor.

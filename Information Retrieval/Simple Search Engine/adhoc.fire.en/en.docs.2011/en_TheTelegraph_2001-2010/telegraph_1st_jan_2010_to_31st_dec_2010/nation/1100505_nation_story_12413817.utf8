	Khuzama (Nagaland), May 4: The Manipur government this evening urged Delhi to stall Thuingaleng Muivahs planned visit to his native village after 40 years and the Naga leader vowed to be there tomorrow.        
	NSCN (I-M) general secretary Muivah was scheduled to visit his village in Ukhral district of Manipur yesterday, but the Congress-led government there had stalled it citing possible law-and-order problems. Okram Ibobi Singhs cabinet urged Delhi a second time today to stall the visit.        
	At Camp Hebron, the NSCN (I-M) council headquarters 35km from Dimapur, Muivah said he would go to Somdal village tomorrow afternoon. We are not going to wage war, we are going to make peace, he added.         
	A senior home ministry official in Delhi said the Manipur government is within its rights to stop him but Muivah may have consulted the Centre on his plans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Eyes glued to Pawar play
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Eyes glued to Pawar play
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sharad Pawar                                  
	New Delhi, April 19: If anyone can save Lalit Modi now, it can only be Sharad Pawar  so goes the political buzz in Delhi.        
	Many here believe that even at a time the Congress and the Centre are keen to go after Modi, the Union agriculture minister could be the one man still capable of ensuring that his confidant stays IPL commissioner.        
	Pawar is not only a key UPA ally, he is the most powerful man in Indian cricket administration and is weeks away from taking over as chief of the world cricket body, ICC.        
	Theories swirled around the capital today on what could be on Pawars mind regarding Modi.        
	Some pointed to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) bosss decision to send Modi as one of Indias representatives to the two-day ICC meeting in Dubai that began today. Pawar too is in Dubai.        
	It shows he is not likely to dump Modi so easily, an observer of cricket politics said. Some media reports had said the Indian cricket board, which meets on May 2, would sack Modi.        
	The BJP, within which Modi is known to have strong connections, too appeared confident that the Congress would not be able to harm the IPL boss too grievously.        
	Firstly, Modi has many friends in the Congress and secondly, Pawar will not play ball with the Congress (in targeting Modi), a source said.        
	This was probably why the BJP tried to deflect media questions on why it had gone soft on Pawar and other NCP leaders linked to the T20 league while gunning for Shashi Tharoors scalp.        
	Asked how civil aviation minister Praful Patels daughter had got the job of running the IPLs hospitality department, a BJP leader said: Shes doing an excellent job; whats the problem?        
	A quick check showed that most of the politicians on the Indian cricket board, who will decide Modis future along with the other members, were with Pawar. Does that mean they would support Modi?        
	Not necessarily, said a Gujarat politician close to chief minister Narendra Modi, who heads the states cricket association.        
	They will sail with the wind. Indeed, Pawar will sail with the wind. If he thinks it makes political sense to dump Lalit Modi and redeem the image of the IPL, the board and the politicians involved in cricket, he might go ahead. If he thinks Lalit Modis departure will jeopardise the IPL, he might take a different call.        
	A Congress minister conceded the party could not afford to rile Pawar too much after all, the Finance Bill was yet to be passed and the Oppositions proposed cut motions had to be defeated.        
	At the same time, the party and its government, stung by the first corruption charge in the UPAs six-year run, is itching to hit back at the man whose tweet scalped Tharoor.

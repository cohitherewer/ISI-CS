	Bangalore, Feb. 3: For nearly eight days, Mallaiah was in darkness, buried under the rubble of a five-storey building that had caved in.         
	He emerged this morning after rescue teams that had been chipping away bit by bit at the shaky structure over the past week found him just as they were nearing the end of their task.         
	The construction worker from Andhra Pradesh was stuck between two concrete beams. However, he escaped with only a few injuries.        
	It was totally dark and he did not know how long he was there, Seemanth Kumar Singh, the Bellary superintendent of police, said. Mallaiah had survived on water, Singh added.         
	But the 40-year-old was not the only one lucky to have escaped with his life. The rescuers have also brought out five puppies from under the rubble.         
	The collapse of the under-construction apartment in Bellary town, about 350km north of Bangalore, has claimed 27 lives so far. Many of the victims were workers who were cooking dinner when the building caved in on January 26 evening.         
	Two students were also killed after the wall of their hostel next to the building collapsed under the impact of the cave-in.         
	A police officer said Mallaiah was asking for his wife Nagamma while being taken to hospital. Her body was found from under the rubble later in the day.         
	Nearly 200 personnel from the Pune-based National Disaster Response Force, army engineers, firefighters and the police have been carrying out rescue operations over the past week. The teams have saved around 20 persons so far, many of them within the first three days of the collapse.         
	We got the exact location of the victims from their relatives and drilled in those places, Singh said. Explosives brought by army engineers were used to target the spots without disturbing the building, he added.         
	The structure has now been razed after rescue workers cleared the debris.         
	Police sources said one person was still buried in the rubble. We are hoping against hope that he is alive, Singh said.         
	Singh said the rescue teams had to shoo away a dog that kept returning to the site. The dog could be the mother of the puppies rescued today, he added.         
	The developer in charge of the apartment project has been arrested and is in judicial custody.

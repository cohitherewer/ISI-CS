The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Order for new Sukna probe
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Order for new Sukna probe
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 22 (PTI): Lt Gen Avadesh Prakash today got relief from the armed forces tribunal, which quashed the court of inquiry proceedings against him in the Sukna land scam and ordered a fresh probe.        
	A two-member tribunal bench headed by Justice A.K. Mathur allowed Prakash to cross-examine six witnesses who had deposed against him in the court of inquiry without being cross-examined.        
	Observing that Army Rule 180 was seriously violated during the court of inquiry, it said: We fail to understand the manner in which the CoI (court of inquiry) has been conducted. This was not a substantial compliance of the principles of natural justice.        
	The rule lays down that all officers have the right to be present when some other personnel depose against them.        
	Prakash was indicted by the earlier inquiry for his alleged role in issuing a no-objection certificate to a realtor for building an educational institute on land adjacent to the Sukna military station in Bengal.        
	After todays order, court martial proceedings against the former military secretary will have to wait till the fresh inquiry is over.        
	The tribunal said that after submitting fresh findings regarding Prakashs role in the case, the authorities will be free to decide the fate of the case, whether or not to send it for court martial.        
	The court martial proceedings, which had been ordered against Prakash, were to start on February 25 in Calcutta.        
	The absence of cross-examination of the six witnesses was a significant plea of the retired general against the inquiry, on the basis of which the disciplinary action was initiated. The six witnesses to be cross-examined by Prakash are Lt Gen P.K. Rath, Lt Gen Ramesh Halgali, Maj Gen P.C. Sen, Col. N.K. Dabas, Lt Col Jiji Verghese and Naib Subedar Surjit Singh.        
	Mathur said that in order to meet the principles of natural justice, we permit Prakash to cross-examine the witnesses. The tribunal rejected Prakash plea to cross-examine S. Bajoria, the owner of the controversial land adjacent to Sukna Military Station, as he had earlier refused to do so when he was given the opportunity.        
	Welcoming the decision of the tribunal, Prakashs counsel Jyoti Singh said now her client would have a chance to cross-examine the witnesses in the fresh inquiry.        
	General Prakash has got justice today. The CoI has been set aside because of non-compliance of Army Rule 180. The court has set aside that part of the CoI and held that all those witnesses will now be recalled and they will be examined in Prakashs presence, she said.

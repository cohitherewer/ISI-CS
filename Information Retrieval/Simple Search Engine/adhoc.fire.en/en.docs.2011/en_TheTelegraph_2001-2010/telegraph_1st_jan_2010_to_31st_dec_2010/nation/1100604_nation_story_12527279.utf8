          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 3: With neighbouring Jharkhand in the throes of another spell of political turmoil, the Orissa government is now finding it difficult to curb illegal transportation of minerals across the border.         
	After the multi-crore mining scam rocked the state last year, Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik had written a letter to his then Jharkhand counterpart Shibu Soren on March 17, urging him to form a joint coordination committee to check illegal transportation of minerals.         
	In the letter, Patnaik stated that as a number of sponge iron factories and crushers had come up in the bordering areas, illegal transportation of minerals was rampant. A mechanism should be evolved at the highest level to arrest illegal transportation of minerals, he had said.         
	Soren responded on April 3, promising that his home secretary and steel secretary would soon be in touch with Orissa government officials to formulate a joint action plan. But the state government has not received any further communication from Jharkhand.         
	They have not yet made any correspondence with our government at the highest level, said a senior official of the steel and mines department.         
	Meanwhile, the state steel and mines department today decided to introduce electronic transit passes to check validity of transportation of minerals.

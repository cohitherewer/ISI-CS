The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Buddha finds friends in Nitish and Naveen
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Buddha finds friends in Nitish and Naveen
          J.P. YADAV                                     Naveen Patnaik, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Nitish Kumar				                                 
	New Delhi, May 11: Mayavati is not dependable and the Yadav twins had cut where it hurts.        
	Its third-front dream in tatters, the CPM has, however, secured the support of two chief ministers who dont belong to either the Congress or the BJP in its campaign for restructuring Centre-state relations.        
	CPM sources said Orissas Naveen Patnaik (Biju Janata Dal) and Bihars Nitish Kumar (Janata Dal-United) have agreed to join hands with their Bengal counterpart Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to take on the UPA on matters relating to discrimination against states.        
	Initial-level talks have been held. Both Naveen Patnaik and Nitish Kumar have agreed and a formal meeting could take place soon, a senior CPM leader said.        
	The immediate issue that has brought them together is funds for implementing the Right to Education Act.         
	Patnaik met HRD minister Kapil Sibal here today to demand a 90:10 Centre-state ratio in funding the drive. Sibal, however, is learnt to have stuck to the Centres 65:35 proposal.         
	Nitishs grudge, like that of Bengals ruling CPM, is over the entire gamut of Centre-state relations. The Congress governments conduct is anti-federal, the JD (U) leader had said in a recent interview with The Telegraph.        
	The CPM plans to exploit the unity of the trio beyond the education act to save its declining clout and for the larger issue of Centre-state relations.        
	A recent central committee meeting of the party here decided that a political campaign would be started on restructuring Centre-state relations in view of Delhis inequitable policies and encroachment on states powers.        
	Bhattacharjee had played a key role in egging his Orissa counterpart to snap ties with the BJP. The same, however, looks unlikely in the near future with Nitish, who heads an alliance government with the BJP in Bihar, but the Left wants to nurse its good relations with him.         
	Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati, too, is on the same page as Bengal over the education act, but the CPM does not seem to be interested in including her in the club. She (Mayavati) is not dependable. We have not contacted her, the CPM leader said, citing her support to the UPA over the Left-sponsored cut motions in the Lok Sabha.         
	As for Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh, the CPM has lost hope of any meaningful engagement with the Yadav duo after burning its fingers over the cut motion.        
	Mulayams Samajwadi Party and Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal implicitly helped the government by walking out.        
	Asked about an alliance with the RJD in the Bihar elections later this year, the CPM leader said: Issue to issue, we will agitate with them, but any electoral alliance with Lalu Prasad is ruled out. In Bihar we will concentrate on Left unity.        
	The issues the CPM plans to raise against the Centre were part of its 2009 election manifesto. The document accused the Centre of being insensitive to the rights of states and failing to take steps to devolve more powers and resources to them.         
	The manifesto also said debts of states were not substantially reduced, nor were their shares in the divisible pool of taxes enhanced.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, May 5: Six children tried to cross over to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to receive arms training and become militants because they were tired of getting the stick from parents and at school for not studying.         
	The children, aged between 12 and 13, were stopped by police and handed over to their parents today. The six claimed that they wanted to become militants because their parents and teachers would beat them up for not studying seriously.         
	We were beaten up at home and reprimanded at school for not studying properly. We decided to cross the border and join the jihadi movement, said Shariq Ahmad, a Class VII student.         
	Shariq and five of his schoolmates left for PoK on Sunday and travelled 75km by bus and car to reach Rigipora village in the border district of Kupwara.         
	They received a prize of Rs 200 for winning a cricket match at their village. With that money, they took a bus to reach Sopore and later boarded a car to Rigipora, a police officer said.         
	The kids then entered a mosque and asked the Imam about the route to Pakistan. The worshippers, who had gathered there for noon prayers, asked them to go home. Shakeel Beig, the police chief Baramulla, said the worshippers suspected the childrens intention and handed them over to the police.         
	Police sources said the six were questioned for two days before being handed over. They said they wanted to leave their school and cross the LoC. It could be that they were attracted by militancy. They are too young and we have to believe them, the officer said.         
	Abdul Ahad Sheikh, a shopkeeper and father of 13-year-old Saleem, one of the six children, said his son had told him that he was going to play cricket before stepping out of home. I cannot believe that he was going to cross over. Like every parent, we also wanted him to study, he said.         
	The police have asked the parents to keep a watch on their children.         
	A.Q. Manhas, the deputy inspector-general of police, north Kashmir, said the police were probing if any militant group wanted to indoctrinate the six. Nothing has been found so far but there could be somebody, he said.         
	We have only seen violence (over the last two decades). This has led to the emergence of a new generation that is violent and emotionally fragile. They can be swayed by anyone. We have to be extra vigilant, he said.

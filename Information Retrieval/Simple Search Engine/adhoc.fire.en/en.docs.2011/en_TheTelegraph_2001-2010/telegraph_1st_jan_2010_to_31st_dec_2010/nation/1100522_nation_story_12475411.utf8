          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 21: India has sought the extradition of a businessman arrested in London, a prime suspect in the leak of sensitive data from the Indian Navys operations directorate or war room in 2005.        
	Ravi Shankaran was absconding for five years and evaded arrest despite an Interpol red-corner notice till he was picked up by London police on April 21.        
	Though Shankaran has got conditional bail, the CBI believes his extradition will be possible because he was arrested on the agencys request.        
	A CBI statement today said he fled India before the defence ministry referred the case to the agency in March 2006.        
	At that time the naval war room leak case created a stir because Shankaran was related to the wife of the then chief of naval staff Admiral (now retired) Arun Prakash. The defence ministry found no evidence to suspect that Prakash was linked to the case.        
	The CBI statement today said the UK was requested to track down Shankaran in May 2006. His passport was also revoked. It claimed that Shankarans arrest warrant was issued on the basis of its provisional arrest request. This is expected to make Shankarans extradition possible.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: Most Congress chief ministers had to cancel their customary visit to Delhi today to greet Sonia Gandhi on her birthday after she sent word she was not celebrating and would not meet people as she usually does.         
	But far away in villages of Madhya Pradesh, thousands had already packed their bags and boarded the train to Delhi.         
	By the time they arrived at 10 Janpath, hundreds of Congress supporters had returned disappointed. Some of them had come from as far away as Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. In previous years, even if she avoided celebrations, Sonia would come out and mingle with party workers.         
	The group from Madhya Pradesh, with little bags on their heads and rotis in their pockets, however, got an appointment to meet the Congress president at home. Brought to Delhi by Dhar MP Gajendra Singh Rajukhedi, the mostly tribal visitors not only got to spend time with Sonia, who turned 65 today, but also gave advice when asked about ways to revive the party in the state.         
	The official reason given out for cancelling the birthday celebrations was the blast in Varanasi on Tuesday, but there was speculation that she was in a foul mood because of the completely irrational stand of the Opposition on a JPC probe into the 2G scam.         
	Although the formal ceremony where all ministers and Congress Working Committee members meet her together at 10 Janpath did not happen this year, many senior leaders in Delhi did drop in to greet her. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee were among them.         
	The visit that aroused curiosity, however, was that of Kanimozhi, daughter of DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, and party colleague T.R. Baalu.         
	Karunanidhi sent a fax message saying: You have been proving to the nation that you are a historic light of sacrifice, guiding the destiny of the nation. People of Tamil Nadu have great love, affection and respect for the Gandhi-Nehru family.         
	This was seen as an indication that the DMK intends to save the alliance.

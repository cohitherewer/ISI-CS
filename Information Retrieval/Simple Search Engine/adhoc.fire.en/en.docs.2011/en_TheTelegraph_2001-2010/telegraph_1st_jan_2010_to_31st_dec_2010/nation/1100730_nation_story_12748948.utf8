	New Delhi, July 29: The Congress has focused its efforts on exposing the inherent hypocrisy in the BJP-Left relationship even while it waits eagerly for Opposition unity to crack when the price rise furore is replaced by Hindutva issues.        
	On a day Congress and Left representatives shared a public platform over womens reservation, Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi described the Left-BJP ties as unholy and opportunistic.        
	The concerted action and artificial sparring expose both the groupings. Tomorrow, if they do shadow-boxing, that will fool no one, Singhvi said.        
	Sources said the Congress was not worried by the communists flirtations with the BJP  it was aware of the limitations of that relationship. The Congress expects the Left to wriggle out of the BJPs embrace when the focus shifts to Hindutva outfits terror links and former Gujarat minister Amit Shahs legal troubles.        
	Still, its objective is to tar the tactical parliamentary understanding between the two Opposition groupings as a political alliance. So Congress leaders are trying to create an impression that the communists traditional anti-Congressism has proved more powerful than their hatred of communal politics.        
	Prakash Karat has turned blind in his hatred towards the Congress; he has taken it at a personal level, completely forgetting the political and moral dilemmas of being in the saffron camp, a senior cabinet minister told The Telegraph.

	Many Congress MPs feel that the Left-BJP harmony defies political logic at a time the battle for Muslim votes is peaking in Bengal.        
	Asked if the Left had moved closer to the BJP under Karats leadership, Singhvi said: I will not take names but the unity of the BJP and the Left was based on political expediency. They have become bedfellows.        
	He claimed the Left was working in tandem with the BJP, which has been trying to create ruckus on the price rise to divert public attention from their Reddys and Shahs.        
	Singhvi said: The issue is not price rise. They (the BJP) want to cover up the scandals in Karnataka and Gujarat and hence the political stunt-bazzi and sensationalism.        
	The Left has shown signs of unease and its MPs did not join in when BJP members rushed to the well of the House today while protesting against the price rise, but the communists appear to be irrevocably clubbed with the BJP on this issue.        
	Yesterday, when CPM leader Basudev Acharya was passionately trying to convince the Lok Sabha Speaker to accept the adjournment motion, Congress member Adhir Chowdhury got up repeatedly to taunt him: What else will you do to please the BJP?        
	The Trinamul Congress too is harping on the Lefts alleged proximity to the BJP.        
	Apart from the price rise, one major issue that will have the BJP and the Left on the same side is the serial train accidents. But there are many issues to follow that will force the Left to attack the BJP.        
	These include the Ranganath Mishra commission report on Muslim reservation and the communal harmony bill. Even on the misuse of the CBI, especially related to Shah, the Left will have to sing a different tune from the BJP.        
	The Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal too will focus their attack on the NDA on this issue since the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had started CBI cases against their leaders.

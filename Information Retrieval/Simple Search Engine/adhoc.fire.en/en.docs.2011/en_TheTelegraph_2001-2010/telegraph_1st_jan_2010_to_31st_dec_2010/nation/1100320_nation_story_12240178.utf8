The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak logo confusion
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pak logo confusion
          NASIR JAFFRY                             The Pakistan Punjab police logo (top) and that of the Indian force                           
	Islamabad, March 19: Newspaper advertisements by police in Pakistans Punjab province asking Pakistanis to keep an eye on terrorists appeared today with the logo of the police in the Indian state of Punjab.        
	The advertisements, on the front or back pages of leading local English and Urdu dailies, were shown by Geo TV.        
	This may be a printing error, Punjab police chief Tariq Saleem Dogar told the private channel. He claimed there was a lot of similarity in the logos of Indian and Pakistani Punjab police. But, at the same time, he promised to find out who made the mistake, saying it was punishable, whether committed advertently or inadvertently.         
	The gaffe comes less than two months after the photo of ex-Pakistan air force chief Tanvir Mahmood Ahmed appeared along with Indian icons in newspaper ads against female foeticide by Indias women and child development ministry.         
	The mistake had forced Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs office to tender an apology.

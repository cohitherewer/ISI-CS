          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: The Supreme Court has quashed a defamation case filed by a pesticide industry association which had accused an NGO of wrongfully claiming that a widely used insecticide killed many Andhra farmers in 2001.        
	The complaint lacks basic ingredientsno useful purpose would be served, Justices Dalveer Bhandari and Deepak Verma said in a recent judgment.        
	The Crop Care Federation of India  formerly known as the Pesticides Association of India  had alleged that Rajesh Rangarajan and others of the NGO Toxics Link had prepared a report blaming the deaths on endosulfan to harm the Rs 6,500-crore pesticide industry.         
	Endosulfan is among the most widely used pesticides. The deaths had occurred in Andhras Warangal.         
	The apex court went through the report, titled The Killing Fields of Warangal, but did not agree with Crop Cares claims. The report meant to focus on the harmful effects of exposure to pesticides. It was not meant to harm, hurt or defame any individual or manufacturing company, the court said.

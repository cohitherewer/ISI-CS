	Colombo, April 30 (PTI): India will assist Sri Lanka to develop the Palaly air base and the Kanakesanthurai port in Jaffna peninsula, as the country works to rebuild the war-torn Tamil-dominated north.        
	The Indian governments help has been sought for the development of the Palaly air base and the KKS port projects. India has said it will consider providing assistance for these ventures, a source in the Lankan government said.        
	The Palaly air base is the nerve centre of Sri Lankas military presence in Jaffna. The air base had served as the lifeline to Jaffna because there was no land supply route to the peninsula until 2009. Till then, much of the essential food items, medicines and ammunition was brought via air to the Palaly base.        
	The Daily News today said the Indian government was also willing to assist Sri Lanka in its resettlement programme in the north.        
	Sri Lankan Prime Minister D.M. Jayaratne said: Indian assistance was much needed at this juncture when Sri Lanka is striving to achieve economic development after eradicating terrorism.

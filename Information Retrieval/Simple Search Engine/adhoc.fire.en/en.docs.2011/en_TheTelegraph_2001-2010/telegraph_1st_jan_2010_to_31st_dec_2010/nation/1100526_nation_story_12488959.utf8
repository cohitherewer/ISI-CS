          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 25: The CRPF is losing men not just to Maoists but also to the blazing sun.        
	Three personnel died from heat stroke during training in Gwalior yesterday, raising questions about the working conditions for the countrys spearhead against the Maoists. An inquiry has been ordered.         
	The incident comes close on the heels of the E.N. Rammohan committee report on last months massacre of 75 CRPF jawans in Dantewada, which raised questions on the working conditions in the force.        
	The Gwalior deaths suggest that not enough care was taken to acclimatise the jawans. Head constables Dinesh Chand, S.N. Yadav and Vinaygar had come for the training from postings in Kashmir. They collapsed along with at least 10 other jawans  who are under treatment  on their first day of training.         
	Gwalior has been reeling under severe heat-wave conditions, with the mercury shooting past 45 degree Celsius.        
	Those who died or took ill were part of a larger group of 500 head constables undergoing a 90-day weapons and tactics course at the forces central training centre.        
	The inquiry, ordered by the CRPF top brass in Delhi, will be conducted by additional director-general (training) Rakesh Jaruhar and Dr R.K. Dhawan, a director in the force who oversees medical and health matters.        
	Sources said heads were likely to roll after the probe. Last week, three CRPF officers, including a deputy inspector-general, were transferred on the basis of the Rammohan inquiry report. Rammohan, a former BSF chief, had visited Chintalnaar, the site of the rebel ambush, and spoken to jawans during his fact-finding mission.        
	The CRPF has 14 battalions in Chhattisgarh, where jawans have to walk up to 30km every day in scorching heat.        
	Over a dozen of them have had to be rushed to hospital after collapsing in the heat in recent months. Two died before reaching hospital and one after being admitted.        
	The CRPFs standard operating procedures do not always allow jawans to travel in vehicles because of the greater threat of ambush. Eight jawans died when rebels blew up their vehicle on May 8.        
	Unlike other paramilitary forces like the BSF, Indo Tibetan Border Police, Sashastra Seema Bal or Assam Rifles that are deployed along the border, the 206 battalions of the CRPF perform multiple duties. From law-and-order and VIP duties, we are sent to the jungles of Chhattisgarh, or packed off to Kashmir. There is no time to acclimatise, a CRPF officer said.        
	The CRPF denies deaths from sunstroke or malaria but there have been instances where entire platoons have had to be hospitalised.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress old guard fumes

          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 12: Rahul Gandhis tour of Bihar may be marred by a rebellion brewing in the faction-ridden state Congress, with many senior leaders planning to resign from the jumbo state committee formed a few days ago.        
	The dissenters see the PCC executive  which has 562 office-bearers, many of them young, fresh recruits  as a move by state unit chief Anil Sharma to remain at the helm despite overwhelming opposition.         
	A leader told The Telegraph most seniors were upset and many were thinking of quitting the new committee in protest. Many leaders want to clearly tell the high command that working with this PCC president is impossible, the leader said.        
	While the main cause for resentment is the decision to continue with Sharma, who is seen as too junior, some leaders are furious at what they describe as a committee formed without any application of mind.        
	Two working presidents in the previous committee have been demoted to the post of general secretary, and a large number of fresh entrants have been given important posts straightaway. Sources said a majority of older leaders felt that drawing new members into the party was fine but the organisational hierarchy should not be destabilised in the process.         
	Around 60-70 young boys and girls have been recruited and made secretaries to begin with, one leader said. Older Congressmen are feeling dismayed. Somebody working for 10 years in the field all of a sudden finds himself being monitored by a girl who developed a fancy for politics two days ago.        
	A section of leaders believe the very concept of membership drive has been distorted in Bihar, where Rahul will be visiting to boost the recruitment drive for the Youth Congress.        
	The sources said all important posts in the youth wing were being filled up through elections, but the Bihar PCC had just distributed posts at different levels without applying any criteria.         
	Senior leaders are enthusiastic about the membership drive, which has seen young leaders like Sachin Pilot, Priya Dutt and Jitin Prasada visit the state, but dont favour appointment of greenhorns to key posts.         
	The new committee has also triggered a controversy by including the name of Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar as a permanent invitee to the PCC executive. Anybody holding a constitutional post ceases to be a party member and some are citing this to buttress their allegation of incompetence against the PCC chief.

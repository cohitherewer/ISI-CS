The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak lauds PM, seeks talks date
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pak lauds PM, seeks talks date
          NASIR JAFFRY AND PTI                              
	Islamabad, April 30: Pakistans foreign minister today described the outcome of yesterdays talks as more than expected, saying it showed how committed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was to normalising bilateral relations.        
	Shah Mahmood Qureshi said he would contact his Indian counterpart S.M. Krishna after Indias budget session ended on May 7, and fix a date for a meeting that would resume the dialogue process and try to bridge the trust deficit.        
	Qureshi was speaking to reporters after returning here from the Thimphu Saarc summit, on whose sidelines Singh and Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani had met yesterday.        
	The Pakistan foreign minister said the approach of Singh and Indian foreign secretary Nirupama Rao was very positive.         
	Singh had yesterday dropped Indias insistence that the composite dialogue could resume only after Pakistan had dismantled the terror infrastructure on its soil and acted against the 26/11 plotters.        
	When I asked Prime Minister Singh (if) the two foreign ministers (should) meet in a third country, he replied why should they not meet in any of the two countries, Qureshi said.        
	He said future talks would focus on all issues of concern to India and Pakistan: We will discuss every issue in the dialogue, which is going to be resumed shortly.        
	But he said there was no need to stick labels like composite dialogue on the talks.        
	If all issues are to be discussed, whether you call it comprehensive dialogue, composite dialogue or whatever you want, that is not important. The spirit behind that is important, the spirit is right.         
	Foreign secretary Rao too had said in Thimphu yesterday: I dont think we have to get stuck with nomenclatures.        
	Islamabad, which has been insisting on resuming the composite dialogue, now appears to have dropped the demand. Qureshi said Rao was very positive during her media briefing yesterday.        
	There has been a trust deficit and we have to bridge it. It can be done through confidence-building measures, he said. It will not happen in a day. It is a process. If we allow the process to continue with passage of time, the deficit will be narrowed down.        
	Terror fight        
	Prime Minister Gilani today appealed to Saarc countries to partner Pakistan in fighting terrorism, which he described as a trans-national and trans-regional phenomenon. I reiterated (at the Saarc summit) the need to fight it (terror) individually as well as collectively, he said.        
	Gilani said Saarc nations needed to forge a common front based on tolerance and respect for human dignity. A meeting of interior ministers of the bloc in Pakistan in June will help strengthen co-operation in this area, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 12: Students who appeared for the IIT entrance exam yesterday will receive marks for partially correct answers to certain questions in a departure from the institutes standard marking policy which has faced criticism.        
	The IITs will award marks for partially correct answers to five questions each in physics, chemistry and mathematics in the Joint Entrance Examination, taken by over 4.5 lakh students.        
	These 15 questions carry three marks each, adding up to 45 marks together. The instructions to these multiple-choice questions clarified that they could have more than one correct answer.        
	The students will receive partial marks on any of these questions if they darken some of the correct answers, even if they fail to identify all the correct answers.        
	The move represents a shift from the traditional binary marking policy adopted by the IITs for the JEE. Under that policy, a student received either full marks  for a perfect answer  or negative marks for an imperfect or wrong answer, with zero marks if the student left the question unanswered.        
	Yesterdays question papers clarified that the students would not receive negative marks for incorrect answers to these 15 questions.        
	The shift in marking policy comes after criticism that binary marking was placing students with no knowledge on a par with those with partial knowledge. But the instructions on the question papers were unclear on how the partial marking on these 15 questions would be carried out.        
	Partial marking without any negative marking  which was all that the instructions mentioned could mean that students would receive some marks for correct answers even if they also marked incorrect answers to the same question.In such a situation, the students could blindly mark all four options, thereby covering the correct answers and receiving marks without any negative marks for darkening an incorrect option.        
	JEE officials at IIT Madras, the organising IIT for the exam, claimed they would not consider marking students who darkened all options.        
	The instructions on the question papers fail to specify, either, how many marks students will receive for partially correct answers.

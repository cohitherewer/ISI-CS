          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    (From top) Dileep Padgaonkar, Radha Kumar, MM Ansari      
	New Delhi, Oct. 13: The Centre today named three interlocutors for Jammu and Kashmir but continued its search for an eminent political face who may head the group.        
	Journalist Dileep Padgaonkar, central information commissioner M.M. Ansari and academic Radha Kumar have been tasked with holding talks with all shades of opinion in the state.        
	Amid criticism from sections in the Valley on the choice of interlocutors and the absence of a political face, Union home minister P. Chidambaram said credible persons who had been in public life for long had been named. One more interlocutor could be added later, he added.        
	The government hopes that after interacting with all shades of political opinion they will suggest a way forward that truly reflects the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, specially the youth, an official statement said.        
	The team will make its first visit to the Valley by end-October. Week-long trips have been proposed every month. The panel has a year to submit its findings. In the interim, it will have to suggest to the Centre ways to bring back peace in the Valley. This curfew culture has to end, a source said.        
	Sources said Congress leaders Digvijay Singh, Prithviraj Chavan and Salman Khursheed were apparently reluctant to head the team.         
	The ministry release said the group would function under the chairmanship of an eminent person. It said Padgaonkar would chair the meetings but did not name him chairperson. It is a huge responsibility, we dont have a quick-fix solution, Padgaonkar said.        
	Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani said: This is a futile exercise. The Government of India is acting like the deaf and dumb.

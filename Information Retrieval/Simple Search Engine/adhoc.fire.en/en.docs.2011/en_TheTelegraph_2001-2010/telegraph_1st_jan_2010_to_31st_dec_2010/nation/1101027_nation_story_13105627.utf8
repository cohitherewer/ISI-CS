	Burdwan, Oct. 26: Trinamul Congress workers today went on the rampage in Burdwan University over alleged nepotism in recruitment of Group-D staff, triggering a torch-and-attack duel with CPM cadres across town.        
	Two offices, one each of the rivals, were set on fire in the six-hour violence that also saw vehicles damaged and bricks being hurled at shops, forcing them to down shutters and residents to scurry indoors in the Left bastion.        
	The university authorities accused police of arriving late, though this correspondent also saw some varsity employees  the staff union is controlled by the Left  hurl stones at the rampaging Trinamul workers.         
	Four non-teaching employees were injured and were admitted to the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.        
	Trouble started around 10.15am when nearly 200 Trinamul workers led by district Youth Trinamul president, Khokan Das, insisted that the supporters would march to submit a memorandum to vice-chancellor Subrata Pal over the alleged hiring irregularities.         
	A local Trinamul leader said the Group-D posts  that of peons, gardeners, electricians and other similar jobs  were being filled with supporters of the Left.        
	The varsitys security staff refused to allow more than 10 Trinamul workers in, sparking an altercation that soon turned into a ransack spree.         
	The Trinamul workers broke the signboards above the gate. Then they ransacked the post office inside the compound, broke windowpanes and furniture. They also damaged around 50 two-wheelers and bicycles on the campus, said Sambaran Pramanik, secretary of the employees union.        
	The eight to 10 policemen on duty in front of the varsity were heavily outnumbered. University estate officer Kalyan Mukherjee said repeated calls to the local police station went unheeded. No reinforcements came.         
	Mukherjee said the larger police team arrived around 11am, by which time Trinamul workers had fled.        
	But as news of the campus chaos spread, around 100 suspected CPM cadres marched to an office of Trinamuls trade union wing at Hospital More, in the heart of the town, and set it on fire.        
	That sparked near-immediate retaliation around a kilometre away, where alleged Trinamul workers torched a CPM branch office in the Joramandir area.        
	Around 1.30pm, Madan Mitra, Trinamul MLA and the president of the partys youth wing, arrived in Burdwan from Calcutta and accused the police of inaction in preventing attacks by CPM men.         
	Mitra claimed that many Trinamul supporters were injured, though none was seen going to hospital for treatment.        
	After he left, clashes broke out in three more places with Trinamul and CPM supporters damaging vehicles and hurling brickbats at shops in the towns B.C. Road, Burrabazar, and Station Bazar Road areas.        
	Burdwan police chief R. Rajsekharan, said: The university had told us about the memorandum to be submitted and we had sent a team of policemen. But we did not realise it will take such a bad shape. Trinamul had not informed us about their plans.         
	Additional police chief S.R. Mishra said this evening the situation was under control.

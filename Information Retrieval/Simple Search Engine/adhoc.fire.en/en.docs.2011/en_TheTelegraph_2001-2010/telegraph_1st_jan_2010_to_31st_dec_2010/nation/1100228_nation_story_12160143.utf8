          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Feb. 27: Ranchi senior superintendent of police Praveen Kumar today asked hotel owners of the city to make necessary security arrangements to ensure that criminals did not use their establishments as safe havens.        
	Kumar, along with his junior officers, held a meeting with hotel owners and members of the Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries today to discuss the security arrangements of the hotels.        
	It is being observed that criminals from Uttar Pradesh and other neighbouring states are putting up in the hotels and committing crime in the city. We are asking the hotel owners to ensure that they maintain proper addresses of their guests in their registers after checking identity cards, said Kumar.         
	The SSP also discussed the possibility of installing closed-circuit television cameras at strategic locations of the buildings. He also told them to inform the police if they came across any suspicious persons in their hotels.         
	Kumar said another meeting would be held on March 8 with the hotel owners to discuss in details what other security arrangements could be taken. We have urged the hotel owners to take security measures. But if some hotels fail to do so, we will be strict with them to go for the arrangements, he added.         
	The meeting had been convened two days after criminals had tried to kill businessman Vijay Dhanuka.

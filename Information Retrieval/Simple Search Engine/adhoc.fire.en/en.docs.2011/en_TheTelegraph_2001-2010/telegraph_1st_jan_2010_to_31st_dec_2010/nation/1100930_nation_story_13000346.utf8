                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ayodhya chants peace
          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	Ayodhya, Sept. 29: The buzzword in the twin towns on verdict day-eve is peace.        
	On a day P. Chidambaram quoted Gandhijis favourite lines  Ishwar Allah tero naam, sabko sanmati de Bhagwan  the common people in Ayodhya and Faizabad courted peace in their own quaint way, pasting stickers with couplets on vehicles or putting them up in paan shops.        
	Faizabad desh se kahega, faisla jo bhi ho shahr shaant rahega (Faizabad will tell the country that whatever the verdict, the town will remain peaceful), went a sticker on a truck. Aman mera chaman, Hind mera watan (Peace is my garden, India is my country), went another in a shop. Elsewhere, people handed out pamphlets with appeals for peace.        
	Contrary to apprehensions of trouble, it seemed business as usual here. Shops and schools remained open. Men and women, both Hindus and Muslims, milled in the streets near the Hanumangarhi temple, the biggest in Ayodhya, shopping for provisions and vegetables.        
	The only thing that betrayed their anxiety was their shopping bags. Most bravely said the twin cities would remain peaceful whatever the verdict, but were unwilling to take chances. It is better to be prepared. I am stocking up on provisions, said R.P. Singh, a resident.        
	One of the original petitioners, Md Hashim Ansari, said he was confident the security arrangements would ensure there was no trouble. I have several Hindu friends. I can walk into any of the 8,000 temples here. The priest of Hanumangarhi is a friend. Trouble, if any, will be created by politicians, the 90-year-old, who lives on the outskirts of Ayodhya, said.        
	He then talked of politicians who, to his mind, had exploited the Ayodhya dispute to their advantage. They built their political careers, minted money. I was the original petitioner. But look at my children and grandchildren  they are drivers, he said, sitting on a wooden bed in a dilapidated house.        
	A tailor by profession, Ansari said the verdict, whichever way it went, should be respected by all. He said he had yet to decide if he would move the Supreme Court if the verdict did not go in his favour. We will decide that tomorrow, he said.

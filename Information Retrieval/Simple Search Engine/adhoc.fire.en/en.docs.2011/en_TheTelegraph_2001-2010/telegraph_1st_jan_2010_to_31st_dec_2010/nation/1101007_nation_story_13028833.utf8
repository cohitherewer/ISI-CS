	New Delhi, Oct. 6: Present please, Maam.        
	Please take your seat, Mr VC.        
	Vice-chancellors and other administrators in educational institutions could soon be attending classes if the human resource ministry gives the go-ahead to the IIMs to start courses on academic management.        
	Directors of Indias top B-schools will meet HRD minister Kapil Sibal next Wednesday to discuss, among other things, plans to start such courses. Sources said the idea was to create a pool of professionals who can tackle the emerging challenges faced by educational institutions.        
	Running educational institutions requires special training, given the emerging challenges faced by such institutions. The directors will discuss starting special courses on academic management on the pattern of courses on business management, an official told The Telegraph.        
	Vice-chancellors, registrars and other administrators in key positions can enroll for the course, the official said.        
	The directors will also discuss the governance structure of the IIMs. At present, the management institutes enjoy autonomy in academic matters but the government decides the pay structure for faculty.        
	The HRD ministry had set up a committee under Maruti Udyog chairman R.C. Bhargava to study the governance structure at the IIMs and suggest measures to help the B-schools achieve excellence.         
	Next weeks meeting will also discuss ways to attract quality faculty. A committee, set up under Ajit Balakrishnan of Rediff.com to look into the issue has already submitted its report.         
	The IIMs, which have been recruiting teachers according to norms fixed by the government, are demanding more autonomy so that they can hire faculty through invitation and offer them better package over and above the scales fixed by the government.         
	The October 13 meeting will also review the progress made by the new IIMs.         
	The government has appointed directors in four of the new IIMs  Ranchi, Raipur, Rohtak and Trichy.

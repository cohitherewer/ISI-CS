	 New Delhi, Oct. 20 (PTI): India has said that only highly skilled foreigners who have been drawing annual salaries of more than $25,000 would be given employment visas.           
	It has also lifted the cap on the number of overseas workers that can be employed for a project. The home ministry has nullified a labour department circular that had capped the foreign workforce to 1 per cent of the total strength in a project with a minimum of five and maximum of 20 people. The removal of the cap is expected to help power and steel projects in partic- ular.           
	The home ministry has, however, made it clear that employment visas shall not be granted for jobs for which qualified Indians are available and also for routine, ordinary or secretarial/clerical jobs.                  
	Shimla: A private engineering college in Sirmour district of Himachal Pradesh has suspended 17 students for involvement in ragging and vandalism. The 17 had allegedly ragged third-semester student Jagdeep Singh.                   
	New Delhi (PTI): The Centre has declared the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore, an institute of national importance. The cabinet has also approved the introduction of a bill that will allow the institute to formulate courses that are required but are not approved by the Medical Council of India.                   
	Kuala Lumpur (PTI): A 37-year-old Indian national has been murdered allegedly by a Malaysian man. K. Mohanasundaram is suspected to have been killed last month by Abdul Rahim Abdul Raza. A local court has fixed December 7 as the date of hearing.                   
	Kochi (PTI): Etihad Airways has said it would offer free visas to people travelling from Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode airports to Abu Dhabi.

	Srinagar, Sept. 18: The death toll in the Kashmir street protests crossed hundred today, the hundredth day of the agitation.        
	Five persons lost their lives today, taking the toll to 102 since the protests started on June 11 when a teenager, Tufail Ahmad Mattoo, was killed in tear-gas shelling by police in the Old City. Each death fuelled more protests, leading to more deaths followed by more intense protests.        
	All but one of the 102 dead are civilians, most of whom were killed by security forces. One policeman was killed when he was hit by a vehicle during a clash between the security forces and the protesters.        
	The present agitation has already turned out to be deadliest since the 1990 unrest: the toll is nearly double that in the 2008 Amarnath agitation.         
	The youngest victim was eight-year-old Sameer Ahmad Rah.        
	It was perhaps a milestone that the government was eager to achieve. In the first 93 days, you had some 75 dead. But in the last seven days or so, more than 25 were killed to achieve a-killing-a-day target, said human rights activist Khurram Parvez.        
	Parvez was referring to the protests that started on Id last Saturday and prompted the authorities to enforce round-the-clock curfew.        
	For the first time since Id, the curfew was relaxed for hours in different parts of the Valley, giving some respite to the people.        
	Anantnag was rocked by protests today after the body of Manzoor Ahmad Nath, a youth missing since he was chased by security forces last week, was recovered from the Jhelum. Security forces opened fire which left another youth, Noor Amin Dagga, dead.        
	The police said Bilal Ahmad Najar, district president of the youth wing of the Opposition Peoples Democratic Party, was among the injured. The police added hat he was also among the protesters. The government has in the past blamed the PDP for fomenting trouble but it is first time any senior functionary has been injured in any clash.        
	The London-based human rights group, Amnesty International, today appealed to Indian authorities to order security forces not to use firearms against demonstrators. Security forces should use the minimum force necessary to defend themselves, it said.

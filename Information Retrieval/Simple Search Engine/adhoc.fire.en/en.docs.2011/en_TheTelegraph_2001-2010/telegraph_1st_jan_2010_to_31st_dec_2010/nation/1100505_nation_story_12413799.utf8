The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Funds agency for varsities
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Funds agency for varsities
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, May 4: The human resource development ministry is proposing a new inter-university agency that will take over the UGCs responsibility of funding varsities, divorcing the tasks of regulating and financing institutions for the first time.         
	The inter-university financing centre, though, will not have any of the regulatory powers held by a commission under the HRD ministrys plan, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The plan for the new funding agency has been incorporated in the ministrys latest draft legislation for the National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER) that will take over the regulatory powers of the UGC and other regulators.         
	Like the UGC at present, the new funding agency will fully fund central universities while also providing grants to state universities.         
	The inter-university financing centre will have one member from the NCHER but will function completely independent of the new regulator, sources said.         
	The idea is that the NCHER will take care of all regulatory tasks, while the inter-university financing agency will be in charge of funding varsities and monitoring their expenditure, a source close to the development said.         
	An HRD ministry panel of experts had earlier this year held nation-wide consultations on an initial draft of the NCHER bill. The initial bill had empowered the NCHER with the task of funding universities along with the responsibility of maintaining academic standards  like the UGC.         
	But the ministry and the panel of experts faced opposition from several stakeholders during the consultations. The critics argued that by giving the NCHER the dual responsibility of financing and regulating institutions, the HRD ministry was repeating the flaws that plague the UGC.         
	The National Knowledge Commission had recommended that the roles of funding universities and regulating them be handed over to separate agencies.         
	Its dual responsibility placed the UGC in a position of conflict of interest, critics argued. If you are funding an institution it is hard to accuse it of violating norms as that would lead to questions about why you were funding it, an adviser to the government who was formerly with the NKC said.

	Cuttack, Dec. 27: Orissa police are embroiled in a controversy over alleged irregularities in the purchase of woollen wear and other accessories for the force.        
	The alleged irregularities relate to the purchase of khaki woollen jerseys, khaki woollen hose-tops, khaki nylon socks, black ankle boots, brown officer shoe (moulded sole) and brown leather belts for 2010-11.        
	The purchase process was challenged in the high court by Prakash Mohanty, a supplier with a valid rate contract of export promotion and marketing (EPM) for such articles of clothing. Mohantys petition claimed the process adopted for purchase describing it as illegal, arbitrary and discriminatory.         
	The high court has issued notices to the state government seeking clarifications on the matter.         
	The home secretary, director general of police, inspector general of police (law and order) and chairman of the purchase committee, AIG of police (provisioning) and director of export promotion and marketing (Orissa) have been accused in the case which is expected to be taken up for hearing after the winter vacation.        
	Mohanty, proprietor of Baba Enterprises, had filed the petition after getting purchase orders for clothing for the force.        
	After a preliminary hearing, a two-judge bench of Chief Justice V. Gopal Gowda and Justice B.N. Mohapatra admitted the petition and issued notices to the state government to clarify the matter within 15 days.        
	The government was expected to file responses a fortnight ago. But the counter affidavits had not been received yet, petitioner counsel Umesh Patnaik said today.         
	The purchase process was arbitrary and discriminatory because the purchase committee had not disclosed the total requirement of different items or the quantities apportioned before different participating firms, the petition said.        
	The process of selection of sample and firms as well as distribution of items to be purchased being prima facie non-transparent and discriminatory, is not sustainable in law, the petition had alleged.        
	The policy of the government provides for distribution of all EPM rate contract articles equally among all firms registered under EPM rate contract to ensure that benefits of marketing are equitably distributed. But in the present case, there is apparent violation of such policy, it added.        
	Some firms had been given larger shares of supply of different items than others without any valid or acceptable reasons, the petition said seeking direction to allow proper participation of eligible parties in the process and distribute the items sought to be purchased equitably among them.

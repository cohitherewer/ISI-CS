                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lalu hits back after Left barb
          J.P. YADAV                              
	New Delhi, April 30: Lalu Prasad today asked the Left to explain why it had voted with the communal BJP on the cut motions in Parliament, a day after CPM mouthpiece Peoples Democracy took a dig at him and Mulayam Singh Yadav for abstaining.        
	They (the Left) should explain why they voted along with the communal forces, Lalu Prasad said when asked about the CPMs view that the Yadav duo should explain the reason for their walkout.        
	We (Lalu Prasad and Mulayam) had asked the Left to change their stand over the womens reservation bill and support our demand for a quota within the quota. But they refrained from committing anything, the Rashtriya Janata Dal president told The Telegraph.        
	On the womens bill they joined hands with the BJP and the Congress and left us in the lurch. But over the cut motion they wanted our help. How can they except to have everything their way?        
	The CPM weekly had hinted the Yadav duo did not vote against the government as they had CBI cases against them.         
	Asked about a possible alliance with the Left for the Bihar polls, Lalu Prasad was non-committal. Let the time come, then we will decide. We have to see whether our people want an alliance with parties that do not support the cause of backward and Muslim women, he said.

	Bhubaneswar, March 21: Amitabh Bachchan and his wife Jaya offered puja to Lord Jagannath in Puri today during his daylong visit when he also attended the inauguration of Gurukul, a school built by flute maestro Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia.        
	However, no barricade and special arrangement was made for the Bollywood superstars visit and the police had a tough time handling the swarm of people who gathered outside the temple.         
	The star couple, along with Chaurasia, spent about 30 minutes inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple.         
	Later, Bachchan talked to the temple authorities about its kitchen and the neelachakra wheel.        
	Interestingly, they neither paid any dakshina nor registered their names in the temple visitors book.         
	In the afternoon, the Bachchans attended the inaugural function of the Virndaban Gurukul. The school, set up over a sprawling two acres at Ghatika in Bhubaneswar, aims at teaching and promoting performing arts of the world (music and dance particularly), yoga and meditation techniques in a serene atmosphere along the ancient Indian gurukul principles.        
	The Gurukul will cater to students of the east interested to learn Indian classical music, Indian-Western integrated music, along with meditation techniques, yoga and music theory. My mission is world peace, love and harmony through music, meditation and relaxation, the 71-year-old maestro said         
	Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Big B said: The very concept of Guru-Shishya is so Indian and I am proud that we have people like Chaurasiaji who are determined to pass on the culture and tradition of music to the next generation.         
	While the first Gurukul was set up in Mumbai, the second one is here and the third would be set up in the US.

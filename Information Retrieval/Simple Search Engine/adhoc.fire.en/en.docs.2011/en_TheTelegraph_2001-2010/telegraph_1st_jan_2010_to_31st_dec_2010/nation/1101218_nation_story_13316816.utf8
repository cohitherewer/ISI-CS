          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Surendra Mohan                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: Veteran socialist leader Surendra Mohan passed away this morning following a cardiac arrest. He was 84 and is survived by his wife, Manju Mohan, a son and a daughter.         
	Mohan, who served one term in the Rajya Sabha between 1978 and 1984, was one of a rare breed of politicians who was never tempted by office despite being close to the power centre in Delhi.         
	A socialist activist to the end, Mohan wrote widely and played a central role in both the Janata experiments at the Centre  the post-Emergency Janata Party government and the Janata Dal dispensation headed by V.P. Singh.         
	Mohan was cremated at the Nigambodh Ghat this afternoon in the presence of family, friends, associates and a large number of well-wishers.

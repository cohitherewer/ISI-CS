          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 15: Delhi University has selectively embraced a new undergraduate academic schedule in 12 science courses, dividing the academic year into two semesters instead of an annual examination for these programmes.         
	But Indias largest university has put on hold plans to introduce the semester system across remaining courses for a year following protests from teachers.         
	The DU Academic Council  the highest varsity authority on academic matters  on Thursday decided to introduce the semester system for all science courses other than BSc (Hons) mathematics and BSc chemical sciences from July.         
	But the council decided to put on hold plans to extend the semester system to all courses under pressure from teachers. Several teacher representatives on the council had after the meeting protested against vice-chancellor Deepak Pental whom they accused of trying to ramrod the plan through without adequate debate.         
	Teachers across streams  including the sciences  have been opposed to the introduction of the semester system for the past two years.         
	But the UGC and the human resource development ministry have since 2007 made it clear that the government wants all universities to adopt the semester system. The DUs plan is in keeping with the UGCs roadmap for reforms.         
	The 16 new central universities started by the government over the past three years have all been made to adopt the semester system under the acts of Parliament that allowed creation of these institutions.

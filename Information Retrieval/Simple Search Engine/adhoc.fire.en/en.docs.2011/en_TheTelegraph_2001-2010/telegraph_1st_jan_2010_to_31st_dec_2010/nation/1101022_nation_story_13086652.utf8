          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhopal, Oct. 21: In bad news for Rahul Gandhis efforts to attract the best and brightest youths to the Congress, a 27-year-old Youth Congress worker sent to Patna as an observer for the National Student Union of India elections has accused two party leaders of taking her captive and raping her repeatedly.         
	The woman, who had left for Patna in mid September, returned home to Morena in Madhya Pradesh yesterday and filed a police complaint.         
	The Morena superintendent of police, Kamal Maurya, said he was sending the case diary to Ranchi, where the woman alleged the crime was committed. The allegations are serious. We want Ranchi police to investigate the matter and coordinate with us, Maurya said.         
	An FIR has been registered under Section 376 (rape) and Section 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code. Maurya said a medical test had confirmed rape.         
	In her complaint, the woman said in Patna she met Devendra Sharma, a resident of Morena, who introduced her to another leader, Shamsher Alam. Alam lured her on the pretext of getting her a post in the Congress Sewa Dal, she said, adding she was taken to Ranchi, kept in captivity and sexually abused.         
	About a fortnight ago, the womans parents had lodged a complaint that their daughter was missing. A few days ago, they received a telephone call informing them she was in Ranchi and rushed to bring her back.         
	The 27-year-old was reportedly helped by Alams estranged wife, who has filed a case of dowry-related harassment and intimidation against her husband.         
	State Congress leaders refused to comment on the incident.         
	BJP spokesperson Vijesh Lunawat said sleaze was an integral part of the NSUI and Youth Congress culture. Be it Naina Sahni, Jessica Lal, Sarla Mishra or this particular case, the Youth Congress and NSUI come across as dens of criminal and undesirable elements. The honour of young girls and women is not safe in the Congress, he said.         
	Naina Sahni, the wife of former Youth Congress leader Sushil Sharma, was burnt alive in a tandoor at a New Delhi hotel in July 1995. Sharma was subsequently convicted of the murder and Delhi High Court has confirmed his death sentence. Jessica Lal was killed by a Youth Congress leader, Manu Sharma. Sarla Mishra had allegedly committed suicide in Bhopal several years ago after being exploited by powerful leaders during Congress rule.         
	Privately, local Congress leaders admitted that seeking sexual favours in exchange for career growth was not uncommon but insisted the malaise cuts across party lines. There are some unhealthy trends in all political formations, a state Congress functionary said.                           
	Some party leaders said such incidents would hurt Rahuls efforts to attract students of engineering, management and other disciplines to Congress-affiliated organisations.         
	When the general secretary in charge of Youth Congress and NSUI visited Madhya Pradesh in January this year, he was repeatedly asked why youngsters should opt for politics when it was a den of corruption and crime.         
	During an interaction in Sagar in the Bundelkhand region, a girl described NSUI leaders as goons. The student of Dr. Harisingh Gaur University said the student wing of the Congress was good for nothing and was known for disrupting classes. A thunderous applause followed. Rahul had responded that henceforth all NSUI office-bearers would be democratically elected. You will get the kind of leaders you choose, he said, adding with a smile, I feel if women like you come forward, the organisation will get strength.

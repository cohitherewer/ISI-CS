	New Delhi, Nov. 13 (PTI): Germany today took exception to environment minister Jairam Rameshs remark that SUVs and BMWs were fuel-guzzlers and bad emitters, saying German car technology was far advanced in reducing both fuel consumption and fuel emissions.        
	It is very difficult to imagine that Mr Jairam Ramesh, minister of environment and forests, has made such specific comments on fuel technology with reference to German automotive manufacturers, German ambassador Thomas Matusseks statement said.        
	The German industry is also proud to have some of the most sustainable car companies in the world who have pioneered CO2 emission cuts and have next-generation fuel-efficiency standards.        
	Ramesh had told a UN conference on low carbon transport options in Delhi yesterday: The use of vehicles such as SUVs and BMWs in countries like India is criminal.        
	He had favoured a reformed diesel-pricing policy so that it would benefit farmers and not the owners of the BMWs, the Benzs and Hondas. BMW and Mercedes-Benz are Germany-based automakers.        
	Rameshs comments were based on the logic that the more fuel a vehicle uses up per kilometre, the higher its emissions. Matussek said the German auto industry had implemented a variety of fuel-saving and emissions-reducing measures.        
	The German automotive industry has been continuously progressing to secure a sustainable future with fuel-saving engines, state-of-the-art recycling techniques and greener production facilities, he said.         
	Correction        
	In the report Jairam criminal tag on fuel-guzzlers in the November 13 edition, a sentence read: As minister, Ramesh now uses an Ambassador (11.1km per litre) but earlier owned a Maruti Zen, which offers lower fuel economy. The last part should have said higher fuel economy. We apologise for the mistake.

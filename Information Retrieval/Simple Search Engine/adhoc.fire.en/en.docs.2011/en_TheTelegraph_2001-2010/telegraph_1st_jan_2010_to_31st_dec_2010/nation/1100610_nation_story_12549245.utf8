The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amma descends from ivory tower
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Amma descends from ivory tower
          G.C. SHEKHAR                           Supporters outside the ADMK office in Chennai to meet Jayalalithaa                                  
	Chennai, June 9: She came, she saw, she left  without uttering a word.        
	But her flock, waiting for hours under a steady drizzle, was happy: it wasnt every day they got to meet Amma.        
	ADMK chief Jayalalithaa today met party cadres  at an arms length  the silent communion coming nearly three years after she had last interacted with them.        
	Observers said the former Tamil Nadu chief minister was forced to descend from her ivory tower after desertions by several senior leaders who alleged that she had become inaccessible even to long-term party loyalists, many of whom have been in the ADMK longer than her.         
	The defection by these leaders had led to murmurs that unless Amma stepped in personally to fill the breach, the party would be left with no middle-level leader. So she has announced her decision to meet cadres at least once a month to hear out their grievances, said a senior legislator.        
	For someone who rarely made a public appearance except on special occasions, to meet cadres one-to-one appears to be a sincere effort to undo the damage of the past, the MLA added.        
	The cadres arent complaining. Amma had met them, it didnt matter she was there for hardly 50 minutes. Hundreds of them had waited in the rain outside the party office in central Chennai, an expectant glow on their faces, large envelopes in their hands.        
	True, we were briefed that we could only greet her and hand over our petitions but must not utter a word unless Amma herself asked us anything. I hardly spent two seconds in front of her, but the fact that she received my petition is itself a positive development, said a party worker from Thiruvannamalai.                    
	Most party workers arent sure if Jayalalithaa will ever read the petitions. But they are more than satisfied that she has at least come this far to bridge the growing gap between her and the cadres.

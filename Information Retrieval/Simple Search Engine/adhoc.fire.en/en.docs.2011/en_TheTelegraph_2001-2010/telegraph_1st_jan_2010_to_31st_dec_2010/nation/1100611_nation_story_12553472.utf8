          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, June 10: A father in Kashmirs Anantnag allegedly killed his 30-year-old schoolteacher daughter because she was firm on marrying a man of her choice, a rare case of honour killing in the Valley.        
	Abdul Rahman Hajam, a resident of Dooru village in the south Kashmir district, has been held for allegedly stabbing Ruby Jan to death.         
	There was an attempt to cover up the murder as she was buried hurriedly by the family. The family tried to project the death as the result of a fall. But we got a clue after rumours spread that she was murdered and that there were injury marks on her body, a police officer said.        
	Anantnag police chief Showkat Ahmad Malik said they had started investigations. During examination of the scene of the crime, it was established that she was stabbed to death. The body was later exhumed and a post-mortem conducted by a team of doctors in the presence of a magistrate, he said.        
	Malik said the probe so far showed it was a case of honour killing. There were differences and the family thought she (Ruby) wasnt paying heed to their opinion. We have booked him (Abdul) under Section 302 (murder).        
	Police sources said they had found the knife used in the murder. The father had purchased it around 15 days before the murder, another officer said. Ruby was the eldest of Abuls three daughters. He also has a son. Malik said Rubys case was the first of alleged honour killings in many years.

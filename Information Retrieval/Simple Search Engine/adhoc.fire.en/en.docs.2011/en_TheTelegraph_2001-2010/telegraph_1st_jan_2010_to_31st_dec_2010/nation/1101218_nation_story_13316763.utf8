          AMIT ROY                          Elizabeth Hurley and Arun Nayar                                  
	London, Dec. 17: English actress and model Elizabeth Hurley has knocked down suggestions that she is going to go for a quickie divorce from her Indian businessman husband Arun Nayar or that she will fly Down Under to be with her Australian cricketer lover Shane Warne over the Christmas and New Year period.        
	Perhaps the mother in her realises she has been self-obsessed and neglected her responsibilities nearer home, as many of her critics are alleging in a flurry of newspaper blogs.        
	 Referring to her eight-year-old son, Damian, who cannot have been immune from the sleaze swirling around his mother and her reported two-night fling with Warne at the Bentley Hotel in South Kensington, Hurley said: My poor baby in bed with a fever.        
	 The Daily Mail and other papers had claimed Hurley would seek a speedy dissolution of her marriage, possibly so that she could be with Warne.        
	 But on Twitter, her principal means of communicating with the media, Hurley, increasingly referred to these days as a swimwear model, said: Bored now of silly speculations: no one is divorcing anyone yet, no one is fighting over money amp; I have no plans to go to Australia. Enough!        
	 The use of the word yet suggests divorce is not ruled out eventually. After Nayars public humiliation  his wife was holed up in Warnes suite for 11 hours in one go apparently  a reconciliation seems unlikely.        
	 However, no one can tell whether Hurleys encounter with Warne was not just an opportunistic fling which would have remained a secret had the News of the World not exposed the affair over several pages last week. It remains to be seen what else the newspaper has in store for this Sunday.        
	Whoever gave the story and the pictures to the paper clearly had his (or her) palms generously crossed with silver for that is how the system works.        
	Meanwhile, British women journalists have accused Warne of one fault they say they cannot overlook  he uses too many exclamation marks in his Twitter messages.        
	 In his latest, he confirmed the allegation: Still no sleep... so got up out of bed, now staring at the water here in Perth, sulking and feeling grumpy!! Need cheering up today!        
	English fans at the Perth Test added to Warnes discomfiture by urging the Australian selectors to Bring Back Horny Warnie.        
	Meanwhile, a photograph has appeared of Nayar looking disconsolate and lighting up a cigarette. He is in London but it is not known where he is staying or whether he has had a talk with his wife.

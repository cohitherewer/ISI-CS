                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Obama bares job compulsion

	Washington, Nov. 3 (PTI): President Barack Obama has said he has a responsibility to support jobs for Americans but added that the economic relationship with Delhi can be a win-win one, seeking to balance concerns at home and abroad ahead of his visit to India.        
	I have a responsibility to support jobs and opportunity for the American people, and I believe the US-India economic relationship can and should be a win-win relationship for both of our countries, Obama told PTI today.        
	Obama, who has recently spoken against outsourcing of American jobs to countries like India and offered tax breaks for firms creating jobs in the US, was responding to a question whether he would address concerns in India.        
	With adverse election results pouring in, Obama took care not to ruffle feathers in America. The President said his administration was focused on Americas economic recovery, investing in Americas future, creating and keeping jobs in the United States, increasing our exports and providing incentives and creating conditions under which businesses can grow and prosper.        
	He made a case for free access to American companies in India. Our market is open to products, services and investment from around the world. We believe other countries, including India, should give US companies the same access to their markets that we give.        
	Obama made no reference to any specific sectors but the Americans have been pushing for greater access in finance and retail.        
	The President said the US has realised that its economy cannot recover and grow without growth in other places. India has world-class companies, many of which are creating and supporting tens of thousands of jobs in the United States, and my administration wishes to encourage more such investment, he said.        
	Ebullience replaced caution when Obama referred to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Describing his friend Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as one of the most extraordinary leaders he had met, Obama said he greatly valued the Indian leaders friendship, wisdom and decency.        
	From our very first conversation in London, I have found that the Prime Minister and I share many of the same values, the same goals and the same vision for the well-being of our people, he said.        
	Saying that he and his wife Michelle were excited about going to India, Obama added: One of the great joys of my visit to India is the opportunity to see the Prime Minister again.        
	Obama said: Michelle and I were so pleased to host the Prime Minister and his wonderful wife (Gursharan Kaur) for our first state dinner (a year ago).        
	The US President asked Pakistan to bring to book transparently, fully and urgently those responsible for the Mumbai terror attacks.        
	Pakistan is taking important steps and making sacrifices in our shared fight against extremism, and we will continue to underscore the importance of taking additional action to eliminate terrorist safe havens, he said.        
	Addressing criticism that Washington had not leaned enough on Pakistan to deal with terror emanating from its soil, Obama said that the United States had taken every opportunity to make it clear to Pakistan that confronting violent extremism of all sorts is in its own interests and in the interest of regional stability.        
	Obama explained why he has chosen to stay at the Taj hotel when he visits Mumbai. By staying at the Taj, I am pleased to pay tribute to the resilience of the Indian people, while also underscoring our shared commitment to counter terrorism, he said.        
	Moily potshot        
	With Obama asking Americans to work hard to compete with Bangalore and Beijing, law minister M. Veerappa Moily today said if at all the US President was afraid of anything it was the world class IT sector in the garden city.         
	If at all, the US President (Barack) Obama is afraid, he is afraid of only Bangalore... Moily said at a book launch in Delhi, recalling how he had managed to establish the world class infrastrcture in Bangalore when he was chief minister of Karnataka.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 20: The state government is contemplating building multiplexes in some selected gram panchayats to make urban entertainment available to the rural populace.        
	Provisions starting from video parlours to indoor games, community halls and auditoriums will be available in these rural multiplexes. Besides, there will be at least 40 shops in each of the rural multiplex, which will be built on public-private partnership (PPP) mode.        
	The proposal was discussed at a meeting chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik here last evening.        
	Apart from the rural multiplexes, one lakh low-cost houses would be constructed for the urban poor through the PPP model at various district headquarters, planning and co-ordination minister A.U. Singhdeo said today.        
	This would meet the growing housing needs of the urban poor, especially slum dwellers, he said, adding that these houses would be allotted to low income groups at a low price.        
	The government was also planning to build night shelters in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Rourkela, Berhampur and Puri to provide temporary shelter to those who spend nights under the open sky, he said. Similarly, pay and use toilets would be constructed in urban areas to improve sanitation system.        
	The government will also set up mini-secretariats at district headquarters to bring all government offices under one roof.         
	People will not have to run to the state secretariat or different offices for their work. Building up health infrastructures in backward areas was also discussed at the meeting.                     
	It was decided to develop some big health centres in backward areas into medical colleges and hospitals.        
	Proposals for skill development of unemployed youth through driving training also figured in the discussions. It was proposed that driving training centres in all district headquarters would be opened by renowned automobile companies like Telco, Maruti Udyog and Ashok Leyland. Provision for imparting training on maintenance of vehicles will also be there.        
	State government will provide infrastructure support to all these projects, while the private companies would take up construction and allied activities, sources said.

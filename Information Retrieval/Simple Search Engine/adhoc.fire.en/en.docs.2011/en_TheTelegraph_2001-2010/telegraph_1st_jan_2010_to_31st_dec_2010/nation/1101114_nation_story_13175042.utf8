The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress keeps alliance boat steady   Why sack Raja now, ask leaders
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Congress keeps alliance boat steady     Why sack Raja now, ask leaders
          SANJAY K. JHA                             Manmohan Singh and A Raja (below)                                      
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: Congress leaders are not keen on forcing out telecom minister A. Raja, if such a step risks the alliance with the DMK, top sources said.         
	Speculation of political churning after Jayalalithaas offer of support to the UPA government if it decided to sack Raja  and in the process lose the support of the DMK  has perturbed a section of party leaders.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs tentative response to Jayalalithaas offer  he said the alliance with the DMK stands as of now and that the high command would decide on the AIADMK offer  has also caused some unease among leaders who prefer the status quo, the sources said.         
	The opinion within a section of the party is being aired amid a perception that the government wants to use the opportunity presented by Jayalalithaa to nudge the DMK into replacing Raja.         
	The DMK has so far shown no signs in public of relenting. Rajas fate now depends on how far the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi would want to pursue their clean-up drive that has so far remained confined to the Congress.         
	The Congress has already rejected Jayalalithaas offer and the political sources said there was no question of reconsidering it at a later stage. They iterated that there was no tacit understanding with the ADMK.         
	What will our credibility be if we keep changing our important allies. Who will trust us? a senior leader asked.         
	The Congress leadership has formally conveyed to the DMK that it should not lose sleep over any possible political realignment in the state, the sources said.         
	Despite the Congresss overt position and the governments unstated intent, nothing stops either from changing the tune on Raja at a convenient time.         
	Some sources in the government also expressed surprise at suggestions that the Prime Minister had decided to talk to DMK chief M. Karunanidhi on Rajas removal after his return from the G20 meet. What is the material change in the 2G spectrum case? The Supreme Court is looking into the matter and we should wait for the outcome. Why this sudden hurry to get Raja removed by disrupting the winter session of Parliament when the previous session ran smoothly? a government source asked.         
	One new aspect is the negative comments in the CAG report which will be tabled in Parliament next week. The question before the government is: should the CAG report be taken as a benchmark for ministerial propriety? Many in the government strongly feel this would be a dangerous proposition and argue that there is no precedent. No minister will support the premise that CAG reports be taken as credible indictment, the sources said.         
	As far as political morality is concerned, the Congress is clear that it should be Karunanidhis decision. Every party has its own standards and comfort levels. We have removed Ashok Chavan only because his mother-in-law had a flat in Adarsh society. No other evidence of wrongdoing was available against him. Other parties may not be that sensitive. We cannot force our standards on them, a senior Congress leader said.         
	As far as the stalemate in Parliament is concerned, the government feels the Opposition would realise its mistake and return to discussions as it has done several times in the past. Corruption is not an issue which is haunting this government alone. We too can show the mirror to the BJP. What is happening in Karnataka is not hidden from the world, a cabinet minister argued.         
	The Congress started its counter-attack today, questioning the BJP on Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappas alleged involvement in a land scam. Congress spokesperson Shakil Ahmed said in a statement tonight: The BJP should tell the nation what action it is going to take against the chief minister instead of making baseless allegations against others.         
	The description of the allegations as baseless is a clear defence of Raja, a departure from the Congress stand till yesterday when it had steadfastly refused to utter a word in favour of the beleaguered telecom minister.

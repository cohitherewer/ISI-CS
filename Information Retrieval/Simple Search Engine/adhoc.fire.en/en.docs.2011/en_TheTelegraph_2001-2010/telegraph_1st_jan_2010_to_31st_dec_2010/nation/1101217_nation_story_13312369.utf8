The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maharashtra DM on Andhra rural job list
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Maharashtra DM on Andhra rural job list
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 16: A Maharashtra district magistrate and his family have surfaced as beneficiaries of the rural job plan in Andhra Pradesh, bringing to light the corruption in the implementation of the UPA governments flagship scheme.        
	Solapur district magistrate Vijay Rao Patel, his parents, wife and son have been named beneficiaries in the village of Gullabig in Nizamabad district. A social audit has found that district authorities showed 100 days of wages drawn by Patels family till April this year. The authorities later mentioned that the family had migrated.         
	The truth, however, is that Patels parents left Nizamabad three decades ago. Besides, the Mahatma National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme is only for below-poverty-line (BPL) families  one member of each such family is entitled to 100 days work and wages.        
	Patel said the matter was brought to his notice last week. My parents left the village almost three decades ago. The work appears to be the mischief of some local officials as we are not even on the voters list, nor do we have any land there, he said.        
	A Nizamabad district official said that political interference had rendered the rural job programme redundant. Lot of bogus cards and work are recorded to display the success of the programme, he said. Of the 2,000 job cards issued in the Nizamabad village, at least 600 are bogus, he added.        
	Few months ago, ration cards and rural job cards meant for BPL families were issued in the name of cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, the late Andhra chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy and tennis ace Sania Mirza.

	Midnapore, July 12: Suspected Maoists last night shot dead two villagers, including a gram panchayat pradhan, in West Midnapore.         
	The bullet-riddled bodies of Soumen Bhakat, 33, the chief of Kenddangri gram panchayat, and Kamal Mahato, 56, were found 4km from their home in Jambonis Balidiha village. A villager said the Maoists had demanded Rs 5 lakh from Soumen recently but the panchayat chief had told the rebels he could not pay more than Rs 50,000.         
	Police said several spent AK47 cartridges were lying near the bodies. Here, only the joint forces and the Maoists use AK47 rifles, Mukesh Kumar, the ASP (operations), said.        
	The Maoists allegedly kidnapped Soumen and Kamal when they were returning from Jhargram town yesterday.

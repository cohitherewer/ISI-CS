          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, July 26: A CBI court today slapped a two-year prison term on M. Natarajan, the husband of Jayalalithaas close friend Sasikala, for evading duty while importing a luxury car in 1994.         
	The court found Natarajan, his nephew T.T.V. Bhaskaran, London-based businessman Yogesh Balakrishnan, and R. Sucharitha, a manager of Indian Bank, guilty of conspiracy, falsification of documents, evasion of duty and corruption. All have been given two years jail terms.        
	The CBI charged that the four, along with another bank employee and Yogeshs father S. Balakrishnan, had hatched a plot and imported a new Toyota Lexus in the name of Natarajans magazine, Tamil Arasi (Tamil Queen), in September 1994. The Balakrishnans from London had claimed the car was a year old but the CBI later found it was a new model and an unused one.         
	By declaring the car as old, Natarajan had paid Rs 1.06 crore less in customs duty, the CBI said. The car was subsequently seized by the customs department.         
	Since one of the bank employees had turned approver and S. Balakrishnan was absconding, the CBI prosecuted Natarajan, the editor of the small magazine, Bhaskaran, Tamil Arasis publisher, bank manager Sucharitha who has been suspended, and Yogesh.         
	CBI judge K. Ravichandran also slapped a fine of Rs 40,000 on Yogesh and Rs 20,000 each on the others.         
	He, however, suspended the sentence to allow the guilty to appeal in Madras High Court.

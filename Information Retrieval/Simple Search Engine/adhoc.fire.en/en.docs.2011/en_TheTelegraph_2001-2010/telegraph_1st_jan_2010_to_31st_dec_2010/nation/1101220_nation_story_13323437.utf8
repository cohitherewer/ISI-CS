The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Digvijay attacks, Sonia calms
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Digvijay attacks, Sonia calms
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 19: Sensing discomfort in Congress ranks over going all out against majority community terrorism, Sonia Gandhi today equated it with minority communalism.        
	But Digvijay Singh went after the Sangh, wondering why all Hindu terrorists arrested in various blast cases were RSS activists.        
	Seconding the political resolution that called for a probe into the link between terrorists and the RSS and its sister organisations uncovered in recent cases, Digvijay said the BJP never tired of saying that all Muslims are not terrorists but all terrorists are Muslims.        
	Can we apply the same logic and say that all Hindus are not terrorists? the AICC general secretary and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister asked.        
	Congress insiders said Sonias move to stick to the old position, Rahul Gandhis decision to remain silent and let Digvijay go after the BJP-RSS was part of a carefully thought-out strategy to test the waters.        
	Since last evening, there have been many behind-the-scene deliberations on whether Rahul should himself go on the offensive or let Digvijay speak out. Finally, the conservative sections won the day, prompting Rahul to back out.        
	A Rahul confidant, Digvijay has in recent days made several controversial statements that have not met with approval from a section of the Congress. Earlier, he had attacked the RSS and radical Hindu groups by saying slain ATS chief Hemant Karkare received threat calls for probing the Malegaon blast, which hinted at Hindu terrorists involvement.        
	Rahul, in his brief intervention at the Burari plenary, chose to remain silent on rise of majority community radicalism. He also avoided reference to WikiLeaks, which had quoted him as saying radicalised Hindu groups could pose a bigger threat to India than terror outfits like the Lashkar-e-Toiba.        
	Digvijay, however, went ballistic. He likened the RSS-BJPs alleged hatred for Muslims to that of the Nazis for Jews and claimed that the roots of terrorism in India lay in BJP leader L.K. Advanis 1992 rath yatra.        
	Minutes after Digvijay spoke, some colleagues said they were not convinced. Jagdambika Pal, a Lok Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh said: It is wrong to hold followers of a particular religion as responsible for violence.        
	For an AICC delegate like me, Sonia Gandhis formulation that terrorism has no colour is acceptable. How can a majority community with its exemplary record of pursuing peaceful co-existence be accused of saffron terror?        
	Pals sentiments were echoed by Sanjay Nirupam, the Congress MP from Mumbai North. He said Digvijays formulation on Karkares death could weaken Indias stand against terror and Pakistan, but there was no doubt that Karkare was killed by Pakistani terrorists.        
	Former Olympian Aslam Sher Khan said Digvijay was trying to deflect attention from the Bihar poll fiasco and the Parliament logjam over the 2G scam. Instead of offering a better deal or a sense of participation to minorities, he is indulging in rhetoric, which could prove counter-productive, the delegate from Madhya Pradesh said.        
	The AICCs political resolution said the role of religious fundamentalist organisations in challenging the nations security could no longer be ignored. The Congress calls upon the government to tackle this menace in the strongest possible manner and investigate links between terrorists and the RSS and its sister organisations that have been uncovered in some recent cases.        
	In her presidential address, Sonia launched a scathing attack on communalism. Terror of all hues is dangerous. We must not ignore parties and organisations fanning communalism and terror, she said.        
	The Congress makes no distinction between the majority and the minority communities who indulge in communalism and related acts of terrorism. They are all dangerous, they must all be defeated.        
	Digvijay however, insisted that the RSS-BJP should be checked at all costs. In the 1930s, Hitlers Nazi party attacked the Jews... similarly the RSS ideology wants to capture power by targeting Muslims under the garb of furthering nationalism, he said.        
	The RSS has been sowing the seeds of Muslim hatred in the minds of the new generation through Shishu Mandir schools this is the biggest danger for us.        
	Digvijay claimed the RSS had made its activists enter the bureaucracy, police and even the army.

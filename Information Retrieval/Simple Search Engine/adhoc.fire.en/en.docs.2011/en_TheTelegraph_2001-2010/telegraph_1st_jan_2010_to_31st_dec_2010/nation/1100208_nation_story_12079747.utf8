	Feb. 7: Maoists blew up railway tracks in Bihar early this morning, setting off a chain of train delays and cancellations in neighbouring Jharkhand and Bengal, on the first day of a 72-hour bandh spanning four states.        
	The rebels, protesting the arrival of central forces for a security operation in Jharkhand, blasted the Up and Down tracks near Rajla station in Bihars Jamui district bordering Jharkhand. The bandh, called in Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and Bengal, kicked in last midnight.        
	Over 40 Maoists were involved in the operation, a senior police officer in Patna said. A 2.5-foot length of the Up line and five feet of the Down line near Rajla station under East Central Railway, were damaged, railway sources said.        
	Trains started running again after noon.        
	Security has been intensified on all trains passing through Tatanagar and other important stations in Jharkhand.         
	The Tata-Badampahar Passenger, the Up and Down Palamu Express, Palamu Link Express, Gomoh-Barkakana passenger, Gomoh-Barwadih Passenger and Barwadih-Dehri-on-Sone Passenger have been cancelled.        
	The routes of the Shakti Punj Express, Ranchi-Varanasi Intercity, Tata-Jammu Tawi Express, Rajdhani Express and Swarnjayanti Express have been changed. These will run on the Gomoh-Gaya-Mughalsarai route.        
	To keep roads safe, an anti-landmine vehicle was pressed into service at Bhilai Pahari on National Highway-33. Movement of heavy vehicles will be restricted on the highway at night.        
	Today, government-run long-distance buses stayed off the roads in Jharkhand. Although private buses plied, they were few in number.        
	In the Maoist strongholds of Ghatshila, Chakulia, Potka, Chandil and Chowka  all in Jharkhand  the effect of the bandh was complete. Traffic was thin in Ghatshila, Chakulia and Potka.

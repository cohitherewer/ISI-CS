The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Clerics reject Ayodhya verdict
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Clerics reject Ayodhya verdict
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 7 (PTI): A group of Muslim scholars and clerics from Delhi and Uttar Pradesh today rejected the Allahabad High Court verdict on the Ayodhya title suits as well as any reconciliation bid, asking the Centre to clear its stand on the matter.        
	Led by Shahi Imam of Delhis Jama Masjid, Maulana Syed Ahmed Bukhari, nearly 40 scholars met here and passed a resolution. We reject the judgment of Allahabad High Court and demand that the central government express its stand clearly with regard to this verdict. We also demand that the Congress party make its stand clear, Bukhari said.        
	He said the scholars had written to Manmohan Singh and sought a meeting.        
	We hold the Congress directly responsible for all the anti-masjid acts perpetrated right from the raking up of the Babri Masjid issue till this verdict. The Congress party, on the one hand, kept Muslims under deception, while on the other hand, it helped communal forces, Bukhari said.        
	To a question if representatives of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) were present at the convention, Bukhari replied in the negative. Some AIMPLB members are involved in some back-door talks about some sort of negotiations. We did not invite them because we do not want to be part of any such talks. What kind of compromise formula will they work out when Muslims will not settle for anything less than a masjid at that site, he said.        
	Asked if he was seeking the support of other political leaders such as Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, Bukhari said: Support of anybody who is with the Muslim community is welcome. He said the convention would be a party to the appeal before the Supreme Court.

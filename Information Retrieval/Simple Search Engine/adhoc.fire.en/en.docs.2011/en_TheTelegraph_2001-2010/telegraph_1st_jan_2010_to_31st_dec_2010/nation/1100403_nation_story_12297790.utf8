          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ayesha Siddiquis family at a news conference in Hyderabad on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Hyderabad, April 2 (PTI): The family of the Hyderabad girl who claims to have married Shoaib Malik in 2002 today threatened to file a police complaint if he tied the knot with Sania Mirza without divorcing her.        
	If he goes ahead with the marriage (without divorce), then the law will take its course, M.A. Siddiqui, the womans father, said tonight.         
	Hours before, his daughter Ayesha released copies of the purported nikaahnama between her and the Pakistani cricketer as TV channels beamed clips of a 2004 interview in which he was shown saying he was married to Ayesha. The marriage certificate apparently contains the signatures of Shoaib in the column for the groom and the name of Maha Siddiqui in the column for the bride.         
	Ayesha, who alleged Malik had dumped her as she was fat, claimed she was Maha Siddiqui. My name is Maha Siddiqui, Ayesha is the name given to me by my grandmother. Maha is the name in my passport. So, when he says the wrong name was given during the nikaah, well both names belong to the same person  me.        
	Imran Zafar Malik, Shoaibs brother-in-law, dismissed the certificate as fake, asserting no nikaah ever took place.         
	I dont want to say anything except that Ayesha is a very talented girl and she is being misguided by some people, Imran said in Lahore, adding that the Siddiquis had left the Maliks no choice but to take legal action in India.         
	Ayeshas father said he had taken legal opinion. Ayesha said she had released the certificate because Malik and his family had been constantly denying the marriage.         
	The only thing I want now is an official divorce from him, but it has to be in the open and not behind closed doors because he can always then deny it later as he has (with) the marriage. I want to end my ordeal, I want to move on and put a stop to people asking me questions constantly about my marriage to him. Even an official talaq, talaq talaq will do.        
	Ayesha asserted she had nothing against Sania, who has said she will marry the cricketer this month. I have nothing against Sania but the truth must come out, she said.

  - Hunger strike ends after Andhra scraps cases against students         G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          A Congress leader who ended his hunger strike is offered juice by Andhra minister K Jana Reddy in Hyderabad on Tuesday. (PTI)                                        
	Hyderabad, Dec. 28: Congress MPs and MLAs from Telangana today called off their one-day-old fast after the state government accepted their demand to withdraw all police cases against students from the region who had agitated for statehood.        
	Ostensibly, the states Congress government has succumbed to pressure from its own lawmakers but analysts suggested the entire episode may have been stage-managed.        
	Such an interpretation appeared to gain credence from a remark by Congress Working Committee member K. Keshava Rao, who said: Why let the opponents take credit when the Congress alone can give (statehood to) Telangana?        
	Keshava Rao has been steering the Congresss efforts to gain pole position in the Telangana campaign ahead of the vocal Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS).        
	Even today, before the fast had been called off, TRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao had threatened that the people of Telangana would hit the streets from tomorrow if all cases against the students were not withdrawn.        
	Later, Chandrasekhar Rao threatened that his party would intensify its agitation if the Centre failed to start the statehood process after the Srikrishna committee handed in its report by December 31.        
	Eleven Congress MPs and MLAs from Telangana had begun their fast on the lawns of the new MLA quarters yesterday, demanding withdrawal of all the 1,667 cases lodged against 8,047 people between December 2009 and September 2010.        
	Earlier, an embattled government had dropped 700 cases against 3,336 people but balked at letting off students accused of arson and other serious charges. Today, the government said in a statement that it did not want the students and other Telangana agitators to suffer because of acts committed in momentary emotional stress, anger and anguish.        
	The statement, endorsed by chief minister Kiran Kumar Reddy and home minister Sabita Indra Reddy, was read out at the fasting venue before a gathering of students and Congress workers.        
	This government and the chief minister would like to ensure a golden future for the students of Andhra Pradesh, the statement said, almost terming the gesture a New Year gift to the students.        
	For all that, the government is taking no chances ahead of the Srikrishna reports release and may close several universities to pre-empt violence after December 31. The holidays are likely for a month, a vice-chancellor said.        
	The universities likely to be closed (along with their hostels) include the Kakatiya, Telangana, Mahatma Gandhi, Palamuru, Satavahana and Osmania.        
	The agitating Congress MPs have written to Sonia Gandhi seeking withdrawal of the paramilitary forces from Telangana, a demand also made by the TRS.        
	Education woes        
	As the fear of further agitations after December 31 looms, the government is worried about the possible loss of more school days and the prospect of having to postpone board examinations.        
	Students in the state have already lost 66 days this academic year, which comes to over 30 per cent of the 220-240 days that schools are expected to be open under the rules of the secondary and intermediate education boards.        
	The Secondary Schools Certificate (SSC) and intermediate examinations are scheduled for March and April. Officials said that if there were any more disruptions of classes, the exams would be certain to be postponed.        
	Schools are planning to cut short the mid-January Sankranti vacation that starts on January 9, said the convener of the Private Schools Managements Association, Srinivas Reddy. But it all depends on the political situation.        
	We have fixed two sets of dates for the SSC. If one set of dates does not work out, well conduct the examinations according to the other schedule, said an official from the directorate of government examinations.        
	An intermediate education board official said: Last year too, we had to postpone the examinations by a week as several schools had not had time to teach the entire syllabus.        
	We have completed teaching only 60 per cent of the intermediate syllabus so far, said Madhusudan Reddy, secretary, Government Junior College Lecturers Association.        
	Even yesterday, less than seven per cent of students appeared in their university semester exams in six Telangana districts following an education bandh call from the Osmania University Joint Action Committee.        
	Osmania vice-chancellor T. Tirupathi Rao said the students who skipped the exam may have to lose a year.

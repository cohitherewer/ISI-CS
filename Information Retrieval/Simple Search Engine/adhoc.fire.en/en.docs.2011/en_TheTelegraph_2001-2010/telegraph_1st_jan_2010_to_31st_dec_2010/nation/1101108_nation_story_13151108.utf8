                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delay ruckus at new airport terminal 
                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 7 (PTI): Angry fliers snatched public-address microphones and chanted slogans against Air India after unexplained delays at Delhis new airport terminal this evening, days after it made a snag-ridden debut.        
	Officials of the Indira Gandhi International Airport claimed acute shortage of parking space, a problem that forced some of the state-owned carriers planes that had flown in to wait for hours with passengers on the tarmac.         
	Some of the fliers also alleged that they did not receive baggage for three to four hours after landing. They complained that the conveyor belt was not functioning. The process usually takes no more than 30 minutes.         
	The officials said the baggage had to travel over 2km from the planes to the terminal but could not say why it took hours.        
	The ruckus  which occurred on a day the spotlight was on Delhi because of Barack Obamas visit to the capital  started after the agitated passengers failed to get a convincing reply from the officials.         
	The fliers had heated exchanges with Air India officials.         
	The passengers of a New York-Delhi flight were among those who complained about baggage delivery problems.        
	According to unconfirmed reports, Air India flights to the Gulf were delayed by at least three hours. Sources said AI 841, which was supposed to take off at 8.15pm for a destination in the Gulf, finally left at 11pm because of non-availability of a parking bay at the terminal.

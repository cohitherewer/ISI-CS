          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 23: Death of a classmate last night led to a free-for-all among angry students of Silicon Engineering College campus here.        
	Shamshuddin Shah, a third-year electronics and telecommunication student from Jajpur took his food at the college canteen around 9pm. In less than an hour, he complained of vertigo and started vomiting. His friends rushed him to the nearby KIMS Hospital after he began vomiting blood and doctors could not save him.         
	No sooner had the news of Shahs death spread on the campus, the students turned violent. At least 1,500 students came out of their hostels, vandalising all that came their way.        
	Several other students, who had the same food, complained of dizziness and vomiting with at least 60 of them falling sick.        
	Soon after the incident, enraged boarders entered the college canteen questioning the quality of food served.         
	As the canteen staff started arguing, the students went berserk and ransacked the canteen. Although the canteen staff tried to resist the students, but they were soon outnumbered as the students went about smashing windows, doors and breaking furniture.         
	Later, the boarders from the hostels joined the vandalism and in no time also vandalised the college building, including the reception counter.         
	The students burnt tyres at Magnet Square and blocked traffic for about an hour at 11pm.        
	Three persons have been arrested and interrogation is on, said IIC Infocity police station officer-in-charge S.K. Patel        
	Meanwhile, the authorities locked up the colleges main gate, restricting movement of students outside the campus.         
	Reporters trying to enter the campus were also allegedly attacked. Two camera personnel of two private channels were left badly injured in the scuffle. At least two cameras were damaged.        
	Journalists in Cuttack submitted a memorandum to director-general of police Manmohan Praharaj, demanding immediate action against the culprits involved in orchestrating the attack on reporters at Silicon Engineering College. The DGP assured them of taking action in accordance with the law.        
	However, college officials declined to comment. The management has declared the institute closed for two days following the violence.        
	Students who complained of food poisoning have been admitted to city-based Kalinga Hospital.

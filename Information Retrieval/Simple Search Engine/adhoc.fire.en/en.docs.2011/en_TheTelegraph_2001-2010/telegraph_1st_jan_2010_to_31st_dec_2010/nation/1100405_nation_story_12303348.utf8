	Karachi, April 4 (PTI): A group of Pakistani generals had offered to save former Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto from execution by sneaking him out of jail to Afghanistan but his daughter Benazir rejected the plan, an aide of the hanged leader has said.        
	Benazir did not accept the offer as she did not trust the army, Mustafa Khar told Geo TV on the 31st death anniversary of Bhutto. Bhutto was hanged after his government was dismissed by Zia-ulHaq.

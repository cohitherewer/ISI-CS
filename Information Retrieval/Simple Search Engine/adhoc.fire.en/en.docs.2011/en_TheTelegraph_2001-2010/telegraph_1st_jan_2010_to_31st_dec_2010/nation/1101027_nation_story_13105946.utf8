The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Eyes on Digvijay to read Sonias mind
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Eyes on Digvijay to read Sonias mind
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                     (From top) Rita Bahuguna Joshi, Rahul Gandhi and Digvijay Singh      
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: Former chief minister Amarinder Singh has returned as the Punjab unit president, Rita Bahuguna Joshi has been retained at the helm of the Uttar Pradesh unit despite opposition and R.V. Deshpande has been removed as Karnataka unit chief in the Congress state committee shuffle announced today.         
	There were no other surprises. Manas Bhuniya in Bengal, Bhubaneswar Kalita in Assam, J.P. Aggarwal in Delhi, Ramesh Chennithala in Kerala, Yashpal Arya in Uttarakhand, Kaul Singh Thakur in Himachal Pradesh and A.V. Subramaniam in Puducherry were retained as presidents as expected.        
	Decisions on politically significant states like Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat are yet to be taken.         
	The announcement triggered fierce speculation about Uttar Pradesh where Digvijay Singh, the AICC general secretary in charge of the state, had sought a change. Digvijays strained relations with Bahuguna had become a cause for concern in the vital state that goes to the polls in 2012.         
	Rahul Gandhi, who has undertaken a special mission to revive the party in Uttar Pradesh, considered the names of several young MPs as well as veteran Pramod Tiwari before the decision to persist with Bahuguna was taken.         
	Congress circles are now eagerly awaiting party president Sonia Gandhis decision on the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh. Digvijays removal  many senior party leaders are lobbying for it, because his continuance in the post helps him get easier access to Rahul  would send a significant political message. If Digvijay stays on despite the strained relations with Bahuguna, it will be an indication of Sonias and Rahuls confidence in the proactive leader.        
	In Punjab, which will also go to the polls in 2012, Amarinders return is a clear signal that Sonia still thinks he is the most potent force against the Badal family and that recapturing power would be difficult without his fighting spirit.         
	Amarinder has courted controversy in the recent past  his personal life has been in the news and allegations of financial impropriety have been made against aides  and many powerful state leaders were opposed to his rehabilitation.        
	In Karnataka, Deshpandes exit is being seen in the context of the partys failure to protect its flock  six MLAs have crossed over to the BJP, which has been struggling to save its government. Deshpandes place will be taken by G. Parmeshwar, a Dalit leader.         
	A striking feature of todays announcement is that most of the Northeast states held elections to choose their state committee presidents, instead of leaving the decision to Sonia like in the rest of India.         
	The Congress president has approved the result of elections held to the PCCs in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep, the news release issued by the party said. Only Nagaland had a new president in S.I. Jamir. In all the other units, the incumbents won another term.

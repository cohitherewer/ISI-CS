The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naidu packed   off on plane 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Naidu packed   off on plane 
          OUR BUREAU                          Chandrababu Naidu                                        
	July 20: Chandrababu Naidu was bodily lifted and put on a chartered flight to Hyderabad this evening, the rapid action capping the water war between Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.        
	The Ashok Chavan government sighed with relief after the Telugu Desam leader, confined at Dharmabads Industrial Training Institute hostel for defying prohibitory orders to reach the Babhali barrage site, was taken to Aurangabads Chikhalthana airport in an air-conditioned convoy and put on a plane. The flight took off at 8.30pm.        
	A PTI report said Naidu and his team of 43 landed at Shamshabad airport at 10pm. They were driven straight to the Care hospital in Banjara Hills for medical tests.        
	Naidus presence in Dharmabad had provoked protests from Babhali project supporters and political parties, which threatened to organise a Nanded bandh if he was not sent back to Andhra. To calm tempers, the Nanded administration decided to shift Naidu and his supporters to Aurangabad today.        
	Sources said Naidu, who was unwell after four days in captivity, refused to co-operate. He woke up late, demanded breakfast and got into an argument with prison and administration officials, delaying the journey till 10am.        
	His supporters refused to board the police van and got into a scuffle with policemen, forcing a cane-charge. In the melee, Desam MLA T.V. Rama Rao was beaten up, sources said. Another MLA, G. Govardhan, suffered leg injuries. Eight persons were hurt in all.        
	As the scuffle was going on, the legislators apparently tried to speak to reporters on their mobiles. Sources said the police then allegedly seized their phones and threw away their personal belongings.         
	We requested Naidu to leave for Aurangabad. But he refused to move an inch. We had to physically lift him and his group and put them in waiting vehicles, said Nanded collector Ajay Gulhane.        
	By the time Naidu and his team reached Aurangabad airport, the Nanded administration had withdrawn all offences against them on orders from the home ministry.        
	Another drama followed on the tarmac, with Naidu and his group refusing to board the aircraft. When we staged a dharna on the tarmac, the officials bodily lifted us into the plane, Desam MLC Rajendra Prasad claimed over phone.        
	A lady legislator alleged: The police treated us badly, dragging us by our hand and shoulders. They didnt care even when we cried with pain. We will never forget this day.        
	In Hyderabad, enraged Desam workers blocked roads, staged demonstrations and burnt effigies of Chavan. They torched some Maharashtra buses and lorries in Nizamabad and Anantpur districts.        
	The National Human Rights Commission has directed Maharashtra to submit a report on a petition by former Desam MP Yerran Naidu.         
	Chavan has cancelled his visit to Puttaparthi in Andhra tomorrow.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                        A Kandhamal riot   victim. File picture      
	New Delhi, Aug. 23: Admit you were part of the conspiracy to kill Swami Laxmanand Saraswati or name someone who was, the mob said. Then they hunted people down and buried them alive, or butchered a husband before a wifes eyes.        
	A peoples tribunal today heard horror stories of the anti-Christian pogrom in Orissas Kandhamal district in 2008 as victim after victim got up to depose. They blamed the Sangh parivar for shattering the centuries-old peace between communities.        
	Some 95 survivors have come to the three-day National Peoples Tribunal that began at the Constitution Club here yesterday. Tomorrow, the tribunal is expected to prepare a note for the Orissa government on what more can be done to improve the situation.        
	Hundreds are still in camps in key towns; others have migrated to Bhubaneswar. They are too afraid to return home two years after the violence that had followed the assassination of Laxmanand.        
	Christadas Naik, 55, from Manjuguda village, said Bajrang Dal activists had bombed and burnt down 100 homes in his village. His wife died. He hasnt been able to rebuild his home and is still not allowed access to water or the jungles for wood. So he is still living at the Udaygiri camp.        
	Kamal Digal described how his brother Rajesh Digal was tortured by a mob that buried him alive. His body was later thrown into the river. Since there were no witnesses, he received no compensation.        
	But the culprits are roaming free, he told the jury that included Justice (retd) A.P. Shah, Admiral (retd) Vishnu Bhagwat and rights and social activists such as Miloon Kothari, Harsh Mander and Vrinda Grover.

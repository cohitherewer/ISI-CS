The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish switches to poll mode in Bihar villages
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitish switches to poll mode in Bihar villages
          NALIN VERMA                          The chief minister addresses villagers at Harpur in Saran on Tuesday. (Deepak Kumar)                                  
	Patna, Feb. 16: Nitish Kumar yesterday visited a remote north Bihar village, offered puja at a Shiv temple and spent time at a Dalit settlement as part of his three-day tour of the poll-bound state.        
	A close observation of the recent style of operation of the Bihar chief minister  usually known for making it to the secretariat by 9.30am and monitoring work with senior officials  reveals that he has launched his silent election campaign, much before his rivals who are planning to oust him.        
	The transition in the CMs itinerary  where he would stay in the hinterland announcing development schemes and carrying out face-to-face meetings with the people till the electoral code of conduct is in operation  has given rise to the speculation that Nitish may invite early polls.        
	Political observers interpret his meticulously chalked-out programme  to cover as much area, meet as many people and announce as much largesse as possible before the polls are announced  is nothing but a method to catch his opponents unawares.        
	In fact, Nitishs north Bihar sojourn coincided with the virtual revolt in JD(U), culminating into replacement of its state chief Rajiv Ranjan, alias Lallan Singh, by Vijay Choudhary.        
	While his friend-turned-critic Lallan announced a war for restoration of democracy in the JD(U), Nitish visited historical and religious places at Chiran (Saran) and Mehdar (Siwan) offering pujas.        
	In a way, the suave but politically smart chief minister showed two contrasting aspects in his personality in a span of six months.         
	Displaying rationality, he had biscuits and tea in front of lakhs of fasting devotees at Taregna to see the total solar eclipse last year and offered prayers to the sun god.        
	Almost six months after that, Nitish hardly leaves any temple or place of religious importance without offering prayers.        
	His party, which otherwise did extremely well, winning 34 of the states 40 Lok Sabha seats last year, lost in Siwan and Chapra. While Lalu Prasad retained Chapra and an Independent won the Siwan seat, trouncing the JD(U) nominee.        
	Incidentally, Nitish spared three days to stay in the remote areas of Siwan and Chapra alone, announcing a Rs 200-crore development scheme for rural infrastructure of Siwan and eating lunch at the home of Lalbabu Rai at Chapra.         
	Surprisingly, Lalbabu is a staunch Lalu supporter, who had represented Chapra in Lok Sabha as well as Assembly on an RJD ticket.        
	Nitish has of late also turned softer on his opponents. On Lallans war for restoring democracy in the party, he said: Lallan is my old friend. I requested him to continue as the state JD(U) chief. But he refused.

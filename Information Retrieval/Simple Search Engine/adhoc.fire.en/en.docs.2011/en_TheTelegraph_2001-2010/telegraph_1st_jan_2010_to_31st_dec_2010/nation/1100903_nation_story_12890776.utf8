	Patna, Sept. 2: Tied up in a four-day-old hostage crisis, Nitish Kumar suffered a public relations setback today.        
	Rajni, wife of one of the four policemen abducted by Maoists after Sundays battle in Lakhisarai, sat outside the chief ministers residence with her children only for policewomen to drag her away before TV cameras.        
	Worse, the rebels later said they had killed her husband, assistant sub-inspector Abhay Yadav, though the claim hasnt been officially confirmed.        
	Yadavs family arrived in Patna on Monday and had been visiting Nitishs residence off and on. Nitish met them once. Last night, Rajni began camping before the house with her three children. Abhays mother Naina joined them this morning.          
	By noon, the government had got fed up with the media coverage. A few women constables appeared and pulled Rajni up by her arms. She and elder daughter Shalini were packed off to hospital even as she screamed: I wont go... bring my husband back.  
	Naina and daughter Pinku stayed behind. Im not feeling the sun. Ill take poison and die at sahabs door if my son doesnt return. I wont go till sahab comes out, she said.        
	Deputy superintendent of police Rajesh Dubey failed to persuade Naina to return home. In the afternoon, news spread that the wife of Lucas Tete, another hostage, was coming to the spot. Suddenly, all roads leading to the house were cordoned off and journalists were held at bay.        
	A while later, the family was gone. We moved them away, Dubey said. We assured them that if they need accommodation in Patna, well help them.        
	Around 3.30pm, the claim about Abhays death came in. Nitish, who was at a function at 4pm, said he had heard the news from the media. He said: I met all the families. What more can I do other than offer condolences?        
	Rajni has stopped crying and is in a state of shock.

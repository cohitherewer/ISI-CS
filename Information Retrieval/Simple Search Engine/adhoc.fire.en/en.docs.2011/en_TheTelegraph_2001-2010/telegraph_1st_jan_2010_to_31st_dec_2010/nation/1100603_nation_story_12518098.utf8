The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata sets eyes on early poll   Result shows no trust in Left, says Trinamul
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mamata sets eyes on early poll 
  Result shows no trust in Left, says Trinamul          BARUN GHOSH                                                  
	Calcutta, June 2: Mamata Banerjee today renewed her call for early Assembly elections, buoyed by the historic civic poll results across Bengal.        
	Todays results are not only historic but revolutionary since people have expressed a complete no-trust against the CPM. So, the CPM should not stay on in power in Bengal any more and instead seek a fresh mandate by advancing the Assembly elections, Mamata told a crowded news conference this afternoon.         
	She suggested that the Assembly elections, due in May 2011, be held in October this year. I have heard that some states will go to the polls in October this year. If the Election Commission considers our demand for early polls, elections in Bengal could be held in October without dismissing the state government, she said. Only Bihar will go to the polls this October.        
	CPM state secretary and Left Front chairman Biman Bose today rejected Mamatas demand. The results of the civic polls are a verdict of 17 per cent voters of the state. How can it reflect the view of the total electorate of the state? he asked.         
	State industries minister and CPM politburo member Nirupam Sen echoed Boses view. The Assembly elections will be held as scheduled, Sen said at Writers Buildings. There are some laws of the land and they will have to be adhered to.         
	Trinamul sources said that Mamata would, however, keep mounting pressure on the state government for advancement of the Assembly polls by taking recourse to a string of movements.        
	We shall raise the slogan for advancement of Assembly elections at our Martyrs Rally on July 21 that Mamata has already offered to the people for their overwhelming support to us, said a Trinamul general secretary.        
	Mamata had in a string of campaign meetings for the civic polls also time and again raised the demand even as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had rejected it.         
	The Trinamul leader felt that the results of the civic polls assume significance for her on the ground that her candidates had fared better in the Left bastions like Burdwan, Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore than what they had done in the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Going by the results of the civic polls, we have made considerable inroads in such Left bastions such as Burdwan, Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore. In a majority of civic bodies located in the four districts, we are going to form the boards on our own, a smiling Mamata said.        
	The CPMs total rout in Burdwans Memari, known to be party stalwart Benoy Konars fiefdom, has come as a shot in the arms for Mamata.         
	We cant even imagine that the CPM drew a blank in Memari. By getting a majority in 12 wards out of 16 there, we are going to form the civic board in the red bastion, said a Trinamul vice-president.        
	Asked about the possible mayoral candidates for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the Bidhan Nagar municipality, Mamata said that the party would shortly take a decision on this at a party meeting. We shall choose our important party nominees for the key posts, she said.         
	In Calcutta, Trinamul won 95 wards out of 141 and in Bidhan Nagar it won 16 out of 25.        
	Mamata, who had dubbed the Congress a party of betrayers for breaking up the alliance during the campaign for civic polls, today appeared mellower in victory. We have no complaints against any political party for the failure of the alliance. They may have some compulsion. But I am with the UPA and will continue to be a part of the coalition at the Centre to serve the people, she said, when asked about the breaking up of the alliance.        
	She said she would welcome the Congress if the party wanted to extend support to Trinamul in the municipalities where they are short of the magic number for forming the boards. If my UPA friend extends support to help us form civic boards in the place where there is a hung situation, I shall feel obliged to them, she said.        
	Trinamul will form boards in 51 wards out of 81 across Bengal, Mamata said.

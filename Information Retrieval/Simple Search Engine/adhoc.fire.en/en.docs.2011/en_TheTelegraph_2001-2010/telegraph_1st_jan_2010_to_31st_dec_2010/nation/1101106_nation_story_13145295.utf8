	New Delhi, Nov. 5: For almost two days starting this Sunday, some Delhi neighbourhoods will be on a hair trigger.        
	Snipers will be deployed atop residential complexes along the 10km route from the airport to ITC Maurya for Barack Obama. The US President will arrive in the capital on Sunday afternoon and check into the hotel.        
	Over 10,000 police and paramilitary personnel will be deployed for the next three days. Snipers will be placed at other strategic locations during his stay in the capital from November 7 to 9, a senior officer said.        
	Personnel of the Special Weapon and Tactics Team (SWAT)  an elite Delhi police squad trained to perform high-risk operations  will also keep vigil. On Saturday morning, a day before the President flies into the capital, Delhi police will conduct a rehearsal. We will conduct a mock drill which will be monitored by senior officials from the police, the Intelligence Bureau and the paramilitary forces, said the officer.        
	The top brass of Delhi police met US security officials last week and briefed them on the arrangements outside Maurya hotel and other places where Obama is scheduled to visit. Around 500 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Secret Service officers will oversee the Presidents security and be in complete charge of the arrangements inside the hotel.         
	We are co-ordinating with them (the US officials) and there will be a four-layer security ring. They have expressed satisfaction with our security arrangements outside the hotel as well as the other places, another officer said.        
	Delhi police have given the FBI and Security Service officers a blueprint of the security arrangements, starting from the airport and the route to the hotel. We have also submitted a copy of the security plan at Humayuns Tomb, Rajghat and Parliament. The President is scheduled to visit these places, the officer said.        
	Chavan ID proof        
	The US consul-general in Mumbai today said he had apologised for a clerical error in invitations that required chief minister Ashok Chavan and deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal to mention birth dates, nationality, passport details and PAN card numbers for identification at Obamas events.        
	I have visited the chief minister and deputy chief minister and personally apologised. It was just a clerical error, the consul-general, Paul A. Folmsbee, said. Chavan and Bhujbal had seen the move as a slight and threatened to boycott the Presidents programmes.

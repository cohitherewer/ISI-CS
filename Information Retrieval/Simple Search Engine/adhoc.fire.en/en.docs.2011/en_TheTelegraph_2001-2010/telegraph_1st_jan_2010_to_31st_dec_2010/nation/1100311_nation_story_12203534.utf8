          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, March 10: Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav today abandoned their move to bring a no-confidence motion against the UPA government, saying they could not muster the required support of 50 MPs to move the motion.        
	Between them, the two leaders have 26 MPs. It is learnt that the BJP and the Left were unresponsive to the proposal which, if voted on and carried through in the Lok Sabha, will spell the end of the government.        
	The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Samajwadi Party chiefs are upset with the government for passing the womens reservation bill in the Rajya Sabha without introducing a separate sub-quota for backward classes and Muslim women.         
	Both Yadav leaders have not yet completed the formality of withdrawing their support to the government by handing over a letter to the President, although they had announced the decision a couple of days ago. Asked about it today, Lalu Prasad said: We have not got time (appointment) from Rashtrapati Bhavan. The moment we get time, we will rush. I have made an announcement of support withdrawal publicly, Mulayam Singh has also done it. We cannot go back on it. Deals cannot be struck on such crucial matters.        
	The allusion to deals arose after the CBI today backed the RJD chief in an assets case. The Bihar government had contested his acquittal in the Supreme Court. The CBI told the court the state government had no right to appeal. Government sources claimed, however, the CBIs submission had nothing to do with politics. It is a consistent stand the agency has pursued from the beginning based on evidence it examined, a source said.         
	A Samajwadi leader echoed the sentiment, saying their politics was not based on quid pro quos. We burnt our fingers once by bailing out the UPA government on the nuclear deal, for which we gained nothing but lost a lot. We looked like the Congresss B team. In Uttar Pradesh, people said since the Samajwadi Party is an ally of the Congress, why not vote for the A team (Congress) instead of the Samajwadis, he said.        
	After months, we got an issue with political potential. We can try and stop Muslim votes from crossing over to Congress. Will we give up something like this to do deals with the Congress government? he asked.        
	 Evicted skip party        
	Five of the seven evicted Rajya Sabha MPs boycotted a farewell party hosted by the Upper House secretariat for those who retired last year and will retire in April and July this year.         
	 Party? Do you think I will want to sup with those who had me thrown out? asked Amir Alam Khan of the SP.        
	I was herded out like an animal. They should not have invited any of us because to them we are sub-humans and not normal beings like Sonia Gandhi, Sushma Swaraj and Brinda Karat, said Nand Kishore.

	Sankrail, Nov. 4: A team from Sankrail police station, which saw a previous officer-in-charge kidnapped by Maoists a year ago, was allegedly led into a trap by the rebels today and beaten mercilessly by villagers armed with bamboo poles and choppers.        
	Retaliatory police firing killed one villager and injured seven as a 45-strong force and a mob of 200 fought a pre-dawn skirmish, set up apparently to showcase local support for the Maoists.        
	A senior officer claimed the Maoists had forced the residents of Chunpara, about 30km from Jhargram town, to launch the pre-planned attack that left 17 policemen wounded and their OC needing 12 stitches to the head.        
	One of the injured (villagers), Deben Mahato, is a home guard at Jhargram police station. We dont think it is possible for someone working in a police station to openly attack policemen, said additional superintendent of police (operations) Mukesh Kumar.        
	However, the village ambush also pointed to rebel infiltration of the polices local sources. An officer from Sankrail said the police had been lured into the 4am raid on Chunpara after sources told us that people wanted in an old riot case were in the village and it was the right time for a raid.        
	Almost exactly a year ago, on October 20, 2009, the Maoists had taken then Sankrail OC Atindranath Dutta hostage in a high-profile abduction after killing two officers. Dutta is now a sub-inspector at Anandapur police station, an area not affected by the rebels, about 60km from Sankrail.        
	Today, the mob specifically targeted current OC Uttam Debnath, clubbing the 50-plus officer with bamboo poles, gashing him with choppers and trying to drag him away after snatching his AK-47, the police said.        
	We gave the OC multiple stitches on his head and a CT scan revealed internal haemorrhage. He had bruises all over his body, said P.P. Pradhan, medical superintendent of Midnapore Medical College and Hospital. Debnath was admitted to NRS Hospital in Calcutta tonight and was to undergo surgery.        
	The wife of Uttam Mahato, the 45-year-old villager who died after taking police bullets in the stomach, said her husband had gone out to relieve himself at 4.30am when he was killed.        
	Trinamul Congress MP Subhendu Adhikari visited Chunpara and claimed Uttam as well as the seven injured villagers  who were mostly hit in the leg  were party supporters. This is how the police and the CPM carry out atrocities on villagers, he said before handing over Rs 15,000 for treatment of the wounded.        
	Additional SP Kumar said the mob, while fleeing the police firing, had left behind freshly cut bamboo sticks. So, we have every reason to believe that they were waiting for the police, he said.         
	While leaving the village after arresting four wanted men, the police were surrounded by about 200 villagers, including some 50 women, a Sankrail officer said.        
	Injured constable Benoy Tudu said from his hospital bed that the mob pounced on OC Debnath and tried to drag him inside the village.        
	We could not fire immediately because there were so many women. We initially scattered here and there. But when we saw them dragging the OC away, we fired, Tudu said.        
	I heard gunshots but we were too scared to venture out, said Uttams wife Monika. Around 5.30, I went out to look for him and found his body on the road.        
	Kumar said the firing not only saved Debnath but also prevented the snatching of more police weapons. He led a bigger team, complete with sniffer dogs, to Chunpara around 6.30am. Fifty villagers have been rounded up for interrogation.         
	State home secretary G.D. Gautama blamed the attack on the Peoples Committee and villagers.

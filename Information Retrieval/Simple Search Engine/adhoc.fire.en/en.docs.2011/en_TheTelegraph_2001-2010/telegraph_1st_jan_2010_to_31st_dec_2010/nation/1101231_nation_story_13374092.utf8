          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: The Congress today made fun of BJP president Nitin Gadkaris attempt to use the illegal-immoral distinction to defend B.S. Yeddyurappa.        
	Gadkari had said the Karnataka chief ministers decision to allot land to his sons and daughter was immoral but not illegal.        
	We learn that the BJP president has allowed its leaders to commit immoral acts, Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said. We are not happy to know that the BJP leadership considers its chief ministers act immoral. Now we would like to know what immoral acts are permissible in the BJP.         
	The Congress has been taunting the BJP for its failure to remove Yeddyurappa despite several scandals, and has used the Karnataka controversy to hit back at the Oppositions anti-corruption campaign.        
	Ahmed today alleged that Yeddyurappa had survived through blackmail, having threatened to expose how top BJP leaders had benefited from their association with the Bellary-based Reddy brothers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Aiyar cites Rajivs vision to counter rebels 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Aiyar cites Rajivs vision to counter rebels

	New Delhi, April 9: Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar (in picture left), recently nominated to the Rajya Sabha and tipped to become part of Sonia Gandhis National Advisory Council, asks the government to shed its one-eyed policy against the Maoists in this exclusive interview with The Telegraph.        
	Aiyar hints at complicity between the policy-makers and corporate interests as one reason for the Maoist expansion, and asks the government to address the tribals grievances instead of trying to find a military solution. He buttresses his arguments by invoking Rajiv Gandhis policies.   
	Excerpts:  
	The Dantewada massacre has shocked the nation, and the political class now favours tough action. Even your party is asking the government to wipe out the Maoists.        
	I dont want to comment on any party view. But I think a one-eyed policy will not work. We need to look at this issue of Naxalism with both eyes wide open; one on security issues and the other firmly focused on participatory, people-driven development.        
	But your own party thinks that socio-economic issues can be addressed in the long term, and that right now the state needs to wipe out the Maoists.        
	 I have not seen such a statement from my party. I dont think the Congress can speak of a military solution alone. I have spent the last 25 years under the intellectual and moral influence of Rajiv Gandhi, who championed the cause of grassroots development through grassroots democracy.        
	My association with Rajivji began by arranging his tours in the periphery of India. The first visit I arranged for him was precisely in the area where the most recent tragedy has taken place.         
	As a result of his frequent and deep interaction with the people both in central India and the outreaches of the Northeast, Rajivji came to the conclusion that the state had not only failed to deliver development to the tribal people, it was systemically incapable of doing so.        
	What have the successive governments, including Rajiv Gandhis, done to change the situation?        
	 Rajiv Gandhi realised it was necessary to shift the delivery system from the bureaucracy-technocracy to empowering people at the grassroots to secure for themselves their entitlements.        
	Rajiv Gandhi clearly apprehended that if such a participatory development was not encouraged and the exploitative development discouraged, the top-down development process would only increasingly alienate tribal people, thus paving the way for their felt sense of injustice to be exploited by non-democratic elements who believe in violence and believe also in sabotaging (what they see as) the bogus democratic process.        
	To forestall such a disaster, Rajivji gave the nation two instruments far stronger than the AK-47 or unmanned drone. These were: one, the 73rd amendment of the Constitution, panchayati raj, and the very special provisions for empowerment of tribal communities through PESA (Provisions of Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas Act).        
	Had successive governments, both at the Centre and the states, concentrated on effective implementation of a constitutional panchayati raj in tribal areas, far from our democracy being profoundly threatened in the heart of India, tribal people would have been our enthusiastic co-partners in development.        
	Are you blaming governmental priorities for the mess we are in?        
	 I can say that their (tribals) gross neglect has continued and they almost have nothing to gain from the high trajectory of growth attained through the economic reforms process.        
	Worse, notwithstanding the PESA provisions, there has been virtually no consultation with tribal communities whose lives and livelihood are threatened with disruptions by the mining ambitions of Indian business combines like Vedanta, Tata and Essar and MNCs like Posco and the Mittals.        
	Are you suggesting there is a nexus between corporate interests and state policies?        
	 Far from acting as a conduit for channelling peoples concerns to big business houses, there is ample evidence of collusion and collaboration between the state and the big business houses in the face of grievances articulated initially democratically, and later through the barrel of the gun.        
	If we recognise that not all insurgency-affected districts are entirely insurgency-affected, then we can fast-track full-scale panchayati raj and PESA in these areas and thereby clearly present to people the alternative of genuine people-run participatory development if they join hands with the state as the alternative to certain death at the hands of the state or the Maoists if they continue to be with the Maoists.        
	Whats you final suggestion to this government?        
	 I would suggest that while the home ministry gets on with its job, the Prime Minister give his full political backing to the ministries of panchayati raj and tribal affairs, and the Planning Commission (and), in concert with the state governments, initiate a massive burst in people-oriented grassroots development in the tribal areas focusing on the 29 basic minimum needs listed personally by Rajiv Gandhi in the 11th Schedule of the Constitution.        
	I say personally because I sat next to him as he prepared the list. I have one final suggestion which I owe to the best chief minister that tribal India ever had  Digvijay Singh. He says a one-line solution to all tribal grievances would be to amend the forest act to vest the ownership of all natural wealth below and above tribal lands in the tribal communities themselves.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Violence cloud on new varsity

          BASANT KUMAR MOHANTY                      The Central University of Kashmir building                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 14: The unrest in Srinagar and the Valley has cast a shadow on a new central university.        
	Nearly 50 per cent of the seats at Central University of Kashmir, the only such varsity in the state and created through the Central University Act, 2009, have remained vacant after the second phase the admission for its maiden academic session.         
	The reason: students from other states have stayed away because of the violence.        
	The third phase of admission got over on Saturday. But with the response still poor, the university will put up a public notice on its website on Monday asking students who have applied for its courses to take admission by August 21.        
	The majority of students from outside Jammu and Kashmir who had applied for our courses did not prefer to take admission because of the disturbed conditions. Only four students from outside the state have taken admission so far. I am keen to receive them when they come to the campus, vice-chancellor Abdul Wahid told The Telegraph. The four students are from Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.        
	The students have been chosen from a joint entrance examination held in June for admissions to the Kashmir varsity and six other central universities.         
	The merit list prepared by the university had the names of over 100 students from other states. I was expecting that a good number of students from outside (Jammu and Kashmir) would take admission. This would have given us an all-India representation, Wahid said.        
	The Kashmir varsity now offers MSc in IT, MA in English and MBA courses, with 30 seats in each programme. However, after the second phase of admission, only 53 of the 90 seats in the three courses had found takers. Twenty-six seats have been filled in the MBA course and 17 in MSc (IT). Another 10 students have taken admission in MA (English).         
	The admissions were affected by the street protests and curfew in Srinagar and other parts of the Valley since early June, Wahid said. We will give the final call on Monday. We will ask the students who figure on the merit list to take admission by August 21, Wahid said. The classes are expected to start from the last week of this month.        
	The university is now functioning from a temporary campus in Srinagar but is expected to shift to a permanent one near Ganderbal, close to Srinagar, by next year. It has around 10 faculty members for the three courses.

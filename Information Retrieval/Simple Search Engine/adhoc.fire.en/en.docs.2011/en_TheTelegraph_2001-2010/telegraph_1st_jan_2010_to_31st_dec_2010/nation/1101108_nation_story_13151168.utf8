The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pakistanis rue focus shift from Kashmir
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Pakistanis rue focus shift from Kashmir
          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, Nov. 7: Many Pakistanis were today left a little disappointed at President Barack Obamas comments on Kashmir, which they felt were aimed at keeping his hosts happy.        
	Obama suggested that India and Pakistan should first take up the less contentious issues in talks, which runs counter to Islamabads traditional eagerness to include Kashmir in any dialogue.        
	The US President also said that America cannot impose itself on India-Pakistan ties, a statement analysts here see as a concession to Indias sensitiveness about third-party mediation on Kashmir.        
	However, many Pakistanis believe that it is almost impossible to resolve the dispute bilaterally. Kashmir is a nuclear flashpoint and the root cause of tension between our two countries. We will be unable to forge good neighbourly relations unless this issue is resolved, said Ali Hassan Ansari, a former teacher at a federal government school.        
	Obamas statements, though, were of a piece with his hands-off policy on Kashmir, said Hasan Askari, political analyst and visiting professor at Washingtons Johns Hopkins University. They (the Obama administration) have so far taken a position that it is an issue between India and Pakistan and they should resolve it bilaterally.        
	But what appears to bother many people here, at least partially, is that Obamas remarks have come on Indian soil.        
	For instance, most Pakistanis realise that Obama was not breaking any new diplomatic ground when he said Islamabad must do more on extremism and that the progress had not been as quick as we would like. However, they are uncomfortable that the statement was made in Mumbai, where the 26/11 attacks happened.        
	Faraz Haider, 25, a student of charted accountancy in Rawalpindi, said: We have lost more than 3,700 people including security personnel since July 2007 in the war against terror. As far as I understand, Islamist militancy is a seed they (the Americans) themselves sowed during the Afghan war to defeat the Soviets. This problem cannot be resolved and tackled overnight by Pakistan alone.

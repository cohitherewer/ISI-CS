          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 23: A group of 10 Trinamul Congress MLAs returned to the Assembly to demand fire minister Pratim Chatterjees resignation over the Park Street blaze, hours after the party had announced a three-day House boycott and its members stormed out.        
	The Congress legislators joined the chorus. They demanded a statement from Chatterjee on why frequent fires were occurring in the city.         
	Chatterjee wasnt present then, prompting finance minister Asim Dasgupta to step in to calm the slogan-shouting MLAs. He offered some explanations but the Trinamul MLAs, not convinced and angry at Chatterjees absence, left.        
	The fire services minister did arrive around 20 minutes later but, finding no Opposition MLA in the House, spoke to the media instead. He, however, rejected the Oppositions demands for his resignation.         
	Why should I resign? A lot of train mishaps take place and are, in fact, taking place (alluding to last nights Rajdhani derailment). Does this mean that the railway minister should resign? Am I a thief or a robber that I should resign, he said. He added he would give a statement in the Assembly tomorrow.        
	Earlier in the day, Trinamul had walked out after the chief minister refused to give a statement on the law and order situation.        
	At Park Street, the leader of the Opposition, Partha Chatterjee of Trinamul, echoed his House colleagues. All the people I spoke to said the first fire engine arrived at least an hour after the blaze started, he said.         
	Governor M.K. Narayanan also visited the fire site.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Whiff of senior cops in Maoist racket
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Whiff of senior cops in Maoist racket
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Yashodanand Singh                                  
	Lucknow, May 2: The CRPF and Provincial Armed Constabulary gang that supplied Maoists with bullets had been active for years, and senior officers may have protected kingpin Yashodanand Singh when he came under suspicion five years ago, police said today.        
	Yashodanand, who ran the racket as a CRPF sub-inspector and continued to do so after his retirement in 2008, had been arrested and suspended along with PAC constable Dhani Choudhary after 1.5 lakh cartridges were stolen from the Chunar armoury in 2005.        
	But both were reinstated by Allahabad High Court after weak cases were presented against them, said officers of Uttar Pradesh polices special task force (STF), which busted the racket on Friday.        
	We now realise the gang had been operating far longer than we had thought, said N. Arora, STF superintendent, whose officers are questioning the 10 people arrested: Yashodanand, seven serving personnel and two Maoist agents or go-betweens.        
	Its impossible that these jawans and constables carried out the entire racket; some of their senior officers must have been involved and played protectors, an STF source said.        
	The gang was very well organised. They first found out from the Maoists agents exactly what sort of ammunition the rebels needed. Then they stole these specific cartridges from CRPF, PAC or state police academy armouries and informed the agents over the phone. From order to supply, it would take about two weeks. The supplies would go everywhere  to Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bengal.        
	The gang stole the bullets during shooting practice or encounters, when they would inflate the amount of ammunition spent, said additional director-general Brij Lal.        
	State armouries are handled by junior policemen. After the 2005 scandal, the government had laid down that a gazetted officer must oversee the records at PAC and police academy armouries, but this is hardly followed.        
	The STF had arrested Yashodanand and five others  two CRPF constables and three PAC jawans  in state-wide raids on Thursday night and Friday morning. They picked up two more PAC personnel on Friday night.        
	Ramkripal Singh, 41, a deputy armourer with a PAC unit in Basti, has allegedly confessed to having supplied 2,000 cartridges to two Maoist agents last month. The eighth man arrested was Beni Shankar, who was in charge of a PAC armoury in Jhansi.        
	The two alleged Maoist agents were arrested today from Mau in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Dinesh Yadav and Ravi Singh are in their 30s.         
	The three key accused  Yashodanand and CRPF constables Vinod Paswan and Dinesh Singh  were sent to 10 days police remand yesterday.

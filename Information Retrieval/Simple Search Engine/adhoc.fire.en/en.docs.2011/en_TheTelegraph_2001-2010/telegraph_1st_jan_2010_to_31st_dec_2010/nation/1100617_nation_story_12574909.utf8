                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Invite to tap Afghan mineral treasure
          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, June 16: Afghanistan has invited India to invest in its mining sector, the overture coming days after reports that the war-torn nation has untapped minerals worth nearly $1 trillion  almost matching Indias $1.2-trillion GDP.        
	The invitation was apparently extended yesterday by the visiting Afghanistans minister of mines, Wahidullah Shahrani, during his meeting with Union minister of mines B.K. Handique. We will invite bids for the development of our mineral deposits in the next few months, Shahrani said after the discussions.        
	The ministry later released a statement saying the Afghan minister had invited India to invest in his countrys mining sector, particularly in iron ore, copper, gold and coal. Shahrani said Afghanistan would be organising a road show, focusing on iron ore, in London on June 25.         
	Around 200 global companies, including some from India, have been invited to showcase their exploration prowess at the event.        
	Indian mining companies have shown interest in Afghanistan, but none has gone there yet. The mining investment void exists even though Indian companies are helping the Hamid Karzai government build infrastructure in virtually all parts of Afghanistan in the other sectors.        
	These include including hydel power, electricity transmission, road construction, agriculture, industry, telecom, information and broadcasting, education and health. Delhi has given Kabul over $1 billion in development aid.        
	Indian industry sees big gains in the Afghan find but has tempered its hopes with caution.         
	Companies are wary of investing in Afghanistan because of the security situation, said a spokesperson for business chamber CII.        
	At their meeting yesterday, Shahrani and Handique were also said to have discussed cooperation between the Geological Survey of India and the Afghan geological survey in mineral exploration, seismotectonics, geo-technical studies, remote sensing and other related areas. Shahrani thanked India for training Afghan geologists in Hyderabad.        
	The New York Times had reported the $1-trillion mineral find on Monday quoting senior US government officials.         
	American officials believe the discovery has the potential of transforming Afghanistan into one of the most important mining centres in the world. The report quoted an internal Pentagon memo which states that Afghanistan could become the Saudi Arabia of lithium, a key input in the manufacture of batteries for laptops and BlackBerrys.

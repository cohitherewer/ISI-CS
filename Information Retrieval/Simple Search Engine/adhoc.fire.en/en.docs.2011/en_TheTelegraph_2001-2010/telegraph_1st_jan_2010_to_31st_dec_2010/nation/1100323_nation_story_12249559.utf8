	Burdwan/Bankura, March 22: Nearly 200 alleged CPM activists today attacked a Burdwan village and shot a Trinamul Congress worker dead in a bid to regain the partys foothold in a pocket that has become an Opposition stronghold since the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Hasmat Sheikh, 25, was dragged out of his house at Mullickpur village in Mangalkot and shot dead in front of his mother, who tried in vain to shield him. The attackers hurled bombs at Hasmats cousin, Sukur Ali, who had also tried to save him. Sukur is in hospital.        
	The CPM runs the local Lakhuria gram panchayat but Trinamul had got more votes from that area in the byelection to the local Mangalkot zilla parishad last December.         
	CPM zonal committee secretary Durjodhan Sar said: A clash took place when a dozen CPM activists who had fled home under Trinamul threats earlier tried to return home.

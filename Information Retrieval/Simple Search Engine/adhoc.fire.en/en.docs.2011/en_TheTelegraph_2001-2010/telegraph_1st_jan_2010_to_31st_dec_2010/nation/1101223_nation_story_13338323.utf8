The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal parallel school vacuum 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Bengal parallel school vacuum 
          MITA MUKHERJEE                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 22: The Bengal government has pushed through a parallel school board without making any provision for higher studies of those who pass Class X examinations under the new system.        
	Students who pass out from the panchayat department-run shiksha kendras two years hence are headed to an uncertain future, officials handling higher secondary school affairs said today.        
	The concern was expressed as it emerged that the bill the Left government pushed through yesterday had not factored in Plus Two (Classes XI and XII) classes in schools under the board to be run by the panchayat department.        
	The Bengal government had yesterday passed in a hurry the bill to empower the panchayat department to set up a Madhyamik-level education board. This will allow shiksha kendras to run classes up to X.        
	Since the bill has no provision to run Plus Two courses, the students clearing the Class X exam under the new board will have to study in the higher secondary schools under the school education department.        
	But higher secondary schools do not have enough seats to accommodate the additional students. Around 60,000 students are expected to clear the Class X exams under the new board.        
	The demand for higher secondary seats will increase by 60,000 at one go in 2013. The demand will keep on increasing in the following years, given the fact that there is no provision in the bill to run higher secondary schools under the panchayat education board, said Ashoke Maity, till recently the general secretary of the West Bengal Headmasters Association.        
	Assuming that the academic standard of the shiksha kendras is on a par with the Madhyamik schools, we will not discriminate in admitting students from the panchayat department-run schools, said Onkar Sadhan Adhikary, the president of the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education. But the problem is how to accommodate them since there are only a limited number of seats in the existing higher secondary schools. At least a few hundred more higher secondary schools have to be set up to accommodate these students.         
	Education department officials said that this year, the 6,000-odd higher secondary schools across the state have not been able to accommodate all 749,725 students who cleared the Madhyamik exams this year. Trends suggest that between 10 and 15 per cent of successful Madhyamik students do not find a higher secondary seat. The problem will only be compounded now, the officials said.         
	Maity said that by setting up the new board, the state government was not solving the problem of what to do with the students who had passed Class VIII of the shiksha kendras but merely postponing it by another two years as it would again show up in 2013.        
	We understand the governments desire to provide education to students from rural areas, a teacher of a reputable school said. But before passing the bill, the government should have taken steps to increase the number of higher secondary schools. The purpose of educating students from backward areas till the Class X level will be an exercise in futility if they are not given the opportunity to pursue higher studies.         
	State school education minister Partha De, however, said: Seats will not be a problem because we are taking proper steps to set up new higher secondary schools and upgrade existing Madhyamik schools.         
	But De did not spell out exactly how he intends to do this, given a perception his party may not be in power in 2013.

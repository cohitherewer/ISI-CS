          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The former head of Indias apex technical education regulator who was suspended over charges of corruption has dragged the human resource development ministry to the Central Administrative Tribunal demanding reinstatement.        
	Ram Avtar Yadav, former chairman of the All India Council for Technical Education, has challenged his suspension in a case against the ministry, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	Yadavs challenge has triggered concerns in the ministry that he may win a stay order on his suspension  a situation that will be embarrassing for the government.         
	HRD ministry sources admitted that while the suspension was based on prima facie evidence suggesting corruption, some arguments used by Yadav in his petition could be upheld as technically legitimate.         
	The AICTE chairman is appointed by the appointments committee of the cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister. Yadav has argued that the committee alone can suspend him.         
	An appointments committees decision to suspend an official must be based on recommendations from the officials government division  the technical education bureau of the HRD ministry in his case, Yadav has argued.         
	Instead, Yadavs suspension order was issued by a vigilance officer at the HRD ministry, without consulting either the technical education bureau or the appointments committee, Yadav has argued.         
	Several OBC MPs had last year written to the Prime Minister alleging that Yadavs suspension was an instance of discrimination.        
	Yadav, controversially appointed AICTE chairman in 2008 by then HRD minister Arjun Singh, was suspended by current minister Kapil Sibal last July after the CBI began probing the allegations of corruption.         
	He was accused of facilitating and actively participating in corruption in granting recognition to technical education courses and institutions as well as awarding deemed university status to institutions.         
	Technical education institutions win deemed university status on the basis of the AICTEs recommendation, which needs to be accepted by the UGC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lonely Somnath trip for Advani
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lonely Somnath trip for Advani
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      LK Advani and Uma Bharti at the Somnath temple   on Saturday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: When Lal Krishna Advani, the Sangh parivars original Ayodhya protagonist, paid his annual visit to the Somnath temple on the anniversary of his Ram rath yatra today, he had only Balbir Punj and Uma Bharti by his side.         
	Punj is the BJPs minder in Gujarat, where the Somnath temple is located, and Uma is no longer in the party.         
	Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, who issued an appeal for harmony a day before the verdict on the Ayodhya title suit was due, stayed away ostensibly because of his preoccupation with the civic polls next month that are billed as a mini general election.        
	Umas presence set off speculation of her return to the BJP, which the party promptly squashed. When spokesperson Prakash Javadekar was reminded that one air trip with Advani had clinched Jaswant Singhs homecoming while Uma was still waiting after two similar journeys, he said: She might have to make several trips before she can come.         
	A political aide of BJP president Nitin Gadkari said: There is no plan to bring her back in the near future. There is no consensus within the party. Nothing should be read into her visit with Advani.        
	Sources said that after several discussions the RSS and the BJP had agreed that with senior leaders such as Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, M. Venkaiah Naidu, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and state party chief Prabhat Jha against her, there was no need to upset the apple cart.         
	Umas well-wishers have strained every nerve to persuade the RSS, but without success so far.        
	Advanis failure to re-induct Uma into the party is an indicator of his declining clout in the RSS and the BJP, sources said. There are other signs, too.         
	In mid-September, when the RSS convened a meeting to assess the possible fallout of the Ayodhya verdict, he was not called. Gadkari, Rajnath Singh and Murli Manohar Joshi were.        
	On September 24, the BJPs core committee met without Advani to run through the Kashmir developments and the Supreme Courts stay order on the title suit judgment.         
	Although a source tried to explain his absence saying he had already left for Gujarat, others said the meeting could always have been rescheduled.

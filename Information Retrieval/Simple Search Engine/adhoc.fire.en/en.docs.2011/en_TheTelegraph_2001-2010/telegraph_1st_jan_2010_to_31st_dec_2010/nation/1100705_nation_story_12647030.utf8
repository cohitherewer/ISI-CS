The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul nudged to reveal stand on Bihar
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rahul nudged to reveal stand on Bihar
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Rahul Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, July 4: If the Congress wants to improve its seemingly modest prospects in the Bihar elections, it must quickly spell out who its possible post-poll allies might be, reports reaching Rahul Gandhi have said.        
	The reports say there is substantial goodwill in Bihar for the Congress and the UPA, but among the obstacles to this being translated into votes is the lack of clarity on the partys stand on the likes of Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan.        
	Or on the possibility of a tie-up with Nitish Kumar in the improbable scenario of the Janata Dal (United) dumping the BJP.        
	The feedback is the result of Rahul directing about 40 young MPs, including junior-Union ministers, to visit as many parliamentary constituencies in Bihar as they can and hand in objective, Assembly seat-wise assessment reports.        
	Some ministers and MPs who have already toured the state have briefed Rahul that the partys prospects are not too bright despite the goodwill it enjoys, sources said.        
	Among the reasons are organisational weakness, the long power struggle between former Bihar unit chief Anil Sharma and former All India Congress Committee point man Jagdish Tytler, and, of course, the lack of hints about post-poll allies.        
	Rahul is not inclined towards striking pre-poll alliances and wants the Congress, which has just 10 members in the 243-seat House, to go it alone. The reports, however, say that unless the party clarifies its stand on the Lalu Prasad-Paswan combine, it is unlikely to do well.        
	However, this is not necessarily a veiled suggestion to strike alliances with the duo. The reports have cited Bihars complex caste equations to caution that if the Congress, Lalu Prasad and Paswan come together, some castes would go out and if the party decides to go it alone, it will lose out on other possible pockets of support.        
	The Congress observers have claimed that Bihars Muslims are eyeing the party with a great deal of interest. Similarly, most backward and weaker communities, and even sections of the upper castes that have traditionally been Congress supporters, want to back the Sonia Gandhi-Manmohan Singh-Rahul Gandhi troika.        
	The observers reports note with satisfaction that educated and informed circles see the Congress as the best option, considering that it is not as tainted by criminalisation or divisive politics as its rivals. However, this section of society makes up a very small part of the electorate, a Union minister of state has observed in his lucid report.

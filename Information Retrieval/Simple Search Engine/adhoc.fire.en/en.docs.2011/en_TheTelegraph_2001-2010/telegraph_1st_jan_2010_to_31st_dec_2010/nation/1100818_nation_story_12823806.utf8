The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong pushes for land bill
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong pushes for land bill
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: The Congress today appealed for speedy enactment of a new land acquisition law despite railway minister Mamata Banerjees reservations against it.        
	The party urged the UPA to speak to the Trinamul chief and bring a bill without delay. Mamata had publicly declared her opposition when the government earlier tried to revive a bill that lapsed in 2009.        
	The Congress push came after a furore in Parliament over Saturdays police firing on farmers agitating for land compensation on the Aligarh-Mathura road. Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said: The incident that happened in UP has earlier been witnessed in many states. The government should address the larger issue of land acquisition. The Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill and the Rehabilitation Bill that were passed in the Lok Sabha in February 2009 and lapsed because the 14th Lok Sabha got dissolved should be brought back.        
	Asked about differences in the ruling UPA over the bill, Tiwari said: Every party is entitled to have a viewpoint. But the essence of democracy is dialogue and consensus. The government should convince Mamata on the need for amending the law.        
	In the Lok Sabha, the Nandigram and Singur incidents cropped up repeatedly in connection with the Uttar Pradesh firing. While Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav demanded dismissal of the Mayavati regime, the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) strongly condemned her government.        
	Trinamul MP Sudip Bandopadhyay said much the same thing had happened in Nandigram and Singur where police bullets pierced through farmers hearts.        
	Recalling Mamatas fast, he emphasised that Trinamul was against forced land acquisition. He said states should not snatch poor peoples land at gunpoint to develop special economic zones (SEZs).        
	CPM leader Basudeb Acharya claimed there had not been any forcible land acquisition in Nandigram. Agreeing that the Uttar Pradesh farmers compensation demand was not unjust, he said development of SEZs should be stopped all over the country.        
	CPIs Prabodh Panda appealed for immediate introduction of a land acquisition bill, asking why an archaic 1894 law was being continued. When Parliament echoed with taunts on Nandigram and Singur, he said: We condemn police firing there, too. This is happening everywhere, Bengal, Orissa. We want forceful acquisition of land to stop everywhere.        
	Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad opposed acquisition of fertile land but expressed surprise that Mamata was not acquiring plots for rail projects. All development work has been paralysed as Mamata has said we will not take even an inch of land. This is not right, he said.        
	After a 55-minute discussion, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee assured the House that a comprehensive land acquisition and rehabilitation bill was being considered by a group of ministers headed by Sharad Pawar.        
	We are considering to bring it at the earliest.... We have to ensure that the interests of our farmers are not jeopardised. They play an important role in ensuring food security, he said.

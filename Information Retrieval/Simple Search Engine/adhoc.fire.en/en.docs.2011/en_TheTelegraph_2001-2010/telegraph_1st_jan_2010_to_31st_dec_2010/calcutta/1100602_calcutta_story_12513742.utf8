           Eye of political storm: The site of the Jnaneswari Express tragedy. Picture by Amit Datta                           
	lApropos the report Thrust and parry in politics of tragedy (May 29), resignation is a cheap path taken by ministers to evade responsibility. Mamata Banerjee should have taken moral responsibility for the Jnaneswari incident, and not harp on a blast being a second force behind this.           
	True, the strong smell of cordite, the tell-tale remains of burnt areas, is the clue that a commoner will not miss, leave aside experts of forensic departments  if the bomb theory is to be believed. People should know exactly what happened instead of being kept in the dark. The day before, the dacoity incident at the Down Bibhuti Express in the Patna-Bakhtiarpur section got little coverage in the news, but was a pointer to the frequent incidence of security lapses.           
	We have lost lives, may be more are to follow. In the pre-poll period, the forceful make-believe situation that all is well has spiralled into this security lapse, point enough that Banerjee should resign as railway minister.           
	Abhijit Banerjee,           
	Madhyamgram                     
	lIt is not at all a worthwhile thought to support the proposal of the railway ministers resignation. With the winds of change around the corner, several attempts will be made from various anti-Didi sections to tarnish the image of the railway ministry in one way or the other. This will be routine till the 2011 elections take place in the state.           
	The resultant effect is that we, the common people, will suffer because of the ardent attempts of various corrupt sections to engage in nefarious activities to humiliate Mamata.           
	She should never resign. She should rather keep her ties strong with the Congress and carry on sowing and harvesting the seeds of progress.           
	Saptarshi Mallick,           
	Hooghly                     
	lMamata Banerjee is not an efficient railway minister anyway. She is arrogant and has made many enemies. Even if the incident is proved to be a handiwork of the Maoists, then all I can say is quote the saying Evil begets evil.           
	Mamata makes hasty and irresponsible statements and comes up with ready conclusions on serious incidents without taking experts opinions. She is a person of strong dislikes and is wary only about the defamation of her Trinamul Congress. On the other hand, the CPM is a clever party that is determined to crush Maoists by force.           
	Targeting communication by rail was started by politicians when they called bandhs and staged rail blockades. Though incidents of tracks blown up by blasts or removal of fishplates happened earlier it was not to harm the travelling public. It was only to cause trouble. The Jnaneswari Express incident is unusual and hopefully will not set a new trend.           
	Shiv Shanker Almal,           
	Lower Rawdon Street                     
	lIf Mamata Banerjees resignation as railway minister would have put an end to every train accident and deliberate human interventions then accidents would not be termed accidents. Even if she resigns, will it put an end to Maoist attacks? Any persons resignation from his post does not solve an important issue. It is an escapists way of shirking responsibility.           
	Mamata needs to be sterner with the railway staff. A little bit of negligence or the slightest error costs lives. Therefore, strict norms must be put in place to maintain vigilance.           
	Again, the Maoist issue has long been tolerated. If terrorists from outside the country can be given death sentence, then immediate action must be taken against the terrorists within the country. Unless they are stopped, innocent lives will continue to be slaughtered. Only Mamata should not be blamed for an accident like this. Moreover, there is no need to bring politics into such a tragic occurrence. United effort can help in curbing these disasters, most often caused by internal enemies. Amrita Mallik,           
	Salt Lake                     
	lThere is no reason for Mamata Banerjee to resign after the Jnaneswari Express disaster, as this was clearly an act of sabotage carried out by the Maoists. The railway minister or her department cannot be held responsible despite the shrill noises made, quite expectedly by the CPM and the BJP, both having been totally rejected by the people of this country in last years elections.           
	In fact, the practice of ministers and VIPs rushing to the spot of a disaster exists only in India which is detrimental for the rescue efforts as the VIPs cause confusion rather than offer any real help. Nowhere in the developed world can one find anyone except the experts and related personnel at disaster sites.           
	A few days ago there was a train accident in China and it was evident that nobody except the actual experts and staff required for disaster management visited the site. Submitting resignations and getting them rejected is a funny and silly practice followed in the immature political set-up in India and should be discouraged and stopped.           
	What is needed is strengthening the hands of the railways and the state administration so that such acts of sabotage can be avoided in future. Resignation of a minister is no solution and adds to the confusion. Kalyan Ghosh,           
	Baishnabghata Patuli                     
	lIt was nice that railway minister Mamata Banerjee had reached the site of Jnaneswari Express tragedy very quickly and had offered help. But I need to emphasise on the point that couldnt the train drivers have exercised caution while driving? Maintaining a low speed in those Maoist-affected areas in the dark might have saved the train. So many casualties wouldnt have been suffered and brakes would have been effective. Time could be made up in other areas, by increasing speed.           
	It is only in India that lives have to be sacrificed to stress home a point. Yes, she should have resigned. Its too much work for her, as a minister, and as a leader of the Opposition party in Bengal. Amarnath Chakraverty,           
	Dum Dum Park                     
	lMamata Banerjee should not put in her papers. It is a national security failure. As for somebody citing Praful Patels resignation offer, I feel that was stage-managed. Let us not read too much into it. After all, it was he who was misusing his powers to ferry his daughter around in the national carrier during IPL! While we may not like Mamatas style of functioning, her honesty is beyond any doubt. Jayanta Mukherjee,           
	Address not given                     
	lCould you please explain how Mamata Banerjee is responsible for the Jnaneswari debacle? Is it the fault of the railways in the first place? According to reports, it was a Maoist attack. Both the state government and the central government are saying so.           
	Then whose responsibility is it to protect the citizens of the country? Can they give us a deadline by when they can eliminate the Maoists? Do they really have a plan to combat them?           
	The answer is a big No. They are unable to control the Maoists. Then how do you blame the railways?           
	The Indian Railways has a network spread over 63,000 km and about 7,000 stations through the length and breadth of the country. It carries 12 million passengers daily. They can ensure smooth and safe journey but how will they control Maoist action? How will they supervise such a widespread network of tracks on a minute-by-minute basis?           
	Mamata has become a soft target for all. It makes little sense to blame her for this incident. It was an unfortunate incident that can happen again if proper action is not taken. Controlling Maoist activities is the sole responsibility of the state and the central government and they have failed to deliver the desired results. The resignation of Praful Patel was an eyewash. He knew very well it would not be accepted by the Prime Minister.           
	Our real problem is we have a weak Prime Minister, a weak home minister and a week administration who are unable to take action when needed and its no use blaming Mamata for the problem. Arnab Mullick,           
	Address not given                     
	lI have no reason to believe that Mamata Banerjee is solely responsible for the Jnaneswari Express tragedy because maintenance of law and order is a state subject. It is obligatory on the part of the state government to ensure track security but unfortunately no patrolling was conducted by gangmen for want of enough RPF personnel to guard them.           
	Who did this heinous crime is still a mystery. So, Banerjee has persuaded the central government to order a CBI probe to unveil the truth behind the tragedy. Now, the matter is sub-judice, and there is no question of her resignation as a minister. Asok Kumar Chatterjee,           
	Konnagar, Hooghly                                     
	Apropos the report Autonomy prod for private tech colleges, April 6, as per World Banks declaration, only private technological institutes having autonomous status are eligible for financial assistance under the World Bank Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme . Three such colleges have already received this grant in West Bengal. But there may be a few more deserving colleges that may be eligible for this.           
	Interference of the owners may disturb the smooth running of colleges, especially when there is political pressure. The only solution lies in their autonomy.           
	For improvement of their infrastructure, the institutes need money. Naturally, the students or their guardians are forced to bear the burden. Financial assistance from the World Bank will enable the institutes to improve their infrastructure along with offer research facilities and better education.           
	So the West Bengal University of Technology and the state government should take necessary steps so that a few more private technical institutes are granted autonomy after proper inspection of their existing set-up. West Bengal will definitely be benefited by that.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee,           
	Behala                     
	Apropos the report Fathers cry ends rail roko, April 3, kudos to Shyamal Ghosh, who showed tremendous courage with his little son in his arm to make Congress supporters remove the blockade over a trivial issue.             
	He pleaded help from his stranded co-passengers, as he was desperate to take his child to hospital for an emergency surgery. Strangely, most of the commuters were found not much active to respond to his call. It seems people have lost the power of protest even for any good cause. They think its better to lie low and take the advantage of initiatives by others. The few men who came forward may be regarded as human beings.           
	People who create obstructions on railway tracks in their own interest, ignoring the common peoples woes, are inhuman. They should be condemned vehemently.           
	Diptimoy Ghosh,           
	Salt Lake                     
	l Thousands of passengers travel daily in local trains to reach their destinations on time. It is apparent that many passengers need to reach office, hospital, school, college or some other work place. Habra resident Shyamal Ghosh, with his two-year-old sick son single handedly removed the blockade. Kudos to him as well as Metro for the report. Such rail blockades must be stopped as they do not do any good but cause misery to passengers.           
	B.N. Bose,           
	Dum Dum Park                               
	Apropos the report Faces of fear in battle zone, April 14, on the mob attack at Peerless Hospital, the security personnel had to shed their uniform to escape serious harm. And those who were on the first two floors quickly slipped into ordinary clothes to save themselves, according a guard in front of the Netaji Subhas Ward.             
	Hope readers have not forgotten the media interview of Eastern Frontier Rifles chief with his face covered, after the mayhem on his colleagues, in their own camp at Silda. Nowadays, police stations are not open like before but have collapsible gates, other than police personnel posted at the entrance.           
	If this be the situation at police stations, then just think how safe ordinary people are!           
	Prantik Sanyal,           
	SP Mukherjee Road                               
	Apropos the report All that angers Arundhati, April 15, it is amazing that while Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee is crying hoarse over the attacks on common people in the name of a war on the so-called Maoists, killing hundreds, the Union home ministry maintains a studied silent.             
	The joint operation, Operation Green Hunt, is being directed against poor villagers rather than against Maoists, as eminent writer and Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy said, echoing Mamatas concerns, while she was addressing the gathering at the University Institute Hall recently.           
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram can not shirk his responsibility to visit affected areas to assess the state-sponsored terrorism unleashed to allow CPM cadres capture the areas.           
	The political clash between the ruling party and the Opposition will lead to a grave situation in the state if no drastic steps are taken by the home minister immediately. They should stop the joint operation and arrange for a dialogue between Maoists and the central government.

	Apropos the report Green returns to park, March 23, it is gratifying to learn that Mohammad Ali Park situated near the historic Calcutta University has been renovated. Sraddhananda Park is one of the oldest parks of Calcutta. In 1940, Subhash Chandra Bose delivered his last speech on the Indian soil at this park. I request the CMC to renovate the park and place a statue of Netaji clad in dhoti and alwan in it.

	Apropos the report Writers building, April 13, it gave me immense satisfaction to know that Bangiya Sahitya Parishad has thrown open the doors of its museum that housed some of the valuable belongings of great sons of our soil like Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and Raja Rammohun Roy.             
	The exhibits include Rammohuns death mask, his famous turban and other things of use. I think such a museum was really needed for the city.           
	Calcuttans have always been lovers of things of the past things and this museum will be a gift for them.

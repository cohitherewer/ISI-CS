                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Aide link to threat calls
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police have identified Khurram Khaiyam, a key aide of Aamir Reza Khan, as the man behind the threat calls to the owners of four business houses in the city.        
	City boy Khurram is absconding and has an Interpol red corner notice against him since 2003 for his role in the American Center attack.        
	The owners of the business houses have been threatened with abduction if they fail to cough up crores  between Rs 20 and 40 crore, according to police sources.        
	Khurram is a key member of the Asif Reza Khan Commando Force, headed by Aamir who also once lived in Calcutta. Aamir had zeroed in on his home turf for extortion but it was Khurram who was behind the calls, an officer said on Friday, a day after Aftab Ansari, the key convict in the American Center case, was grilled at Alipore jail.        
	Aamir and Khurram were key aides of Ansari.        
	The sleuths, however, ruled out the involvement of Hassan Imam, another member of Aamirs gang, in making the threat calls. Imam,too, has a red corner notice against him.        
	We have learnt that Aamir was desperate to collect money to buy arms for his gang, said the officer.        
	The police think Aamir is on a recruitment drive to sustain his jihadi activities. Some of the new recruits have been trained in the use of latest communication tools.

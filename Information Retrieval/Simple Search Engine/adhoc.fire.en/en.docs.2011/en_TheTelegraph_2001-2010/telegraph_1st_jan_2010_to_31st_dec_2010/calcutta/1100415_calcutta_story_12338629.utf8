                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Track death probe
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is set to take over the probe into the death of three youths whose bodies were found beside the railway tracks at Bediapara near Dum Dum on Monday morning. A team from the CIDs homicide wing visited the spot on Wednesday and spoke to the officers of Dum Dum Government Railway Police who were investigating the case.        
	We are yet to take charge of the investigation. Our visit is part of the ground work before conducting the probe officially, said a CID official. On Wednesday, family members of the three friends and colleagues  Ankur Sengupta, Ratan Saha and Tridip Das  lodged separate complaints with Dum Dum GRP alleging that they were murdered. The bodies bore multiple injury marks.         
	Whether the youths, all residents of Sinthee, were drinking before they died can only be confirmed after the reports of viscera tests are available, said a GRP officer on Wednesday.

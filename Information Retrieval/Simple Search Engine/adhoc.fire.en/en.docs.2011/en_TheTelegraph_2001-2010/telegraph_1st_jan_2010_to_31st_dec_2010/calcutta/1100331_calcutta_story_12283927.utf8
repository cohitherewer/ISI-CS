          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          Survivors guilt: A poster outside Stephen Court on Tuesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal				                                 
	Amit Kumar, an employee of Microsys Technical Enterprise at Stephen Court, somehow managed to save himself from last Tuesdays blaze that killed eight of his colleagues and many others. He spent the next seven days helping his colleagues families as they shuttled between the blaze site and the morgue to identify the bodies. A week on, Amit is worried sick, yet again.         
	I just realised that it is the 30th of the month and I have no idea whether I will get my salary, said the 29-year-old on Tuesday afternoon, looking forlornly at the blackened hollows on the fourth floor of Stephen Court.        
	I am the only earning member... my widowed mother and two younger sisters are dependent on me. I was lucky to have survived the fire but now I have to do something to make both ends meet, said Amit, who drew Rs 6,000 a month till February.         
	His colleagues Manoj Rajak and Guddu Prasad  both in their late 20s  echoed his worries. Our future seems bleak we fear we have lost our jobs and need to start looking for work immediately, said Manoj. There has been no official word from the company about whether they would be retained.         
	The blaze has cast a shadow on the future of around 1,000 employees of 130-odd small and medium establishments that used to operate from 18A Park Street.         
	Our office was completely gutted. I have heard that the owner is scouting for office space elsewhere but I dont know whether he will retain me, said Chandra Sekhar Das, an employee of Turning Point Job Consultancy, which was housed on the fourth floor. The employee of the headhunting firm is already on the lookout for a job.         
	We do not know when our office will be allowed to function from the building. I need the money to pay my daughters school fees. What will I do if our office does not resume operations soon? wondered a helpless Noor Alam, 35, a security guard with Gunnebo India Ltd.        
	The company operated out of its second-floor office at Stephen Court. Alam visits the site every day and sits with around 10 colleagues near the main gate of the building, hoping against hope for some positive news on the reopening of his office.         
	We are totally clueless about the coming days. Although we have survived the blaze, we are still trapped in a vicious circle, said Alam, who too is the only earning member in his family.         
	Ibrahimuzamman Safvi, who had a trading company on the sixth floor of Stephen Court, has managed to shift his office to Camac Street but said he might not be able to pay his employees this month.         
	Its a precarious situation for everyone. I know people are anxious but Im not sure whether I will be able to pay our employees this month. A lot of money will be spent on the renovation of the Stephen Court apartment, he said.        
	No pay for Amit would also mean no medical help.         
	I escaped by holding on to a rope but sustained injuries on my chest and stomach. I am having severe chest pain and the doctors have advised me to go for a USG and chest X-ray. But where is the money? he asked.

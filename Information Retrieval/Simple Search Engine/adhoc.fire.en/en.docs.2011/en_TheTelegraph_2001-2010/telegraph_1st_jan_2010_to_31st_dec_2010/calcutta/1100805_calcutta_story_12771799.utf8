          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday reminded a young wife of the eternal truth  that she would one day become a mother-in-law herself.        
	You have a son, you will grow old one day and become a mother-in-law. Remember this always, the judge told 32-year-old Ronita Halder, asking her to forge cordial ties with her in-laws.         
	The saas-bahu saga unfolded before a division bench of Justice Asim Banerjee and Justice Raghunath Ray during the hearing of an anticipatory bail plea by Joydev Halder, 37, whose wife Ronita had filed a case under Section 498A against him.         
	Ronita had alleged that her mother-in-law Gouri Devi and sister-in-law Mitali were torturing her with the support of Joydev, an employee of a private firm in Mumbai.         
	Marriage is not just about spending a happy life with the husband. Wives should develop a harmonious relationship with the family members of the husband, the judges held.         
	The bench asked the couple to stay together at Joydevs house in Behala with their six-year-old son, Bablu.         
	Ronita had filed her complaint on July 26 and Joydev moved his bail plea on July 28. The court had allowed the plea and scheduled the hearing for Wednesday.         
	Joydev and Ronita wed in 1999 but sources said their relationship hit a low soon after. In her complaint Ronita had said that Joydev sent money from Mumbai only to his mother, forcing her to beg for money from her mother-in-law to meet daily expenses.         
	On July 28, Ronita had pleaded with the judge for legal help. I am not in a position to engage a lawyer, please hear my plea, she had sobbed.         
	Justice Banerjee then appointed advocate Milan Mukherjee to assist Ronita. On Wednesday, Mukherjee communicated his observations to the judge privately and the judge decided to hear the matter a week later.         
	The judge on Wednesday also advised Joydev not to neglect his wife. You should respect your mother. But you should pay equal attention to your wife too and send her money separately, he said.         
	The judge ruled that Ronita and her son would stay with Joydev and his family at his Behala residence whenever he visited the city and live with her parents at other times.

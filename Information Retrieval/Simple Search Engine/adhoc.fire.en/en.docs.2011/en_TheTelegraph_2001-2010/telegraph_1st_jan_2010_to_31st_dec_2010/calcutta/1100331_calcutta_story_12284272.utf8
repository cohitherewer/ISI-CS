          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Five colleges affiliated to Calcutta University (CU) have been declared eligible to apply for the autonomy tag, university officials said on Tuesday.         
	The University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked CU to direct the five affiliates that were recently granted the centre of excellence tag to apply for autonomy.         
	The five are:         
	Lady Brabourne College        
	Bethune College         
	Maulana Azad College         
	Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandir in Belur         
	Bijoy Krishna Girls College in Howrah.        
	The UGC proposal was placed before the CU syndicate on Tuesday and the members unanimously decided that the colleges should be allowed to pursue autonomy. We have no objection if the five colleges seek autonomy, said Suranjan Das, the CU vice-chancellor.         
	An autonomous college can frame its own syllabi, conduct exams and award degrees. The marksheets and certificates bear the stamps of both the college and the university.         
	University sources said Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandir had already submitted a proposal to the state government seeking autonomy.        
	They added that the state higher education department would have to take a call on whether to allow Maulana Azad, Lady Brabourne and Bethune colleges to apply for autonomy.         
	The governing body of Bijoy Krishna Girls College, which is a state-aided college, will have to decide about proceeding for autonomy.

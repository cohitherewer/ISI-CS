The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Auto show in town
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Auto show in town
          ANASUYA BASU                                  
	The city this weekend will have its own auto show on the lines of Delhi Auto Expo.        
	The Auto Show East, to be held at the Salt Lake stadium grounds from November 19-22, will feature 10 manufacturers, including Hyundai, Tata Motors, GM, Ford, Mahindra, Toyota, Honda, Honda TVS and Suzuki Motorcycles India.        
	On display will be passenger cars, SUVs, MUVs, luxury cars and racing bikes.        
	The event is being organised by the Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), the apex body of vehicle manufacturers in India, along with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).        
	SIAM senior director Sugato Sen said stakeholders, including foreign manufacturers, felt that the biennial Delhi Auto Expo wasnt enough as the Indian auto industry was growing at an annual rate of 32 per cent.        
	They need to know the entire Indian market and its consumers. So we decided that in the intervening period of the Delhi Auto Expo, we will hold regional expos. We started with Hyderabad in May. Calcutta is our second regional venue, said Sen.        
	The show will travel to Pune after Calcutta.        
	SIAM decided to hold the second edition of the regional expo in Calcutta to give a boost to the eastern market, which accounts for only 11 per cent of the national passenger vehicle sales and 13 per cent of the two-wheeler sales.        
	There were 50,000 visitors to the three-day Hyderabad expo, said a CII source.        
	The expo was inaugurated by chief minister K. Rosaiah and it was a huge success, said Sen.        
	Depending on the response in Calcutta, where the show will be inaugurated by transport minister Ranjit Kundu, SIAM will decide whether the expo can be an annual event.

But business is booming inside the restaurant (right) with all the tables full and customers old and new (left) digging into the sumptuous fare well past the curfew hour.

	The street shooting on Ballygunge Circular Road on Sunday morning may have left the posh neighbourhood in shock, but it was business as usual for the dhabas that have turned the area into a shady all-night food corridor.         
	Metro kept vigil on the midnight-bite street barely 18 hours after the shooting and came back with food for thought for the authorities.        
	12.10am: We reach the landmark Azad Hind dhaba 50 minutes before the official shutter-down time. The only sign of caution is a guard ensuring that cars are parked at least 50 metres from the dhaba.        
	Sirji, aaplog yahan khare rahenge to ye police wale hum sabko andar kar denge (Sir, if you stand here the cops will put us behind bars), the guard tells one of us at the entrance.        
	By the time we step out, its 1am. The shutters will remain up, we are told, for quite a while.        
	1.10am: We are in front of New Sharma Hotel, 100 metres down the road from Azad Hind, where a police patrol van is parked. This is where the two victims in the 6am shooting incident on Sunday had stopped along with friends for a morning bite after a night of partying, though owner Lallan Sharma insists his dhaba didnt open before 7am.         
	The shutters are down even now but the dhaba is apparently open. Gaadi se baahar aane se na khana milega (You have to get out of the car to get food), smiles an employee stationed outside.         
	He escorts us through an adjacent passage that leads to a dark alley. We walk around 30 steps before hitting a flight of stairs. A man is waiting there with a torchlight. We are about to make a backdoor entry into New Sharma Hotel.        
	Just as we had thought  the cars parked outside were a giveaway  business is booming inside. Nearly 40 people are having dinner and all the tables are full. We stand for 10 minutes before getting a seat. We ask a waiter whether liquor is available and the answer is a firm no. But the rules are different for known faces. Two youths enter and walk away with beer bottles wrapped in paper.         
	It is 2am when we leave. The police van is still outside. A few cars belonging to customers are parked nearby; the cops choose not to see them.        
	Copspeak: Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), said Lalbazar had not received reports of any dhaba doing business beyond 1am behind closed shutters. But if a dhaba takes in customers through the backdoor, it is a serious offence that we will surely take note of.

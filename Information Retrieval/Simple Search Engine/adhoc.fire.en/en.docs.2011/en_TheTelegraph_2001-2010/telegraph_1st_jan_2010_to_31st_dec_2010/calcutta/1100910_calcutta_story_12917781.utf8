          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A call centre will soon come up to record Calcuttans complaints about civic problems, mayor Sovan Chatterjee announced on Thursday.        
	The toll-free number of the call centre is expected to start functioning by Puja, the mayor said at the launch of A Guide to Active Citizenship, a booklet brought out by the NGO PUBLIC, Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Vodafone Essar.        
	The booklet, in its third edition, guides citizens on ways to deal with civic issues such as waterlogging, garbage disposal, pollution, felling of trees, conservation of heritage buildings and preservation of water bodies.        
	We have included the laws governing these issues and tips on how one can take an initiative. There are also direct numbers of officials in charge of redressing complaints, said Bonani Kakkar of PUBLIC.        
	On being told that complaints were often not looked into, Chatterjee said: Given the limitations we work under, one cannot expect immediate solutions. But we are determined not to let the effort be marred by political concerns, as has been the case till now.        
	The booklet will be available at all Vodafone stores, with another 7,000 copies on offer at CMC offices.        
	Municipal commissioner Arnab Roy, also present on the occasion, said a form to lodge complaints was available at all civic borough offices as well as on the Calcutta Municipal Corporation website.

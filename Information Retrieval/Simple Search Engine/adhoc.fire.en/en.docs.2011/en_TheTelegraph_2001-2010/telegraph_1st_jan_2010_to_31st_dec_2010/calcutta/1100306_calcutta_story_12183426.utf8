                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Why did they lose will to live, wonders son
          RITH BASU                          The building where the Sarkars lived and attempted suicide. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Debjyoti Sarkar, the 22-year-old Bangalore engineer who lost his mother in a suicide attempt by his lonely Calcutta-based parents, has been left wondering what prompted the duo to lose the will to live weeks before they were to visit him.        
	Nothing is tallying, really. They evidently were very frustrated (by loneliness) to do something like this, but I dont know how things reached this stage, Debjyoti told Metro on Friday at Peerless Hospital, where his 64-year-old father Manoranjan is in the intensive care unit.        
	Mother Sikha was found dead and father Manoranjan unconscious in their Patuli apartment when anxious relatives broke down the door on Thursday because the couple werent taking calls. A 12-page suicide note was found.        
	Doctors say Sikha probably died around 18 hours before her body was found.         
	Debjyoti, who arrived from Bangalore on Thursday afternoon, spent Friday evening beside his unconscious fathers hospital bed, trying to read his face and make sense of the suicide pact. They were supposed to come down to Bangalore later this monthand then suddenly this, he said, struggling to hold back the tears.        
	Maternal uncle Shyamal Samaddar and other relatives stood outside as Debjyoti scanned the various monitors showing his fathers pulse rate, respiratory function and cardiac condition. He does not require ventilation but an airway protector has been fitted to aid his breathing, said the medical officer of the intensive therapy unit.        
	The medical superintendent of the hospital said it was encouraging that Manoranjan, a retired official of the National Thermal Power Corporation, didnt require ventilation. But there has been no significant improvement in the patients condition since he was admitted, he added.        
	Manoranjan and Sikha, 56, lived alone in a rented apartment at Chhattisgarh Housing Complex off the Bypass. Like many elderly people living away from their children, they were independent but lonely.        
	An interface organised by city police with 200-odd elderly people in 2008 had revealed that loneliness was their number one complaint.

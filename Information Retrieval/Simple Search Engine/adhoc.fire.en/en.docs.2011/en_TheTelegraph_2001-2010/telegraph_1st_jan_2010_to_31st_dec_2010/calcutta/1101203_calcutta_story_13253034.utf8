          A STAFF REPORTER                      S.K. Todi                          
	A thief has been caught on camera sneaking into the south Calcutta residence of businessman S.K. Todi to steal ornaments worth Rs 35 lakh.        
	Closed-circuit television footage showed the man scaling a boundary wall and entering Todis four-storeyed house on Sarat Bose Road early on Wednesday.        
	The lone guard had apparently spotted the thief while he was coming out of the house and given chase, but he scaled a wall and scooted.        
	Three diamond rings, a pair of earrings and a nose ring were later found missing from one of the bedrooms in the sprawling Todi residence.         
	We scanned all the rooms after the intrusion was reported and found some jewellery missing from my younger son Rahuls room on the second floor, Todi, who owns companies dealing in healthcare and real estate, told Metro.         
	 The thief had scaled the wall to enter our premises. He was captured on the CCTV cameras. We have submitted the footage to the police, added the businessman.        
	The thief came out of the house through the rear door, which the sentry found open around 5am. He had apparently sneaked into the house through the same door.        
	The Todi family filed a complaint with Ballygunge police station on Wednesday afternoon after drawing up a list of the missing items. Apart from the jewellery, around Rs 25,000 was stolen from a wall-to-wall wooden cabinet, police sources said.        
	The safe was locked but its keys were in a drawer in another part of the cabinet.         
	Investigators said they had also procured CCTV footage from the Anandalok apartment block adjoining the Todis 2/2B Sarat Bose Road house. It appears the man is in his mid-20s, said an officer.        
	A fortnight ago, a domestic help had tiptoed out of a Mandeville Gardens flat with diamond-encrusted jewellery worth Rs 30 lakh as the lady of the house sat in prayer. The police are yet to arrest the suspect, who was also captured on CCTV leaving the apartment.

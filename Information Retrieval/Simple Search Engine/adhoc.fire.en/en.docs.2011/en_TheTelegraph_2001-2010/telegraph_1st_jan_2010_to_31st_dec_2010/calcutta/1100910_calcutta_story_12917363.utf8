The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Presi shortlist on govt table
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Presi shortlist on govt table
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The search for the first vice-chancellor of Presidency University has been narrowed down to three suitable and consenting candidates.        
	A list containing the three names  shortlisted by a three-member search committee appointed by the government  with a detailed report on the academic credentials of each has reached higher education secretary Satish Chandra Tewary.        
	We have received the list. It will be processed before we take the next step towards appointing the first vice-chancellor, said Tewary.        
	Rules state that higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhury will scrutinise the list and forward it to governor M.K. Narayanan, who is also chancellor of Presidency University.        
	The governor will make the final choice in consultation with the higher education minister, Tewary said.        
	According to the rule book, a new state-aided university should have its first VC within three months from the day the gazette notification is issued. In the case of Presidency University, the three-month period ends on October 7.        
	The government is expected to notify the name of the VC in the first week of October after the completion of all administrative formalities.        
	The search committee has been mandated to select a person who can turn the College Street institute into a centre of excellence but the composition of the panel triggered suspicion that the clinching criterion for the selection would be the candidates proximity to Alimuddin Street.        
	All three members of the committee  economist Amiya Bagchi, former Indian Statistical Institute director Sankar Pal and Jadavpur University vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh  are believed to be close to the CPM.        
	Sources said higher education department officials had been asked to treat the list of candidates as highly confidential. A leak before the appointment of the VC would create a controversy.        
	Ghosh, the convener of the search committee, refused to comment on the list. We have done our job. The list is now with the government. I cannot comment further, Ghosh told Metro.        
	Sources in the higher education department said the search team had failed to convince an academician of international repute to become the first Presidency VC.        
	Apart from the fear of political interference, the one-year-term of the first VC has put off several potential candidates.

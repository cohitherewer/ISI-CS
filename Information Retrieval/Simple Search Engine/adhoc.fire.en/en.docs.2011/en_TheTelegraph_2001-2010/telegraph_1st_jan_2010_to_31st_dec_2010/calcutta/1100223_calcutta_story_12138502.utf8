The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rizwanur shadow on KKR deal
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rizwanur shadow on KKR deal
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Rizwanur Rahman has returned to haunt Rizvan Khan, with the Kolkata Knight Riders deciding to put all visible ties with Lux Cozi on hold.        
	So, Shah Rukh Khan may have taken on the Shiv Sena in Mumbai for the sake of his Rizvan in My Name Is Khan but he has decided not to risk the Rizwanur tragedy in Calcutta casting a shadow on his cricket team.        
	SRK, though, remains a brand ambassador for the innerwear company.        
	We have decided to respect the sentiments of the people of this city, said Jeet Banerjee of KKR, outlining the go-slow on the teams deal for official fan-support wear because of the Rizwanur case against the innerwear companys owners pending in court.        
	Its a management decision and Shah Rukh is part of the management, stressed Jeet, outlining zero visibility for the KKR-Lux Cozi combo.

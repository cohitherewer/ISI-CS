The extant letters and writings of the artist are translated and reproduced from the originals, and in their entirety for this two-volume book.

Introduced, annotated and edited by her nephew Vivan Sundaram, the editorial intervention sets the larger background for situating the artists voice, along with photographs of the Sher-Gil family album, reviews by contemporary art critics and excerpts from autobiographies and testimonies that touched her life. This evening, Tulika Books, Delhi and The Seagull Foundation for the Arts host the launch of the book, which will be introduced by Sundaram.

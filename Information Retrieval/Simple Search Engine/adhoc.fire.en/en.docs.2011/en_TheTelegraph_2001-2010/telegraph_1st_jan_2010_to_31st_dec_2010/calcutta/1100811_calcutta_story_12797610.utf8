The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Scorcher in the time of rain
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Scorcher in the time of rain

	Subrata Guha did not allow his boys to practise their Messi moves and Villa volleys on Tuesday evening, but for once the budding footballers were not complaining. The morning session had left them drained.        
	Today the heat seemed worse than in March-April. The boys  all between 14 and 16  were really struggling in the morning, so I let them off early and cancelled the evening session, said the coach of a soccer camp run by the Putiari club of Kudghat, in association with the state sports department.        
	Calcuttans  even those who watch but dont play the game  were left wondering why Tuesday felt like an April afternoon as the maximum temperature shot up to 36.2 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal, making it the second-hottest August day this decade.        
	The last time the city experienced such a scorcher was five years ago, on August 31, 2005, when the maximum rose to 36.7 degrees Celsius.        
	The weatherman blamed the heat on reduced moisture incursion from the Bay of Bengal.        
	A cyclonic circulation has formed over the Bay. The circulation is inducing the formation of a low-pressure area in its vicinity. This formation process is not allowing enough moisture incursion from the Bay into south Bengal, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The lack of moisture is resulting in lower humidity during the day, which is responsible for the torment of dry heat, added Debnath.        
	The maximum humidity was normal at 96 per cent. But the decisive factor was the low minimum humidity, 54 per cent on Tuesday, around 20 per cent below normal.        
	Minimum humidity in the 50s meant that for most parts of the day, the city was far drier than usual. The minimum usually hovers in the mid-70s, or even early-80s, during this time of the year, explained a scientist from the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida.        
	The lack of moisture is also hindering cloud formation, allowing the suns rays to freely hit the surface, making the earth hotter by radiation, said an official from the India Meteorological Department.        
	Now, for some good news. The dry heat, assures the weatherman, should not last beyond a day or two.        
	Once the low-pressure area forms, which is expected to happen by Wednesday, the moisture incursion would be normal again, said Debnath. There should be a cloud cover and scattered rain after that. The heat isnt likely to stay.        
	Normal monsoon rainfall is also expected to resume by the weekend.        
	Substantial rainfall, characteristic of the season, is likely to be back. The low-pressure area will help in the formation of thunderclouds over south Bengal, said the IMD official.        
	August has so far had eight rainy days with 108.1mm of rainfall. The long period average for August is 328.8mm of rain over 17.2 rainy days.

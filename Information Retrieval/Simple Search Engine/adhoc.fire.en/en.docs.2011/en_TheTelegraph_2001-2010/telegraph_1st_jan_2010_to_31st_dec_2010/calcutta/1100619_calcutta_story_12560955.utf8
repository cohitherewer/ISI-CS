The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tracks wait for trains on last lap
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tracks wait for trains on last lap
  - Kavi Nazrul-New Garia opening hinges on two rakes joining Metro fleet          SANJAY MANDAL                                    
	The tracks are ready but the trains are not, leaving Calcuttas transport lifeline staring at a massive traffic overload in the run-up to Durga puja if the Kavi Nazrul-New Garia stretch is opened without extra rakes.        
	Availability of rakes is crucial to smooth operations and we are still waiting for the new coaches to arrive. We have postponed the proposed June launch of the last stretch of the north-south Metro connection but we will open it before puja, principal chief engineer Neeraj Kumar told Metro.         
	The original plan was to open the 2.9-km stretch along with the Tollygunge-Garia Bazar (Kavi Nazrul) section last year but litigation over land forced the authorities to revise the deadline to June 31. A new date hasnt been fixed but officials hope to start services from New Garia after two additional rakes  both air-conditioned  arrive from the Integral Coach Factory at Perambur in Tamil Nadu.        
	Metro Railway is yet to receive even one of the 13 air-conditioned rakes being manufactured at Perambur. The first of the lot is expected to roll out of the factory by the end of this month but it wont join the fleet until mid-July because experts have to first certify it fit for the tracks.        
	The second rake could be ready by puja, though officials doubt whether only two additional trains would be enough to cope with passenger pressure in the festive weeks.        
	According to an internal assessment, passenger load would increase by over a lakh commuters every day once Metro services are extended to New Garia. Metro Railways ageing fleet wont be able to handle the increased traffic if new rakes arent added, say officials.        
	 After the launch of operations between Tollygunge and Kavi Nazrul last August, there was a sudden increase in traffic and we did not have extra rakes to handle the load. We want to ensure commuters dont suffer again, a senior official said.        
	Metro Railway has been ferrying nearly five lakh commuters every day with only 15 rakes. We have 18 rakes but two of these have been sent for a complete overhaul. Another rake is undergoing repairs after being damaged when it hit the buffer at Shahid Khudiram station on May 16, an official said.         
	With three of the 18 rakes out of service, Metro Railway is finding it difficult to maintain its daily schedule even now. Of the 18 existing rakes, 11 are to be phased out while the remaining seven will be upgraded to air-conditioned coaches.   
	TRACK RECORD  
	 Length of last stretch: 2.9km  
	 Stations on the route:   Kavi Nazrul, Briji (Shahid Khudiram) and New Garia  
	 Estimated passenger increase: One lakh  
	Sanctioned rakes: 13, all air-conditioned   
	Rakes expected by puja: 2

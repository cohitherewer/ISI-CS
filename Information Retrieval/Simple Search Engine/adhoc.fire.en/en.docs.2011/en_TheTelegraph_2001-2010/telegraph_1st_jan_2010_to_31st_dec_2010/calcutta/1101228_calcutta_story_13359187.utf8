                      Future focus                    Experimenter presents the first ever showing of The Otolith Group in India. Founded in 2000 by Anjalika Sagar and Kodwo Eshun, the group (nominated for the Turner Prize 2010) works with media archives, histories of futurity, the legacies of non-alignment and tri-continentalism. The groups artistic work explores the moving image, sound and text, and also functions internationally as a public platform for curatorial practice and discussion on contemporary artistic production. The present screenings feature their most significant work so far, The Otolith Trilogy, crucial films that have spawned other tertiary creations. Essentially founded on archival footage of Indian modern political and social history and Indian cinema, the trilogy is part of the collections of several important institutions, including Tate Britain, London and Museum of Contemporary Art, Barcelona.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	An Alipore court on Thursday invoked the Senior Citizens Act and asked the husband and the son of a 64-year-old woman to pay her a monthly maintenance of Rs 3,000.        
	Chief judicial magistrate Apurba Singha Roy ruled that Saibya Giris husband Narayan, 70, will pay her Rs 2,000 and her 30-year-old son Tarak, Rs 1,000.         
	The Senior Citizens Act, which seeks to ensure that the aged are not ill-treated or denied the basic necessities by family members, came into force in 2007.        
	Saibyas lawyer Dipit Basu said the problem in the family started a year ago over a five-cottah plot owned by his client and her husband near their Thakurpukur home. Tarak, who drives an auto, and his wife had asked Narayan and Saibya to transfer the plot to them. Saibya refused but Narayan transferred half the plot to his son, said Basu.        
	Since then, Tarak and his wife have not been taking care of Saibya, forcing her to eke out a living by cooking at various houses. She suffered severe burns while cooking in a house. Local residents took her to hospital, said Basu. The lawyer representing the husband and the son opposed Saibyas plea for maintenance, claiming his clients had no intention to ignore the aged woman.

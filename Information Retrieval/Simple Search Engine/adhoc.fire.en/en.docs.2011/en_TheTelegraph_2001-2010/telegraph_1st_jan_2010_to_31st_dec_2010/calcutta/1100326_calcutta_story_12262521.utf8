	My beloved Park Street, you are maimed, bruised and scarred today. Don rsquo;t worry, you will rise again like the Phoenix from the ashes.             
	I recollect the glorious Sixties when I was studying English at St Xaviers College. That walk from the Gandhi statue to the college  the fresh aroma of baked pastries and almond cakes from Trincas and Flurys, the scent of lavender in the air and the smell of new bestsellers on the pavement near Oxford Bookstore and Kwality! I can spot Satyajit Ray browsing books on ornithology; he is making Kanchenjunga. Fr Joris, the nemesis of all BCom students, is dragging Jalan and Khandelwal from Flurys for bunking Prof N. Vishwanathans English classes.           
	There is Bade Mian at Olympia, Lone Trojan at Trincas and Louis Banks at Blue Fox. All legends in their own distinct ways. Prim and proper Patricia Tarley at Mags crooning her special number, which was 34. Only Park Street could embrace them.           
	Stephen Court accommodated beauty queens  Mary Arathoon! Her brother was to be avoided, being a boxing champ and a rugby player. We watch and wait for that bewitching smile when Mary steps out of her palace.           
	Cookie (a friend, not a biscuit) suddenly becomes an intellectual. He wants to admolish the ugly buildings of Park Street; only he means demolish. Stephen Court tops the list but Mary has to be evacuated first.           
	Blue Fox comforted us in the evenings. Louis Banks was music, Pam Crain meant excellence in jazz and blues numbers of the 40s and 50s. We were all there and savoured every moment of our life then. Park Street was our life. Now Park Street is hurt and I grieve for you, my dearest piece of land.

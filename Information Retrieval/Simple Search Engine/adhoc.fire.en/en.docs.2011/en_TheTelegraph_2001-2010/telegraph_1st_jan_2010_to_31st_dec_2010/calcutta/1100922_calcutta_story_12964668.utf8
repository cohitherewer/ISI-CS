The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Demands divide CPM teachers body
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Demands divide CPM teachers body
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The education czars of Alimuddin Street were dealt another blow last Sunday when several members of the West Bengal College and University Teachers Association (WBCUTA), a CPM stronghold for three decades, walked out of a meeting leaving the leaders red-faced.         
	The reason for the boycott: the association leaderships refusal to include the members demands  that the retirement age of college and university teachers be raised from 60 to 65 years and the government create more permanent teacher posts  in the general secretarys report to be published during the AGM next month.        
	According to sources, there were heated exchanges between those close to the CPM and the non-Left lobby. The non-Left members criticised the association leadership for not pressing the Left Front government to accept their demands.        
	About 40 of the 105 members attending the meeting walked out when the association general secretary, Tarun Patra, made it clear that their demands would not be included in the report, said sources.        
	The Madhya Pradesh and Bihar governments have accepted the Centres recommendation and raised the retirement age of teachers to 65 years. We have been urging our association to hold a discussion with the government. But the leaders are only concerned about advocating faulty education policies instead of doing their job  protecting the rights of teachers, said Kalyanmoy Ganguly, the vice-president of the association, who now supports the Trinamul Congress.        
	Our executive committee has accepted a resolution against the Centres proposal on raising the retirement age. We could not allow the members to discuss an issue in the general meeting that has already been rejected by the executive committee, Patra told Metro.        
	The division in the association was first noticed last year when a section of members supporting Trinamul, the Congress and the SUCI held a meeting while the AGM was being conducted.

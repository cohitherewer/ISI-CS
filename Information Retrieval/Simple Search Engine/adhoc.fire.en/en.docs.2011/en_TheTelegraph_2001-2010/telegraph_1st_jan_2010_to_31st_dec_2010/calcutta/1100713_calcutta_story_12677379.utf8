                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      V-day vignettes, home amp; away
   Room with a view of victory                              An army of fans in Barcelona celebrates Spains first World Cup triumph on Sunday night. (Reuters)                                  
	Malabika Sarkar, a former professor of English at Jadavpur University and the president of the Centre for Studies in Romantic Literature, got a ringside view of the celebrations in Barcelona after Spain won its first World Cup on Sunday. She recounts the fan fervour for Metro the morning after.        
	Honking cars, blowing of horns, people jumping on the street or singing in chorus with mugs of beer in hand  it was 11.30pm and Barcelona seemed to have gone crazy.        
	I was looking out from the window of our hotel room overlooking La Rambla, near Placa Catalunya. The place is the heart of the city, much like our Park Street. There are souvenir shops and tapas bars all along the tree-lined street meant for pedestrians.         
	So one could guess where the supply of liqueur was coming from. There would be no downing of shutters tonight. The spirits would flow till the wee hours. Spain had lifted the World Cup, for the first time in the footballing history of the nation. The citys cup of delight was brimming over. What a time to be in Barcelona, which had given the Spanish team as many as six of its players!        
	This trip was occasioned by a seminar at University of York where I am to read a paper on Milton. It was sheer luck that we decided to stop over at Barcelona a week before.         
	Surprisingly, when we landed at El Prat airport six days ago, it was barely apparent to visitors that Spains World Cup campaign was well on track. Perhaps it was only after they successfully negotiated the semi-finals that the city began to believe in its chances. Which is why the souvenir shops stocked little football merchandise.         
	But on Sunday, from the morning, David Villas No. 7 and Andres Iniestas No. 6 jerseys were flying off the shelves. They call jerseys camiseta in Spanish. And it was Iniestas camiseta that was being worn with a lot of pride. The midfielder had been reared as a footballing talent by the city from his teenage years. Not just the locals, we saw even a bunch of American youngsters pick up camisetas to be in the spirit of things when the kick-off would take place at 8.30pm local time.         
	Two huge screens had been put up in a park behind La Rambla and the crowd started coming in from around 6pm. Suddenly, three convertibles zoomed past us, with music blaring and the people in them merrily waving flags of The Netherlands. Dutch tourists in Barcelona were making their presence felt. No, they were not booed. Instead, the scene caused a lot of merriment amid the Spanish supporters.         
	As it neared kick-off time, we returned to our hotel room to catch the match. At half-time, we walked out again to soak in the atmosphere. The park as well as the bars were chock-a-block with football fans but the mood was clearly tense as the team had not managed to score yet.         
	But nothing had prepared us for the delirious scenes on the street below when Iniesta found the net at last. Fireworks were being set off from all corners. It was like Diwali night.        
	As souvenirs of this night of magic, my husband Sudipto is picking up mementos of the local club FC Barcelona as not much is available related to the World Cup. But what I am carrying back in my minds eye when I take the flight to England tomorrow is more precious and lasting  a surging sea wrapped in red and yellow.                     AS TOLD TO SUDESHNA BANERJEE

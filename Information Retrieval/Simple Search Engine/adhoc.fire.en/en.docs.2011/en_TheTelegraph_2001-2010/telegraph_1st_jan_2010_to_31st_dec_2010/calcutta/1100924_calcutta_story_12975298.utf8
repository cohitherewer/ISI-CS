The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Patil plane off radar
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Patil plane off radar
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Pratibha Patil in town on Wednesday                                  
	President Pratibha Patils flight to Aizawl went off Calcutta airports west radar for five minutes shortly after take-off on Thursday, leaving air traffic control in a tizzy until the aircraft reappeared on the east radar.        
	Officials manning the ATC tower said the west radar tripped after the Indian Air Force aircraft carrying the President and husband Devisingh Shekhawat to the Mizoram capital had travelled barely seven nautical miles.        
	The aircraft took off at 10.57am and the west radar tripped around 11.07am. It took us five minutes to connect the flight to the east radar, during which time the plane was off the radar, said a senior official.        
	Experts from the communication navigation surveillance department, however, insisted that the problem arose because the ATC official monitoring the west radar had mistakenly logged out.        
	Although the President and her entourage reached Aizawl safely, the contrasting versions of how her aircraft went off the radar raises questions about aviation safety at the city airport. The director-general of civil aviation is investigating Thursdays incident.        
	An ATC spokesperson said the communication navigation surveillance team was informed about the malfunctioning west radar almost immediately after personnel manning the tower lost sight of the aircraft. The flight was in the Bagdogra airspace when we lost it on the west radar. It was transferred to the east radar even as the team of engineers fixed the problem. The feed was then re-routed to the west radar, the official added.        
	According to an official of the communication navigation surveillance department, the engineers found nothing wrong with the west radar.         
	Metro had reported on Wednesday about a shelved plan to upgrade the ATC making a comeback with an additional budget of Rs 250 crore. The upgrade had been dropped from the original airport modernisation plan because of a cash crunch.         
	The city airport has three radar covering east, west and north along with an approach radar. All of these are over 12 years old.        
	The outmoded radar system needs to be often shut down for maintenance, forcing ATC personnel to switch to manual mode while handling nearly 1,000 flights every day, including overflying ones.

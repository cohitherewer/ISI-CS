                      Transcending the text                    Since primitive times, artists have engaged in experimenting and developing a language of their own that, on a broader level, becomes emblematic or iconic of the age. However, over the last few decades or so, there came into being a trend in art where its representation has nothing to do with any philosophy of life or its aesthetic expression. Instead, it became more autonomous, original and diverse in its attempt to deconstruct and articulate lifes complexity and the process of living. The emergence of plurality of art styles has now acquired a new dimension, wherein artists have transcended conventional parameters of creativity with the help of innovations in technology and digital media. Thus, art is no longer limited within a regional periphery, but is a conscientious process to evolve a new concept through an individualistic language, with an intention to connect with thoughtful minds across the globe. No Content Worries, the ongoing art show, highlights this contemporary intriguing approach and practice of art that is surpassing rules of aesthetics, breaking all tenets of essentialism and reaching out beyond borders. Comprising paintings, sculpture, video art and installation, the show features works by Barun Chowdhury, Saptarshi Naskar, Priyanka Lahiri (a painting by her appears here), Nobina Gupta, Nantu Behari Das, Ketan Amin, Somit Gupta, Mansoor Ali and others.

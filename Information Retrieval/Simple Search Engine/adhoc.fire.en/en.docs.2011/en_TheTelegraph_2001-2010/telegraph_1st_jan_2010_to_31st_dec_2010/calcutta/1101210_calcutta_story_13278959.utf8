The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lights dim on theme screens
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Lights dim on theme screens
  - Location trips footfall          PRIYANKA ROY                          One of the auditoriums in Bioscope, Rajarhat                                        
	Calcutta could be on the verge of losing another multiplex after the giant-screen IMAX folded up last month. Bioscope, the four-screen plex at Axis Mall in Rajarhat that opened with fanfare on Poila Baisakh this year, is struggling to stay afloat.         
	Our weekly footfall has hit an all-time low. If this poor run continues, we will have no choice but to wind up in the next few months, says Arijit Dutta, the man behind Bioscope as well as popular single-screen halls Priya and Star.        
	While the daily weekend footfall at the citys first theme plex is in the 800 to 1,000 range, the Monday to Thursday crowd count often slips below 200. This, despite the Rs 75-Rs 100 ticket price band throughout the week.        
	The biggest drawback for Egypt-themed Bioscope is its location, with the sparsely populated New Town failing to draw footfall. Not many are willing to drive down from the other parts of the city to catch a show there at night, says Dutta. As a result, all shows at Bioscope wind up by 9.30pm. In comparison, a night show can begin at INOX Forum or Fame South City at 11pm.        
	With six of the 10 multiplexes in the city located in the EM Bypass-Salt Lake-Rajarhat zone, Bioscopes poor run has other operators worried. We came in hoping that the IT sector would boost footfall, but that has not happened, says an official of Big Cinemas, in Salt Lakes Sector V. The weekday footfall at this three-year-old multiplex is in the 500-700 range.         
	The lack of footfall drivers at Axis Mall has hit Bioscope hard. The plex only has Bengali restaurant Aaheli and a just-opened food court for company. Every multiplex needs strong co-anchors to draw the crowd. Unfortunately, Bioscope has to do everything by itself and is struggling as a result, says Dutta.

	 Apropos the report PIL on house heritage tag (June 22), the house at 5, Russell Street has no historical value because officially the Bishops house is at 51, Chowringhee Road. The Bishop of Calcutta being the highest body of the Christian community had given confirmation vide their letter dated August 5, 2003 that they had/have no interest in the said property with respect to any religious importance or otherwise. Also the CMC never considered it of any historical importance. The civic body notified the property under the criteria Architectural Style, but since there is no architectural style there, it delisted the same. CMC Agenda and Resolution of June 27, 2007 states that Tenants of the building are pursuing to declare the building as Heritage. The property is fully tenanted, both authorised and unauthorised, and is of no value as it is fetching ridiculously low rent.           
	Merely staying of a few Bishops for a few years in the 1840s does not make the property Bishop House.           
	The property was not included in a heritage building book compiled and published by INTACH in 2006 after extensive research. On the contrary, INTACH had published 51, Chowringhee Road as the official residence of the Bishop in their book.           
	The gateway was demolished by YMCA as it had weakened over the years and was likely to fall causing fatal injuries to the tenants and visitors. This was not demolished by any third party or realtor. This was informed by YMCA in 2001 to the CMC, police and the minister for urban development. In the agenda/resolution of CMC in their meeting held on June 27, 2007, CMC has specifically mentioned that The Gateway was demolished by the present owner i.e. YMCA few years back. It was mentioned in the same agenda that Tenants of the building are pursuing to declare the aforesaid building as Heritage.           
	Hence publication of the article by The Telegraph on June 22, 2010 mentioning that a realtor had demolished the Gateway is wrong and based on incorrect information received from tenants /INTACH, without making any verification from YMCA or CMC.           
	On the request of the CMC, the gateway was reconstructed by YMCA under the supervision of CMC-empanelled conservation architect Anjan Mitra who issued a certificate on September 24, 2008. This was appreciated by the heritage conservation committee of the CMC on October 22, 2009 and also in the corporation meeting held on December 23, 2009 by way of adopting/ passing a resolution as follows: The members have appreciated the reconstruction of the demolished gateway at the aforesaid premises. DG(PMU) is requested to salvage the plaque from the Shakespeare Sarani police station so that it can be reinstalled in the gateway.           
	The agreement to sell the property is 20 years old and has become stale and not acted upon by YMCA and is now barred by lapse of time. This was explained by YMCA counsel in the high court and this has been declared by way of an affidavit in the high court. This is YMCAs property and not for sale and shall remain with YMCA. However, this is not relevant for the purpose of evaluating heritage status and not the subject matter of PIL.

  Chowringhee Road               Cart before horse? A horse-driven tonga near Victoria Memorial                 
	 Apropos the report Naked gun at Maidan joyride, June 2, horse-drawn carriages and hand-pulled rickshaws are gradually becoming scarce although both serve as a boon when streets become waterlogged. So the state government and some people should not oppose this slow-moving mode of transport that do not pollute the environment.             
	Prahlad Agarwala,
  Majdia, Nadia           
	Tongas should be banned. Horses are quiet and harmless animals. They should be left free to roam on the Maidan or in some park. People should not capture them and use them for pulling tongas. The tonga drivers should be provided alternative employment by the government.           
	Somesh Nandi,
  Chetla                     
	The tongas should definitely be banned from the city. The way the tonga drivers hit the animals with canes, it is nothing but cruelty to the animals.           
	Samir Cassim Ariff,
  Amartalla Lane           
	If the tongas are banned then I think horse race should also be banned. Such races are painful for the animal. Just because the races fetch big bucks and are backed by the rich, no one questions the brutality of horse racing.           
	Girish Tijoriwala,
  Address not given                     
	I was thrilled to spot the PETA ad featuring Nargise Baheri, calling on the government to ban horse carts and tongas. Every time I see those exhausted, skinny horses straining to pull huge loads I feel frustrated and angry. Except for those who profit off the horses misery, who supports horses on the congested streets? We dont need to abuse starving horses.

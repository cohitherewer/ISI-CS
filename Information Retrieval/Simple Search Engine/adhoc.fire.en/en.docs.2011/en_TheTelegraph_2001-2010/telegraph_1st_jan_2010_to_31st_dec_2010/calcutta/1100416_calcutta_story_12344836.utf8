                      Livewire play of action and ideas          For the first time ever, Jadavpur University Department of English (JUDE), perhaps Indias leading English department, presents an originally written play and is proud to have discovered a dramatist. Not just that, the author is a student of the department. Youth theatre is where the talents of the future are shaped, and where the audience can encourage the new generation to spread its wings and fly. Wire, written by Saravanan Mani, is a clever yet serious multi-lingual play. Set against an intimate background, it is about an Indian film unit shooting in a forest, when some terrorists apparently try to take them hostage. Twists, turns and flashbacks, with live music and dance, lead to a bitter ending that also reveals an unexpected beginning. Directed by Ananda Lal.

	How to be the most-talked-about bride in town? What to wear to make her go wow on W-day? When to plan a marriage in Kuala Lumpur? The Telegraph Weddings promises to answer all that and more.        
	The one-stop wedding mart is back with its fourth edition at the ITC Sonar this weekend. Spread over three days (August 13 to 15) and with 55 stalls to choose from, it provides a unique browse-and-buy opportunity.        
	It is the most important platform for anyone wanting to showcase a bridal line here because most other exhibitions do pret (off-the-racks wear), says menswear designer Medhavini Khaitan.        
	For Agnimitra Paul, it is a great platform to reach out to a large number of people. It is a good exhibition and the timing is right  just before the festive season. People can come here and shop according to their budget. Last year, so many people got in touch with me after the exhibition, says the designer who will complete a hat-trick at The Telegraph Weddings this time. Her trousseau range will mostly comprise heavy saris.        
	A contemporary groom is on Medhavinis designboard this year. Slowly, men are also opening up to the idea of a trousseau. They want something for every occasion, she says. On her racks, spot a lot of sherwanis, kurtas, bandhgalas, jackets and dhoti pants. Offbeat shades like sky blues and mint greens can become the pop picks this year.        
	Grooms-to-be can also check out Manoj Diwans corner. While the stall will try to capture a bioscope, his sherwanis and achkan-styled pieces will be high on bling with zari, stone and Swarovski embroidery.         
	Those looking for a twist in their wedding wear, can head to Radhika Singhi and Sayantan SarkarThreads for a collection of Anarkali sherwanis. They are fitted till the waist and a little longer in length, explains Sayantan.                                
	Other city-based fashion names on show include Chhuti amp; Raja, Souvik amp; Aditi, Tejas Gandhi, Ekru, Sansa, Nandita Thirani, Fish Dart, Nehaz, Talat Kazmi, Vriddhi By Sarika, Pankhudi by Kavita Tulsian, Palki, Kishan, Ashta-Dhatu and Tres Loudon.         
	A brides trousseau shopping is never complete without some comfortable yet stylish sleepwear. And lingerie designer Suman Nathwani will have them in prints, embroidered and textured.        
	More than 10 jewellery houses will shimmer and shine for the three days. If Saakshi puts up silver and fashion jewellery, Gaja Heritage will stock traditional Bengali patterns. R.K Jewellers, Mahabir Danwar Jewellers and Bling are the other jewellers from Calcutta.         
	Accessorising it right is often the key to the perfect look. And names like Crimzon by Sonali Dalwani (Mumbai) and Prateek will help with just that. VLCC, Keya Seth and Roots N Herbs will provide beauty solutions.        
	What about the appropriate wedding gift? Dmart will provide interesting options, Delhi-based photography label Nitant Sabharwal will offer innovations ranging from album cover to a picture perfect wedding video, and SOTC will help with the hottest honeymoon getaways.        
	Finally, if you are looking for a hatke wedding, the likes of Vinod Bhandari and Neet Paul will be at hand. This year, we are planning weddings themed on the Umaid Bhavan Palace and the Piccadilly Square, says Bhandari.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              NOW AND THEN: Thursdays Trinamul rally at Salt Lake stadium (top) and a CPM rally at the stadium (above) to mourn Subhas Chakrabortys death. (Sanat Kr Sinha)				                                 
	The winds of change flung open the gates of Salt Lake stadium on Thursday for the Trinamul Congress to hold its first big rally on this piece of red turf.        
	The 10,000-strong Trinamul head count at the rally may not have been large enough to rival a party meeting on the Maidan, but it was still the largest Opposition gathering at a venue where the only big match player except on Mohun Bagan-East Bengal days has been the Left Front.        
	We couldnt have imagined assembling here in such large numbers until last year. Thursdays meeting is symbolic of the change we are trying to bring about in Bengal, declared Sabyasachi Dutta, the vice-chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality.         
	Mamata Banerjee led the charge of the green brigade at the partys XVIIIth Karmachari Sabha, attended by almost all MPs, MLAs, newly elected councillors, gram panchayat chiefs and zilla parishad leaders. As many as 321 blocks, 121 municipalities and six municipal corporations were represented at the meeting that broke the CPMs monopoly over the stadium.         
	If Subhas Chakraborty used to be the CPMs man of the match, Trinamul found its man in his protg Sujit Bose on Thursday. He did everything that needed to be done. It helped that he was Subhasdas Man Friday until he switched allegiance in 1999, said a party leader.        
	The sports and youth welfare department, which runs the stadium that has hosted everything from soccer matches to soirees organised by the late Subhas Chakraborty, charged Trinamul Rs 5,000 for using Block A for the day.         
	Trinamul had previously organised two meetings at the stadium but both were small affairs. The first was the Dum Dum parliamentary committee conference in 2002, followed by the North 24-Parganas youth conference two years later. The last big CPM event at the stadium was a Left Front rally in January to mourn Jyoti Basus death.

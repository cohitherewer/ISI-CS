The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | X-ray upgrade holds up flights
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      X-ray upgrade holds up flights
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Teething troubles of an imported baggage scan system have been delaying flights at the city airport.        
	The online X-ray machines from Holland were fitted to two of the three conveyor belts in the domestic terminals departure lounge last week.         
	Since then, airport sources said, several flights have been delayed. Jet Airways flights in the morning and afternoon were the worst hit.        
	On Monday morning, Jet Airways flights to Mumbai, Delhi and Pune were delayed by 40 minutes each and to Bangalore by 45 minutes. Five other flights were delayed between 10 and 15 minutes, said an airport official.        
	The airport authorities met officials of the airlines later in the day to sort out the problem.        
	An online baggage X-ray system is being introduced. The machines have been installed and the system is on trial. Problems in co-ordination is causing the delay, said the airport official.        
	There should be a 15-20 second gap between the scanning of two bags but airline loaders are not maintaining the gap, causing the sensor to trip and thereby causing delays, he added.        
	During rush hour, it is not possible to maintain a 15-20 second gap between bags. More conveyor belts should have been installed before introducing the system, said an official of a private airline.        
	Its a minor problem caused by the switch to a new system, said airport director R. Srinivasan.        
	Passengers used to carry registered bags  after they were sealed  to the check-in counters. They could tamper with the baggage on their way to the counter, said a security officer. In the new system, the registered luggage will be screened on the conveyor belt after check-in. Once a bag is placed on the belt, its owner cannot handle it before reaching his destination.

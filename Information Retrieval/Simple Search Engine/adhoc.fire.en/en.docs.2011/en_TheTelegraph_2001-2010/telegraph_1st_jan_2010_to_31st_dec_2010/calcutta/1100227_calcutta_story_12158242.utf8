                      Palette tales                    A show that celebrates individual talent and at the same time offers a fresh perspective on the continuity of traditional and contemporary themes, Symbols amp; Metaphors, the ongoing group exhibition, showcases some of the finest artistic output of the last 100 years. True to the premise of the show, as suggested by its title, the works offer a visual journey into the world of symbolism and is replete with motifs that hold the keys to unlocking the enduring enigma and mystery of life. Eternal themes relating to life, death, sexuality, roots, nature and the human condition are examined through diverse moods and attitudes. Touched with humour, satire, melancholia, faith or optimism, each work offers a glimpse into the psyche of its creator. Featuring works by Paresh Maity, Gopal Ghosh, M.F.

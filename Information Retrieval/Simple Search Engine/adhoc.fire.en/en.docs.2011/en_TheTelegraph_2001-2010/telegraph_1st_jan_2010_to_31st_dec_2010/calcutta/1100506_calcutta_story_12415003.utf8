	Once, the tiger ruled the jungle. But today, the role has been reversed. The hunter is the hunted. I wonder what it would be like if we were to find ourselves in the position of tigers, said Aniket De, a Class XI student of DPS, New Town.         
	DPS New Town was one of 11 city schools that came together to participate in the Wild Spring Fest. Organised by the Centre for Ecological Movement on April 30 along with Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan (BSS), its theme was the importance of saving the tiger.         
	The day began with a competition where each school presented a seven-minute skit on the state of tigers today.         
	We wanted to make the children conscious about the tiger. We asked every school to present original scripts for the skit, to egg them on to do some fact-finding of their own about the issue. It is a more effective way of learning than memorising dry facts, said Sunita Sen, the principal of BSS.        
	DPS New Towns performance showed a role reversal, with tigers taking the place of people while BSS depicted three generations of a family discussing the diminishing numbers of tigers. BSS pointed out that the fate of tigers is directly linked to the preservation of the environment. Other participating schools included Akshar and La Martiniere for Girls.         
	Shri Shikshayatan, Brahmo Balika Shikshalaya and The Heritage Academy emerged winners. It is important for the young generation to be aware of the problems plaguing the world. The fest was an effective platform for them to explore the issue, said theatre personality Dolly Basu, who was one of the judges.        
	Next up was an open quiz on the environment. Said Aditi Chakraborty, a student of BSS: The questions were easy, with lots of visuals. I especially enjoyed identifying the animals and the questions on birds.        
	The high point of the day was a snake show, where snake handlers Deepak and Debanjan Mitra displayed and spoke about snakes, including non-poisonous snakes like the Rat Snake, Red Sand Boa and poisonous ones like the Russells Viper and Mono Krait Cobra. I did not know that poisonous snakes were harmless unless they are provoked, said Antara Ghosh of BSS.

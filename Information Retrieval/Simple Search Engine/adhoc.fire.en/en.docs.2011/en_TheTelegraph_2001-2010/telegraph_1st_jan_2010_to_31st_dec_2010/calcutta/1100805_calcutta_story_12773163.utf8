The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Concern over cop transfer
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Concern over cop transfer
          KINSUK BASU                                     
	The officer who was instrumental in cracking some sensational criminal cases in the city is moving to Delhi, raising questions about the future of the Special Task Force he has been heading since its inception in July 2008.        
	Rajeev Kumar, a 1989 batch IPS officer and computer science graduate from Roorkee Engineering College, will join a central force within a few months. It would be improper to read too much into the move. Its a routine shift, Kumar told Metro.        
	Transfers of police officers are indeed routine but a section of Calcutta police insiders fear this particular shift will prove costly for the STF.        
	Kumar, who has been playing a key role in the anti-Maoist operations in the state, has been steering the probe into a number of cases, the biggest being the organised pilfering of army ammunition.        
	The STF had blown the lid off the racket on June 29, with the arrest of four persons and seizure of 5,000 rounds of bullets meant for the army. The force under Kumar also busted a fake currency racket and arrested key terror suspects.        
	We fear the STFs performance will take a hit following Kumars exit, said an officer.

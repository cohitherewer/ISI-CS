The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stephen protest for delay in upgrade nod
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stephen protest for delay in upgrade nod

	Around 30 residents of Stephen Court demonstrated on Wednesday in front of the fire-ravaged building against the delay in granting approval to their plan to reconstruct their homes.        
	The authorities had announced that the residents would be denied entry to their apartments till they carried out some structural changes that could prevent a recurrence of the March 23 tragedy that killed 43 people.        
	Representatives of the 70-odd families who have rented flats in the six-storeyed Park Street building owned by Stephen Court Limited claimed that they had submitted their reconstruction proposals, which include creating new fire escape routes, to the civic body in July but were yet to hear from the authorities.        
	The authorities are imposing conditions that are applicable to new buildings. They should understand the situation and sanction our plans so we could gain an early entry into our homes, said Dilip Kumar Basu, a resident of block III of Stephen Court.        
	Once approved, he added, the reconstruction would be carried out in six months at a cost of Rs 70 lakh. The expenses will be borne by the residents.        
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee, however, said the sanction was being held up as the reconstruction plans had some flaws that the residents are unwilling to rectify.        
	We, too, want the reconstruction to start at the earliest because the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is losing crores in looking after the damaged parts of the buildings. But our hands are tied and the sanction can only be granted after necessary changes are made to the plans, he said.        
	Another reason for withholding the nod, the mayor pointed out, was that the fire department was yet to approve the residents proposal. Our approval is subject to the fire departments clearance.        
	The residents claimed they had sent the fire exit plan to the fire department earlier this week. Fire services director Gopal Bhattacharya, who met the residents on Wednesday, said he was considering the matter.        
	The residents have proposed to repair the service staircase of each block and the two spiral staircases of the building and extend them up to the sixth floor. They now go up to the fourth floor.        
	The residents have also proposed to repair the main staircase of each block and build separate flights of stairs connecting every two floors and leading to the main staircase as emergency exits.        
	Officials have opposed the the plan to build separate staircases and insist on one emergency flight of stairs for each block.        
	The residents said that if the civic body stuck to its stand, many of them would lose considerable portions of their homes. We have been homeless for a long time and plead with the authorities not to make the situation more difficult for us, said Debasish Guha Neogi, a resident of block III.

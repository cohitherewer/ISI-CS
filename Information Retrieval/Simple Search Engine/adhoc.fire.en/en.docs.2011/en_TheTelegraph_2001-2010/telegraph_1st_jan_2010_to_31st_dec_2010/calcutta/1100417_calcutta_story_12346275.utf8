The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Return cry at Stephen Court
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Return cry at Stephen Court
          OUR BUREAU                          Residents of Stephen Court at a dharna in front of the building on Friday. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                                  
	Residents of Stephen Court sat in dharna outside the fire-scarred building on Friday morning to protest the lackadaisical attitude of the administration towards their plea to return home.         
	Some residents spread bedsheets on the pavement and had lunch, their posters screaming: Give back our homes!         
	The citys minders, on their part, accused the flat owners of ignoring suggestions given by the authorities.         
	Its frustrating and humiliating to continue living with one relative after another. The authorities are telling us how much longer we will have to wait. They are just passing the buck, fumed Lata Shah, a resident of Block I.         
	Some residents said they had submitted the floor plans of their flats to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and their premises had been checked. But other flats are yet to be inspected.         
	All residents of blocks III and IV have also paid Rs 15,000 each to government-approved contractors to redo the wiring and earthing of the building, said a flat owner in Block III.         
	Power is another peeve point. Electrical work is being carried out till the fourth floor but work on the fifth and sixth floors could not be started because there is no light on those floors, said a resident.         
	She added the residents had written to CESC asking it to shift the electric meter boxes from near the lift to outside the building.        
	Civic officials said they would visit blocks III and IV next week to check their structural stability. The building is still unsafe for living. We are also awaiting a nod from the fire department and CESC, said Debasis Kar, the director-general (building) of the CMC.         
	Kar alleged that the residents hadnt done their basic duty of forming an association, that the CMC had been stressing for days.         
	The residents, however, are divided on forming the association. While some are backing the idea, others feel the buck of restoration and maintenance would stop with the association and the rest of the residents would shirk all responsibility.        
	Another resident felt that the demand for a residents body was the administrations ploy to wash their hands of Stephen Court.

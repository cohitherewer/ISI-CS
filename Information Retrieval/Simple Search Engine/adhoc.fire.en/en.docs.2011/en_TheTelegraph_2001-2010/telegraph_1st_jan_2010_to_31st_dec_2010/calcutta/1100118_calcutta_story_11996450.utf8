          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Bengal will for the next 48 hours mourn the man who ruled the state for 23 years and bid a final farewell on Tuesday evening.        
	Jyoti Basu will be kept in the Peace Haven mortuary on Monday, from where his last journey will set off on Tuesday morning.        
	The first stop will be Writers Buildings, followed by Assembly House, the CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street and finally SSKM Hospital, where Basus body will be donated for medical research. (See map)        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti announced a two-day state mourning.        
	All state government offices, establishments and educational institutions would remain closed on Monday, he said at Writers Buildings.        
	Chakrabarti also appealed to private organisations as well as educational institutions to observe a holiday on Monday.  
	When asked whether nationalised banks and other Central government establishments would remain closed on Monday, the chief secretary clarified: It is not a holiday under the Negotiable Instruments Act.... We have made an appeal and now they will take a decision.        
	The two-day mourning would mean that that all government festivals, programmes and hospitality stand cancelled.        
	All universities and most schools have decided to stay closed on Monday. Some have already declared a two-day holiday.                
	On Monday, those wishing to pay tribute to the longest-serving chief minister the country has seen can queue up to sign condolence books at the Assembly House. There will be one at the Alimuddin Street party office as well.        
	Details of Basus last journey  with full state honours, according to the chief secretary  were announced by Left Front chairman Biman Bose at Alimuddin Street on Sunday.          
	The procession will leave Peace Haven on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road for Writers Buildings around 9.30am on Tuesday. His body will be kept at Writers till 10.30am before it will make its way to Assembly House, said Bose.        
	The body will be kept till 2.30pm at Assembly House, which will be open to all. We request people to come in a disciplined manner and pay their homage, added Bose.        
	From Assembly House, the body will be brought to Alimuddin Street, where a lack of space would make it difficult to manage large crowds, appealed Bose.        
	The last journey of our leader will start from the party office at 3pm and travel through AJC Bose Road, Shakespeare Sarani, Cathedral Road and Harish Mukherjee Road to reach SSKM Hospital, Bose said.        
	The routes through which the body will reach Writers Buildings, Assembly House and Alimuddin Street would be finalised later in consultations with the state administration. Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra is overseeing arrangements for the final journey.        
	Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police, headquarters, said adequate arrangements would be made to manage the crowds even if the last journey took longer than planned.

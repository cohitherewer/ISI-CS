           DOORWAY OF DISGUST: Passengers struggle to get out of the terminal building at the city airport. Lack of adequate number of exit points and the absence of rules for outsiders result in chaos. Picture by Aranya Sen                           
	 After many harrowing experiences at Calcutta airport, I am convinced that the place is being run by a gang of criminals. Since most passengers do not complain, the crooks get away with it.           
	Touts hound you to change foreign currency, while the CISF personnel look away. This foreign exchange racketeer is seen in the airport everyday. Who knows if this black foreign exchange makes its way to any terrorist organisation?           
	A bottle of mineral water costs Rs 45 at the airport. Stale sandwiches are sold too. Every time I have asked for the complaint book airport officials have refused me. Instead, the airport manager makes a show of calling the shop owner and scolding him.           
	The paper glasses in which aerated drinks are sold are all cut down by hand to a smaller size. Therefore, you get 200ml while you pay for 500ml. Take it to the airport manager and you will be abused.           
	The taxi booth has been designed by the crooks for the crooks. Step out of Heathrow airport in London and the taxis are available in a single row. A police officer takes down your details along with the taxi details and gives you a reference number and a telephone number in case of any trouble. Is that a very difficult system to follow?           
	The CISF personnel are a useless lot. They are hand in glove with most of the so-called outsiders in the airport. Are we to believe that Calcutta airport has no video-surveillance cameras? Who looks at these tapes? If these tapes are seen by trained officers, how come they see nothing untoward or any harassment going on?           
	The running of the airport as well as railway stations in Calcutta gives a visitor the impression that Bengal is being run by crooks. Our politicians are too shameless to take any concrete steps.           
	Max Galstaun, Shirley, United Kingdom                       
	 To answer the question Why is Calcutta airport such a mess? (November 1), I must say that such the situation  messy surroundings, long queues, touts, fleecing taxis  is the result of decades of apathy by the ministry of civil aviation and the state government and the indifference of Calcuttans.             
	Airports Authority of India employees are equally responsible for the mess. CISF personnel, who man all airports in the country, work efficiently in Mumbai and Chennai but not in Calcutta. The only option to improve the airports condition is expediting the process of modernisation.           
	Tushar Kumar, New Delhi                     
	 Recently I faced most of the problems highlighted by Metro about Dum Dum airport. My flight to Delhi was at 6.30am. When I reached the airport, I had to wait in queue for 20 minutes just to enter the premises. I managed to find a trolley, but it was broken. Overflowing dustbins and leaking roofs added to my ordeal. No wonder most international airlines have withdrawn their services from Calcutta.

	 It was raining when my flight from Delhi reached Calcutta on time. I booked a pre-paid taxi but couldnt locate the cab mentioned on the receipt. At the taxi stand, I saw a young man arguing with a taxi driver. The driver had allegedly asked for extra money and the passenger was not ready to pay more than the fare on the meter. The passenger wanted to lodge a complaint but was prevented by four people. A security guard at the pre-paid counter watched the proceedings in amusement.   
	After a long time, my taxi came. I asked the driver why he was so late and he informed me that only when dada permits can a taxi come to the stand. I did not dare to ask who this dada was.           
	A. K. Basu, Address not given                     
	 Last month, I arrived at the airport at 6.50am to take a flight to London and was astounded to see that there were no trolleys near the entrance to the terminal. Some children were dragging a few trolleys and demanded money to let go of them!           
	There were betel juice stains all along the walls and the floor, not to mention the deplorable state of toilets in the waiting lounge, past the security check gates. The bathroom floor was flooded and there was nobody to clean up the mess. Even the liquid soap holders were broken.           
	Chirashree, Address not given                     
	 The last time I was at Calcutta airport was a few months back. The state of the departure lounge was pathetic. Most of the seats were torn, the area around the bins was spattered with betel juice and the toilets were stinking. Also, a bottle of cola costs more than five times its MRP at the city airport.           
	Navendu Mathur, Palm Place                     
	 What is happening in Calcutta airport is symptomatic of any failed state.           
	I had a bad experience during one of my trips to Calcutta a few months back.           
	After waiting interminably, I finally got a pre-paid taxi receipt. But finding my allotted taxi was another task. A man fetched the cab for me and then demanded money for the service!           
	Then my cab driver said he did not have petrol to go to my destination  New Alipore. He headed for the counter only to return after 15 minutes and hand me a new coupon with another cab number.           
	Subir Nag, Mumbai                     
	 There is no provision for kids or the aged at Calcutta airport. Everybody wants to board the aircraft just like a local train at Sealdah station. Passengers need to be more disciplined and respectful towards others before blaming the authorities for all thats wrong with the city airport.           
	In the restrooms, there is no diaper- changing table. Once, when I approached an official for help, he just walked away.           
	Dipanjali Banerjee (Ray), Address not given                     
	 Calcutta airport is internationally known for its chaos, mismanagement and fish-market syndrome.           
	Security personnel need to be more alert and caring. Rules for outsiders and non-passengers should be clear and specific. Arrival and departure timetables should be placed at various points so that people do not crowd one place.           
	Proper parking space, more dustbins, cleanliness and preventing people from clogging entrance and exit points will help improve the condition of the airport. Civic consciousness among passengers is also a must.           
	Amrita Mallik, Salt Lake                     
	 The airport is just a reflection of the city that Calcutta has become. Its difficult to get a trolley, the security area is overcrowded, the pre-paid taxis are a nightmare.           
	Cut to Hyderabad. Getting in and out of the airport is never a problem, cars can drive right up to the entry or exit ramps and cops man the area effectively. Even buses are available right from the exit ramp and private cabs from the parking lot. Though all this come for a price, most of us wouldnt mind paying if we got the desired level of service.           
	Nilasish, Address not given                     
	 The CPM has killed this state in every respect. Next year, if the Trinamul Congress comes to power, I dont expect anything to change for the better. There will be more fights and more chaos everywhere in Bengal. It is amazing that the airport can be maintained like this. I am ashamed to be a Bengali.           
	Ranjan Chowdhury, Edmonton, Canada                     
	 Is it any wonder why the worlds leading airlines have pulled out of Calcutta or why major brands are reluctant to invest or do business in the city?           
	When I was at Calcutta airport, I found the airport immigration and security officials rude and unhelpful. The toilets were filthy and the facilities not worthy of an international airport.           
	Tulie, Chicago, US                     
	 Calcutta airport is a story gone terribly wrong. The immigration personnel ask for money if they see that you are a young guy on a first-time job visa. It seems like a rickshaw port compared with Delhi or Mumbai.           
	Sujoy Kanjilal, Address not given                     
	 I have often found cigarettes being sold illegally inside Calcutta airport. Private car drivers approach arriving passengers to ferry them out of the airport to make a quick buck. Baggage handlers force fliers to avail of their services while touts start hounding you the moment you step out.           
	A.S. Mehta, New Alipore                     
	 I arrived at Calcutta on October 31 and booked a pre-paid taxi (Bengal Taxi Association) to Majerhat. It took over 15 minutes for the taxi to come to the stand. The taxi was very old, with no horn or signal lights and was on the verge of breaking down every few metres.

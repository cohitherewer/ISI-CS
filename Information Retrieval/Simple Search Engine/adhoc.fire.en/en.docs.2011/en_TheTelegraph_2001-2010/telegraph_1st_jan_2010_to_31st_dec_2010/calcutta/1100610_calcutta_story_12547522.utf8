The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | School squirms in boy death glare
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      School squirms in boy death glare
  - Police meet family, probe team meets teachers          OUR BUREAU                                    
	The twin probes at the La Martiniere for Boys  by Shakespeare Sarani police and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights  on Wednesday turned the glare on the nature of corporal punishment suffered by Rouvanjit Rawla at the hands of his teachers days before his death.        
	We are going through the post-mortem report to ascertain the reason behind his death, said an officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station, probing the abetment to suicide charge filed by Ajay Rawla, father of the Class VIII boy, against the school principal and four teachers.        
	The cops also visited the Rawla home in Alipore to gather evidence and speak to the family. We will speak to the boys classmates at school on Thursday and then the accused teachers will be questioned, the officer added.        
	Ashok Agarwal, leading the two-member team of the national commission, told Metro that the question was not whether Rouvanjit had been subjected to corporal punishment, as the schools internal enquiry was also regarding that.         
	We are trying to find out what kind of corporal punishment was meted out and whether it led to the death of the boy, he said.        
	Metro had on May 21 reported how principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi had admitted to the schools board that he had caned Rouvanjit days before his death.        
	The probe team of Agarwal and B.K. Sahu spent the day meeting two members of the board of governors, the principal and other teachers. We also met Rouvanjits classmates and had a very interesting discussion with them, said Agarwal. We will meet the chairman of the board, Bishop Ashok Biswas, on Thursday morning.        
	Chakravarthi, Bishop Biswas and the school secretary Supriyo Dhar were unavailable for comment but sources said a section of teachers expressed resentment over the bad name the school and they were getting over the mishandling of the Rouvanjit Rawla and Sanjay Smart cases.        
	If a few teachers are guilty of corporal punishment or corruption, why cant appropriate measures be taken against them internally? they demanded. An emergency meeting was convened to assure them of appropriate steps being taken.        
	Metro had revealed on May 21 how instead of taking appropriate steps, the school management had dropped Neil O Brien (after a 20-year stint) and K.S. David from the board for demanding a proper probe into the matter.        
	No matter what kind of offence the child may have committed, corporal punishment cannot in anyway be justified, OBrien said on Wednesday. Under the standing rules and regulations of the school, inflicting corporal punishment is classified as misdemeanour, he added.        
	Wednesday also saw Partha Pratim Banerjee, father of Srijan, whose complaint has sent Sanjay Smart to judicial custody, file a complaint with the commission. I have mailed them my complaint about how the teacher did not promote my son to Class V after being denied a laptop as bribe, said Banerjee.

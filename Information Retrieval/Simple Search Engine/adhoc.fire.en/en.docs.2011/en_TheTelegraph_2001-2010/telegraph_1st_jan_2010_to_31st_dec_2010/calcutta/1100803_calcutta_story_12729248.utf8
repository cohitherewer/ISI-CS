The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | B-school boost for dreams
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      B-school boost for dreams
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          An outgoing IIM Calcutta batch during the convocation                                   
	Indian Institute of Management Calcutta is not just a gateway to a plum job; its also a place to acquire and hone skills before starting off on ones own.        
	The 2010-2012 batch at the Joka B-school is an eclectic mix  including a doctor, an educationist, a photographer and a botanist-turned-social entrepreneur.        
	For Dr Aswini Rakhame, IIMC is a step towards achieving her dream  setting up a chain of hospitals. The 23-year-old MBBS was interning in a government hospital when she felt a degree in management would give her a head start in realising her dream.        
	I want to do something like Apollo but for that I need to acquire some management skills, said Rakhame.        
	Pooja Misra has seven years work experience, four in the US. But a visit to her village in Rai Bareilly district of Uttar Pradesh, where she saw the gulf between her and those she had left behind, changed the course of her life.        
	Misra set up a college offering bachelors degrees in arts with her savings from her stint in the US.         
	I cant get involved with the college fully without a thorough grounding in business education, said Misra, whose father is now looking after the daily functioning of the college.        
	Amateur photographer Arindam Biswas hopes his time at the Joka B-school will equip him with the necessary time-management skills that will help him take up photography semi-professionally.        
	The IIT Kanpur alumnus chanced upon photography during his tenure at Morgan and Stanley in Mumbai, where he joined the Mumbai Weekend Shots club. At IIMC, he is a member of the Lakeside Lens Lovers group and hopes to put up an exhibition of his photographs in Calcutta and Mumbai soon.        
	I will benefit from the time-management strategies I learn here and will also be able to pick up contacts who can help me host shows, said the city boy.        
	For botanist-turned-social entrepreneur David Lumin Touthang, IIMC is a stopover before he embarks on his rural development venture. The 27-year-old from Manipur wants to start a rural development organisation in his home state and is in Joka to learn the tricks of running a group.        
	I will study what I need to and even intend to work in an established organisation for a while to learn how it works, said Touthang, who taught in a government high school for over a year before going to the Tata Institute of Social Sciences for a course in social entrepreneurship.

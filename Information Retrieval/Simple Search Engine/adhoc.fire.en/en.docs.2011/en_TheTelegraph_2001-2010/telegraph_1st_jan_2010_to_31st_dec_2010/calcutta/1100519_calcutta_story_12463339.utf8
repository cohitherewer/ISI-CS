          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police have identified 281 polling stations in 51 wards as sensitive and super-sensitive in the run-up to the May 30 civic elections.        
	The names of the polling stations have been sent to the state election commission, said a senior officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters.        
	We anticipate violence in some pockets on the day of the election and that is why we have identified the trouble-prone areas. It will help the election commission to deploy security personnel adequately, he added.         
	Officers of the special branch, Calcutta polices intelligence wing, prepared the list after touring the polling stations over the past few days.        
	The booths on the list are in Maniktala, Rajabazar, Garden Reach, Kidderpore, Behala, New Alipore, Watgunge, Metiabruz, Belgachhia, Chetla, Cossipore, Park Circus, Topsia, Hazra, Bhowanipore and other areas, said an officer.         
	According to him, criminals from Bihar and Jharkhand hiding in the city could create trouble on election day. The cops are not ruling out clashes between supporters of the Trinamul Congress and the Congress after their alliance broke down.         
	State election commissioner Mira Pande said several factors had been considered while assessing the security situation of a polling station. She declined to identify the polling stations designated as trouble-prone.         
	An official of the election commission said elaborate security arrangements would be made to ensure free and fair polls.        
	Extra security personnel would be deployed in all the sensitive and super-sensitive booths. Mobile police teams will also be deployed to prevent any untoward incident, added the official.        
	Officers of all 48 police stations have been asked to arrest criminals in the area and keep a close watch on the areas deemed sensitive.        
	Raids are being conducted every night. We have been able to arrest several criminals over the past few days, said an officer of the port division.

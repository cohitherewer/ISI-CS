The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mayors itch in city of hitch
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mayors itch in city of hitch
  - Metro went looking for craters old and new as the first citizen looked for ways to give the citys bleak future a leg-up					 					      tt FOR City - POTHOLE PERIL              BT ROAD                                
	BT Road  near Rabindra Bharati University              
	What: Giant craters dot the stretch.        
	Crater crown: At least four large craters within a distance of 250m vie for the crown, which goes to one that is nearly 12ft in diameter.        
	Watch out for: Vehicles in peril. Passengers struggling to get on and off buses. Traffic snarls.        
	Way out: Drive in slow motion. Avoid after dark if possible. Be extra careful while boarding/disembarking from bus/auto.        
	Official: The craters are not mere potholes, but also scars left by CESC work. We will repair the stretch before August 15, said a PWD engineer.                  BEHALA            
	Behala  Ajanta theatre crossing              
	What: The potholes here are growing and multiplying by the day.        
	Pothole prize: One with a diameter of 5ft among at least six others within 70m, between Ajanta theatre and Pathakpara crossing.        
	Watch out for: Flying stone chips plus pothole peril.        
	Way out: Drive slowly and skilfully. Small mercy? The craters are almost in a straight line.        
	Cop: One flank is closed because of work on the Taratala flyover and now this stretch is a mess. How can we manage traffic here? demanded a constable deployed at the crossing.            SILPARA            
	Western flank of Behala Silpara Main Road to Chowrasta crossing              
	Yesterday: At least 13 small and big potholes along the stretch, parts of which were waterlogged. So vehicles were forced to take the opposite flank.        
	Today: A Matador lost control while dodging one of the giant waterlogged potholes and toppled over on Tuesday morning, injuring the driver and helpers. Water was then pumped out to make the potholes less perilous. But the upper road surface has been washed away, making it dangerous, especially for two-wheelers.        
	Victim: Every time it rains, its the same story. The authorities do some patchwork that serves no purpose, said Manojit Banerjee, a resident of Silpara whose motorcycle hit one of the potholes two days ago and skidded. He has a leg injury to show for civic apathy.

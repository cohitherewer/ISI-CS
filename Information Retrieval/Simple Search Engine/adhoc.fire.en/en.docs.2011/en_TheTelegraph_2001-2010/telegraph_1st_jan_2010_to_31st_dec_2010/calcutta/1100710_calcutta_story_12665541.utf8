                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Jewellery stolen and recovered
          A STAFF REPORTER                           The door to the Mores flat. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	A businessmans flat at Lansdowne Terrace was burgled early on Thursday, but Rs 6 lakh worth of stolen jewellery was found with the arrest of a south Calcutta snatcher on Friday.        
	Police identified the arrested youth as Sridhar Das, a veteran in petty crime.        
	The jewellery was found in a cloth bag in Sridhars house, near the Kalighat fuel pump. The stolen cash  Rs 25,000  is still missing.        
	The thieves apparently had an easy entry into Harsh Mores second-floor flat near Deshapriya Park.        
	Neighbours said the Mores had kept their air-conditioner switched off at night and the verandah door open. The thieves had possibly tied a sari to the balconys parapet and rappelled up.        
	A relative of Harsh, Niraj More, lodged a complaint at Tollygunge police station.              
	Niraj and two of his aunts were in the flat when the theft took place, an officer said. They realised that the flat had been burgled only the next morning.        
	We came to know about the theft from them later in the day. They told us a sari was hanging from the balcony. The thieves had probably used it to enter their room, said Srinita Das, who lives on the first floor.        
	A police officer said the Mores had been living in the two-bedroom-and-study flat for the past seven-eight years.        
	They have businesses in Bengal and Jharkhand and shuttle between the two states, said homemaker Srinita.        
	Her flat had also been robbed two months ago, she said. Then also the thieves had tied a sari to the balcony to climb up.         
	The police said a gold chain and bangles, worth around Rs 40,000, had earlier been stolen from an apartment in the building. None of them has yet been recovered.        
	The police said the Mores had the jewellery at home possibly because of a wedding in the family.        
	A lock was hanging from the collapsible gate outside their flat on Friday afternoon. They have all gone for a wedding, said a domestic help, who was inside.         
	At least six cases of snatching and petty theft are pending against Sridhar, police sources said.         
	This is not the more infamous Sridhar Das. But he is an expert in petty crimes, an officer said.        
	We are interrogating Das. Maybe he will help us crack some other cases as well.

          RADHIKA SEN                          Some of the participants at the art competition held at Birla Academy of Art and Culture. Picture by Aranya Sen                        
	They preferred to chat and compare notes while drawing. And, many chose the archetypal rural scene as their subject of expression.         
	They were all children from slums of wards 83 and 84, who participated in an art competition at the Birla Academy of Art and Culture recently. Around 300 children (from four to 16 years) belonging to Children International-Disha Foundation, attended the event.        
	These children live in tiny homes and are deprived of opportunities. Through their drawings they can let loose their imagination, said Malika Singh, director, Disha Foundation.         
	While landscapes  especially huts with thatched roofs and shaded by coconut and palm trees  were the favourite, some of the older kids chose to depict the Tricolour or various themes on patriotism.        
	I want to be like Spider-man when I grow up, said six-year-old Preetam Bag, holding a fistful of red and blue crayons as he put finishing strokes to the portrait of his webbed hero.         
	The young artists got two hours to finish their drawings. At the end, there were snacks for all.         
	Preetam Bag, Subhra Samanta and Avirup Addy were winners in the four-seven year category, Debasish Bera, Sandip Das and Aman Mondal won in the eight-11 year category while Nupur Maity, Poulomi Das and Ankita Ghosh aced the 12-16 year category.         
	The drawings of these nine children will be sent to the headquarters of Children International in Kansas City, where the final three winners will be declared, added Singh.        
	The judge for this event was Megha Malhotra of Seagull Publications.

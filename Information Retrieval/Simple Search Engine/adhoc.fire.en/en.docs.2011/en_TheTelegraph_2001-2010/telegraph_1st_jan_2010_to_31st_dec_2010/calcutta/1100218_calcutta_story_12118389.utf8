          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday upheld the state heath secretarys decision to temporarily cancel the registration of a doctor for negligence resulting in the death of a baby.         
	Rupa Basu, the accused doctor who owns a nursing home at Chanditala, Hooghly, had moved the court against the directive passed by the health secretary in May 2009.        
	The doctors name will now be struck off the medical councils list for six months, during which period she cannot practise, said Subir Sanyal, the lawyer of the babys parents, Madhumita and Sushanta Boral of Dankuni.        
	Sanyal told the court that Madhumita had given birth to a boy on August 15, 1999 at Basus nursing home. The newborn baby was having breathing problems and convulsions. But Basu did not call a paediatrician or administer any anti-convulsion drug to the baby, the petition said.        
	A specialist who was called in after five days said the nursing home had failed to take proper care of the child, Sushanta said.         
	There was no trained nurse... a quack assisted Basu during the delivery, he said.        
	Over the next two years, the baby was treated in various hospitals but could not be saved. The mother moved the state medical council in 2001, alleging that her son died because of negligence after birth.        
	The council censured Basu but did not take any penal action against her, said Sanyal. Madhumita then moved an appeal before the health secretary.        
	Basus lawyer Surojit Samanta said: We will move an appeal in a division bench.

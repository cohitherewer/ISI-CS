The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flagged off: poll tricks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Flagged off: poll tricks
          POULOMI BANERJEE AND SUCHETA CHAKRABORTY                                          Residents of Salt Lake rsquo;s BD Block woke up to a sea of flags, festoons and banners on their boundary walls, gates and fences on Tuesday, as the civic poll army devised a method to beat the no-graffiti rule.

	The writing may not be on the wall for Salt Lake this civic poll but its not off it either.        
	Residents of BD Block woke up to a sea of flags, festoons and banners on their boundary walls, gates and fences on Tuesday morning with party workers apparently spending the night trying their latest trick to beat the poll code in a no-graffiti zone.        
	This is my private property. Nobody asked for my permission before putting it up. If they had done so, I would have definitely said no, complained Sanjib Guha Roy, pointing to the Trinamul Congress flag fluttering on his gate.         
	The gate of B. Nandis house had both the Trinamul and CPM flags tied to it, though he didnt seem to mind it because both candidates are known to me.        
	But did they seek his permission to peg a flag each to his grille? No, they didnt but a flag is not as bad as wall graffiti. If they had tried writing on my wall, I would have stopped them, he said.        
	For many residents, the flag-and-festoon invasion invited embarrassing questions about their political affiliations. I do not know my fathers political preference but the flags lining our wall definitely makes us look like Trinamul Congress supporters, said 20-year-old Lovely Gupta.         
	Ashrukana Saha, a CPM supporter, complained to the local councillor about flags of a rival party lining her wall. But most residents said they feared reprisal if they filed complaints. Let them do what they want, said an elderly resident, resigned to her wall being wrested for poll publicity.         
	A half-constructed building nearby even had a board with Mamata Banerjees face on it placed on the ledge over the entrance, making it look like a party office rather than someones would-be home.        
	Joy Banerjee, the secretary of the CPIs Salt Lake committee, admitted that party workers had put up flags without permission in two houses but promised that they would be removed. Anupam Dutta, the Trinamul Congress candidate from ward 7, claimed that those contesting the civic polls from the township were at a disadvantage compared to their counterparts elsewhere. Even a roadside tree belongs to the government. Where will we put up our banners? he protested.        
	State election commissioner Meera Pandey said she would need to go through the model code of conduct, which prohibits graffiti without permission, to find out whether putting up a flag or a banner on a private wall without consent was also a violation.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A division bench of the high court on Monday asked La Martiniere for Boys to allow Srijan Banerjee to join Class V with immediate effect.        
	The basis of the order was the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, applicable in case of the Class IV student who was denied promotion on March 29, two days before the act came into effect officially. The act prohibits schools from detaining students till Class VIII. Srijan was twice detained in Class IV.        
	La Martiniere for Boys teacher Sanjay Smart had allegedly sought a laptop as a bribe to supply the questions set by him for the annual examination to ensure the boys promotion to Class V.         
	Smart was arrested on May 17 and charged with criminal intimidation, extortion and abetment to an offence following a complaint by Srijans father, Partha Pratim Banerjee. He is now out on bail.        
	My son has been suffering from mental trauma. My efforts to admit him in other schools failed as Srijan insisted on going to La Martiniere, the 10-year-old-boys father said after Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice Mrinal Kanti Chowdhurys verdict.        
	Supriyo Dhar, the secretary to the board of governors of the La Martiniere schools, said: We have a board meeting on Tuesday and whatever the board decides, whether to appeal to the Supreme Court or take back the child, we will act accordingly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | More power to Rajarhat body
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      More power to Rajarhat body
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The Assembly on Thursday passed the New Town Calcutta Development Authority (amendment) Bill 2010, which empowers the statutory body to provide three additional services.        
	Post-enactment, the authority will have the power to enlist trade and profession, record the land and building titles and supervise and control advertisements in the Rajarhat township.        
	The authority is now responsible for construction, roads, water supply, drainage, waste disposal and markets.        
	There has been a rise in the demand for urban services that cannot be provided by panchayats, which lack in resources and experience. The rural bodies cannot sanction plans for highrises because they do not have engineers. The amendment, empowering the New Town authority to provide these services, will help fill in the gap, said housing minister Goutam Deb, also the chairman of Hidco, the implementing agency of the township.        
	The new services the authority will provide are usually offered by a municipal body, but the present population of New Town does not warrant the setting up of such a dedicated set-up.        
	You cannot expect local panchayats to sanction plans for state-of-the-art structures being built by the likes of DLF, Unitech and Shaporji Palonji. For that engineers are required, said an official of the New Town authority.        
	It would take another 10-15 years for New Town to develop. Not even 35,000 people have moved in. It is, however, necessary to ensure that quality civic services are provided while infrastructure development is on, the official added.        
	New Town was conceived in the mid-90s and 3,075 hectares were acquired in more than 25 mouzas.        
	The New Town Development Authority was formed in 2007 to ensure planned development of what the government billed as showpiece township and provide various services and amenities.        
	Though the bill was passed unopposed, Manas Bhuniya of the Congress raised questions about the infrastructure in New Town.         
	The roads are in bad shape and there is no drinking water, market or hospital. Without these how can a township be developed? he asked. The minister did not respond to the questions.

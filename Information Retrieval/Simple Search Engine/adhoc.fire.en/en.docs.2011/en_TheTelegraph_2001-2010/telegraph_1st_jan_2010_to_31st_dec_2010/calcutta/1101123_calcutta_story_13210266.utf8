                      Rebels with a cause                    On April 18, 1930 at around 10 pm, a clutch of young men, most of them still in their teens, challenged the might of the British Empire through a series of raids in Chittagong. Their actions stunned the colonial power and ignited the spark of rebellion throughout Bengal. In Do amp; Die: The Chittagong Uprising 1930-34, perhaps the first book of its kind, journalist Manini Chatterjee of The Telegraph gives a riveting account of the dramatic events that unfolded over three years. Drawing on police records and government files and interviews with revolutionaries, Chatterjee reconstructs the events of that fateful night when six ex-detenus, inspired by the famous Easter Uprising in Dublin (1916), attacked the armouries of the police and the Auxillary Force in Chittagong. What followed were the battles of Jalalabad, the encounter at Dhalghat, the attack at Pahartali and the underground resistance, all led by the mysterious Masterda, Surya Sen, the irrepressible Kalpana Dutt and the brooding, tragic Pritilata Waddedar. This is a story of their zeal and fervour, love and loss. Meticulously researched and skillfully narrated, it is the story of young idealists, heady with patriotism and ready to die for their cause. Most of all, it records an important, yet so far neglected story of the freedom struggle in India. Published by Picador India, the book will be launched this evening.              lEvent: The launch of Manini Chatterjees Do amp; Die: The Chittagong Uprising 1930-34 lWhen: Today at 6.30 pm lWhere: Starmark, South City Mall

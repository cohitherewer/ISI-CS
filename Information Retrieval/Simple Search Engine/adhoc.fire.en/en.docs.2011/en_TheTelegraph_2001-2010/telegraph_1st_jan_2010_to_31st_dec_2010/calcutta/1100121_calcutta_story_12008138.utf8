	From scooters to sports utility vehicles, The Telegraph Auto Weekend Carnival Infocom 09-10 has lined up hot wheels to suit every pocket.         
	The auto show, which started on Wednesday, will continue till Saturday on the Salt Lake stadium grounds (11am to 8pm), presenting Infocom delegates and visitors the opportunity to touch, feel, drive and book the latest models. There is also an SBI auto loan kiosk to offer financing options.         
	Mahindra and Mahindra is showcasing Xylo, a seven-seater multi-purpose vehicle priced between Rs 8.5 lakh and Rs 8.75 lakh, in the carnival hangar.         
	Last year we participated in the auto carnival at Infocom and received 30 enquiries daily. We hope to receive as many enquiries this year and make a few bookings, said Subir Kumar Bhadury, the regional manager (east) of the company.         
	Fiat has arrived with its newest hatchback, Punto, and its sedan, Linea. Last year we only had the Palio at the auto carnival and there was a good number of enquiries. This year, we have two new and exciting products. We hope to have a fruitful weekend, said Manish Agarwal, the regional manager of Fiat.         
	Giving the Punto competition are Hyundais i10 and i20. We had launched the i20 in last years carnival and there were three spot bookings for i10. We are hoping for similar action this year too, said an employee of Spring Hyundai, the dealership of the company.        
	Fiats joint venture partner Tata Motors is showcasing the Manza and the Grande Mark II, its Sports Utility Vehicle that has received a facelift.         
	Toyota, the most premium brand at the carnival, is showcasing the Altis and the Innova.        
	More than spot bookings, the companies look for brand building by interacting with target buyers from the IT sector, said representatives.        
	The choices on two wheels range from the 90cc Scootie Pep to the Apache RTR 180.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state government has drawn up a Rs 6-crore renovation plan for the Salt Lake stadium, sports minister Kanti Ganguly said on Tuesday.         
	The work, to be executed by the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners, is slated to start on the Bengali New Years day (April 15) and is expected to be completed by the year-end.        
	Both the inside and outside of the stadium will be renovated, including the galleries, the crumbling ramps and toilets. The ground would not be touched.        
	The renovation would take about seven months. All scheduled matches will be held in the stadium during the period, said a senior official of the sports department.         
	The entire sewage system will be relaid so that modern toilets can be built. About Rs 84 lakh will be spent on sewage projects and for reconstructing the toilets, he added.         
	According to the official, electrical fittings of the stadium appeared to be in order. Of course, some portions can be changed, if needed, he said.        
	Since its inauguration in January 1984, Yuba Bharati Krirangan has hosted several important national and international matches.        
	Eden Gardens, the other big stadium in the city, is also being renovated.

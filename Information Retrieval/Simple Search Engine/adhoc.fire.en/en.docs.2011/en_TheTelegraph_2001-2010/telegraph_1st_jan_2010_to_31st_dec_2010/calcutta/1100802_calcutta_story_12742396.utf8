                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Home with helipad at Rs 3.5cr
          SUBHRO SAHA                           Artists impression of the wraparound retail walk alongside The V Service Residency                                  
	A rooftop helipad to welcome your guests, the Rolls Royce of Starwood Grand Spas in your bionic building, an impregnable blast mitigation system  serviced residences coming up in New Town, Rajarhat, are promising Calcutta a new high in luxury living, all for a neat Rs 3.5 crore each.         
	Titled The V Service Residency, the property comprises fully serviced, customised condominiums in the league of the Ascotts and JW Marriott serviced apartments.         
	The serviced apartment tower will rise 142 metres from the ground, but have only 32 floors, housing 96 luxury lairs, Sujit Kanoria, the managing director of Shrishti Hotel Pvt Ltd, the developers, tells Metro. The project is expected to be complete in two years.         
	Concept-designed by Javier Pioz, an expert in bionic architecture, The V units are being sold only by word of mouth to an exclusive club of city residents and NRIs. The realtors are confident of a sell-out by the Puja.         
	This project has created huge interest in the real estate trade as it has taken New Town pricing to a different plane. Compared with the current average pricing of Rs 3,200 (per sq ft) in New Town, The V is selling at Rs 8,100 by dint of its unique product positioning and this has taken the trade by surprise, says Abhijit Das of property consultants Lemongrass Advisors.         
	The V will usher in a new dimension in safe living. Designed by security advisers from Israel and the US, we will have a unique emergency rescue system, along with a fire protection and prevention system, as well as a blast mitigation design, adds Kanoria.         
	The first bionic building in the country, The V will seek the platinum level of LEED (Leadership in Environment Engineering amp; Design) certification, the only residential building in the country to do so, according to Ash Bharj, the director (sales amp; marketing) of Shrishti Hotel.        
	An example of sustainable eco-design, bionic architecture creates spaces that maximise the use of existing natural resources and minimise energy consumption.         
	Our design seeks to mimic the forms of nature and embrace technology, explains Pioz.         
	The luxury Westin hotel next door, being developed by the same group and among the tallest in the sub-continent, an amphitheatre, a kids play zone and pool, a pergola, the health club run by Westin and The Heavenly Spa will be the other standout features at The V. At the City Walk next door, premium international brands will be wrapped around by sidewalk cafes, landscaped plazas and evening entertainment.         
	We foresee The V becoming the most desired landmark in Calcutta when the Westin hotel is operational along with the retail walk because you have just over 90 apartments in the project and this kind of development cannot be replicated easily, Das adds.

	Calcutta police handed over a security dossier to the managers of India and South Africa teams soon after they checked into a city hotel on Thursday evening.         
	The dossier spells out the dos and the donts for the players and other members of the squads for any movement outside the team hotel during their stay in Calcutta, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.        
	An officer of the deputy commissioner rank will oversee security for the teams.         
	A team of senior cops visited Eden Gardens on Thursday to check security arrangements, ahead of the police commissioners final visit before the start of the Test on Sunday. Lalbazar has requested the Cricket Association of Bengal to provide a seat in each block for plainclothesmen.

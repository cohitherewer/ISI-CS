The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traffic-stop rally trailer
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Traffic-stop rally trailer
          RITH BASU                                      
	A clutch of small outfits choked the heart of the city on Wednesday afternoon, providing Calcuttans with a trailer for the traffic horror show that will unfold in Metro Channel in the last week of November.        
	Left Front chairman Biman had on Tuesday announced a series of traffic-stopper rallies on the last seven days of the month.        
	Who are the political parties trying to reach out to by calling such rallies? I, for one, dont connect with such disruptive politics, said an exasperated Sudipto Das, who took an hour to drive down JL Nehru Road from the Exide crossing to Esplanade.        
	I shudder to think what will happen in the last week of the month, muttered the software engineer.        
	As 800 protesters gathered in Metro Channel under the banner of the Party for Democratic Socialism, the western flank of JL Nehru Road became inaccessible to traffic.        
	The flow down the artery was reduced to a trickle as north-bound vehicles had to be squeezed into the flank meant for those heading south, from 1pm to 5pm.        
	To add to the chaos, the West Bengal State Committee of Biri Workers and Employees Federation blocked Rani Rashmoni Avenue in the afternoon.        
	The ripple effect spread to all adjacent thoroughfares, such as SN Banerjee Road, Central Avenue, Esplanade East, Bentinck Street and RN Mukherjee Road.         
	Among the rally victims was 21-year-old Richa Chatterjee, a student of MCom at Calcutta University who missed her class while waiting for vehicles to move at Esplanade for close to an hour.        
	I just got to know that my professor has left, she fumed, sitting in a crowded bus. Why cant they hold these meetings on Sundays?        
	PDS leader Samir Putatunda ruled out Sunday rallies on selfish grounds. We have a limited support base and cant mobilise enough people on weekends.        
	The organisers of Wednesdays rallies said they had police permission but officers at Lalbazar denied the claim.        
	The protesters  who hit the street to highlight as many as 23 issues, including price hike and political violence  saw no wrong in holding weekday traffic to ransom.        
	What can we do? The government allows rallies only on RR Avenue and Metro Channel, said Samir Chatterjee of the Paschim Banga Krishak and Kshetmajur Samiti.

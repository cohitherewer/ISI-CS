The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | THE GRIDLOCK GUIDE
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      THE GRIDLOCK GUIDE
                              
	Mamata Banerjee will hold fort in the heart of Calcutta on Wednesday.        
	On this day, 17 years ago, 13 Youth Congress workers had been killed in police firing during a Writers gherao. Mamata, then the state Youth Congress chief, was at the forefront of that agitation.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief had announced after her civic poll triumph that July 21, martyrs day, would also be celebrated as Victory Day.        
	The train tragedy at Sainthia on Monday has changed that. Martyrs day it is going to be. And the city will suffer.        
	Many schools have declared holidays and many babus would do the same for themselves. The 1pm-3.30pm rally at Esplanade is likely to choke roads across the city from the morning and its ripple effect may run into the evening.        
	For those who have no option but to venture out, Metro lists the likely choke points and draws up a timetable of what roads to avoid when:

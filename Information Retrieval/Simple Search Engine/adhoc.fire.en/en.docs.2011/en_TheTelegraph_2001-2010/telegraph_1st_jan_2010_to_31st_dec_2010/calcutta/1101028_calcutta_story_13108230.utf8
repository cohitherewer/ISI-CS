The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dry run after leak
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dry run after leak
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Large parts of Behala, including mayor Sovan Chatterjees ward, did not receive water on Wednesday evening after a supply pipe from Garden Reach waterworks burst under Taratala Road in the morning.        
	The underground water pipe, 60-inch in diameter, burst near Nature Park on Taratala Road. The pipe carries water to parts of Behala, Garden Reach and the municipalities of Mahestala, Pujali and Budge Budge.        
	Water didnt reach eight wards of Behala on Wednesday evening, said B.K. Maiti, the director-general (water supply) of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	Residents of Parnasree, places off Diamond Harbour Road and areas surrounding Behala police station were denied their quota of 12 million gallon evening water.        
	The supply to the areas in Garden Reach, too, was delayed by 30 minutes to an hour.         
	The mayor visited the spot in the evening. Sources said the actual repair work did not start even on Wednesday evening.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Water and Sanitation Authority (CMWSA), which looks after the Garden Reach waterworks and distribution of water from the plant, kept supplying through the affected pipe even after the leak was reported.        
	We ensured the reservoirs of Mahestala, Pujali and Budge Budge were filled up. Hence water supply to these areas was not affected till the evening, said a CMWSA official. The authorities have promised to repair the leak by Thursday morning.         
	Hopefully, things would be normal by tomorrow, added Maiti.        
	The city has of late suffering frequent disruption in water supply.         
	Over a million households in south Calcutta received less than half their quota of filtered water on September 1 after three pumps at the waterworks broke down. Water supply was also affected in these areas during Puja.        
	nCracker mart rules: Police have issued a directive to all stall owners at Bazi Bazaar, which will start on Thursday at the Sahid Minar ground, to issue receipts with details of the type of firecrackers being sold.        
	The move was prompted by past instances of revellers found exploding illegal crackers they claimed to have bought from Bazi Bazaar.        
	Officials from state pollution control board and the police will conduct sound limit tests on the firecrackers to be sold at the fair.

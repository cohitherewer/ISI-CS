                      Portraits of artists                    Abook that takes the reader on a unique journey, Faces of Indian Art (edited by Ina Puri, published by Art Alive Gallery, New Delhi) offers an insiders view of how the artist works in his own private domain  at work in his studio. Nemai Ghosh, celebrated for his stills of Satyajit Rays films, captures 52 contemporary Indian artists, including Benodebehari Mukherjee, Jamini Roy, Manjit Bawa, Arpita Singh, Ramkinkar Baij and Dhruva Mistry. Chronologically, the volume traverses half a century, giving fascinating and rare vignettes of the names many an art aficionado is able to identify only through their signatures. Ina Puri and eminent art historians and art critics Geeti Sen, Keshav Malik, R. Siva Kumar and Samir Dasgupta share their collections of their own associations, personal/professional, with the reader. The book captures haunting portraits of Somnath Hore in his last days, M.F.

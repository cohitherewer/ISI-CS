The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crunch prompts mortuary plan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Crunch prompts mortuary plan
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	A lack of space for preserving bodies till the final rites, which came into focus following Jyoti Basus death, has prompted the civic authorities to decide on setting up the citys third mortuary.        
	Sources in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said the mortuary could come up at a defunct crematorium in Nonapukur, behind the Mullickbazar burial ground.        
	The two mortuaries in the city, run by private parties, can preserve eight bodies. Peace Haven on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road  where the bodies of Jyoti Basu, Anil Biswas and Subhas Chakraborty were kept  has space for three, while L. Madeira amp; Co. on Bow Street can preserve five.        
	The space in the two mortuaries is far from adequate in a city of 60 lakh people and five medical colleges. We badly need a more spacious mortuary. I have asked the municipal commissioner to prepare a project report. We are looking for a convenient location, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said.        
	Of the three freezers in Peace Haven, only one was empty when Basus body was brought in last Sunday afternoon. Sources said that till Basus body was taken out, a space crunch prompted the mortuary authorities to turn the down the pleas of a few families to preserve bodies.        
	Officials in the CMCs project management unit informed municipal commissioner Arnab Roy on Thursday evening that a project report on setting up a mortuary at the defunct Gas Crematorium in Nonapukur had been lying with them.        
	The crematorium, at 2 Crematorium Street, was set up in 1804. Scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose was cremated there.        
	Civic officials said the crematorium was in a convenient location, accessible from all parts of the city.        
	According to a CMC estimate, at least Rs 5 crore will be required to set up a modern mortuary with adequate parking facilities and space for VIP movement.        
	The civic authorities feel funds would not be a problem in setting up the mortuary, whatever be the location.        
	It can be set up as part of a Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission project, though we prefer a private-public partnership in building and running the mortuary, said joint municipal commissioner Sahidul Islam.         
	Officials said even if an NGO or a private party ran the mortuary, the civic body would retain the right to fix the charge for preserving a body.

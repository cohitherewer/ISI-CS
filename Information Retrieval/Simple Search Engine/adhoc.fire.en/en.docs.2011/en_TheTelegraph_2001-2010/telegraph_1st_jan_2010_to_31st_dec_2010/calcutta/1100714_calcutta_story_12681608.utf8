The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Snags snare slow-mo Metro 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Snags snare slow-mo Metro 
          SANJAY MANDAL                                            
	Metro Railway has gone from rush-hour lifeline to laggard, averaging a five-minute delay for every train over the past month to spoil a 25-year track record for punctuality.        
	This used to be the only thing in our city to function like clockwork. Some commuters would adjust their watches with the station clock. What have they done to our Metro? rued Chandrasekhar Ghoshal, a student of journalism and mass communication at Calcutta University who travels from Netaji (Kudghat) to Central station and back every day.         
	Santanu Banerjee of Dum Dum, who works in a private firm on Park Street, has started taking an earlier train than the one he used to board in the morning to avoid being late for work. A delay is now the norm rather than the exception, he complained.        
	Deep Banerjee, a PR professional who had to wait over half an hour for a train a few days ago, said he was more worried about the callousness of the Metro Railway authorities than the regular snags that had slowed it down.        
	I was waiting to board a Dum Dum-bound train from Maidan station and it came 50 minutes late. The galling thing was that there was no announcement, he complained.        
	Frequent breakdowns, red tape in procuring spares for the old rakes, increased passenger pressure and the delay in rolling out new trains are the reasons being cited for the citys transport lifeline losing its edge.         
	A rake malfunctions, a train is cancelled and the entire schedule is thrown haywire. Our ageing fleet cant cope with the pressure anymore, admitted a senior official.        
	So why arent the defective rakes being repaired and the new ones being rolled out?        
	Integral Coach Factory was to have supplied spares for a damaged rake that had to be pulled out of service in May. The factory kept us waiting for weeks before declining to supply the spares, saying it was busy manufacturing the air-conditioned coaches that we were supposed to receive last year, said the official.        
	A private manufacturer has since agreed to supply the spares after an inspection. That means another month before the damaged rake can be brought back into service, said an engineer.         
	Metro Railway, which started operations in 1984, ferries more than six lakh passengers every day with a fleet of 18 rakes, one of which is out of service and two are on stand-by. Most of these rakes are over two decades old.         
	According to motormen, the diminishing brake power of some of these old rakes was one of the reasons for trains running behind schedule every day.         
	We are forced to activate the brakes well before the train enters a station and that costs us a few minutes along the route. Malfunctioning doors also add to the delay, said a member of the motormens association.        
	Faulty schedules are also being blamed for the train delays.         
	The schedules have been drawn up calculating the running time of 40 minutes from Dum Dum to Garia Bazar. However, the journey takes at least 42 minutes, not counting the delays caused by infrastructure problems, said a train driver.         
	We have pointed this out to the authorities, who have promised to modify the schedules once the southern extension till New Garia station becomes operational, he said.        
	Metro Railway fears a massive traffic overload in the run-up to Puja if it opens the Kavi Nazrul-New Garia stretch without extra rakes arriving from the Perambur factory.

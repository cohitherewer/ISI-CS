The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Grotesque gold on white landmark
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Grotesque gold on white landmark

	Metropolitan Building is being defaced. Not by political graffiti, but by paint. The pristine white landmark in the heart of the city is suddenly breaking out into gross golden spots. Why? Metro peels off the paint        
	What is Metropolitan Building? A century-old building, one of the most visible on Chowringhee adjacent to Metro cinema. It once housed the biggest department store named Whiteaways (Whiteaway Laidlaw amp; Co). It now houses Big Bazaar. It belongs to the Life Insurance Corporation of India and was declared a heritage building by the heritage conservation committee of the CMC to safeguard it from demolition.        
	What condition is it in now? A few years ago the building had been repaired. But not before its Italian marble floors had been removed and its wealth of stained glass destroyed. Now, parts of its structure have become quite unstable, its plaster is flaking off and it has become patchy. Why? The repair work was not done scientifically, in accordance with conservation norms. Appropriate material was not used.        
	Why is it changing its spots? Suddenly, Metropolitan Building is being repainted. Without structural repairs that are urgently needed. And to grotesque effect. The building has always been a pristine white. Now it is being capped with gold  on its cupolas, the procession of urns on the terrace and the acanthus on top of each Corinthian column.        
	Cant the heritage conservation committee of the CMC stop this? Not really, because no structural change has been made. There is no law against the owners turning a beautiful building ugly. But in the West, the colours of old buildings cannot be changed arbitrarily, particularly in a heritage zone. Public consensus is a must.        
	What does the mayor, who heads the committee, have to say? When Metro called mayor Sovan Chatterjee on Monday, he was at a loss. Which is the Metropolitan Building, he demanded. On being told which one it was, he responded that as the golden look is not creating environmental pollution and no one has complained about it being visual pollution, the committee cannot take it up.        
	What about Calcuttas aesthetics? Ganesh Pyne was aghast at Metropolitan Building being imparted a golden glow. We have no convention of painting the exterior of such a building in gold. People will rubbish it, said the artist.

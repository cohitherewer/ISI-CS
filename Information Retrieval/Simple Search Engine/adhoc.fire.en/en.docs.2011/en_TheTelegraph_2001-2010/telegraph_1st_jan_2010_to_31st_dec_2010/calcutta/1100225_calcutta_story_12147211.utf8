	Apropos of the report Classes shut for CPM lectures, dated December 5, it is shameful for a democratic country that the SFI students union suspended all classes at Keshab Chandra College to hold a CPM local committee meeting on the premises.           
	The principal of the college, a Left appointee, was compelled to bow down to the ruling partys diktat and suspend classes for fear of losing his job.           
	How long will the people of Bengal endure such oppression by the ruling party? Numerous such incidents have been reported in Metro over the years.           
	Student unions are thought of as the future builders of the nation. But all that these youth bodies do is resort to violence and vitiate the educational atmosphere in the state. No word is enough to condemn the incident at Keshab Chandra College.           
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would be well advised to acknowledge the failure of the CPM government in West Bengal as the law and order in the state has been deteriorating by the day. The situation is beyond the chief ministers control now as no one obeys him.

	Apropos King guns for Idiots crown, February 11, I feel 3 Idiots is one of the best films I have ever seen. And no film can even think of matching up to the success it has achieved, at least in the near future. However, I wonder why the controversies relating to My Name Is Khan (MNIK) are getting a place in the first page of a newspaper of the stature of The Telegraph. I wish 3 Idiots more success. Aal izz well!             
	Subhankar, Moulali                     
	Who will be proved the best Idiot, er, the best actor among the Khans? For me it has to be Aamir Khan. His roles are very different and one can comprehend the development of this actor in every successive film. After all, who can play a fresher at the age of 44, reminiscent of his Dil days?           
	Shah Rukh Khan belongs to a different genre. A lead role can be played in diverse ways, which Aamir reveals in his films. But King Khan prefers to play stereotypical, trite roles. SRKs latest, MNIK, generated hype through controversies and Shiv Sena protests even before its release. However, the film is doing well because it brings back the Shah Rukh Khan-Kajol jodi after a very long time. MNIK is not 3 Idiots  let the film be seen and admired in its own right and worth.           
	Amrita Mallik, Salt Lake                     
	Taare Zameen Par trounced Om Shanti Om, Ghajini did the same to Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi! And, now its time for 3 Idiots to shake the base of MNIK! People are bored of seeing the age-old KJo-type romances, which was not at all present in 3 Idiots. I dont think MNIK will beat 3 Idiots.           
	Urmish, Address not mentioned                     
	However hard we try, there is no point of comparison between MNIK and a certain 3 Idiots. Other than Aamirs star power and an able director captaining the ship, the major reason behind the success of 3 Idiots was its story line, replete with filmy twists and turns, carefully picked from a novel and intelligently modified by the makers of the film. On the other hand, MNIK has a fair share of social message about a global issue. But if we choose to compare, with the biggest release ever of an Indian film, including over 550 prints overseas, MNIK reiterated who the King was even before the release of the film! SRK and Kajols on-screen histrionics will help MNIK deliver and how!           
	Rajarshi Moitra, Address not mentioned                     
	Please dont draw comparisons between these two superstars. Both are excellent in their work and we, the fans, salute them. The plots of 3 Idiots amp; MNIK are based on different subjects. I hope SRKs next big thing will do well.           
	Aal izz well....           
	Shuvadep Sen, Address not mentioned                     
	No, MNIK cant do better than 3 Idiots. Anyone can easily see that Aamirs 3 Idiots, Ghajini, Rang De Basanti or Fanaa are superhit movies and undoubtedly Aamir is much better than Shah Rukh.           
	Rohit, Address not mentioned                     
	To answer the question Will My Name Is Khan do better than 3 Idiots?, February 11, my answer is: No. MNIK will not be comparable to 3 Idiots because Indians are not, well, idiots.           
	Shah Rukh endorses products that he himself never buys. He is never seen driving a Santro or writing with a Linc pen. He professes love for everything Pakistani but does not pick any Pakistani cricketer for his team in IPL 3.           
	Cocktails do not suit everyone. We do not know whether SRK, mixing his IPL team-owner identity to advance his actor image, can pull it off for long. But his intention is obvious. A film called My Name Is Khan with the tagline every Khan is not a terrorist is bound to ignite the imagination of our western neighbour, and SRK is keen and tactical to tap that market by playing to the gallery.           
	Tapan Pal, Batanagar                               
	Apropos Doctor faces bandh brawn, December 1, it was heartening to read how Satyabrata Roy, a gynaecologist at RG Kar hospital, defied a bandh call and even attacks by bandh enforcers to attend to a seriously ill patient. When the condition of healthcare at most state-run hospitals is appalling, the brave example set by Roy should serve as a beacon to other physicians.             
	Prahlad Agarwala, Majdia, Nadia                               
	Frequent violence on campuses has become a matter of great concern for educational institutions and the state administration. The violent incidents that took place in different colleges in connection with student union elections were deplorable. The demand for a uniform poll code for all campuses is therefore justified (Cry for one poll code on campus, December 23). But is there any guarantee that a uniform poll code will restore peace on campus permanently? Strict police arrangement is necessary on the dates of filing of nomination and holding of polls.             
	The students should take an oath to maintain harmony on campus. Regular sessions should be held to make students aware about the code of conduct during polls.           
	D. Mukherjee, Behala                               
	Apropos Auto driver punches woman passenger, (December 17), women facing misbehaviour, molestation, abuse and assault have become a daily affair in the city. But it shocked me to read that a 35 year-old woman was slapped and abused by an auto driver in front of a number of people. This incident highlights the rule of rogues on Calcutta streets and proves that the conception of Bengal as a safe state for women is a myth.             
	Atif Ayaz, Serampore, Hooghly                               
	Apropos Price bar lowered, the young browse amp; buy art for love, (December 1), it is a commendable initiative of CIMA art gallery, which created a great opportunity for art lovers, especially for those who have wanted to buy a piece of art for long but could never afford it. It was also good to know that the art mela attracted the youth.             
	Sourish Misra, Salt Lake                               
	The condition of the residents of KK Tagore Street, who have been living with an overflowing garbage vat in their midst for more than 40 years, is painful (Grazing spot for cattle, December 8). How can these residents maintain good health and be free from mosquitoes? The civic bodys lorry that collects the garbage at 11am daily (except Sundays) blocks the road, slowing down traffic. The lorry should clear the waste early in the morning. Arrangements need to be made for garbage collection on Sundays too.             
	I would also like to point out that the Sri Vaikunth Nath Devasthan temple situated nearby attracts many devotees, including tourists, who must be getting a pathetic impression about the city after seeing the dirty roads.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee, Behala                               
	Apropos of Writers work as left rallies November 17, till recently, whenever the CPM organised a rally, a half day unofficial leave was granted to the army of babus to attend the michhil. However, it appears that the babus have realised that a change of guard is imminent. That is why they remained in their seats during the Left rally. However, how much work was done during that time is anybodys guess. In the last three decades of misrule in Bengal, work culture, responsibility, etc, have become extinct in state government offices.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      After-party crash kills two
          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	A young BPO employee on a late-night trip out of town to celebrate his promotion died along with one of his friends in a car accident on Delhi Road that was allegedly triggered by drink driving.         
	Sunny Roy Chowdhury, a 19-year-old employee of Wipro BPO who was simultaneously doing his BCom from Dinabandhu Andrews College, was returning to the city with three friends in a hired Tata Sumo early on Thursday when the vehicle hit a divider on the NH 2 at Bally and rammed into a stationary trailer.         
	Sunny and his friend Binod Raut, 22, died on the spot while two others  Amarjit Chowdhury, 28, and Deep, 21  were critically injured in the accident, which occurred around 6.30am. The driver of the Sumo, Prabhakar Bharati, 24, and his brother Dibakar, 20, were also injured but are said to be out of danger.         
	Police said Prabhakar may have been driving the Sumo after drinking through the night at the roadside eatery where the group had partied.         
	 A preliminary investigation suggests that the driver of the hired Tata Sumo was drinking along with the boys, S.K. Jain, the additional superintendent of police (town), Howrah, told Metro.        
	The cops will start a case of drink driving  along with rash and negligent driving  against the driver if his blood report confirms more than the permissible limit of alcohol.        
	According to Sreebhumi resident Sunnys family, the BPO employee didnt plan the party but agreed to go out when his friends came calling on Wednesday evening to coax him into giving them a treat. Sunnys friends came over around 7.30pm and he left with them soon after, telling his mother that he would return the next morning. The police called at 8am (on Thursday) to inform us about the accident, said uncle Kalidas Kundu.        
	Sunnys father Sandip, a trader, left for Bally Hospital immediately along with members of a local club at Sreebhumi, off VIP Road.        
	At victim Binods Raja Dinendra Street home, mother Sudhama rued not being able to stop her son from stepping out at night. His friend Amarjit came to our flat around 10pm and asked him to accompany him. I had put my foot down saying that I wouldnt let him drive so late at night. They assured me someone else would drive and promised to return by morning. But that was not to be, she cried.        
	Binod and Amarjit lived close to each other on Raja Dinendra Street, while Deep is a resident of EA Block in Salt Lake. The driver and his brother live on Keshab Chandra Street in central Calcutta.         
	Sheshnath Jadav, who witnessed the accident, said the Sumo was speeding. I was unloading sand from a lorry when I saw the accident occur barely 20 metres away. I heard the clang of metal and turned to see the vehicle hit a road divider and dash the trailer, he added.

                      Many shades of life        A show that brings together emerging and senior artists from   India and across the world, Colours, the ongoing group show,   is a joyous celebration of the myriad shades and hues of life. Each   work imposes its own logic, revealing infinite variations and muta  tions as found in nature. Senior artist Anita Roy Chowdhurys   works represent the voice of mother Nature. Her works portray   human figures, nude or draped in different postures, plant and ani  mal forms, elements of landscape and still life. London-based Drip  ta G. Roy has presented his new media giclee and paint work on   canvas, titled Expression. Sublimity of figurative expression and a   contemporary ba-ckground design have merged to arouse a dream  like feeling in his work. Manas Roy, a master painter of the Nether  lands and In-dia, has presented two of his Mediterranean style,   human symphony visuals, The Pianist and Prelude of Music, with   oil on canvas in museum quality. Both paintings are dominated by   a sense of flamboyance in colour selection similar to the south Eu  ropean style. An unusual combination of cadmium, cobalt blue and   turquoise green has made the paintings lively and energetic. In his   depiction of abstract-expressionist works done in acrylic on can  vas, Subhendu Sarkar has come up with a different rhetoric. His   works explore the contrast between two kinds of private pursuits.   Prabir Sens rhythmic compositions are eloquent and expressive. He attempts to set up a dialogue between our obsessions   and private associations. Krishnendu Chaki is a consummate practitioner. His art has cosmopolitan roots. At a universal   level, his work is marked by holistic visions of the co-existence of nature and humanity. Curated by Reshmi Chatterjee.

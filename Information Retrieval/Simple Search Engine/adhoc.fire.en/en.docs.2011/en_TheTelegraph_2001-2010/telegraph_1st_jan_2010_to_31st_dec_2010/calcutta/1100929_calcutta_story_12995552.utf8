          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Calcutta will be the first stop in the Archbishop of Canterburys two-week mission of goodwill in India.        
	Rowan Williams, the principal leader of the Church of England and the highest ranking non-royal in the UK, will spend October 9, 10 and 11 in the city before heading for Ranchi.        
	He will fly back to Calcutta on October 13 and spend time in Serampore before travelling to Patna, Nagpur and Delhi, where the Church of North India will celebrate its 40th anniversary.        
	It has been 24 years since the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, visited Calcutta. We are privileged that Rowan Williams has accepted the invitation by the Church of North India, said Ashok Biswas, the bishop of Calcutta.        
	The archbishop has expressed a keen desire to visit Calcutta, as the city had a rich Anglican connection and used to be the seat of Metropolitan (a centre directly under the archbishop) before 1970. But we will not be able to show him around during Puja (which starts on October 14), he added.        
	The archbishop will put up at The Oberoi Grand in Calcutta. The chief minister, the mayor and other dignitaries have been invited to a reception planned for him on October 10 evening.         
	The archbishop will visit south India after the north Indian leg of the trip.

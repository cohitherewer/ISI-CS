The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A prized partnership at Eden
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A prized partnership at Eden
  - When Ray looked back with love at his first days in the cricket stadium and the Xaviers classroom        JAYANTA BASU                          Siddhartha Shankar Ray in the VIP box of Eden Gardens on February 17, watching the India-South Africa Test                                        
	The 6ft-plus ramrod straight 90-year-old, dressed more for the boardroom than a Test match, trudged down the steps of the VIP box in Eden Gardens. It was around 11am on February 17.        
	Is India going to slip in the rankings if they lose this Test to South Africa? boomed the voice of Siddhartha Shankar Ray.        
	I realised the question was addressed to me (perhaps because the others seated in the box seemed least interested in the action in the middle), even before he had settled into his seat.        
	Then, almost apologetically, he added, Amar ektu deri hoye gyalo (I am a little late).        
	United by the bond of bat and ball, we started off with singles and twos. But soon, the veteran cricket lover was dealing in boundaries.        
	Find another 90-year-old in the ground I have seen all Tests played at Eden. Once Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, the then President, came to Calcutta while a Test was on. I was chief minister and he requested me to accompany him to Delhi. I said no way, not while a Test was on at the Eden!        
	What was his first Test at Eden? January 1934. The teenaged Ray had then gaped at Douglas Jardine hooking Muhammad Nissar. An image that was still crystal clear in the nonagerians mind.        
	At that time the batsmen used to play so straight, rued Ray, clearly not a fan of the ever-shortening forms of the game.        
	So, who were his favourite Indian batsmen through the years? In the modern era Gavaskar, Tendulkar and Sourav stand out.... Sourav should not have retired. He had a lot of cricket left in him and I recently told him that, said the legal eagle-turned-politician who had once partnered Sourav Ganguly in a court battle against his suspension by the ICC.        
	By the end of the day  Ray left around 2pm after rain had curtailed the match post-lunch  two cricket lovers, separated by several decades, had become partners at the crease enough to exchange mobile numbers.        
	The day the story of Ray, the cricket lover, appeared in Metro, I got a call around noon. Apnar lekhata dekhlam, bhalo likhechhen aami ja bolechhi tai likhechhen (I have seen the report, its well-written you have written what I said), boomed the voice. And then, Ekdin barite ashun (Come home one day).        
	Within a week, I found myself next to his armchair on the first-floor verandah of his Bakulbagan Road house, sipping on ice tea.        
	We picked up from where we had left off at the Eden. Ray spoke about his days as a college cricketer.        
	Would you like to see the news clippings about my performancesI have kept everything, he brimmed over with enthusiasm.        
	As minutes rolled into hours, the chat turned to his chief ministership, and the Naxalite movement, Mamata and more.        
	The way the Naxalite movement was countered by the police in the 70s was the requirement of the time. The Naxalite movement was within a limited boundary and hence easier to control through police operations, but the current Maoist movement has spread over a vast and difficult terrain and hence is difficult to contain through an armed operation. We need to start a development process through credible NGOs as the people of the Maoist-infested districts (West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia) have lost faith in the state government, said Ray.        
	All political parties should stay out of the process, he stressed, adding that he had written to home minister P. Chidambaram with this prescription.        
	So, after 33 years, was Bengal finally on brink of change?         
	If Mamata does not make any major mistake, she will be in power. Her integrity cannot be questioned. Her anti-Left stance also cannot be questioned.        
	Some four weeks back, my mobile rang and that booming voice began rattling off some personal medical details.         
	I realised that Ray was trying to call his doctor, my namesake, and had dialled the wrong number.         
	When I pointed that out, he immediately said: Oho, I made a mistake Come home one day, we will talk.        
	That was not to be.              Maya Ray bids adieu to her   husband at their Beltala house   Siddhartha Shankar Ray rsquo;s body being carried to Calcutta High Court              The hearse carrying the former chief minister rsquo;s body at the CAB office  Mamata Banerjee during the gun salute to Ray at the Keoratala crematorium      
	Where was Ray rsquo;s body taken  The Assembly  Calcutta High Court  Cricket Association of Bengal office at Eden Gardens  Chittaranjan Seva Sadan at Hazra  
	Where Ray rsquo;s body was not taken  Writers rsquo; Buildings, from where he had governed Bengal for five years  Congress headquarters at Bidhan Bhavan  Congress rsquo;s previous office at Hazi Mohammed Mohsin Square
        
	Conspicuous by absence    State Congress chief Manas Bhuniya at Keoratala burning ghat  Mamata Banerjee at the Assembly  Pranab Mukherjee at the funeral   
	Presence that mattered  Mamata Banerjee, who controlled proceedings for the better part of the day   Left Front chairperson Biman Bose at Ray rsquo;s Beltala home  Other Left Front leaders, like Forward Bloc state secretary Asok Ghosh, at Beltala  Former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee at Beltala

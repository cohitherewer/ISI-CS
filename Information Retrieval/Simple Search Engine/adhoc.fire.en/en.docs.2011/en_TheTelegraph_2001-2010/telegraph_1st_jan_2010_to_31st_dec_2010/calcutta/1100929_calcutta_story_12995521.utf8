                      Splendours of tribal culture                    Dance forms in West Bengal draw mainly from folk traditions, specially those of the tribal groups. Full of exuberance, energy and culture, these tribal dances are a heartwarming amalgamation of grace and poise. They have moved on from being just an expression of folk culture to being an important part of its history. Hosted by West Bengal Tribal Development Co-operative Corporation Limited (TDCC), the two-day Adivasi Sanskriti Utsav promises to be a colourful event showcasing the sheer beauty, elegance and splendour of folk and tribal culture. The participants in the festival have been selected from among 2,500 artistes who took part in the TDCC-organised district level competition that was held over the last three months. The 22 winning teams (comprising 350 plus members), representing various districts, will feature in this first-ever tribal festival in the city.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic body nod to property tax reform
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Civic body nod to property tax reform
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                          
	The Trinamul Congress board at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is set to introduce area-wise property tax, as advocated by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).         
	The board had said no to tax on filtered water, a condition set by the funding agencies while granting loan to the city civic body.        
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee had last week intimated the municipal affairs department of the decision to introduce area-wise property tax.        
	We have decided to replace the existing rent-based property tax assessment method with a more scientific and transparent unit area method. The final notification is expected this week, said mayor Sovan Chatterjee.        
	Under the notional rent system, the annual valuation of a property is the rent its owner could earn if it was let out. The tax on the property is a percentage of this amount.        
	Since there is no objective way of determining the notional rent, property owners are at the mercy of dishonest inspectors.        
	The unit area assessment divides the 187sq km area of the city, covering 141 wards, into 262 blocks. These will come under seven tax zones  A to G.        
	The highest property tax (Rs 4-5 per sq ft) will be in zone A, which includes the central business district and Park Street) and the lowest (Rs 1.4 per sq ft) in zone G, including Metiabruz, some parts of Behala, the eastern fringes of the city and areas dominated by hutments.        
	Once the unit area assessment is enforced, the owner of a 1,000sq ft residential unit in Park Street will have to pay Rs 5,000 as annual property tax. The corresponding figures in Ballygunge Place, Jadavpur and Topsia will be Rs 4,000, Rs 1,600 and Rs 2,500 respectively.        
	I hope that a good number of middle-class house owners in the city proper benefit because of the introduction of the new system, said Chatterjee.        
	The unit area assessment was finalised by the previous Left Front board in the CMC.        
	Welcoming the new boards decision, former mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: It is a good sign. The objective of reforms should not be lost in the ideological conflict of politics.        
	When the CMC had approached the ADB in the mid-1990s for a Rs 1,245 crore loan (the amount was revised to Rs 1,800), the international funding agency had called for collection of user charges on filtered water or water tax and property tax reforms.        
	The civic authorities had been granted the loan in 2001 after it signed the loan covenant. The CMC has been implementing the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP) with financial assistance from the ADB.        
	The World Bank had imposed similar conditions while sanctioning loan to pursue infrastructure development schemes under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM).        
	Ahmedabad, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bangalore have already introduced the unit area assessment system.

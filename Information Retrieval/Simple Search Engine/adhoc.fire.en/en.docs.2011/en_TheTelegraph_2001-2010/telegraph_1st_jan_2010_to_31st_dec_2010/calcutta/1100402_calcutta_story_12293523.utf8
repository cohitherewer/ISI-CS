                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dog delays fliers 9 hours

	A stray dog on a Mumbai runway forced passengers on a Wednesday evening flight from Calcutta to spend the night on the plane in Ahmedabad.         
	The Kingfisher flight which was diverted to the Gujarat city finally landed in Mumbai on Thursday morning, nearly nine hours after it had taken off. Flights between Calcutta and Mumbai usually take two hours.        
	Airline officials said passengers had to spend the night on the plane because of inadequate facilities at Ahmedabad airport.         
	The flight, IT 514, had taken off from Calcutta airport with around 90 people on board at 8.25pm and reached Mumbai around 11pm.        
	The flight could not land in Mumbai on Wednesday night because of heavy congestion at the airport and had to be diverted to Ahmedabad, was the official line from the airline.         
	Shabat, one of the passengers, however, said: The flight circled over Mumbai airport for 45 minutes. The pilot first announced that there was severe congestion on the runway. Later he announced that there was a dog on the runway and so the flight would be diverted to Ahmedabad.        
	The flight landed at Ahmedabad around 12.45am. It could not take off immediately because of the flight duty time limitation of one of the pilots.        
	A crew member could not fly because of his flight duty time limitation. So we had to get another crew member, said a Kingfisher official.        
	The airline informed us that we would have to spend the night on the plane. The air-conditioning did not work while the flight was on the ground. It was very hot and humid although we kept the doors open, said Shabat.        
	We asked for food and water but airline officials said the stock was exhausted. Early on Thursday, they brought some snacks for us. Some passengers were irritated and got into arguments with staff members, said another passenger. The plane was parked in a deserted bay and it was pitch dark outside. We were scared and none of us could sleep, she added.         
	Sandwiches and beverages were served to passengers at night. But they had to remain in the aircraft as Ahmedabad airport is not equipped to host so many passengers in the terminal, said an airline official.        
	The new pilot arrived at the airport around 3.15am and underwent mandatory medical checks. The flight left Ahmedabad around 4am and landed in Mumbai at 5am. Even after we returned to Mumbai, the flight had to wait 15 minutes to land, said a passenger.According to airline officials, flights are often forced to hover over Mumbai airport, wasting costly aviation turbine fuel, because of runway congestion.         
	The problem of congestion is mainly restricted to Mumbai and Delhi airports. There is too much traffic at both these airports. The authorities should look to upgrade equipment, ground support system and operational system, said a senior pilot of Jet Airways.

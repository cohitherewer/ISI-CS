The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Majority muscle in bill battle 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Majority muscle in bill battle

	Team Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is banking on the sheer force of numbers to push through the Presidency university bill in the face of the first-ever ceasework by teachers of the institution and a united Opposition campaign to review the autonomy initiative.        
	If the bill is put to vote in the Assembly on Friday, the Left Front with 232 MLAs in a House of 294 could bulldoze the Opposition  Mamata Banerjees party and the Congress have a combined strength of 57  by the required majority and more.         
	Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjee, the leader of the Opposition, admitted that the only option was to protest, though he wouldnt say whether that meant the stage was set for a sequel to the riotous scenes in Parliament over the womens reservation bill.        
	This move to push through the Presidency University Bill, 2009, hurriedly by sheer force of majority reveals the mindset of the government. It wants to trample the Opposition in the House and the academicians outside who have raised questions about the bill, Chatterjee added.         
	Resistance has also come from within, with the CPM-backed Government College Teachers Association announcing on Thursday that nearly 1,300 teachers of 36 government-run colleges, including Presidency, would cease work on Friday to protest the planned passage of the bill in its present form.         
	This is the first time in the 193-year history of Presidency that a section of teachers of the institution will be boycotting classes to join a protest. Sources said they would march to the Assembly to submit a memorandum to Speaker Hasim Abdul Halim, seeking the status of an affiliating university for Presidency rather than a unitary one.         
	A CPM leader said the party wasnt worried about the protest.        
	Earlier in the day, Speaker Halim informed the Opposition during a meeting of the business advisory committee that higher education minister Sudarshan Roy Choudhury intended placing the bill for discussion on Friday. Halim told the Opposition leaders that sending the bill to the select committee was the ministers prerogative and that he had decided against it.         
	The governments resolve in getting the bill passed on Friday itself was apparent with CPM leaders revealing that the party had issued a whip asking every MLA who is in town to be present in the Assembly during the debate. It has been done to ensure the passage of the bill. Some of our MLAs are presently attending the Citu national conference in Chandigarh, and we dont want to take a chance, said a CPM legislator from North 24-Parganas.         
	Although the government seems ready with a strategy to get the bill passed on Friday, there is every chance of Opposition MLAs stalling the process using Bhattacharjees comments about the Congress and his remarks about Chatterjees credentials as an orator during Thursdays proceedings as an excuse. It seems the chief minister tried provoking the Opposition into boycotting the House on Friday so that the bill can be passed smoothly. But we wont boycott the House, said a Trinamul leader.        
	He said the final strategy would be drawn up after consulting Mamata and the state Congress leadership. Opposition leaders have also decided to meet governor M.K. Narayanan to delay the bill.

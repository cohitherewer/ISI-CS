The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flat residents flee flames
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Flat residents flee flames
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Pearly Mitra was taking a bath in her first-floor flat in the P amp;T colony on Ultadanga Main Road on Tuesday when what sounded like a bomb exploded nearby. She rushed to the balcony, only to find herself facing a wall of dark smoke.        
	The wall soon parted to reveal flames reaching for the sky: the slum the 23-year-old engineering student had seen since childhood was ablaze.         
	The flames were almost licking our building. I knew we had to get out of the flat before it too caught fire, said Pearly, who ran outside with whatever she could grab from her home.         
	Her neighbours in the compound and the Reserve Bank of India quarters  only a 3m- wide road separates the estates from the slum  were doing the same.        
	We moved the LPG cylinders from the flats because the kitchens face the slum, said Sharmila Mukherjee, a resident of the colony.         
	More than 80 families gathered on the grounds outside the flats and prayed that the flames did not engulf their homes. As hours passed, more and more slum dwellers took refuge there.        
	We continuously sprayed water on the walls of the adjacent buildings so that they did not catch fire, said divisional fire officer Bibhash Guha.

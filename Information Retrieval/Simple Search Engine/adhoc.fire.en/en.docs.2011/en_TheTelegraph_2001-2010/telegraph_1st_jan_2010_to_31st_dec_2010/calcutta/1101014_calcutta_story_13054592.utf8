                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Glitches derail Metro on   Mahasashthi
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A compressor pipe in the braking system of a Metro Railway rake came apart around 11am on Sashthi, stalling trains for 15 minutes. A series of glitches disrupted services for the rest of the day, too.        
	In a near-rerun of Tuesdays nightmare, a south-bound train got stalled at Shyambazar around 4pm and plunged into darkness. But much to the passengers relief, the train started moving after a couple of minutes.        
	Metro officials, however, denied knowledge of any problem at Shyambazar.        
	On Tuesday, a packed train got stranded for 35 minutes before the panicked passengers, many of whom were gasping for breath, were made to walk through the tunnel to reach Sovabazar-Sutanuti station.        
	A mob later damaged ticket counters, CCTV cameras, turnstiles and weighing machines at the station.        
	At 11.01am on Wednesday, a Dum Dum-bound train got stalled at Tollygunge after the compressor pipe between two coaches came apart.        
	The train was stranded for 15 minutes, till the compressor was refitted, disrupting services on the north-bound track. The New Garia-bound trains ran normally during the period, said an official.        
	For hours later, the services remained uncertain as the doors of the packed coaches closed after several attempts.        
	The display boards at Sovabazar-Sutanuti went on a blink when I boarded a train around 1pm. A Metro official at the station told me the boards had been switched off as trains were not running according to the schedule, said Arvind Prasad, an insurance adviser.        
	Trains, supposed to run at eight-minute intervals, were 20 minutes late on Sashthi evening.        
	At Writers Buildings, the chief minister said the police commissioner had talked to the Metro authorities about the ransacking of Sovabazar-Sutanuti station. Home secretary G.D. Gautama ruled out increasing the number of cops at the Metro stations.        
	nRawla case: The principal of La Martiniere for Boys and three other teachers, who were arrested on October 4 in connection with the suicide of a student and granted bail hours later, attended the metropolitan magistrates court on Wednesday. The 12th metropolitan magistrate, Apurba Ghosh, declared that the trial would start on November 19 and asked the principal and the teachers to attend court on the days proceedings would be held.        
	Rouvanjit Rawla, a Class VIII student, committed suicide on February 12, four days after being caned by principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi. The principal has been charged under IPC Section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and the rest under the Juvenile Justice Act 23 (related to torture of a child by the custodian of the place/institution where he or she has been staying).        
	nArrest: The special task force of the city police on Wednesday arrested Kishore Pandey, wanted in more than three dozen murder cases and several cases of extortion in Jharkhand. The cops picked him up, along with his alleged associate Bijoy Kumar Singh, from a hideout on Nalini Seth Road in Posta. A revolver was found on him.        
	nAirline offer: Air India will offer Puja Bhoj to the passengers on all its flights from the city during the Puja. An Air India official said Bong Connection had been launched to reposition its brand.

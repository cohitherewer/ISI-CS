  - New Town resident off radar on highway; ATM gang in net          OUR BUREAU                          Shouvik Bhadra: the New Town resident was visiting his family                                        
	A 32-year-old Sector V techie has been reported missing since he left town for his parents house in Durgapur on his motorcycle on Thursday evening.        
	Shouvik Bhadra, employed with Nokia Siemens Networks, last called a family member around 9.15pm to say that he was buying langchas at Shaktigarh on the Durgapur Expressway and would be reaching home soon.        
	Shouvik is a resident of Greenfield Housing Complex in New Town. He would travel to Durgapur every weekend to meet his parents and wife.        
	When Shouvik did not reach his parents house in Durgapurs Bidhannagar locality till midnight, his father Srikumar Bhadra dialled his number but found the cellphone switched off, police said.        
	Srikumar then contacted a colleague of his son, who informed the companys Burdwan office that he was missing, said Arup Sarkar, the officer-in-charge of Shaktigarh police outpost.         
	According to Sarkar, a representative of the company reached the Bhadra home at 3am and accompanied family members to the Bidhannagar outpost.         
	They were asked to lodge a missing diary at Shaktigarh police outpost because Shouvik had made his last call home from there.        
	The inspector-in-charge of Burdwan police station, Subhashis Chowdhury, said Shouviks father  a retired employee of Damodar Valley Corporation  informed investigators that Rs 25,000 was withdrawn from an ATM and Rs 11,000 worth of goods were purchased with his sons debit card since he went missing.        
	Shouvik was apparently carrying his credit and debit cards along with his laptop when he left the city for Durgapur, an officer said.        
	As investigators hunted for clues to Shouviks mysterious disappearance, a source close to the family said he called around 6pm on Friday to inform his parents and wife in Durgapur that he needed to quickly arrange for around Rs 80,000. He also asked them not to inform the police, before hanging up. The phone has been switched off since, the source added.        
	The police failed to verify the information till late on Friday. We have been showing people at dhabas and sweet shops on either flank of Durgapur Expressway a photograph of Shouvik to find out whether anybody had seen him since Thursday evening, an investigator said.        
	A colleague said reports of Shouvik calling up his family to say he needed to arrange some money were baffling. We have never seen him behave erratically, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Girl molested, father shot dead
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Girl molested, father shot dead
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A father, mum in fear when robbers went looting his house, was shot dead on Sunday night as he screamed in protest when the goons started harassing his teenage daughter.        
	Seeing Gopal Saha shot, his wife continued with the screaming forcing the robbers to flee. As the gang tried to speed away on motorbikes, one of the robbers fell with the booty and was caught by neighbours.        
	Saha, 39, was a supplier of building materials in North 24-Parganas Halisahar, about 50km from Calcutta.        
	Six armed goons broke into the Sahas house around 11.30pm. An officer of Bijpur police station said Saha, his wife Parna and their 14-year-old daughter were sleeping when Parna felt the presence of someone inside the room. She woke up to find the intruders surrounding their bed.        
	Two of them demanded the key to the almirah at gunpoint, said Parna. Gopal gave them the keys without protest. One of the goons suddenly held the teenage girl by her hair and assaulted her.         
	At this, Gopal started screaming. The goons warned him not to shout but as he continued screaming one of them fired twice at him, said the officer. As Saha slumped, Parna started shouting. The goons then fled with ornaments and cash worth Rs 1 lakh.        
	The goons were speeding away when one of their bikes developed a snag about 500 metres from the Sahas house and stopped, said Kalyani Biswas the local councillor.        
	As the bike started again with a jerk, Ajay Das, sitting third, fell down with the bag containing the booty. Members of a local club, still awake to oversee the construction of a Kali Puja pandal, caught Ajay and handed him over to the cops.        
	We arrested Ajay Das and seized a firearm from him. We are trying to find out his associates, said Rahul Shrivastava, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police.         
	Parna said her daughter, a Class VIII student, could barely speak since her fathers murder. A police officer said they were also checking whether business rivalry was behind the heist.

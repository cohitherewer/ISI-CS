The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Potato army lays siege to city centre
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Potato army lays siege to city centre
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Commuters bore the brunt of a daylong meeting held by the Hooghly district Krishak Samiti at Metro channel on Monday. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                  
	Sixteen-year-old Kanchan lay helpless in an ambulance on SN Banerjee Road, his head swathed in bandages, while his father frantically tried to clear the way on Monday morning.         
	My son fell off a tree last night and has been referred to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. But given the traffic mess, I dont know if my son can make it to the hospital in time, cried Arun Majumdar, a resident of Basanti.         
	It took the ambulance almost 30 minutes to ply down SN Banerjee Road, almost double the usual time, as the Left Front-backed Krishak Samiti (Hooghly district) was holding a rally in Metro channel to highlight the plight of potato farmers.         
	Traffic movement was thrown out of gear on all arterial roads leading to the heart of the city between 11am and 5pm as supporters of the organisation took over an entire flank of the road opposite Metro cinema.         
	The organisation erected a giant dais and pandal on the western flank, leaving both north and south-bound traffic to jostle down the eastern flank.         
	JL Nehru Road, SN Banerjee Road, Lenin Sarani, Esplanade East Road and parts of CR Avenue and Red Road were chock-a-block by noon. The snarls also spread to Sealdah and the BBD Bag area.         
	Office-goers, schoolchildren and others caught in bumper-to-bumper traffic for hours wilted in the heat and cursed the city.         
	It took me 30 minutes to cross the stretch of JL Nehru Road between Park Street and Lenin Sarani. I knew there was a political meeting but I never realised that they would block an entire road. How can the administration allow such a thing? I feel ashamed to be a Calcuttan, fumed Kanak Chatterjee, heading for his Shyambazar office in his car.         
	The police brass insisted there was no question of granting permission for meetings that blocked roads. The organisers write to us about the date of their meeting and we make arrangements to ensure smooth traffic movement as much as possible, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	The organisers were aware of the havoc they had wreaked, but insisted that it was all for a genuine cause.         
	We know people had to suffer, but our programme was announced in advance. And its for a genuine cause  supporting poor potato farmers who are not getting the proper price for their produce, said Madan Ghosh, the state president of the Krishak Samiti.        
	We do not block roads over trivial issues, like other political parties do, he added.        
	But that would bring little solace to the thousands who suffered the Monday mayhem.

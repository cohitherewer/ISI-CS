                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      The City Diary
                Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Thursday inaugurated the second administrative office of the West Bengal Madarsa Education Board at Salt Lake Sector I. The chief minister said some classes of Aliah University would be held in the eight-storey building for the time being.  Injured: Five persons were injured in three accidents in and around the city on Thursday. A.K. Saha Pramanick, a traffic sergeant, sustained multiple injuries after a bus knocked him down near Parama Island around 8.35am on Thursday. In another incident, motorcyclist Debashis Roy, 25, and pillion rider Safique Hafiz, 26, were injured after being hit by a goods carrier at the crossing of Diamond Harbour Road and Mayurbhanj Road on Thursday. A minibus lost control and rammed into a shop on Benaras Road in Howrah on Thursday, injuring the shop-owner and a cobbler. Residents set the bus on fire.  Ransacked: Students of Motijheel College in Dum Dum allegedly vandalised the office of the Barasat State University vice-chancellor on Thursday. They had gone there to submit a memorandum to protest poor results.  Killed: Mrinal Bhowmick, 55, a Howrah resident, died after Zahida Bibi, with whom he allegedly had an affair, hit him on the head with an iron rod following an altercation over money. Bhowmick was declared dead at a local health unit. Zahida has been arrested.  Roadblock: ABVP supporters blocked the College Street-MG Road crossing for 10 minutes on Thursday morning.   Correction: Ajayajeet ran 1,200 metres in just over 1 minute 20 seconds on Wednesday to win The Finalist Plate at the RCTC. The Metro report on Thursday mistakenly mentioned that he ran 2,600 metres.

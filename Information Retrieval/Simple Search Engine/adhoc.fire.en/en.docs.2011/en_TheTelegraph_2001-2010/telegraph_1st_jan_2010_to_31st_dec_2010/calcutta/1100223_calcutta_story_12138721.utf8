                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fresh bazaar war hots up

	A home-grown retail chain will soon bite into the fresh-produce pie of organised markets, locking horns with perishables giants like Reliance Fresh, Spencers and More.        
	Future Group has entered into a 50:50 joint venture with Keventer Fresh Group to roll out a new line of perishables stores. Kicking off in Calcutta within a month, the chain has plans for an aggressive pan-India footprint.        
	We are giving a final shape to this perishables format and setting up 28 collection and processing hubs across the state for this, M.K. Jalan, the chairman of Keventer Fresh, told Metro on Monday.        
	Kishore Biyani, the CEO of the Future Group, and Jalan unveiled a Rs 100-crore shopping centre next to Sealdah station during the day in the presence of municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. The Big Bazaar Family Centre is a public-private partnership between the Calcutta Municipal Development Authority and the Keventer-Future Group combine.        
	We are looking for more opportunities to replicate large retail formats like this close to railway stations as these guarantee huge footfall, Biyani said.                    Two private groups have come together to open a retail chain which will lock horns with perishables giants such as Reliance Fresh, Spencers and More. The Future Group of Kishore Biyani (picture above by Sanat Kumar Sinha) and the Keventer Fresh Group will roll out a line of stores across the country, the first outlet to be opened in Calcutta within a month.      
	Sources said the next such project would come up near Rishra railway station, where Keventer had successfully bid for a 10-acre plot formerly belonging to the National Textile Corporation.        
	Minister Bhattacharya lauded the private partners for taking this courageous step in these trying times, but reminded them of the need to protect the interests of small retailers. The G+9 Sealdah retail and office tower can park 59 cars, with the top four floors being taken up by Bajaj Allianz.        
	Keventer, which supplies fresh produce to Metro Cash amp; Carry, Reliance Fresh, More and Food Bazaar, is confident its expertise in supply chain management would supplement Biyanis retail vision.        
	The Future Group is targeting business worth Rs 750 crore from the Sealdah centre in the first year and Rs 100 crore in the second year. Five more Big Bazaar outlets are expected by mid-2010.        
	We are confident of opening two Central malls in the city over the next four years, and we should notch up business of over Rs 1,000 crore from Calcutta alone this year, said Biyani.         
	The Future Group is also launching its T24 telecom brand in the city soon, in a tie-up with the Tatas.

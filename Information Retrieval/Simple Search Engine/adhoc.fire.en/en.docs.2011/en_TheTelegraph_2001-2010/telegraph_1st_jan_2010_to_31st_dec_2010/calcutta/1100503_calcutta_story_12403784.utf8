          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An upcoming hospital off the Bypass that has changed hands from Wockhardt to Fortis is likely to be commissioned in July after being delayed by more than a year.        
	The Rs 150-crore hospital in Anandapur is coming up on a two-and-a-half-acre plot. It is one of the three Wockhardt Hospitals properties in India that the Fortis Healthcare chain had bought last year.        
	Construction, stalled for 14 months, resumed in January. The first phase with 200 beds will be ready in July, said Vishal Bali, the chief executive of Fortis Hospitals. The entire 400-bed unit will be completed by next year, he said.        
	Cardiology, neurology and gastroenterology are among the departments the new hospital will have. There will be facilities for minimally invasive surgeries and haepatobiliary surgeries, including liver transplant.

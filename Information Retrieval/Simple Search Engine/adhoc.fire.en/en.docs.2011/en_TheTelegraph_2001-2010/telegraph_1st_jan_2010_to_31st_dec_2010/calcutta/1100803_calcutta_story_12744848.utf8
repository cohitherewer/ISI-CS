	Work on an illegal building, stopped after Metro highlighted the violation on June 8, has resumed.        
	Local residents who had lodged complaints against the illegal structure at 44A Abdul Halim Lane, off AJC Bose Road, with the civic body and police have alleged that they are being threatened by anonymous callers.        
	The civic body had declared the structure illegal and ordered its demolition in 2005 after owner Laxmi Gomes allegedly fell off the first floor and died. The family left the area soon after and the plot remained vacant till October last year, when realtor Subhajit Sharma allegedly took possession of the property to build the apartment block.        
	Last May, the civic body had issued a red card  a final notice that marks any construction as illegal  against the building and lodged an FIR with Taltala police station to ensure that construction didnt resume. Present owner Philomena Lipika Gomes, Laxmis daughter, was arrested on May 29.        
	Despite all this, residents said the top three floors were fast nearing completion. The promoter has put up tinted glass windows and is carrying on with the construction at night, says a resident who refused to be named.        
	Local councillor Iqbal Ahmed, of the Trinamul Congress, said: If the residents are being threatened, why arent they approaching the police? Ahmed said it was up to the police to ensure the construction was stopped and the illegal floors were demolished.

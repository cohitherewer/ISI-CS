          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two realtors were arrested in Ballygunge on Tuesday on the charge of duping a woman of nearly Rs 1 crore. Police said Saroj Jhunjhunwala and Asish Ruia were held on the basis of a complaint filed by Hemlata Ragani last month.         
	According to an officer, Ragani said she had paid Rs 1.08 crore to the accused  who run a construction firm  for building a mall on a plot owned by her in Rammohan Mallik Garden Lane in south Calcutta.        
	The woman handed over the money to the firm in mid-2009, said city detective chief Damayanti Sen.        
	Ragani alleged that the firm did not carry out any work and she asked for her money back in November. They gave back only Rs 12 lakh two months ago and promised the rest within a fortnight. But they have not returned the money yet, said an officer.

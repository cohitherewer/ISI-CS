          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two traffic sergeants on Monday came to the aid of two Calcuttans in need, setting examples for their colleagues.         
	Asish Roy of headquarters traffic guard did not waste a second as soon as he saw a man in his early-50s get off his motorcycle and lay down on a pavement in front of Akashvani Bhavan on Monday morning. The cop hailed a taxi and rushed Amlan Kumar Chatterjee to SSKM Hospital. Doctors said Chatterjee had suffered a heart attack.        
	Joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim said: Roy called up Chatterjees office after finding the number in his identity card. He waited at the hospital till Chatterjees family members reached there from their Panchanantala Road home.        
	Chatterjee was shifted to a nursing home later.        
	Biplab Mandal of East traffic guard chased down a man who had snatched a cellphone from a woman on Topsia Road on Sunday night. The woman, Neepa Jagannathan, identified the snatcher.        
	Mohammad Ali, the arrested man, had earlier been held in connection with burglaries and snatchings.

                Traiyee Chatterjee, a Madhyamik examinee, was mowed down by a private bus in Bhatpara, on the northern city fringes, on Wednesday morning. Traiyee and friend Ishika Sarkar were on their way to the exam venue in a rickshaw when the mishap occurred. Traiyee fell after a bus on route 85 hit the rickshaw and was mowed down by the front wheels of the vehicle. She was rushed to hospital where she was declared dead on arrival. Ishika suffered minor injuries.    An incomplete question in the Madhyamik Hindi first language paper II created confusion among the examinees. There was only one question marked 2c but the score was split into two (3 +2) . Secondary education board secretary Partha Roy admitted the mistake and assured the 50,000-odd examinees that they would not be affected.    The high court on Wednesday asked an estranged couple to stay together in the wifes house with their three minor children for at least a week in an attempt to save their marriage. The bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice P.K. Deb asked Joyenendra Singh and wife Amisha to appear again in the court after carrying out the order. Considering the future of the three minor children, the court should try to unite the couple, the bench observed.  oyenendras lawyer Jayanta Naryan Chatterjee said the couples relations had soured over a minor incident on January 19. Joyenendra had placed a pot of milk on a stove in his Baguiati home. The pot got tilted and some warm milk spilled on the youngest child, aged one year. Amisha left the house with the child for her parental home on Bidhan Sarani. She also lodged a police complaint. Joynendra moved the high court last week seeking anticipatory bail.    Three teachers of Sonarpur Ramkamal Vidyapeeth and two home guards were injured while they were on their way to the local police station to deposit Madhyamik answer papers. The group was travelling in an auto which was hit by a truck.    Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will lay the foundation stone of the beautification project of Rabindranath Tagore Memorial at the Nimtala burning ghat on April 3.    A passenger got back his hand baggage containing jewellery worth Rs 3.5 lakh which he had left at Calcutta airport on Tuesday. Kumar Shankar Mitra had arrived on IndiGos Bangalore-Calcutta flight at 2.45 pm and left for Hooghly. After reaching home he realised that he had left the hand baggage at the airport. On Wednesday morning, he rushed to the airport, where the IndiGo staff gave him his bag.

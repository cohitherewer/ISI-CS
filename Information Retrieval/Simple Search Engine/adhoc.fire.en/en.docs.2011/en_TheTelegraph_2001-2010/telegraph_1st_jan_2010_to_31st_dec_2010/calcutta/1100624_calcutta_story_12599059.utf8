The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Revised college syllabi 2010-11
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Revised college syllabi 2010-11
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University will follow revised undergraduate syllabi in 35 subjects in all three streams from the 2010-11 academic year.        
	The decision was taken on Wednesday at a meeting of the universitys syndicate, which also scrapped the plan to admit students to postgraduate courses through admission tests.        
	The university had last revised its undergraduate syllabi in 2004.        
	Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said the syllabus of each subject had been divided into modules to prevent repetition of topics. For instance, in history, the trading systems of all periods will be clubbed under the topic trade. Earlier, students had to study the trading systems of different periods separately.        
	The new BCom course will be of 1,800 marks, including 1,200 marks in honours papers, said Das. Earlier, the BCom (honours) course comprised 800 marks each in the honours and pass categories.        
	The course has been modified to make it more job-oriented, said an official.        
	On postgraduate admission, Das said: There will be no entrance test. Students will be admitted on the basis of their marks in undergraduate exams. Students of affiliated and autonomous colleges will be treated on a par.        
	The university had last year decided to introduce entrance tests after 12 students from St Xaviers College, an autonomous institution, moved court against the admission criteria for postgraduate courses. But the move was opposed by SFI and other student organisations.        
	The authorities on Wednesday did not specify what prompted them to abandon the plan to conduct admission tests.        
	The syndicate also decided to request the UGC to reconsider its guidelines for granting affiliation to colleges. We oppose the new regulations as it would be impossible for colleges to follow them, said Das.

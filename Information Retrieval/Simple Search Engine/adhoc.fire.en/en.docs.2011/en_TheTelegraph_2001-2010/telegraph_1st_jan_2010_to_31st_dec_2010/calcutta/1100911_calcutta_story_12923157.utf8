                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      SC stays Riz probe 
                            
	The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the Calcutta High Court order directing the CBI to conduct a fresh probe in the Rizwanur Rahman death case.        
	A bench of Justice P. Sathasivam and Justice B.S. Chauhan also stayed all proceedings arising out of the high court order that had directed the CBI to register a murder case against Rahmans father-in-law Ashok Todi.        
	 The apex court asked Todi and others to file fresh bail bonds before the trial judge. It will dispose of the matter for final disposal on October 5. The court passed the order on a CBI appeal challenging the high court order.        
	Rizwanur, a computer graphics teacher, was found dead near railway tracks in Patipukur in September 2007. (PTI)        
	Appearing for the CBI, Solicitor General, Gopal Subramanium said the High Court order was unheard of and in blatant contravention of the Criminal Procedure Code since the agency had already filed the chargesheet in the matter.        
	 He submitted that High Courts direction had consequential effects as the trial had come to a stand still and all the accused were discharged.        
	 The apex court said it will hear CBIs appeal along with the appeal filed by Todi, who has also challenged the divisions bench direction.        
	 Todi had on May 28 moved the Supreme Court challenging the High Court order.        
	 The division bench of the Calcutta High Court had on May 18 directed the CBI to treat as an FIR the complaint filed by Rukbanur Rahman, elder brother of Rizwanur, on September 21, 2007.        
	 The bench had observed that Justice Soumitra Pal in his earlier order had only directed the CBI to investigate the cause of the death and file a report to it and had not authorised the agency to investigate the alleged crime.        
	 The CBI had then in its report concluded that Rizwanurs death was a case of suicide and recommended initiation of an abetment to suicide case under Section 306 of the IPC.        
	 Rizwanur, a computer graphics teacher was found dead near railway tracks in Dumdum area of Kolkata on September 21, 2007, just a month after his marriage on August 18, 2007, to Priyanka Todi, daughter of industrialist Todi.        
	 Todi, owner of the Rs 200-crore Lux Cozi hosiery brand, his brother Pradip and brother in-law Anil Sarogi are accused in the case along with senior IPS officers then serving in the Kolkata Police.        
	 The GRP was first entrusted with the investigations following which the state government ordered a CID probe.        
	 After this, the state instituted a judicial probe by a retired high court judge, which was withdrawn after the CBI probe was ordered by the Calcutta High Court on October 16, 2007.

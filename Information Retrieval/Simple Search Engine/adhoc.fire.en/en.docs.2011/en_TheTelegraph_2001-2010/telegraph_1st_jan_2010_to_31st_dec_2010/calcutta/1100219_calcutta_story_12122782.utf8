                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Youth falls off bus, run over

	A 25-year-old on his way to office lost his balance on the footboard of a packed government bus and was crushed under its wheels on Prince Anwar Shah Road on Thursday morning.        
	Abhijit Jana, a diploma holder in civil engineering, had joined his first job, at a real estate development firm in Rajarhat, on Tuesday and was pursuing a BTech course at a private institute. He was taken to MR Bangur Hospital, where he was declared brought dead.        
	The youth had somehow managed to board the crowded bus but lost his balance and fell on the road near the Lords Bakery bus stand. The rear wheels of the bus crushed his head. The driver sped away, said an officer of Lake police station.        
	As the bus slowed down near the stand, some office-goers pushed their way into the bus. Suddenly I heard a screech and a cry and found the boy lying on the road in a pool of blood. His navy blue bag was lying a few metres away, said Tapas Manna, who saw the mishap.        
	He was excited after landing the job and had said that he would soon start helping me run the family, said Abhijits father Ashok, a Calcutta State Transport Corporation employee, about his only child.        
	Mother Suchitra was inconsolable. I fed him with my own hands as he got ready for office. He left home in a hurry around 7.45am. Half an hour later a policeman called to say that he was dead, she said, clutching a photograph of her son.        
	Shopkeepers near Lords Bakery blamed poor traffic management for the mishap.

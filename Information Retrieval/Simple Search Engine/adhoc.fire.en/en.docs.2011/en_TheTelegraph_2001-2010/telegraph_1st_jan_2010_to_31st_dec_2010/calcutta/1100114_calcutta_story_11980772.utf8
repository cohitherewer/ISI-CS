          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two employees of a private finance company were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly abducting a borrower, manhandling him and confining him in the companys New Alipore office.        
	The two, Samiran Samajpati and Sujit Chakrabarty, were slapped with non-bailable charges. A Reserve Bank of India directive prohibits financial institutions from recovering dues by force.        
	An unidentified person, who saw Rik Mandal, the borrower, being manhandled in the finance firm office, alerted the Lalbazar police control room. It informed Alipore police station, which raided the office and found Mandal in a room that was bolted from outside, said an officer.         
	According to police, Mandal, in his early 20s, took a personal loan of Rs 39,000 from the company two years ago. He stopped EMI payments after a few months.        
	Samajpati and Chakrabarty visited Mandals house in Howrah this morning and told him that he owed Rs 33,000 to the company. When Mandal told them that he only owed Rs 20,000, they asked him to speak to a senior official of the company who was waiting at Mandirtala, said joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim.        
	When the youth went to Mandirtala, a man in a car asked him to accompany him to the companys office. After they reached the office, Mandal was confined in a room. Samajpati and Chakrabarty asked him to repay the dues immediately. When Mandal said he could not, the two slapped him, said an officer of New Alipore police station.        
	Company officials were not available for comment.

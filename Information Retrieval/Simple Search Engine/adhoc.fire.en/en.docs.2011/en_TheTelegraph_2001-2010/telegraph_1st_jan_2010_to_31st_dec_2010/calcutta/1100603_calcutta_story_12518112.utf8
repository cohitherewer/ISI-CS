The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City changes colour as winds of change sweep wards of war
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City changes colour as winds of change sweep wards of war
  - Mamata the new queen of cool        TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                                  
	Mamata Banerjee may have earned herself a new moniker along with a mandate for change: Didi Cool.        
	Hain Didi, ekdom coolekhon porjonto dekhachhe aamra Calcutta-ey 92. Kintu chinta-r kono karon nei. Ekdom cool, aami aachhi, Mukul (Roy) aachhe (Ok Didi, absolutely coolso far we have won 92 in Calcutta. Nothing to worry about. Absolutely coolI am there, so is Mukul), Trinamul Congress MLA Madan Mitra assures Mamata over the phone around 10.20am.         
	The railway minister has instructed Man Wednesday Mitra to make sure party cadres remain cool and do not make a show of what is turning out to be a red rout by the green army in the city.        
	Didi ekhuni flight-e uthechhe. 12.30-er modhye neme jaabe (Didi has just boarded the flight. She will land by 12.30pm), Mitra announces outside the Trinamul office on Harish Chatterjee Street.        
	A roar greets the announcement but the crowd falls silent as Mitra cautions them: Pleaseplease, we are under strict instructions from Didi not to shout slogans or celebrate at the airport or any other public place.         
	Sure enough, as Mamata walks out through the VIP enclosure of the airport at 12.45pm, she is greeted not by a crowd of delirious supporters but a muted group of party workers whose cool quotient on their day of triumph seems inversely proportional to the heat of the Celsius.        
	There are no slogans, no cries of DidiDidi, not even a wave of the party flag. Mamata, cellphone to the ear, smiles in approval.         
	Its a historic victorya victory for Maa, Mati, Manush. The CPM should leave on its own now, declares Mamata before getting into the front seat of her black Santro, accompanied at the back by her confidential assistant Ratan Mukherjee and a bodyguard.        
	As the five-car convoy speeds down the Rajarhat Expressway, party supporters who have got wind of Mamatas arrival are milling at the Chinar Park crossing to stop the vehicles and congratulate their leader. Mamata waves at them as her Santro slows down, then pleads with them to be shanto (calm). Another wave of the hand and a smile, and she is gone.        
	At Chingrihata, where the EM Bypass curves before straightening to hit the high-speed corridor, the sight of a white Maruti 800 with Mamata staring out of its rear windshield catches the ladys attention. The convoy slows down.        
	Didi wants that car to be kept out of the convoy. This is not a victory procession, an aide conveys Mamatas wish to a Special Branch officer in one of the vehicles following the Santro.        
	Cool. Convoy moves again.        
	It is 1.32pm when Mamata reaches Harish Chatterjee Street, her home and party office. She is smiling but wont get off the car until the crowd of flag-waving supporters is pushed back. Today, she must play it cool.        
	Apnara sorey jaan nahole Didi namben na (Didi wont get off if you dont move back a bit), shouts Mitra before asking the Special Branch personnel to help clear the way.        
	The 1,000-strong crowd cools down, though not for long. Mamata aaschhe...ma bonera hanschhe (Mamatas comingmothers and sisters are smiling), shouts a supporter.        
	Mamata doesnt complain, which is encouragement enough for another wisecrack slogan. Didi tumi korle ki? CPM ebar khabe ki (Didi what have you done? What will the CPM eat now)?        
	Mamata makes her way through the adoring crowd to reach her home, where mother Gayatri Devi is waiting for her. Daughter bends down to touch her feet and mother lifts her to give a big hug and a broad smile. The crowd cheers. Loud enough for Mamata to play the cool card again.               
	Please be calmI am requesting you with folded hands to be modest in victory, she beseeches.        
	The crowd goes quiet.        
	I thank you for your tireless labour over the last two months, and I now ask you to go home, have a bath, have some food and sleep. There should be no celebration now. We will celebrate this victory in a big way on July 21, she announces.        
	A young, enthusiastic supporter with a Mamata sticker on his forehead and a flag in his hand looks disappointed.        
	Lokkhi chhele, baba ebar tomra ghore jaao (Good boy, now you please go home), Mamata pleads one last time.        
	She has her way. Yet again. Its her day.

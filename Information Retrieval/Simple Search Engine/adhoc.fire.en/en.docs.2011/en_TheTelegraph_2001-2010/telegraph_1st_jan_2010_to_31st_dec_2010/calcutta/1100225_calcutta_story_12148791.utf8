The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Journey through contour amp; colour 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Journey through contour amp; colour 
          ARKA DAS                          Symbols amp; Metaphors was inaugurated at CIMA Gallery on Wednesday. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	Symbols amp; Metaphors, inaugurated on Wednesday and on till April 3 at CIMA Gallery, plays on the theme of its title and offers varied individual perspectives on a broad artistic palette.        
	Varied in context, diverse in style and even time-frames  Gopal Ghoshs 1946 watercolour Calcutta Kills shares wall space with a 2009 Paresh Maity  Symbols amp; Metaphors, from the CIMA collection, offers a visual journey through contour and colour expressed in exhilarating individuality.        
	The premise of the show is symbols. Not surprisingly then, the works on display offer image plays on eternal themes: life, death, sexuality, roots, the human condition. The absence of a catalogue provides another interesting facet to the exhibition: without the printed word, each work could perhaps carry a uniquely specific interpretation to individuals viewing it. Until the couple of months to its annual summer show, this CIMA exhibition would be engaging enough.        
	While the themes of the works remain eternal, what is intriguing is the individual meaning these offer to the artist and its consequent expression. The apparently stationary fish in Mayank Kumar Shyams untitled work are in stark juxtaposition with Jitish Kallats outr, bursting-at-the-seams Rickshawpolis-7; the former a characteristically moody study in monochrome, with just that touch of Pointilism, the latter a murky picture of urbane chaos in its graphic lines, its basic burnt brick tone, perhaps a metaphor for the bare bones of city structures.        
	In the same milieu, the quiet treatment of nature in folk artist Ram Singh Urvetis work throws in yet another possible contrast, in conjunction with Jyoti Bhatts series of reverse paintings executed in the painter/ceramic masters intricate approach. Much of the recent works are from recently concluded shows, including works by Samir Aich, Shreyasi Chatterjee, Rashmi Bagchi Sarkar, Kingshuk Sarkar and Sumitro Basak.         
	A lone work by the irrepressible Atul Dodiya  Man With Chakki  offers its fair share of inward glances, placed on a mirror board as it were, while Sanjeev Sonpimpares personalised vision of a world digitised yet executed in physical shapes often overrides his message. Baiju Parthans take on a similar subject brings us to his diptych of pigment ink prints on archival paper, where tiny geometric shapes unravel the hawkmoth or a snail-shape that he calls Spira Mirabilis in reference to a logarithmic spiral. But the surprise inclusion in the show remains Knight Watch 17, a part of M.F. Husains seminal 2001 exhibition protesting the Godhra riots that the now-exiled artist had brought to Calcutta.

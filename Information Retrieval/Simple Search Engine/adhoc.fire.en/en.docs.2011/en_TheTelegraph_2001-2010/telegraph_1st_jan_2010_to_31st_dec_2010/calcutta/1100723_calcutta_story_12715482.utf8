The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hospital waste by wayside
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hospital waste by wayside
										      JAYANTA BASU      Infectious medical waste that can spread epidemic is being dumped beside Basanti Road in Chowbhaga, triggering fears of the items being recycled back to the market untreated.  A team from the state pollution control board had on Monday visited Chowbhaga and found several yellow and blue bags containing biomedical waste below Ambedkar bridge.  ldquo;Some people, including children, were separating the toxic waste which should have been sent to the biomedical waste treatment facility of Sembramky Environmental Management Pvt. Ltd in Howrah. The bags had the company rsquo;s name written on them, rdquo; said Shyamal Adhikary, the senior engineer in charge of the waste management cell of the board.  The board called the company to a hearing on Thursday and asked the management to explain within seven days how the bags made their way to the roadside in violation of the Bio-Medical Waste (Management amp; Handling) Rules.   The company distributes the bags to all private and government hospitals. The yellow bags are for anatomical waste and the blue ones are for plastic waste, such as syringes and catheters.  ldquo;Some hospital employees siphon off the waste for money rdquo; said a Sembramky official. He also hinted at the possibility of some civic conservancy employees being involved in the racket. Some local residents told Metro that bulk of the waste was from government hospitals.  ldquo;The violation is frustrating the efforts of the state board and diktats of the Supreme Court. It also exposes people to the threat of an epidemic... if required we will complain to police, rdquo; stated Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the state pollution board.

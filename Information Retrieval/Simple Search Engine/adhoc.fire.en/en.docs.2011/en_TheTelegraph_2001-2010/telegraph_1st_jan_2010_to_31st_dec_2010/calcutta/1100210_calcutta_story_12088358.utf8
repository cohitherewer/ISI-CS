          A STAFF REPORTER                           The gate of the IIM campus at Joka                                  
	Placement trends for the 2010 batch of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta have confirmed that the downturn blues are over for the B-school boys and girls.         
	A representative of the placement cell at the Joka institute told Metro that 100 of the 170 students participating in lateral placements  the part of campus recruitment reserved for students with work experience  have received offers, many of them multiple ones.         
	This years lateral placements have not come to a close as yet but it is clear that things are much better than last year, said Samyukktha Thirumeni, the secretary of the IIM Calcuttas external relations cell.        
	The placement cell had a tough time last year as lateral and pre-placement offers, made to students after their summer internships, had gone down drastically, resulting in the lengthiest final placement on the Joka campus.         
	The turnaround coincides with the governments announcement that the economy is back on track and could grow at 7.2 per cent in 2009-10.        
	Though IIM students are reluctant to say that the pre-downturn days are back, the increase in salary package for students taking part in the lateral placements has raised their hopes.        
	We havent calculated the averages yet but students have received quite a few offers above Rs 20 lakh per annum, which is higher than what was offered last year, said Thirumeni.        
	The lateral placements, which began in January first week, is expected to end before the start of the final placement season in March.        
	According to the placement cell, a wider variety of roles has been on offer this year compared with last year. Companies like shipping firms, which had stayed off IIM lateral placements, have debuted in the race to bag B school brains. Mahindra amp; Mahindra was another first-timer in this edition of the laterals.         
	Like the past two years, we have tried to bring in diverse companies across various sectors. New companies have shown an interest in coming for lateral placements this year, said Thirumeni.         
	The highest number of offers so far came from Cognizant Business Consulting. The list of other recruiters included Deloitte, Hinduja Group, Aditya Birla Group, Accenture Business Consulting, Virtusa, Essar and Bristlecone.        
	The number of companies that have come for lateral placements is double of last year, said Thirumeni.

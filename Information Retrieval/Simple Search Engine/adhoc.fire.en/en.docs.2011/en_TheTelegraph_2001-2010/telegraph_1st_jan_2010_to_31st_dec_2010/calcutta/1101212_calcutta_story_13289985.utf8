	Randiha is a homely tourist spot in the Durgapur subdivision of Burdwan district, about 10km from Panagarh on NH2 and about 19km downstream the Durgapur barrage.         
	A quaint town on the banks of the Damodar, Randiha offers a beautiful mix of greenery and water. We had booked the state irrigation and waterways departments bungalow in advance.         
	You can spend the mornings with endless cups of tea, listening to the chirping of birds. The quiet of the place makes one aware of the sounds of nature. One can find trees laden with fruits taken over by flocks of woodpeckers, parrots, bulbuls and kingfishers.        
	The expansive Randiha dam is spectacular. The vigorous waves of the waters of the dam bore on the fishermen who braved the churning waters for an occasional catch in their homemade nets. It was amazing to see them feel their way around in the treacherous waters with their nets and bundle them up their thrashing catch, an assortment of silver carp, rohu and tilapia fishes.         
	In 1932, the Anderson weir was constructed at Randiha. With this, irrigation facilities reached the lower Damodar basin. This was even before the construction of dams by means of the diversion weir on the Damodar and Eden canal to the extent of 890 sq km in the districts of Burdwan and Hooghly.        
	At night, the sleepy town turns even quieter and one can hear the nightbirds. The crickets accentuate the silence.         
	Our trip was over too soon. We resolved to return to this beautiful place very soon.               
	Going         
	Take a train or bus to Burdwan and then reach Randiha by hiring a vehicle. You have to cross Panagarh Bazaar More              
	Staying         
	The bungalow of the West Bengal governments irrigation and waterways department is the only place with proper facilities. Book at the departments regional office in Burdwan town                                            Metro on Sunday   thanks reader   Sudipta Chatterjee   for this contribution.

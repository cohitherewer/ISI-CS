	The public works department on Monday cleared the modified IPL Club Lounge at the Eden Gardens, handing over a no objection certificate (NOC) to the Kolkata Knight Riders.        
	The fire services department is yet to grant an NOC on the stand but, according to sources, its experts have expressed satisfaction with the steps to protect the structure from a blaze.         
	Each ticket to the stand costs Rs 32,000. Shah Rukh Khan and his guests had watched the Kolkata Knight Riders matches from the stand.        
	After an inspection of the Club Lounge with fire services officers on Monday, PWD engineers said they were satisfied with the work done on the structure to increase its stability. Almost all the PWDs recommendations have been complied with. Currently, there is no problem with the structures stability, Ajit Ranjan Bardhan, the PWD secretary, told Metro.        
	We were happy to find that steel beams have been welded together at several places and new plates have been used for welding certain portions. Even the space between the plywood and the steel framework has been filled with steel rods. Steel bolts and nuts have also been used extensively, said an engineer.        
	The fire services department had lodged an FIR with Maidan police station regarding the Club Lounge and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami had said there were several deviations in the structure from the blueprint that was submitted.        
	KKR officials were asked to make certain modifications before the stand hosted spectators for the April 1 match.         
	The fire services department had specified that two staircases would have to be built so that spectators sitting on the gallery could escape in an emergency. Besides, it asked for the plywood portions to be treated with fire-retardant chemicals.         
	The staircases have been built and the plywood structure has been sprayed with fire-retardant chemicals by an agency authorised by the department, said a fire services officer who was part of the inspection.         
	The police top brass said they would allow seating inside the IPL Club Lounge at the Eden Gardens. The clearance comes ahead of the IPL co-ordination meeting at Writers Buildings on Tuesday.        
	The meeting will be a stock-taking exercise, where chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti will clear everything with the agencies concerned. After that, we would have no problem in allowing spectators in the Club Lounge, said a senior IPS officer at Lalbazar.

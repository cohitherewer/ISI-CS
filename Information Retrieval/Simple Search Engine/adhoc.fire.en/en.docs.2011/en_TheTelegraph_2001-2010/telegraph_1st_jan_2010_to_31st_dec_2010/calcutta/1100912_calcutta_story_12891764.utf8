The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Massage fraud over mythical river
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Massage fraud over mythical river
                                      (From top) An artwork by Nikhil Biswas, a cryptic crossword and Vivek Kumar Singh at the launch of his book at a city store. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                           
	Accountant-General got nothing in the past. That means ago (AG-O). If this sounds like gibberish, how about massage fraud over mythical river? The answer is  yes, rubicon.         
	This is the world of cryptic crosswords. Only the sharp of mind with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the English language and the world are eligible. How many such do we have in India? If Vivek Kumar Singh, author of Understanding Cryptic Crosswords, A Step by Step Guide, published by Macmillan, is to be believed, there are plenty and many more will convert if they follow Singhs advice on direct clues, indirect clues, deletions, anagrams, homophones and what not.        
	This is a book not for the ace crossword solver, it is for those who are uninitiated and would like to crack the cryptic crossword, says Singh, an IAS officer of the 1989 batch.         
	Launching his book at Oxford Bookstore on September 1, the author, who solves The Telegraph Cryptic Crossword every day, lamented the lack of indigenous crosswords. In India most crosswords in English papers are from British newspapers and magazines.         
	Gentle giant        
	Nikhil Biswas is a tragic figure of Bengals contemporary art, and like many who die young, he is the stuff that legends are made of. He has left behind a prodigious body of work whose power never fails to surprise us.        
	He was a master of the sweeping brushstroke, of sinewy human and animal figures, either in monumental black or explosive colours.         
	Sandip Sarkar, art critic of long standing, had known the artist, who died in 1966 at age 36, since 1956. Sarkar says unlike his powerful works, Nikhil Biswas was a quiet and peace-loving giant.         
	Sandip Sarkars book titled The Passion of Nikhil Biswas was launched recently. The book is sponsored by art collector and dealer Prashant Tulsyan, who writes in the foreword: The first time I saw Nikhil Biswass paintings in 1990, I was mesmerised by the sheer riot of colours and the boldness of strokes in his works.         
	Sarkar has written the story of his encounter with Nikhil Biswas quite unpretentiously. But the huge tome is littered with literals. Otherwise it is a beautifully produced book with some wonderful reproductions of Nikhil Biswass works.                   
	Hope and despair        
	Renee Ranchan has been writing poetry for as long as she can remember, but the collection of poems, Untwine The Wind is the first earnest published work of the Delhi-based columnist.         
	Some of the poems explore the life going out of relationships with time. I ask you to stop/ .. making me a chore/ Tiresomely habitual in Habitually Yours. The past seems to be the only relief: Memory a companion/ Never forsaking/ And so am I blessed (To Meeta). A theme in many of the 103 poems is the desperate clinging on to hope in the face of despair and melancholy.         
	Ranchan, who counts Johnne Donne and Samuel Taylor Coleridge as some of her favourite poets, grew up in California. The book, by Konark Publishers, is designed by Rohit Kathuria with pencil sketches by Renees brother Rahul.                     ANASUYA BASU AND ROMILA SAHA

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Armyman in the dock
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Military police took into custody Pradip Jagdale, the lance naik of the Eastern Command accused of molesting a civic police volunteer, after he was released on bail by cops on Wednesday and started a probe into the incident.        
	Police said they would go ahead with their own probe and submit a chargesheet in Bankshall court.        
	Jagdale was caught by hawkers, who were alerted by the cries of the civic cop, near Dorina crossing on Tuesday night. The woman was not in uniform.        
	The army would conduct a court of inquiry against the accused. Primarily, there seems to be enough evidence against him. If he is proved guilty, strict action would be initiated, said an army spokesperson. Army sources said Jagdale had been let off with a warning following an offence in the past.

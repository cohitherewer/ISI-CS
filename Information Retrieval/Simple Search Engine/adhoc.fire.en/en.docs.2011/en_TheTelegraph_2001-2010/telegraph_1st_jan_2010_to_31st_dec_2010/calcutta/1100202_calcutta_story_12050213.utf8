                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops sit on complaint against goon 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A criminal who allegedly opened fire in the Park Street area twice in the past two weeks has gone scot-free despite specific complaints by residents.        
	Mohammad Arshad, who had been booked several times in connection with extortion and other crime, allegedly fired to scare a tenant into vacating a house in Moulavi Golam Sovan Lane, off Elliot Lane.         
	The FIR mentioned Arshad as the man who pulled the trigger. Mohammad Ashfaq, one of his associates, was arrested in connection with the incident on Monday evening.         
	Arshad owns a part of the house but he does not stay there. The tenants went to the rent control department when he tried to evict them forcibly, said an officer of Park Street police station.        
	According to sources, Arshad wants to vacate the house so that he can erect a multi-storeyed building in its place.         
	Arshad came in the area early on January 19 and assaulted me with a hockey stick. Before leaving the spot, he opened fire. The bullet hit a wall in my room, said Mohammad Rafique, the tenant.        
	I, along with local people, went to Park Street police station to lodge an FIR. But the police refused to accept our complaint as, we suspect, they are hand in glove with Arshad.        
	The complaint was finally accepted after residents put pressure on the cops.        
	A re-run of the January 19 incident occurred on Saturday. Around 9.30am, Arshad and his men came to the area and started abusing us. He fired three rounds in the air to terrorise the residents and went away, said Sheikh Munna, a resident of the area.         
	As news of incident spread, residents gheraoed the police station, demanding action against Arshad.        
	Joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim said: We are probing Arshads role in the incident. Strict action will be taken against him if he is found guilty.        
	Preliminary investigation has revealed that Arshad is involved in extortion in Esplanade and central Calcutta. He takes money from bus owners for allowing their vehicles to ply from the Esplanade depot, said an officer of the detective departments anti-rowdy squad.

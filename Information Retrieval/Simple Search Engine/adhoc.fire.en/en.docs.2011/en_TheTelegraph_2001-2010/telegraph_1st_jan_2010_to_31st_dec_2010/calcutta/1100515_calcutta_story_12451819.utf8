                Rain and thundershowers late on Friday brought relief from the sweltering heat. Officials at the Alipore Met office said an abundant incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal into the atmosphere over south Bengal under the influence of a low pressure trough over Jharkhand and adjoining areas caused the rain. The thundercloud formation was further aided by an embedded cyclonic circulation along the same trough. The weatherman said the drizzle might continue till Saturday morning. The weather office ruled out the thundershowers being a Norwester.

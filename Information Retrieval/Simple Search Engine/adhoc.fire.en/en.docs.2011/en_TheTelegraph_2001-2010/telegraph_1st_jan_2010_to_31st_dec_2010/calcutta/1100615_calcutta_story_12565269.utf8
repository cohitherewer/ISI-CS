The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire hazards in hospitals
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fire hazards in hospitals
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Fire safety norms are violated in all state-run hospitals and medical colleges across Bengal, fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee said on Monday.        
	A notice had been issued to all hospitals and medical colleges in this regard but none bothered. Fresh notices will be sent. Only SSKM Hospital took a few steps but more should be done, the minister said the day after a fire broke out in an operating theatre at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital.        
	The minister admitted that the government had not pursued the matter seriously as incidents such as the one at North Bengal Medical College had never occurred.         
	Now we will ensure that the orders are enforced strictly. The hospitals will be given a deadline to implement the order. Fire brigade officers will visit the premises to ensure the safety measures have been put in place, said Chatterjee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Boycott call fails to defer exam
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Boycott call fails to defer exam
  - JU authorities send out enough-is-enough message to union threat          OUR BUREAU                          The November 9 clash on the JU campus                                        
	The Jadavpur University (JU) authorities on Monday decided not to blink in the face of a boycott threat from a students union and ruled out deferring the semester exams scheduled from November 19.        
	The boycott threat from the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu)  demanding withdrawal of the FIR against 35 students booked for clashing with the police while trying to prevent the chief minister from leaving the campus on November 9  had triggered confusion on the campus about the exam schedule.        
	But the message on Monday was loud and clear. The exams in all three faculties will be held as per schedule, said registrar P.K. Ghosh.        
	The engineering exams begin on November 19 while the arts and science faculties start from November 22.        
	A small section of students is increasingly developing a tendency to create trouble on the campus. The university is determined to take a tough stand on tackling this threat. We will not change the exam schedule and those who dont appear for it will be marked absent, said a senior official of the universitys controller of examinations department. The students marked absent would be given a second chance when the supplementary tests are held three months later.        
	We will not appear for the exams until all our demands are met, said Palash Ghosh, the Fetsu general secretary.        
	But the science and arts faculty unions will not boycott the exams. We, too, are opposed to the police action on the campus and want the authorities to ensure the withdrawal of the FIR against the students, but we do not support the boycott, said a member of the arts faculty union.        
	Recent incidents of violence and students agitation, including a marathon gherao of the vice-chancellor and senior teachers, have rocked the Jadavpur campus. On November 9, some students allegedly slapped a policewoman and clashed with cops when the chief minister visited the campus.        
	On September 10, Fetsu had led the arts and science faculty unions in the day-night gherao protesting the decision to install closed-circuit TV cameras on the campus. Fifteen members of the universitys executive council  five of them patients of hypertension  were held hostage for 50 hours.

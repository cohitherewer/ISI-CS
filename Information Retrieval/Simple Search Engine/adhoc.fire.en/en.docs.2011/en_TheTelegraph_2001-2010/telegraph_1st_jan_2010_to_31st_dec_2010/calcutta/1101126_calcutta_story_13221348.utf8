          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court division bench on Thursday admitted a contempt petition against La Martiniere for Boys moved by the father of Srijan Banerjee, who had been denied promotion to Class V allegedly because his class teacher was not given a laptop.        
	On October 5, a high court division bench had ordered the school authorities to admit Srijan, who had been issued a transfer certificate, to Class V with immediate effect.         
	The boys father, Partha, told the judges the authorities had still not allowed his son to join the school. The bench directed him to serve a notice on the school authorities asking them to take part in the contempt case and scheduled the matter for hearing on November 30.        
	The school had announced it would move the Supreme Court against the order.

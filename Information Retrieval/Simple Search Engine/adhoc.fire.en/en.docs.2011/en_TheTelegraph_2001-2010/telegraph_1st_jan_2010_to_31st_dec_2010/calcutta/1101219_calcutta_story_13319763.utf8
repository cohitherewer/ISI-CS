                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Next weekend you can be at ... Hee Bermiock
                                          
	When we reached Hee Bermiock in West Sikkim from New Jalpaiguri along a snaking road, it was just past noon but the air was comfortably cool at an altitude of 1,700m above sea level.         
	Hee Bermiock is an all-weather destination, its charm changing with every season. In winter it is especially a travellers delight with clear skies and snow-capped peaks all around.        
	The skyline, outlined by the mighty Himalayas, gradually disappeared as evening rolled into night. A shrill whistle of a bird heralded the next morning.        
	The inky sky was just fading out. I slid open the windowpanes and what a view! As the first slanted rays of the sun appeared from behind the hills in the east, the crests of the Kanchenjungha got smeared with molten gold.        
	The gold turned to white through diffusing shades of yellow as the sun started moving upwards in the sky.         
	Between Hee Bermiock and Kanchenjungha, there is only one hill that hosts Ghesing on one side and Peling on the other.         
	We could not resist visiting Chhai Tal, a lake 10km uphill from Hee Bazaar, the main market place of the hill town.        
	We enjoyed a cultural programme of east Himalayan tribes there. The folk songs and dances in traditional costumes and ornaments made the day even more magical.         
	Near Rinchengpong, six kilometres downhill from the town, we visited a monastery where a woman embraces the idol of Ati Buddha, an exceptional sight indeed.        
	Different shades of green, colourful flowers, a variety of orchids and tiny birds with bright feathers dotted with red, blue, green and black are a photographers delight.        
	At sunset, rays turned golden again but this time it looked like a white sari with a golden border covering the Himalayan beauty queen.        
	The trip became all the more exciting because of plates piled high with momos, steaming thukpa and local wine.         
	Going         
	You can reach Hee Bermiock from New Jalpaiguri or Siliguri by road via Jorathang. One has to pass through Reshi and Rinchengpong               
	Staying         
	There are several hotels to choose from. One can book hotels and get information from the Sikkim Tourism Development Corporation office at 4/1 Middleton Street, Calcutta.

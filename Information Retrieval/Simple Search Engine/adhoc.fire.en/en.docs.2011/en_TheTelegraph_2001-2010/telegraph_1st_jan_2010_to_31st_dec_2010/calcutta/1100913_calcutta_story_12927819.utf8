The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fearless Khan beats em all at Friday box office   All eyes on Salman
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fearless Khan beats em all at Friday box office     - Dabangg opens bigger than 3 Idiots thanks to Chulbul Pandeys punches, punchlines amp; pelvic thrusts          PRIYANKA ROY                                                  
	 Chulbul Pandey joins Munni in gyrating to Munni badnaam hui. Two women in their 40s jump out of their plush plex seats and break into a jig. Fearless.              
	 Chulbul Pandeys shirt is ripped open by his rippling muscles. A gang of college girls lets it rip with catcalls. Fearless.              
	Salman Khans Dabangg (Fearless) is living up to its name  its making those watching it fearless.        
	Fearless enough to crow and clap, fearless enough to whistle and whoop. Fearless enough to beat the box-office record for the biggest opening for a Bollywood film. Ever.        
	With Rs 14 crore on Friday the 10th, Salmans Rs 30-crore film has blazed past friend Aamir Khans blockbuster 3 Idiots, which had notched up Rs 13 crore on its opening Friday. No wonder Salman Khans tweet on Friday evening read: Thank u bolna banta hai boss so thank u.        
	Dabangg has set a record for the biggest Bollywood opening, says trade analyst Taran Adarsh. The crowd count swelled on Saturday with collections reportedly rising to Rs 30 crore-plus in two days.         
	Salmans Chulbul Pandey  a comic and corrupt cop with a cause  has ended the Bolly drought at the box office starring the likes of Kites and Raavan. Dabangg is bigger than anything that has hit Bollywood in a long time.... If Wanted (Salmans 2009 superhit) worked more with the single-screen audience, Dabangg has managed to break the plex barrier, says trade analyst Komal Nahta.        
	Salmans comic-action avatar, with punches, punchlines and pelvic thrusts, has something for everyone. No wonder Ballygunge businessman Ankit Agarwal watched Dabangg on Friday afternoon, then Saturday night and wont mind another dekko. Salman makes every trip worth it. No wonder Urmila Sen, 16, must catch Dabangg a second time. Chulbul Pandey is mind-blowing. Salman is Bollywoods rockstar, she gushes.                          
	The Dabangg fever is raging in town, with screens registering one houseful show after another. At a cinema in Dum Dum on Sunday evening, Salman fans denied tickets went on a mini rampage.        
	According to Taran Adarsh, Dabangg collected Rs 75 lakh in Bengal on Friday, Rs 3 lakh more than 3 Idiots on opening day. We opened across a record 156 screens and every show since Friday has been packed. Dabangg has opened better than 3 Idiots and Ghajini. Tickets have been sold in advance for next week, says Mahendra Soni of Shree Venkatesh Films, the films regional distributors.        
	The occupancy figures have been in the range of 90- 98 per cent and we expect it to rise further in the coming week, adds Virendra Marya, the regional director of INOX.        
	What explains the Sehwag-like start for Dabangg? The fun promos of Salman caught the eye. The music caught the ear. The debut by Shatrughan Sinhas daughter Sonakshi caught the fancy. But above all else, Salman Khan as Chulbul Pandey has caught the imagination of so many.        
	Nobody can match him in star power, Bolly buff Sumit Rajora wrote on Facebook.        
	The box office agrees.

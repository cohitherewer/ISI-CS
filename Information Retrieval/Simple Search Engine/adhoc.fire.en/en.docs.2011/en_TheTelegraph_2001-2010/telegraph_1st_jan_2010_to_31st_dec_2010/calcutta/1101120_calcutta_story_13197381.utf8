The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pay chanda or face chopper   Puja over, chanda on
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pay chanda or face chopper     - Club gang in slash-and-run over traders refusal to pay up          AMRITA GHOSH                          Dinesh Pareek in hospital with a bandaged left hand. (Gopal Senapati)                                        
	Extortion in the name of chanda drew blood again on Thursday with a Howrah club gang slashing a young mans hand with a meat chopper while he was trying to shield a trader who had refused to pay up.        
	Dinesh Pareek, a 30-year-old purchase manager of a Varanasi-based textile company, required 19 stitches on his left hand after taking the blow meant for his friend Sanjay Agarwal, who owns a garments workshop.         
	The assault took place in the workshop of SS Garments in Ashutosh Mukherjee Lane around 7.40pm on Thursday, minutes after Dinesh had reached there to say goodbye to his friend.         
	Police said Dinesh, who had come home for Diwali and was to board a train for Varanasi late on Thursday, was chatting with his friend when three members of the local Young Star Club barged in to demand a pending donation for Jagaddhatri Puja.         
	Tui ki shotti taka dibi na? Teen hazaar taka na diye ki kore thakbi, aamra dekhbo (Are you sure you wont pay the money? We will see how you avoid paying Rs 3,000), one of the club members threatened Sanjay before slapping him hard.        
	When Dinesh tried to intervene, he was pushed away. The leader of the gang, identified as Vivek Mukherjee, then stepped out of the workshop and came back with a chopper from a nearby meat shop. He lunged at Sanjay with the weapon but the blow landed on Dineshs outstretched left hand, slashing it from the palm to the forearm.        
	As Dinesh writhed in pain and Sanjay screamed for help, the trio fled. One of the accused, Joynath Seth, was arrested on Friday afternoon.                           
	This comes barely two weeks after a Frenchman and his Bengali wife living in south Calcutta faced death threats from members of a Bansdroni club that had demanded Rs 5,000 from the couple as Kali Puja chanda.        
	Metro had reported on November 13 how Jean-Frederic Chevallier and wife Sukla Bar mustered the courage to lodge a police complaint despite seeing other residents being browbeaten into silence.        
	In Howrah, Dineshs wife Nitu said she didnt even know that her husband had been attacked until someone from Golabari police station asked her to visit Howrah General Hospital.        
	I almost fainted on seeing him in blood-splattered clothes. I live here alone with our two children (daughter Tisha, 6, and son Gaurav, 4). I hope those club members wont come after us, she said.        
	Assistant superintendent of police Anuradha Mandal said cops were hunting for the other two accused.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Station boon for fringes
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Station boon for fringes
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday announced a suburban railway station at Noapara, where a Metro station is also slated to come up during the extension of the underground network to the airport.        
	I have sanctioned a station at Noapara, where trains from both the main line leading to Barrackpore and the Barasat line will converge, the railway minister announced at the foundation laying ceremony of a Metro rake rehabilitation workshop at Noapara.        
	On December 29, she sanctioned the conversion of the suburban rail service to the airport to Metro and its extension to Noapara. Once the projects are completed, places like Kalyani and Barrackpore on the northern fringes will be connected to the airport via Noapara.        
	In an interactive programme on STAR Ananda, a caller from Noapara had requested me to sanction a halt station here. But look at what I have done: I have given you industry in the form of the rake rehabilitation factory and two full-fledged stations instead of a halt station, said Mamata.        
	She also told the gathering that Metro Railway would finally stretch from Joka to Barrackpore.         
	According to the minister, the rake rehabilitation factory, coming up around the existing car shed at a cost of Rs 113 crore, will save the railways money and enhance safety. We are now forced to send the coaches to Chennai for repair. This costs us time and money. Also the safety standards will go up with the new factory.        
	Amar Nath, the general manager of Metro Railway, said the life span of the coaches would go up by five years after the factory opened.

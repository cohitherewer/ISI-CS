          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police have framed charges against a south Calcutta couple and two others for allegedly employing a minor girl and torturing her.         
	Prabhat Kumar Singh, 45, his wife Sulakshna, 35, Manik Mondal, 40, and Tarun Mullick, 38, have been charged under the Juvenile Justice Act, said an officer of Lake police station.        
	According to him, Prabhat, a trader, and Sulakshna, who works in a private company, brought the 11-year-old from her home in Alipurduar in north Bengal to their Prince Anwar Shah Road flat in January to work as a help. The couple used to confine her to a room and deny her food. The girl was also beaten up regularly, the officer said.         
	The girl managed to flee the flat and narrate her experience to Mondal, who runs a shop in the area. Mondal put her up in Mullicks house in the neighbourhood. Soon, Mullick too started forcing her to work as a help and torturing her, said the cop.        
	Alerted by residents, the police rescued the girl on March 2. Acting on her complaint, we arrested the four. Neighbours helped us nail them, said the officer.

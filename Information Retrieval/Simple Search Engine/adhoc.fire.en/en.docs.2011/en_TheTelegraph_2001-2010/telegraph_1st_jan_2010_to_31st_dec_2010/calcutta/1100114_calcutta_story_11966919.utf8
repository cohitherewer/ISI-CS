The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Merc luxe bus eyes our highways
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Merc luxe bus eyes our highways
  - Puja month target for Mercedes-Benz foray into east with 45-seater coaches          ANASUYA BASU                          NEXT STOP CALCUTTA: A Mercedes-Benz luxury coach                                        
	This Puja, you may get a ticket to ride... a Merc!        
	Mercedes-Benz will start retailing its fully loaded, multi-axle buses in Calcutta this October, making long-distance highway journeys something to look forward to.        
	Each 45-seater Merc coach comes with fire-retardant upholstery, LCD screens, laptop-charging points, temperature control, seats with mechanical reclining mechanism and ample leg space and a unique suspension system that allows the driver to lift the floor height of the vehicle upto six inches to ensure a smooth ride on bumpy roads.        
	We will start operating in the east once the service network spreads to Calcutta, and that should be by the third quarter, Wilfred Aulbur, the managing director and CEO of Mercedes-Benz India, told Metro while launching the new three-axle luxury coaches at the 10th Auto Expo in New Delhi last week. With rapid infrastructure development in India, there is a need for long-distance mobility solutions with adequate comfort and safety. The Mercedes-Benz coach will cater to this specific demand, he added.        
	There are five service centres for Merc buses in the south and the west but none in the east. Our buses are used by inter-city travel operators in Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Goa and Chennai. Before we come to Calcutta, we need a state-of-the-art workshop ready there, said Aulbur. Mercedes-Benz is already selling buses to state-run transport corporations and would be happy to strike a deal with the West Bengal State Transport Corporation.        
	Transport minister Ranjit Kundu said his department would definitely look at the Mercedes buses once they approach us. We have already inducted Volvo and Tata low-floor buses into the city fleet. Whether we induct Mercedes buses or not would depend on our need and the kind of price they quote, added Kundu.        
	A Merc bus bears a price tag of Rs 85-90 lakh  against Rs 82 lakh for a Volvo in Calcutta  but that has not stopped it from aiming to be the mass transit leader in Bengal.        
	According to Aulbur, Mercedes-Benz also does not rule out building buses for intra-city travel to become an approved supplier under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, which has brought a fleet of swanky vehicles to the city to replace rickety, polluting buses.        
	Powered by the Euro III engine, Merc luxury coaches come with safety features like the anti-lock braking system and emergency hammers to aid quick exit. Entry and exit is easy because of an inswing pneumatic passenger door and a nightlight.

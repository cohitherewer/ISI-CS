	 The article Metro Manners, July 25, was much needed and I hope many have read and learnt from it. The experiences described are what I face daily while travelling from Kavi Nazrul to Chandni Chowk. I am a senior citizen and often find that people are reluctant to give up the seats reserved for the elderly.           
	It is embarrassing to ask them to vacate their seats for me.           
	Anne Pybus,

	 What really bugs me is how people waiting to board a train dont allow passengers to get off first. Its simple logic that if you let people get out of the train first, those entering will have more space to stand. I often have to sternly say Aagey berotey din (Let us get off first) as I get out of a train.           
	Saptarshi Bhattacharya,
  Address not given    
	 I have a simple suggestion that can make getting off and boarding a Metro train easier. There are four doors in every coach. Metro rail can mark alternate doors as Enter and No entry. Inside the compartment, the same doors should be marked the opposite. The system could be popularised by announcements for a while.           
	Sandip Ghosh,
  Wedderburn Road                     
	 The problem of commuters carrying backpacks is not restricted to schoolkids. Many office-goers carry laptops in big backpacks. On protesting, most reply with a snide remark. They perhaps expect to be treated with awe by ordinary passengers. I commute between Tollygunge and Rabindra Sadan and this problem is greater in this stretch as many people who work for IT firms get off at Rabindra Sadan to travel to Salt Lake.           
	Vikash Agrawal,
  Barisha

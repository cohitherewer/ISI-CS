	It is an international standard that the worlds major cities preserve central open spaces for their citizens to enjoy and develop them as aesthetic statements reflecting the greatness, culture and beauty of their nations. The perspicuous description of the Maidan in Maidan Marauders, dated February 21, as the lungs of the city, holds up a mirror to yet another of Calcuttas former glories  receding now in appearance from mere shabby gentility to a charmless refuse dump  and the reflection is not a pretty picture.             
	The report is a well overdue cry of alarm which, if ignored, can only be to Calcuttas detriment. Sadly, yet another environmental catastrophe induced by official indifference. Maintaining this historical and environmentally important feature obviously deserves a higher priority than it currently receives.           
	Calcutta taking pride in its newly-emerging image deserves better and India, as a great nation growing into an international leadership role, absolutely deserves better. The initiative for restoring and improving the Maidan clearly lies with the municipal authority, supported by appropriate legislation and resources by the state. Anything less is disrespectful of the citys residents and will deserve the condemnation of history.

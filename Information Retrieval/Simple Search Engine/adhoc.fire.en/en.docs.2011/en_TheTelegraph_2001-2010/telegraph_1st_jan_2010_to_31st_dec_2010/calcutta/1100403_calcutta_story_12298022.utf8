                      In step with Kathak                    A classical dance form of northern India, Kathak literally means to tell a story and is derived from the dance-dramas of ancient India. When its patronage shifted from the temples to the royal court, there was a change in its overall emphasis, which shifted from the telling of religious stories to one of entertainment. Today, the story-telling aspect of Kathak has been downgraded and the dance is primarily an abstract exploration of rhythm and movement. This evenings Annual Kathak Show by the students of Padatik Dance Centre attempts to showcase the diverse dimensions of this ancient form of the performing arts, at the same time incorporating elements that bear testimony to its contemporaneity and timelessness. It features choreographies including Vasant, Fusion, Angikam, Kathak with Flamenco, Megher Damaru, Taal Tarang and Vaidic chants, that will be presented with both live and recorded music. A Kathak item improvised with the Nazrulgeeti, Megher damaru ghana baaje, depicting monsoon, will offer sheer visual delight, while Kathak with Flamenco deserves mention for its innovative choreography. Taal Tarang offers examples of different improvised patterns of bols in the frame of teen taal to be followed by a thumri, Chayan nahi aaye. Vedic chants prove the dancing skills of youngsters as little as three years old.                  Event: Annual show of Padatik Dance Centre When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Gyan Manch

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | At Centre door against rail
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      At Centre door against rail
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN NEW DELHI                               
	The state government has complained to the Centre that Mamata Banerjees railway ministry was not cooperating with it in plugging the loopholes in Metro Railways security.        
	State home secretary Samar Ghosh and Calcutta police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti were part of the Bengal delegation that called on Union home secretary G.K. Pillai on Wednesday to discuss the issue.        
	Bengal has said 685 posts need to be created to upgrade Metro security. Half the expenditure has to be borne by the railway but Mamatas ministry hasnt apparently responded to the state pleas. We also need CCTVs, bomb disposal squads and metal detectors, said a member of the state delegation.        
	A home ministry official said the meeting discussed the gaps a recent security audit had revealed.        
	Sources said Pillai had asked the railway ministry to do the needful for Metros security. The home ministrys prod may prompt the railwayto provide the necessary support to the state, said a source.        
	The home ministry had recently written to the state government stating that Metro security was inadequate.        
	Ministry officials said the security issue should be seen in the light of the Lashkar-e-Toibas threat to attack railway establishments and trains in the run up to the Commonwealth Games.        
	A team of railway ministry officials, too, met the Bengal delegation which included the additional director-general of police (railway), Dilip Mitra, and the chief security commissioner (Eastern Rail), S.C.Sahu.

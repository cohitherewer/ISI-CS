          A STAFF REPORTER                                              Rouvanjit Rawla and Srijan Banerjee        
	The principal and three teachers of La Martiniere for Boys arrested in the Rouvanjit Rawla case on Monday and later released on bail will continue to perform their regular duties at the school, while a Class IV boy will be promoted following a high court prod.        
	The board of governors in a meeting on Tuesday decided that no further action would be taken against principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi, the head of middle school, L.J. Gunnion, and teachers David Ryan and Partha Dutta.        
	There will be no change in their duties or roles. There is no question of taking any action at the moment as they are yet to be proven guilty as charged, said Supriyo Dhar, the secretary to the board of governors, La Martiniere schools.        
	The board of governors also discussed Class IV student Srijan Banerjee whose father had moved court against the schools decision to fail him twice in the same class and give him a transfer certificate.        
	A division bench of the high court on Monday asked the school to allow Srijan Banerjee to join Class V with immediate effect. The basis of the order was the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, prohibiting schools from detaining students till Class VIII. Srijan was twice detained in Class IV.        
	The board has decided to abide by the high court ruling on the issue, said Dhar.        
	La Martiniere for Boys teacher Sanjay Smart had allegedly sought a laptop as a bribe to ensure the boys promotion to Class V.        
	It is a great relief. I knew I wasnt at fault and neither was my son, said the boys father, Partha Pratim Banerjee.        
	In the Rawla case, all four teachers were charged under the Juvenile Justice Act 23, which relates to torture of a child by the custodian of the place/institution where he or she has been staying when the crime took place, a non-bailable, cognisable offence.        
	Rouvanjit, of Class VIII, was found hanging in the attic of his Alipore home on February 12, four days after being caned by the principal for bunking class.         
	Ajay Rawla, Rouvanjits father, had filed an FIR on June 7 with Shakespeare Sarani police station accusing the principal and four teachers of physical and mental torture leading to Rouvanjits death.

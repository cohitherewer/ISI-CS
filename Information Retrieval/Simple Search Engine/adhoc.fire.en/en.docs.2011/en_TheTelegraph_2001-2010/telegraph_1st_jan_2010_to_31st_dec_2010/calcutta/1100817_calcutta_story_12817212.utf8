The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Subsidy up by Re 1 on transport fuel
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Subsidy up by Re 1 on transport fuel
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state government on Monday doubled the subsidy on diesel for buses, minibuses and taxis to Rs 2 per litre and lifted the cap on the total subsidy offered to each transport operator.        
	For a taxi, up to 20 litres of diesel was being subsidised per day. The limit for buses and minibuses was 50 litres.        
	Now, the subsidy will be available on whatever quantity of diesel the vehicles consume as long as the operators can produce the bills.         
	At the end of each month, Rs 2 will be deposited in the bank accounts of the transport operators for each litre of diesel they buy.         
	Following the state governments announcement last month of Re 1 subsidy on a litre of diesel, transport operators had threatened to go on strike to press for a fare hike.         
	We have done everything to accommodate the demands of the transport operators. Now, the Centre must also do something to reduce their burden, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said on Monday.        
	After this, there cannot be a demand for a fare hike. We have done everything we can, transport minister Ranjit Kundu said.        
	According to Dasgupta, the state government had decided to forego Rs 100 crore of sales tax income annually to offer the first subsidy. The government would have to shell out Rs 100 crore from its coffers to pay the enhanced subsidy.        
	The transport minister will meet the transport operators at Writers Buildings on Wednesday afternoon to formally tell them about the government decision and to ask them not to go on strike.         
	Sources in the operators lobby said a strike was unlikely now. Most of us did not want to go on a 72-hour strike in the first place. Now there is little reason for one, said a leader of bus operators.        
	Trinamul Congress MLA and a leader of transport operators, Swarnakamal Saha, said they were satisfied with the governments gesture and method but would still negotiate for a higher subsidy.         
	Special trains: The Howrah division of Eastern Railway ran three pairs of local trains between Tarakeswar and Howrah on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays from July to accommodate the 40 lakh-odd extra passengers who visited the temple town because of Shravani Mela that ended on Monday.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Voices from radio
                    Dhirendra Chandra Mitra      
	The 1930s to the 1960s are considered the golden age of Bengali music, be it adhunik or light classical which had so many famous exponents. But a good part of this heritage has been pushed into oblivion for the singers can only be heard occasionally on the radio. Few music companies are interested in reviving these songs although their merit is undeniable. For most young people used to multitasking, music has become a background score of their day-to-day activities. Little wonder popular music is closer to jingles than to the kind that needs concentration and undivided attention.        
	The Megaphone Company has recently brought out two CDs that make us marvel at the high quality of singing in those times. The first by male singers is titled Nishirate Rimjhim after Dhirendra Chandra Mitras one-time hit featured here.                   Dancer Alokananda Ray, former Union minister Renuka Chaudhury and teacher Bharati Ray took the dais for a talk on the Women rsquo;s Reservation Bill organised by Concern for Calcutta recently. They were all for 33 per cent reservation in Parliament and state legislatures while the men in the audience listened silently. If they had behaved as well in Parliament, the bill would have fared better. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya      
	The latters charmingly nasal voice is still heard on the radio, but one-time favourites such as Siddheswar Mukhopadhyays Brindaban path yatri, Chinmay Lahiris Rajani pohalo je patha paane chahiya, recorded a little before his death, and Tarapada Chakrabartys Path bhola oi matal hawa make this an invaluable CD. Gnan Datta, who later in life became a well-known music director in Mumbai, sang of the loves of Laili and Zuleikha. These were all recorded in the 1940s.        
	The second CD is Ke amare daake by some well-known female singers of those times, the most famous of whom was Begum Akhtar, who sings two Bengali evergreens. Featured also are Lalita Ghosh, Gnan Prakash Ghoshs wife, Bandana Mitra and Jyotsna Ganguly, who has a musical voice, is heard often, but whose accompaniment can be overwhelming. The surprise is the sultry-voiced Hiranmay Pandit of the Sambhunath Pandit family. She stopped singing after her marriage. Only these two 1959 recordings exist.                           A stamp on Lenin at the exhibition. (Sudeshna Banerjee)       
	Lenin in city  
	Recently Left Front chairman Biman Bose inaugurated a stamp exhibition on Lenin on the occasion of the 140th birth anniversary of the revolutionary leader that fell on April 22. The exhibition took place a few days later at Calcutta Information Centre.         
	Subhro Chandras collection of stamps, miniature sheets, cancellations and post cards comprised the three-day show. Many stamps portrayed the troika of Marx, Lenin and Engels. Indian stamps on M.N. Roy, Bipin Pal and Lokmanya Tilak were included in the collection as Roy and Pal featured in books on India in Lenins study at Kremlin. Lenin had protested Tilaks arrest in 1908.         
	Chandra, a Calcuttan who is a former secretary of the Philatelic Congress of India, says he was inspired by a Russians collection on Lenin in Armenia.           
	Strangeing fiction            China Mieville      
	British writer China Mieville was in town recently, brought down by the British Council.         
	The author, a man in his thirties with a shaved head and earlobes lined with earrings, is known to put together new worlds peopled with monsters in his books. Mieville says he writes weird fiction. It is about strangeing, or making things strange, where you throw out things that are taken for granted,said Mieville, a two-time winner of the Arthur C. Clarke Award, speaking at Oxford Bookstore.         
	I like the process of world creation just as Tolkien was in it for the languages, he said, quickly adding, Not that Id turn my back on monsters. That would be heresy.        
	His novels Perdido Street Station, The Scar and Iron Council are sited in the magical Bas-Lag universe with its own continents, languages, politics, and societies, while Beszel and Ul Qoma in The City amp; The City are cities of fantasy that are located somewhere on the edge of Eastern Europe. The monsters in them, he said, are empathisable.         
	Heat is off                  A tourist tries to beat the heat. (Pradip Sanyal)       
	The heat has struck. And how. The latest to fall prey to the killer heat are voyeurs lining the Peace Park pavement, opposite SSKM Hospital. Now thats quite a feat for the heat. On any given afternoon or early evening, depending on the CDT (Calcutta Dating Time, silly!), rows of eyes are firmly glued to the proceedings behind the bushes. The voyeurs stand on their toes. They peer and they gape. Heads are bent at right angles. And good reflexes really help.        
	But the mercury is keeping the peeping toms away from the action-packed pavement. But some are dedicated voyeurs. They come back with large black umbrellas. But they leave after a while, staring is not that fun even from under the brolly.

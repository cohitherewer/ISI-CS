                      When nature beckons          A flowers appeal is in its contradictions  so delicate in form yet strong in fragrance, so small in size yet big in beauty, so short in life yet long on effect.  Adabella Radici				 				   Contemporary urban existence truncates any close association with nature in any form. Land is prime and all greenery must make way for development, or so is the mantra. Besides, life in the fast lanes bars any interaction with nature. We have no time to stand and stare. But Gods precious gift, Nature, survives and thrives even amid hostile surroundings and thats precisely why we are dumbstruck when we spot a bunch of sunflowers or dahlias swaying breezily from the bleak window of a dilapidated multi-storied building. Where flowers bloom so does hope, said Lady Bird Johnson, and our souls are revived, once again. The Agri-Horticultural Society of Indias annual flower show reinstates this saying. The show, now in its 183rd year, also plays a pivotal role in promoting horticultural development and environmental restoration. This show will have rare species of flora, scientifically-bred plants, as well as commercial horticulture. With more than 10,000 exhibits and more than 1800 entries, the Annual Flower Show will also have other attractions like Prints displayed by Photographic Association of Bengal, Ikebana flower arrangement by Wafu Ikebana School of Japan, floral decoration from Shailpik Craft Centre, and demonstration of Ikebana techniques.     Event: Annual Flower Show 2010 When: February 4 (inauguration at 3 pm); - February 7; 7 am  7 pm daily Where: Main Lawn, RPG Hall amp; H B Kanoi Exhibition Hall, The Agri-Horticultural Society of India, 1 Alipore Road

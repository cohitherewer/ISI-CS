                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Commerce course goes practical
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University will revamp its BCom syllabus to include practical classes and upgrade the theoretical papers.         
	This is the first time since the course was started in the 1940s that students will get first-hand experience in handling business matters, which is expected to boost their employability.         
	The demands of modern industries are changing and we feel our students must have exposure to industrial practices, said CU pro vice-chancellor (academic) Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee. The changes are likely to be introduced either from the upcoming academic session or next year.         
	The CU board of studies in commerce has prepared a draft of the revised syllabus, which provides for an internship and on-the-job training. The theoretical papers will also be upgraded, with a greater focus on information technology and its application, marketing, taxation, cost and management, said board chairman D.R. Dandpath.        
	CU will organise a workshop in collaboration with the Merchant Chamber of Commerce on June 1 to discuss the proposed changes. Representatives of various companies will also attend the workshop.         
	Fresh commerce graduates lack the basic practical knowledge even in accounting. Companies have to train them to update their practical skills. We are happy that CU has decided to upgrade its syllabi, said S.S. Beriwala, the president of the chamber.

                Green activist Subhash Dutta filed an affidavit in the high court on Monday alleging that the Centre and the state were not promoting bio-diesel in Calcutta and the rest of Bengal, ignoring a national policy on bio-fuel.    The state has suggested to the Centre that it be allowed to issue arms licences to the owner of a private security agency or a person recommended by him instead of in the name of the agency. This will help the government keep a tab on private guards and firms.     Traffic was disrupted in central Calcutta on Monday afternoon after members of the Minority Group of Youth Federation blocked the Dorina crossing demanding the implementation of the recommendations of the Sachar Committee and the Ranganath Commission. Over 170 protesters were arrested.

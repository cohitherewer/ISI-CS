The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | To-do code for tinderbox town
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      To-do code for tinderbox town
                                          The Metro on Sunday report on March 28        
	As the city went into shock over the Stephen Court tragedy, Metro on Sunday visited a host of old and precarious buildings in the central business district where disaster was waiting to strike. The cross-functional committee set up by the government followed suit and prepared a situation report on some of these buildings. The recommendations will be sent to the owners/caretakers of these buildings along with a time-frame for implementation, said Banibrata Basu, the special commissioner of Calcutta police. Metro thumbs through the findings and the recommendations that will soon reach his desk from the fire services department.        
	Karnani Mansion        
	What they saw: The G+5 building at the Free School Street-Park Street crossing has no in-built firefighting system even though it houses several business establishments and two schools. The electrical wiring system is a mess and corridors have been barred by grilles. The terrace houses over a hundred unauthorised constructions.        
	What they recommend: Underground reservoir with a pump room; a multi-grade detector to set off a fire alarm; a long water pipe to surround the building; water hydrants at ground level; sprinklers; grille gates in the middle of corridors to be done away with; proper electrical wiring; circuit breakers.        
	Mercantile Building        
	What they saw: The building on Lalbazar Street is a labyrinth of unauthorised constructions on the terrace, countless cubicles, a mesh of wires and no firefighting facilities. A steep wooden staircase rises from the second floor to the terrace. The backyard is chock-a-block with cars.        
	What they recommend: Unauthorised constructions to be removed from the terrace; backyard to be cleared of cars; water reservoir; no loose and open electrical wiring; wooden stairs done away with; two proper escape routes; sprinklers and water pipe.              
	Queens Mansion        
	What they saw: The sprawling building next to Stephen Court on Park Street has wide corridors connecting different blocks but many of these are blocked by makeshift constructions. Blocks 1, 3 and 5 have cat ladders, two wooden and one iron, leading to the terrace, that are tough to negotiate. No firefighting system at this residential-cum-commercial address.         
	What they recommend: Water reservoir, hydrants and sprinklers; the steep cat ladders to be replaced, wooden ones done away with; electrical wires redone and circuit breakers installed; leaking water tank repaired; water sprinklers.              
	6, 10, 12 Old Post Office Street        
	What they saw: Located opposite the high court, this seat of legal chambers is a storehouse of inflammable articles. Outside, there is indiscriminate use of open fires by food stalls. No firefighting system inside. Tangle of wires and cables. No defined fire escape route. Staircase is wooden.         
	What they recommend: The oil-based transformer in front of the building to be replaced by a dry-type transformer; the wooden staircase to be replaced; electrical wiring to be redone and circuit breakers installed; hose-drill with necessary accessories and hydrants; multi-grade detectors with sprinklers; external sources of open-fire to be removed.                    KINSUK BASU

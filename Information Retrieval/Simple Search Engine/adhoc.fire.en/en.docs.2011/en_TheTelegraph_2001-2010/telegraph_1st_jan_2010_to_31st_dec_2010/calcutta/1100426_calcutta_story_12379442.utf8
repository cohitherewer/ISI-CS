The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Security hot spot for Netizens
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Security hot spot for Netizens

	Wi-Fi hot spots are increasing faster in the city than awareness on how to make them secure, leaving many laptops exposed to wireless security threats.        
	Most public Wi-Fi hot spots in Calcutta lack encryption technology that enables data transmission in scrambled form so that it cannot be easily intercepted and read.         
	Those using open Wi-Fi networks become easy prey to cyber criminals, said Indranil Chatterjee, lead consultant, ITC Infotech, at an awareness session on Wi-Fi security in Sector V recently.         
	Following increase in bandwidth theft and other Wi-Fi crimes across the country, Sector V administrative body Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, Sector V Companies Forum and Nasscom had organised the programme.        
	Cyber criminals can intercept data like passwords and credit card information transmitted through an open Wi-Fi network. Hackers can even access the hard disk of a user who has turned on file sharing.        
	A key or username and password are required to access a secure Wi-Fi network.         
	Generally, if no username and password is asked while connecting to a wireless network, it lacks security, said Suparno Moitra, the regional head of Nasscom.        
	In Calcutta, many hotels, some cafs and malls have Wi-Fi zones. In places like The Park, Hotel Hindustan International and Barista Lavazza, Netizens need to type in a username and password. Mani Square on the EM Bypass is one of the places with open Wi-Fi network.        
	Portions of the mall are Wi-Fi enabled. Access is free and no password is required to log in, said a Mani Square spokesperson.        
	Experts suggest precautions for those using open Wi-Fi networks. Ideally, one should not connect to an unknown or open Wi-Fi network. If one has to, one should refrain from downloading email attachments and other files from unknown people or websites, said Moitra.         
	Even so called secure networks that use encryption technology like WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) or WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) are not totally safe because hackers have developed tools to unscramble encrypted data.         
	Most users are unaware about the threat they are exposed to when they use open Wi-Fi connections.         
	Even tech companies in Sector V do not protect their Wi-Fi network adequately from hackers.        
	Only 30 per cent of the information technology and business process outsourcing companies are equipped in terms of network security, said Manjit Nayak, a joint director of the city wing of software society STPI, at the awareness session.        
	A month ago, officials from the Bangalore cyber crime cell had visited a Sector V company to investigate a credit card fraud perpetrated using the companys Wi-Fi network.        
	We will put up billboards across Sector V explaining the dos and donts of Wi-Fi networks, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of Nabadiganta.        
	Not securing your Wi-Fi network is as much a crime as using it for evil purposes, added Sujit Mukherjee, the officer-in-charge of Sector V police station.

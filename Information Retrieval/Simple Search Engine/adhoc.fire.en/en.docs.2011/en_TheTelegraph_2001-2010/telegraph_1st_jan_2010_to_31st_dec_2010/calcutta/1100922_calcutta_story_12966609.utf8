                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Glare on cell in track tragedy

	Two college girls trudging along a rail track with one of them chatting over a cellphone were killed by a speeding local train on Tuesday morning, barely four days after a similar tragedy.        
	Friends Paromita Jana, 19, and Bidisha Mondal, 18, died of multiple injuries within hours of being knocked down by the Down Sealdah-Bongaon Ladies Special between Birati and New Barrackpore stations around 9.55am.        
	Witnesses said Paromita, who was closer to the track, may not have heard the sound of the train coming from behind as she was using a cellphone headset. Bidisha, her first-year classmate in the Bengali department of New Barrackpore Acharya Prafulla Chandra Mahavidyalaya, apparently died trying to drag her friend out of the way.        
	I could make out even from a distance that the girl with the headset (Paromita) was engaged in conversation. Why the other girl didnt hear the sound of the speeding train until the last second is a mystery, said Asim Kolay, who sells groundnuts at Bisharpara-Kodalia station.         
	Bystanders and boys of a college near the accident site, around 19km from the city, helped take the critically injured girls  Bidishas left leg was severed  to NRS Medical College and Hospital. Paromita died around 12.20pm, an hour after being admitted. Her friend, who was later shifted to SSKM, succumbed to her injuries around 2.15pm.        
	She was so excited about coming home for Puja in a few weeks. She wanted a cellphone along with new clothes this time. Who will I buy these things for now? cried Bidishas father Bimal Mondal, a farmer from Dushnekhali in North 24-Parganas.        
	Mondal said he last spoke to his daughter over her friends cellphone around 8:30am.        
	Schoolteacher Sukanta Mondal, a friend of Paromitas father, said he had heard about her talking over the cellphone when the accident occurred but wasnt sure whether that was the cause of her death. We need to hear from the cops first. In any case, what is the point in finding out how this tragedy happened since she cannot be brought back to life, he told Metro.         
	Paromitas family lives in Atapur village, on the northern fringes, not far from Bidishas village. The two friends, who had passed Madhyamik from Atapur Kenaram High School, used to share a mess at Bisharpara.        
	The duo had set off for college around 9.30am on Tuesday, hoping to make it to the first class on time by taking a shortcut along the rail track. The college is a 25-minute walk from the girls mess.         
	Last Friday, a train mowed down Class XI student Madhurima Das, 16, when she walked past a closed rail gate and stepped on the track near Dum Dum Cantonment station while talking over her cellphone.

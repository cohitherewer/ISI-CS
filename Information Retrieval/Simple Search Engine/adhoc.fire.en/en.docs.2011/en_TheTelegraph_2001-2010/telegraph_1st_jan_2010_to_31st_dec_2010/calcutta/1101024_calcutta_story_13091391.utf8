                        Smritir Veenay   by Mira Bose                           
	Mira Bose, born in 1933, was an ordinary woman with an ordinary story to tell, which she told with extraordinary sincerity. Bose had been advised by her son, a doctor, to write her memoirs in a matter-of-fact manner to ward off depression and paranoia brought on by illness and the privations she had suffered.         
	After some hesitation, she started jotting down her memories on scraps of paper, but before she could complete even a couple of chapters, she died. A part of this fragment was initially published by historian Gautam Bhadra.         
	Sutradhar has published the entire piece in the form of a book titled Smritir Veenay with elaborate footnotes by her son, noted local historian Debasis Bose, which have enriched this fragment.         
	This happens to be the 25th death anniversary of Mira Bose, and the slim volume was launched by the authors tiny grandson at Seagull Bookstore on Mahalaya.         
	The book gives a clear and honest picture of the lives of women in upper-class families of north Calcutta, although a single outstanding personality, Barama, the grandmother of the authors mother, stands out amidst the crowd of characters and intricate family histories.         
	At times these strands are so intricately woven with each other it would have been impossible to figure out what was going on without the family trees printed in this edition. Although Mira was by no means outspoken about the injustice meted out to many women in her family, she did not hesitate to write about the depravities of the menfolk.         
	At the launch, Gautam Bhadra said that as in the accounts of many women, the accent here was on sorrow and suffering. It was as if women discovered themselves through their sufferings.         
	Found in translation                        Jean Kwok rsquo;s Girl in Translation       
	Girl in Translation by Jean Kwok tells the story of a Chinese immigrant family which moves from a fairly comfortable life in Hong Kong to an unheated, dark apartment in Brooklyn. While the mother and other members of the family worked in the sweatshops to make ends meet, little Kimberley found her books. She also found her way to the campus of Harvard University and finally to Columbia University. Although Girl in Translation is a work of fiction and not memoirs, there are definite parallels with my own life, says Kwok, who lives in New York, in an email interview.         
	The use of the language in Girl in Translation, published by Penguin, is quite unique. Since the novel is told in the first-person by my narrator, Kimberly Chang, I used her voice to place the reader into the head and heart of a Chinese immigrant. We cannot understand much of the English that is spoken to Kimberly because we hear with her ears, she says.         
	Many words come across as gibberish to the reader. However, we can understand Chinese expressions as fluently and easily as she can, a native speaker of Chinese.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday upheld the life terms awarded to six men for murdering Mahesh Agarwal, a property developer based in New Alipore. An Alipore sessions judge had sentenced the six.        
	Tapas Das, Goutam Ghosh and Shankar Das shot the 40-year-old from a close range in his office on April 7, 2002. Jishu, a criminal in the area, had masterminded the murder. Two of Jishus aides, Raja Dutta and Dulal Mondal, had helped Tapas and others track down Agarwal.        
	In April 2002, while he was lodged in Alipore jail, Jishu had demanded Rs 5 lakh from Agarwal through his associates. After the property developer refused to pay, Jishu planned to kill him, public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami told the division bench of Justice S.P. Talukdar and Justice P.K. Dey.        
	The court dismisses the appeal moved by Jishu and five others against the trial court judgment, the bench ruled.        
	Police arrested the gang. On March 12, 2007, the Alipore sessions judge sentenced the six accused to life imprisonment.        
	In July 2007, the convicts moved an appeal before the high court against the trial judges verdict.

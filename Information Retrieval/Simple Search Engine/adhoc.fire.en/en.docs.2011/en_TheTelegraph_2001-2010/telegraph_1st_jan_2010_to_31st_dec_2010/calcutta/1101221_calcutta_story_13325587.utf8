The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Body parade stalls city
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Body parade stalls city
          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Trinamul Congress supporters punished the city for Lalgarhs pain on Monday, parading the body of a slain farmer from the battle zone through the streets even as the rival Left Front choked a thoroughfare to protest the 2G spectrum scam.        
	Barely had the city recovered from the traffic mayhem unleashed by the procession mourning farmer Sanatan Hembrams killing, a district leader of the Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad was wheeled into SSKM Hospital with bullet injuries suffered in an attack near Saktigarh in North 24-Parganas, around 80km away.        
	The attack on Sanju Malakar (president of the Bongaon unit of Trinamuls student wing) is part of the CPMs plan to spread terror ahead of union elections in colleges, alleged party MLA Jyotipriya Mullick, possibly setting the stage for another traffic-choker protest rally in the city.        
	On Monday, commuters at the Shyambazar five-point crossing were the first to fall victim to the traffic congestion triggered by the parade, which included schoolchildren who had thought that some famous actor rather than the hearse bearing Hembrams body was the reason behind the huge gathering.        
	The western flank of Bhupen Bose Avenue, the road that connects the Shyambazar five-point crossing with CR Avenue, was closed to traffic at 1.30pm. Barely 15 minutes later, police closed the other flank as well, putting the entire pressure of traffic on CR Avenue.        
	With the procession proceeding towards Bidhan Sarani en route to the Metro Channel, traffic along the entire stretch of College Street, Nirmal Chunder Chandra Street and S.N. Banerjee Road was thrown haywire over the next hour.        
	Homemaker Sreeradha Dutta, stranded on a Shyambazar-bound tram along with 20-odd passengers near Hedua Park, kept looking at her watch. I have been stuck here for more than half an hour. My child is probably back from school already and I need to reach home (in Bagbazar) quickly, she said.        
	Class VI student Manish Hela of Shyambazar Vidyamandir was sucked into the afternoon mayhem while watching the procession file past Bhupen Bose Avenue minutes after school gave over at 2pm. I was wondering whether the TV cameras were following some famous actor when I felt a hand on my shoulder pulling me into the procession. I was then asked to walk along, he said.        
	Ziarul Hossein, a first-year geography honours student of Basirhat college, had joined the procession thinking that it would be a student protest against farmer Hembrams killing by alleged CPM cadres, only to discover that it was a political rally.        
	I dont attend political rallies. I was told that this programme would be a protest rally by students, but on reaching the venue I found Trinamul workers far outnumbering us, rued 20-year-old Ziarul, one of the young faces in the procession.         
	What is the point of parading a body on city roads? There are ways to protest other than resorting to such political gimmicks, fumed Rakhal Rakshit, standing near the Metro Channel with traffic through the Dorina Crossing stalled between 4.10 and 4.45pm.         
	From the channel, the hearse later took a U-turn for the protesters to head towards Trinamul Bhavan on the Bypass. Both Park Street and Park Circus bore the brunt of the congestion during that period.        
	Around half an hour after both the flanks of JL Nehru Road were opened to traffic, around 2,500 supporters of the Left Front blocked Rani Rashmoni Avenue to protest Delhis alleged inaction on the 2G spectrum scam.         
	However, police insisted that the Left Front protest didnt hold up traffic, proving that Lalbazars idea of disruption depends on the colour of the flag at the rally. There is no use telling the parties what to do. We are just relieved the rallies were peaceful, said a cop.

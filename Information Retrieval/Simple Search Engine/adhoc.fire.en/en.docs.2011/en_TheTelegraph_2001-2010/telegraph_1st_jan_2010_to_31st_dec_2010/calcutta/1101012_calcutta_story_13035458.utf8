The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lensman dwells on digital divide
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Lensman dwells on digital divide
          SOUMITRA DAS                          Raghu Rai in front of a work at the exhibition. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	Raghu Rai sees Calcutta either as a sweeping panorama both ugly and pretty, or equally striking vertical shots that pack their punch by layering of visual information top downwards.         
	A couple enjoy a tryst on a terrace with Chitpur in the distance defined by the dome of Nakhoda masjid and the jagged line of highrise buildings.        
	Sweepers carry loads of rubbish in wheelbarrows in a narrow lane crowded with fibreglass deities  typical Kumartuli kitsch. Upcountry labourers twig it on a ghat with an expanse of dirt before it that recedes into the Hooghly.        
	Street urchins perched on a garbage dump grin as they look into the camera while a bus whizzes past in the background. It is not difficult to imagine unheard ragas echoing in the gallery of photographs of classical musicians in the house of Bhupendra Krishna Ghosh of Pathuriaghat.        
	Harrington Street Arts Centre is holding a large exhibition of Raghu Rais Calcutta photographs, many of them taken in the 1980s, some of which have gained iconic status. While Rai, who was here for the inauguration on Saturday, never stops praising digital technology, he admits that he had to use film for these panoramic shots.        
	India is a horizontal experience. Capturing a moment in space has been done to saturation point. India is a multi-religious, multi-cultural country with several moments living together. It is multi-layered. You have so many pictures in a single frame, says Rai. And this is just the way one feels because Rai is not afraid of chaos.        
	In the early days when cables and other impediments came into the frame, it was considered disturbing. But in contemporary photography one accepts the fact that this is part of our situation, says Rai. Which is why even in the picture perfect Prinsep Ghat shot, the foreground shows a puddle because it added that extra dimension.        
	Rai, who has been visiting Calcutta since 1969, feels Bengalis are emotional, even sentimental. They are more connected with whats going on in the world and with each other. The architecture too has so much character that one does not see in other cities.        
	Rai cannot stop talking about the virtues of digital technology, whatever critics may say. The prints on display, both the black-and-whites and the handful of colours, were products of cutting-edge technology.        
	There was a time when people thought I was an A-class printer. You had to be careful that certain details did not get burnt or another part of a print became too dark. Now with digital prints details are uniformly revealed.        
	Rai refuses to hold any brief for the use of film. Thirty-five mm film gives you grain. Digital technology produces flawless prints. There are no grains. In a year or two, pixel will become so small it will become grain, he says with smile.        
	He continues: Earlier, when you were shooting for 10 days in the Himalayas on film you didnt know what was going on. This journey had a little bit of mystery. Now you can watch every step.        
	Yet, one has to wait for the energised moment. When he shot the photograph of the assignation on the Chitpur roof, he had to wait for the moment when the breeze lifted the womans pallu. That little extra is where your contribution comes in. All that is pretty and predictable is anti-creativity unless it energises.

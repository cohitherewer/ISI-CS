	Calcutta may well be Indias least livable metro, but few will deny its power to draw in all sorts.        
	Public space in this city is a bizarre mix of tradition and modernity, stubbornly timeless yet open to change, anxious to preserve an aura of noble gloom while hitting out against the limits of imagination. One has to only consider the Durga puja to realise how the past and the present come together in a spectacular celebration of life and art during this weeklong carnival.        
	Things are going to get better now.        
	Calcuttas tryst with world-class art began with the Kolkata Museum of Modern Art (KMOMA), the first-ever state-of-the-art museum in the country coming up in Rajarhat. The city will now host a major public art project, to be created by the German artist, Gregor Schneider, who won the Golden Lion Award at the 2001 Venice Biennale.        
	Speaking to Metro on Sunday, Schneider seemed excited by the prospect of a tour of the city. Public art, he said, forms a bridge between the museum and the studio. The former is open to the public but enclosed by four walls, while the latter remains exclusively private. But art in the open has many dimensions, inviting debate and discussion.        
	Indeed, the intellectual context for this project will be provided by a daylong international symposium at the Taj Bengal on Monday entitled Art in Public Space: Waste or Wonder?        
	Organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and Goethe Institut, in partnership with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the seminar is supported by KMOMA and the Art amp; Heritage Foundation, and sponsored by ICICI bank. It includes a distinguished line-up of artists, historians, critics, curators and policy-makers from India and abroad.        
	Although public art is a familiar phenomenon in the West, the genre is fairly new to India, which anyway has a dismal record in archiving, preservation and museology. So an artist embarking on a public project in an Indian city has to face that many more challenges.         
	But things could be as difficult in the best of circumstances, says Christine Litz, art historian and project manager of documenta 13 (an exhibition of contemporary art taking place in Kassel every five years).        
	Litz pointed out that even in Mnster (one of the most livable cities of the world), where a renowned sculpture project takes place every 10 years, artworks are marred with graffiti. But public interest led to better surveillance; the community came together for the sake of art.                                
	The idea is endorsed by Susanne Titz, director of the Stdtisches Museum Abteiberg in Mchengladbach.        
	Since the 1960s, the social role of art has gained prominence, she says, which makes community participation important for the success of public art  the latter must have the vision to engage with the imagination of many, and the intelligence to speak of matters that concern all of us.        
	But keeping aside vandalism, there is another subtle danger involved in public art. What if the work becomes just another fixture, so that people stop noticing it altogether? (As with Richard Serras column of twisted steel outside Liverpool Street Station in London, around which the homeless find refuge, tipsy Friday night crowds relieve themselves, and angsty youth scribble obscenities.)        
	Both Titz and Litz agree that there is a possibility of people growing indifferent to public art, so it may be a good idea to move it around.        
	Its enduring value often becomes clearer once the work is removed from the site and people start missing it.

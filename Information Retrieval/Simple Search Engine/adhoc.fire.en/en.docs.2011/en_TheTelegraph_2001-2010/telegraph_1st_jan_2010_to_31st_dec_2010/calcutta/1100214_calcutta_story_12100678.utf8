  - What Shah Rukh Khan should tell Bal Thackeray on the Day of the Cupid after the release of My Name is Khan                    Shah Rukh Khan (AFP)          
	All is not well with Bal Thackeray. He is still angry, antagonistic, calling people names. In fact, he is objecting to peoples names. He needs some lovin. Calcutta, the city of KKR, wants Shah Rukh Khan to send him a few Valentines and make him feel better.           
	Such as: I think of you often...I do,           
	From morning til evening I do,           
	When memories bring laughter,           
	Or moments bring pain,           
	There is faithfulness, too.           
	Or,           
	Im so glad,           
	Im so glad,           
	My name is fine,           
	Be my Valentine.           
	Or,           
	Roses are red,           
	Violets are blue,           
	My name is Khan,           
	What can I do?           
	Or,           
	Its Valentines Day           
	Just wishing you were here           
	You will always be near           
	Whenever I think of you I feel blue           
	But never give up hope.           
	There will always be another Friday.           
	And there is always the DVD.           
	Come and be my Valentine.           
	I always cherish your heart in mine.           
	Or,           
	Its all about lovin the family           
	Its all about lovin the family           
	Its all about lovin the family           
	Its all about lovin your lovies           
	Come and be my Valentine           
	And I will give you Aspirin.           
	Or,           
	The man who made Mumbai           
	You think you are forgot?           
	If you will be my Valentine           
	I promise to feel the shiver in my spine.           
	If Balasaheb is moved by such serenading, and feels the love in his heart, it will benefit him.           
	If it is a blocked nose, love would help. In a recent study of 479 healthy volunteers between ages 10 and 99, all participants received nasal drops containing rhinovirus, which causes the common cold. Researchers assessed the subjects on 14 types of relationships, including relationships with sons, nephews, Marathis, Biharis and Amitabh Bachchan, and the subject scored a point for each type of relationship if they spoke to a person in that category at least once every two weeks. The participants who reported only one, two or three types of relationships had more than four times the risk of developing a cold than those reporting six or more types of relationships.                     Bal Thackeray      
	If it is a heart that is blocked, perhaps with hostile feelings for other communities, love would help. A recent survey on 342 men and 112 women undergoing coronary angiography showed that those who felt the most loved and supported had fewer blockages in their heart arteries than the other subjects. In a related study, researchers looked at almost 10,000 married men with no prior history of angina. These men had high levels of risk factors, such as elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and electrocardiogram abnormalities. Those who felt their wives did not show them love experienced almost twice as much angina as the first group, who felt their wives showed love.           
	Even better than conjugal love is the love that is above personal interest. Romantic love can help to heal, but it hardly lasts. So the required love can come from a dog, cat, fish, or plants. Or a son, a nephew, Marathis, Biharis or Shah Rukh Khan.           
	Or be given to them. For if a man is lovin, he ages less. The results of a recent study on 1,042 senior citizens showed that the effects of aging were influenced more by what the participants emotional investment in their families and friends than what they received from it. The more lovin they do, the more they profit.           
	If Balasaheb is the selfish giant, his garden will bloom.           
	If all this can happen, on this day, the Shiv Sena chief will also have to admit that Valentines Day is no longer the silly, stupid, commercially motivated Western thing that he thought it was. If it is silly, stupid and commercially motivated still, it has become very Indian.

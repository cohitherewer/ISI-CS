	A team of film-makers, producers and members of the Artistes Forum met at actor Ranjit Mullicks home on Thursday to discuss a proposal on infrastructure upgrade of Tollywood, to be sent to the central government.         
	The meeting was organised after Mamata Banerjee recently interacted with representatives of the film industry and assured them that she would draw the information and broadcasting ministrys attention towards Tollywood.         
	Reviving two ailing post-production facilities  NFDC Film Centre in Behala and Rupayan in Salt Lake  tops the Tolly turnaround list.         
	The equipment at these two places have not been upgraded. Theres no infrastructure to support modern film-making, so we have to travel to Mumbai and Chennai for post-production, said director Haranath Chakraborty, who steered Thursdays meeting.         
	The proposal, which will be sent to the minister of state for I amp;B, C.M. Jatua, will focus only on the NFDC studio.

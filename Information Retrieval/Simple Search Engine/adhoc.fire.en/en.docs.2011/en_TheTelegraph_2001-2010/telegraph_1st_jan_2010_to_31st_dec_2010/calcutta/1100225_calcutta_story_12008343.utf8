The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hurdles many for heritage man
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hurdles many for heritage man
          PRIYANKA ROY                          Yeasin Pathan before one of the temples he has helped preserve. A Telegraph picture                                  
	History fascinates him. Archaeology is his passion. Md Yeasin Pathan is a school peon who has studied till Class VIII but is at the forefront of a rare movement. Over the past 35 years, the 50-year-old practising Muslim has been working relentlessly, against odds and opposition, to preserve 34 crumbling temples in his village of Pathra in West Midnapore, a two-hour drive from Calcutta.        
	Pathan has won several awards for his efforts, including the Presidents medal. In 2002, he was conferred the Courage Award by The Telegraph Education Foundation, which he gave away to children at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence.        
	Pathan recently became the only person from Bengal to receive the CID Gallantry Award, instituted by Sony Entertainment Television to commemorate the popular television series that enters its 13th year.        
	He stood out for his selfless contribution towards preserving our heritage, said a spokesperson for Sony.         
	Life hasnt been easy for Pathan thanks to his love for temples. I have been taunted by Muslims and beaten up by Hindus when I protested against the damage which was being done to these temples. I dont look at them as religious symbols, but as our countrys invaluable heritage, said the crusader, his voice quivering with passion.         
	Though his work over three decades bore fruit with The Archaeological Survey of India taking over the maintenance of 28 of the 34 temples, he himself is struggling to make ends meet.        
	I have to feed 15 mouths on a salary of Rs 7,500. My brother, a postgraduate in history, and my son who has studied computers are both unemployed. I have received no aid from the state government, despite repeated petitions to the chief minister, said Pathan, who is looking at using the cash component of his latest award to pay off a portion of the loan he took for his daughters marriage last August.        
	But award or no award, government help or not, Pathan is determined to continue his crusade. If each one of us does his bit to preserve our heritage, the world will be a much better place to live in.

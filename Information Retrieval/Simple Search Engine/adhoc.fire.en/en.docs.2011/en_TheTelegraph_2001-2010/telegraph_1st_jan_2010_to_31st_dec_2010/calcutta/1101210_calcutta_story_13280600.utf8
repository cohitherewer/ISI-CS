                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Boy call data sought 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sleuths probing the death of Class XII student Swastik Banerjee are banking on his cellphone call records to reveal why he took his life.         
	Swastik, a bright student of Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, fell to death from the top floor of the Mani Square mall on the EM Bypass on Tuesday.        
	The boys phone had been switched off since he left his Lake Gardens home that morning. Police said he had damaged his SIM card before the fatal fall.        
	We want to know whether Swastik spoke to anybody on the day of his death. If we find someone who had a dialogue with Swastik, we will speak to him or her, said an officer of Phoolbagan police station.        
	The police have sought the teenagers call records from the cellphone service provider that had issued his SIM card.        
	Cops visited the Banerjees Lake Gardens apartment on Thursday afternoon and spoke to Swastiks father, a senior BHEL official, and mother, a schoolteacher.        
	Swastik could not have fallen accidentally. There is also no evidence yet to suggest murder. The only possibility left is suicide. We want to know what led the student to such a tragic end, said an officer.

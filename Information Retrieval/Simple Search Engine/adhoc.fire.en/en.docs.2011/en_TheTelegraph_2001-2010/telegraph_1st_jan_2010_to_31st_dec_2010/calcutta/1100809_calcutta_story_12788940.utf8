                      Where the mind is without fear                    We are all free if we are ready to bear the consequences of our choices. Freedom means to be strong, devoid of fear and respecting others expression of individual freedom without prejudice, hatred and condemnation. It also means to restrict our power for the good of all, to consider the implications of our actions at every level, be it personal or family, within the community or country and even the world in which we live. In a broader sense, freedom means being able to live anywhere we want to without limitations and prejudice, understanding the common threads that connect us all, on a level that would allow us to tear down our borders and all our differences, political, religious and economical. Voice of Freedom, the ongoing group exhibition, is dedicated to the nation and is inspired by the ideas of freedom as expressed by Rabindranath Tagore and Sri Aurobindo. The participating artists have tried to articulate the concept of freedom of these two great men in their works. Featuring works by Atanu Mukherjee, Chandrima Bhattacharyya (a painting by her appears here), Eleena Banik, Mahmud Husain, Pushpal Sarkar, Rishav Gandhar Narzary, Santanu Maity, Seikh Shahjahan, Tanup Nath and others.

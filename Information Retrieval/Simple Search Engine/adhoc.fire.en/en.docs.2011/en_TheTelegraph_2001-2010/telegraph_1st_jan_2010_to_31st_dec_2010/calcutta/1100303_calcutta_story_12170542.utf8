	Around Rs 1 lakh was stolen from Girish Chandra Dey amp; Nakur Chandra Nandy, the 165-year-old sweet shop near Hedua Park, on Tuesday. The theft was discovered when the shop opened around 8am on Tuesday.         
	We keep the money in a wooden cash box, said Prasanta Nandy, one of the partners of the north Calcutta landmark.         
	Apart from the money collected from Mondays sales, the box contained cash meant for buying milk and sugar and paying the telephone and electricity bills of the shop, located at 56 Ramdulal Sarkar Street, he said.         
	Around Rs 35,000 from my personal account, kept in a polythene bag, was also stolen, Nandy added.         
	Two employees  Shankar Gugri, 50, and Surojit Gugri, 24,  were arrested in connection with the theft. The duo have been booked under IPC Section 308 that deals with stealing, said an officer of Girish Park police station.         
	Shankar had been working in the shop for a year and his nephew Surojit joined a month back, said a shop employee. The owners said they had recently caught Surojit stealing Rs 500. The shop, known for traditional sweets like jal bhora, parijat and dilkhush, remained open on Tuesday.         
	 Missing girl found: A five-year-old girl, who went missing from her Metiabruz home on Monday afternoon, was traced to Hasanpur village in Nandigram on Tuesday. Rabina Khatun was rescued by police and her father Sabir Ali. The police are probing if it was a case of kidnapping.         
	 Minor raped: Residents of two localities in the Bankra Badamtala area of Howrah clashed on Tuesday over the alleged rape of a minor girl. Police said the girl was found lying unconscious near a pond. Residents of her locality alleged that hoodlums living in a nearby locality who had abducted and raped the girl had attacked them after the girls family decided to lodge a police complaint. No one has been arrested yet.         
	 Township robbery: An elderly couple, Monideep and Jayanti Chatterjee, living at IA 112 in Salt Lake woke up on Tuesday morning to discover their almirah open. Rs 10,000, watches, cellphones and a camera were missing, they said. Police said the couples room, located on the ground floor, was probably sprayed with a chemical.         
	 Security meet: Home secretary Ardhendu Sen held a meeting with senior officers of North 24-Parganas police at New Town police station on Tuesday for stepping up security arrangements in the township in the light of the kidnap of IT professional Sandipan Das. Sen said plans were afoot to set up another police outpost in New Town.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Woman thrown out of Writers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Woman thrown out of Writers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 30-year-old woman visitor was allegedly removed by force from Writers Buildings on Tuesday after she demanded an audience with home secretary Ardhendu Sen without an appointment.         
	Sens personal secretary had asked security personnel to issue a visitors slip to Nadia resident Asima Pal when she sought a meeting with him at the state secretariat gate. The woman, separated from her husband five years ago, was accompanied by her four-year-old daughter.        
	Asima was not happy with the meeting and wanted to see Sen immediately. She sat down outside his room, in the first-floor VIP corridor, said a cop.        
	According to Writers employees, Asima, with the child on her lap, was carried out of the building by women cops after about 15 minutes. The police, however, said the two were accompanied to a ground-floor room where they were served lunch and then asked to leave.         
	Sen refused comment. The commotion in the corridor prompted the chief minister to seek a report on the incident.

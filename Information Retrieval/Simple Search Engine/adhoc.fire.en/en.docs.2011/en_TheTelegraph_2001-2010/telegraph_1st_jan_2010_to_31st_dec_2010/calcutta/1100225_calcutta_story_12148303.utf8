	Calcutta was muggy and cloudy on Wednesday, with some parts of the city receiving light rain late in the afternoon.         
	Incursion of abundant moisture from the Bay of Bengal has resulted in the sudden formation of a cloud cover over south Bengal, which pushed up the discomfort factor on Wednesday.         
	The weatherman, however, said Thursday was likely to be windy and rainy and less uncomfortable. The conditions are conducive to rain or thundershower in and around Calcutta on Thursday, said an official of India Meteorological Department in Delhi.        
	There could be squall in some areas towards the afternoon. The rain is likely to be accompanied by wind blowing at 50-60 km per hour in some areas of Calcutta and its surroundings. The minimum temperature should also drop by around three degrees, he said.        
	The minimum temperature on Wednesday was six degrees above normal at 23.2.         
	The humidity, too, was high, with the maximum touching 96 per cent.

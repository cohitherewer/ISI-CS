          A two-day international conference revisits Rabindranath Tagore the bishwakabi, reports Somak Ghoshal                            (From top) Sugata Bose welcomes Amartya Sen to Netaji Bhavan and briefs him about the car that Subhas Chandra Bose had escaped in on the night of January 17, 1941; Sen on the dais with Krishna Bose and George Yeo, the foreign minister of Singapore.

	Ironic as it may sound, Bengalis have always been somewhat uncomfortable with the idea of sharing their beloved bishwakabi with the rest of the world. Till the copyright on the works of Rabindranath Tagore expired in 2001, Visva-Bharati had total control over the poets posthumous legacy. Ten years on, into his 150th birth anniversary, the man who sailed to the far shores to bring the world home continues to be monopolised by Bengalis.        
	Yet, Tagore left behind a more widespread resonance than what most Bengalis care to remember today. Invoked with similar reverence by dissimilar entities, such as the American president and the Chinese premier, Tagores influence transcends race, culture and nationality.        
	This different universalism propounded by Tagore was the theme of a two-day international conference in the city this week.        
	Organised by the Netaji Research Bureau (NRB) and Kolkata Museum of Modern Art (KMoMA), it was the fourth in a series of conferences that began in Boston, and was followed by two more in Singapore and Beijing.        
	Scholars from America, England, Singapore, China, Japan and India spoke on a range of topics, from the visual arts to distant voyages, translation to transnationalism, in order to place Tagore in a historical context vis--vis his Asian and European contemporaries.        
	Patriotism cannot be our final shelter. My refuge is humanity, Tagore once wrote.        
	This sentiment assumes an overriding importance in the present crisis of civilisations, as the East and the West become increasingly polarised. It would be useful to think of Tagore as a proponent of multiple and competing universalisms rather than of a theory of the clash of civilisations, said Sugata Bose, professor of history at Harvard and one of the prime movers behind the conference. Tagores universalist vision, as Krishna Bose, chairperson of NRB, pointed out, was hailed by Subhas Chandra as his comprehensive sadhana, which, as Amartya Sen explained in his inaugural speech, was based on his commitment to reasoning.        
	It is this inherent rationality that makes Tagores universalism so appealing to contemporary diplomatic discourse. He remains abidingly relevant to realpolitik.              
	THE CHINA LINE        
	In his keynote address, George Yeo, foreign minister of Singapore, stressed the necessity of realising Tagores dream for good relations between India and China. Tagores works are the most translated after Shakespeare in China, he said. A project is now on to translate Tagore directly from Bengali to Chinese. Dwelling on Tagores intimate ties with China, Yeo claimed that the issue of war and peace in Asia would be decided by how the relationship between India and China develops in the years to come. Hopefully, the logic of better lives, on both sides, will prove irresistible.        
	Indeed, there is a great deal that modern China can gainfully imbibe from Tagores syncretic vision of universalism into which, he claimed, the best of Hindu, Muslim and British cultures was distilled. Wang Gungwu, university professor at the National University of Singapore (NUS), spoke eloquently of Tagores reasoned integration of Western influences into an Indian way of life.        
	In contrast, Wang sketched the life and work of Gu Hongming (1857-1928), probably the most celebrated Chinese scholar around 1913, when Tagore became internationally renowned. Born in Penang and educated at Edinburgh University while Thomas Carlyle was its rector, Gu was steeped in Western values, before he rejected them in favour of his vision of an idealised China. He was a reborn Confucian idealist who, unlike Tagore, approached the West in a confrontational mode, Wang said. Gu is an example of what can go wrong if you adopt such a strategy.        
	Wangs view was corroborated by Prasenjit Duara, of NUS, who, in his perceptive analysis of the present crisis of sustainability, qualified Tagores cosmopolitanism as one that grew out of rooted attachments. Wangs admiration for Tagore was echoed by Tan Chung, an acclaimed scholar of India-China relations, who spoke of the poets yearning for a place not here but beyond as expressed in the poem, Balaka.        
	Liu Jian, of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, reiterated Chinas indebtedness to India. Tagore poems have been texts in Chinese schools since the 1950s, he said. However, as Japanese scholar Kyoko Niwa explained, Tagores initial reception in Asia was not uniformly adulatory. When Tagore first visited Japan in 1916, Japanese intellectuals were largely indifferent to him  a poet from a ruined nation. The harshness of this verdict is often obscured by the attention that is lavished on Tagores friendship with Okakura Tenshin, when leading Japanese poets and thinkers of the day felt that Tagores message was too optimistic and unsatisfactory, that his speeches did not reflect the agonies of the Indian people.              
	BEYOND ASIA        
	In Europe and Latin America, Tagore got a more sympathetic response. For instance, in Argentina, he still remains a legendary figure, said Diana Sorensen, the dean of humanities at Harvard University and an expert on Latin American literature. In 1924, when Tagore visited Argentina, where he met Victoria Ocampo, his fame preceded his arrival in Buenos Aires. The Argentine daily, La Nacin, sent a reporter to meet him when his ship arrived at Montevideo, such was his reputation.        
	In France, Tagore forged another great friendship of his life, with Romain Rolland, who helped translate and disseminate his works. While charting the spiritual and intellectual affinities between Rolland and Tagore, Chinmoy Guha, of Calcutta University, also pointed out the latters profound disappointment with Tagores uncritical view of Mussolini.        
	Tagores attitude towards Europe was no doubt complicated, if not ambiguous. He famously gave his poetry to Bengal but his paintings to Europe, the continent where he extensively showed his art in the 1930s. In his paper on Tagore and global modernism, art historian Partha Mitter discussed the influence of German aesthetics, especially that of the Bauhaus style of Walter Gropius and Johannes Itten, on Tagore. However, Tagores appreciation was not always reciprocated. The German press criticised his work as dilettantish Kitsch  a view that suggested a general incomprehension of what he was trying to do.        
	As philosopher Saranindranath Tagore clarified, Rabindranaths late flowering into a painter signified a break in his metaphysical thinking; his art is about the limits of representation. So, even as Paul Klee found his poetry unappealing and lacking in humour, Austrian art historian Stella Kramrisch became a lifelong admirer and spent years teaching in Santiniketan. Kris Manjapras survey of Kramrischs career, especially of her pioneering role in organising the great exhibition of European art in Calcutta in 1922, traced the roots of artistic internationalism in Bengal.        
	It was a readiness to embrace other cultures, as art historian R. Siva Kumar put it, that became the source of the intellectual richness of the Tagores of Jorasanko. Such a generosity of spirit should ideally inform our experience of Tagores afterlife as well. As art historian Tapati Guha-Thakurta said, it is time to ponder if India, or any institution, should have a proprietorial right on Tagore. It is so difficult to see his works even in Rabindra Bhavan in Santiniketan, she said, voicing what remains a common complaint.        
	Since Visva-Bharati has already lost the precious Nobel medal, it may not be a bad thing if it now lost its illustrious recipient to the whole wide world.              
	Our Tagore and their Tagore                  Pramita Mallick performs at the conference      
	It is appropriate that the conference ended with a concert of Tagore songs by Laisa Ahmed Lisa from Bangladesh  as Amartya Sen pointed out, there is a certain symbolism in Tagore being the composer of the national anthems of both India and Bangladesh. One of the finest Rabindrasangeet singers now, Lisa sang from the Puja and Prem sections of the Gitabitan. Using minimal accompaniment, she evoked the full drama of the songs through expert modulation of her voice. In the course of the two days, Pramita Mallick also rendered Tagore songs with full-throated ease, once again with no frills, and at one point even without any accompaniment.        
	The final session, addressed by Fakrul Alam, professor of English at Dhaka University, focused on traditions of translating Tagore. Alam argued that the archaic style of the early translators is being gradually replaced by livelier renditions, bolstered by newer techniques and theories of translations, since the 1980s. Sukanta Chaudhuri, professor emeritus at Jadavpur University and general editor of the Oxford Tagore Translations, pointed out that while most nations dont care about how their great literature is translated, Bengalis remain obsessed about how Tagore is presented in translation to the rest of the world. And excessive enthusiasm is known to inspire as well as impede creative thinking.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two men injured in the Vidyasagar Setu toll plaza mishap on Friday night remained critical on Sunday.        
	Dipankar Roy, who was on the way to his Shibpur home in a taxi that night, is admitted to the High Dependency Unit of CMRI Hospital. The 33-year-old, who works for a finance firm and has a three-month-old daughter, fractured his legs and has injuries in his ribs, spinal cord and shoulders.        
	Sanjay Thakur, who was driving Roy, is admitted to SSKM Hospitals New Emergency ward. The 38-year-old has a broken right leg and chest injuries and is having trouble breathing.        
	A trailer loaded with logs lost control and slammed into cars and taxis  including the one Roy and Thakur were in waiting at the toll gate before turning turtle on two taxis. Two persons died and eight were injured. Six of the injured were treated and discharged.        
	Roys condition is critical. We have been able to stop his internal bleeding and control his blood pressure with medicines but he is remaining unconscious for most of the day, said a doctor.        
	Lying on the floor of the New Emergency ward, Sanjay Thakur recalled Fridays nightmare. My taxi was in the toll plaza queue when suddenly I heard a loud sound. I lost consciousness before I could turn around. I opened my eyes to find people bring me out of the mangled vehicle. My passenger was groaning in pain in the back seat, said the resident of Uma Das Lane near New Market.        
	The driver of the trailer, Bindeshwar Chowdhury, was arrested on Kona Expressway. He has been booked with charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and reckless driving, said a cop.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The 44-year-old woman arrested from her Picnic Garden home on Monday night for duping a trader of Rs 1 lakh had allegedly taken the money to admit his son in a reputable English-medium school on AJC Bose Road.         
	Janice Ann Martin, who has two children, had duped several people in the same way, changing her residence after taking money from them, said a cop. Her accomplices are at large.         
	Janice had met Rajesh Sharma, a Baguiati-based trader, on May 18 in central Calcutta and had allegedly given him a fee book of the school without any name written on it in exchange for the money. Sharma lodged a police complaint when his sons name did not figure on the nursery admission list.

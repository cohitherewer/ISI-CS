The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cash amp; wash to save wall
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cash amp; wash to save wall
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state election commission has announced a three-pronged strategy to restore the citizens right to his walls in the run-up to the civic polls though similar measures before the last Lok Sabha elections had proved futile.        
	The poll panel has asked police to prepare a list of public and private buildings being defiled by political parties, get the walls cleaned and painted, and start a case against the persons who have wielded the paintbrush. Yet again, there is no mention of what can be done to penalise political parties orchestrating the graffiti.        
	We have asked the police to take action wherever they come across a violation. Law must take its course, said Khalil Ahmed, the district magistrate of South 24-Parganas and returning officer for the civic polls in the city.        
	Ahmed claimed that the authorities had come up with a fool-proof system to ensure the defiled walls were wiped clean and the violators booked.        
	The panel will release Rs 1,000 per address for the police and the civic body to get the walls cleaned and whitewashed. This was decided at a meeting today. The money will be released from Saturday. The walls of the polling stations that have been or will be defiled will also be cleaned before the elections, Ahmed said.        
	The election commission, Ahmed added, has asked the police to be pro-active in fighting the paintbrush brigade that functions in violation of the model code of conduct and register a case under Section 202 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, 1980.        
	If convicted, the perpetrator, or the person who has defiled the wall, can be jailed for up to six months and/or fined up to Rs 50,000. The law does not permit us to touch the parties or the candidates behind the defacement, said an official.        
	According to the law, graffiti is banned on public buildings. As for private properties, parties must take written permission from the owners before defacing the walls. The consent has to be submitted to the police within three days of receiving it or at least three days before the defacement begins, whichever is earlier.        
	A senior police officer expressed doubt on the efficacy of the panels move. Similar announcements were made before the last Lok Sabha elections but no one could beat the graffiti gang. The exercise has become a ritual as political parties and their candidates have no regard for the code of conduct, said an officer.        
	Asis Banerjee, of Park Circus, said walls could be kept clean only if there was a mass movement. Banerjee should know as he heads an organisation comprising residents of Talbagan-Orient Row that has forced political parties to spare the walls of the neighbourhood.

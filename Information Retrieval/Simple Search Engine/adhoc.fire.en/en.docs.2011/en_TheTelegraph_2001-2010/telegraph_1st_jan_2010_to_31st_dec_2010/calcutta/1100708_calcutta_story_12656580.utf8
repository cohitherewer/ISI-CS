The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Three on goal and two off the mark   Dutch and go 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Three on goal and two off the mark   Dutch and go 
  - Dutch tourist wills the Oranje to victory from Sudder Street cafe           POULOMI BANERJEE                           Esther Berg (right) and a friend cheer a goal by The Netherlands at a Sudder Street cafe on Tuesday night. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                        
	Esther Berg may not have consulted Paul the psychic Octopus but she did get her prediction right for the second time in as many matches  well, at least the Dutch side of the scoreline.        
	We will win. I think we will score three goals, declared the 27-year-old from Zwolle, looking pretty in a blue dress, minutes before the midnight kick-off on Tuesday.        
	Esther, who had watched the quarters perched on a wooden seat at Hotel Maria on Sudder Street and predicted that the Dutch would win, shifted to Rajs Spanish Caf across the road for the semis.        
	I am with my friends from across Europe, including Germany, Portugal and England. They are all supporting The Netherlands tonight, she smiled.        
	Metro tracked the myriad moods of the lady in blue on the Oranjes big night.        
	12.06am: Oops! Alvaro Periera of Uruguay shoots from close to 50 yards but it drifts over the crossbar. Esther heaves a sigh of relief. I hope Uruguay wont be able to score any goal, so it will be a 3-0 victory for us, she says.        
	12.18am: Wow! First strike by Giovanni van Bronckhorst, greeted with a Yesssss! from Esther and Good! Good! Good! from her friends. Esther now has an I-told-you-so look on her face. But shes predicted three, right?         
	12.21am: Foul! The South Americans are desperate for the equaliser, and its showing. I dont know who he is, says Esther of the player in orange who has just been fouled. She is looking worried.        
	12.41am: Oh, no! Esther is a picture of heartbreak as Diego Forlan hits home for 1-1. There goes the 3-0 prediction, though it can still be 3-1. It was a good goal, she concedes. Come on, Holland.                          
	12.44am: Grrr! A minute to go for half-time, Uruguay is on the offensive and Esther is angry. What is Holland doing? she screams. It will be a disaster if we lose today.         
	Half-time: Smell the coffee! The tension is getting to Esther. Still 1-1, she rues.        
	1.22am: Yessss! The smile is back on Esthers face as Wesley Sneijder gets the lead with a low shot. This is great, she screams.        
	1.25am: Wish fulfilment! Goal number three, and part of Esthers prediction comes true. That Arjen Robben, one of her two favourite players (Sneijders the other), has scored is a bonus. I can relax now, she announces.         
	1.44am: Oh, dear! Its not over yet. Pereira has just reduced the deficit. It would be ridiculous if we lose now, worries Esther.         
	1.46am: Please, no! The Uruguayans are pushing for the equaliser and Esther is willing the match to end. The referee has added five minutes, and shes screaming foul. Does he want Uruguay to win? she demands.         
	1.47am: Whistle and whoop! Esther is ecstatic but cautious about the final. We have to play better, she sighs.

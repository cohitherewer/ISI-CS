The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The way we know our Esplanade
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      The way we know our Esplanade
          AYAN BANERJEE                                            
	Calcutta is in Calcutta, the high priests of anarchy proved on Thursday, with a rally taking over the road and hawkers devouring the pavements as Esplanade donned a familiar look of chaos following a fleeting tryst with order the day before.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee vowed to fight political anarchy from a dais in Metro channel but one of his comrades went Orey baba, at the thought of wading home through the traffic anarchy the chief minister presided over on Thursday afternoon.        
	The city centre came to a standstill, thanks to the august presence of our popular chief minister, barely 24 hours after his police took the unusual initiative of enforcing the rule of law.        
	Rallies had been banned and hawkers kept away to allow President Pratibha Patil a smooth ride and Calcuttans a rare treat.        
	On Thursday, two-thirds of Chowringhee Road was back to being blocked  this time by primary school teachers ferried from faraway places by CPM-organised buses to hear their leaders rail against the nairajya (anarchy) being unleashed all around.        
	The teachers squatted on the thoroughfare, sipped lemon tea, threw traffic haywire and justified it all with a shrug of their shoulders.        
	There is no other way we can make ourselves heard, said Tanusree Saha, a young teacher with a badge of the CPM union pinned to her sari.        
	Whats the point of being heard by inconveniencing  even angering  thousands of weekday commuters?        
	Tanusree broke into a smile. People were abusing the rally in the private bus I took while coming here. She would have probably sided with them had it not been the rally she was going to. Thank God, they didnt know where I was headed.        
	A teacher of a city school, she was constantly on the phone at the rally site, trying to get in touch with a colleague who had not reached from Moulali, a kilometre away, in an hour. The snarls had stretched to Girish Park in the north and Rabindra Sadan in the south.        
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee of Trinamul was a victim of the anarchy as he was forced to dive underground and take the Metro around 3.15pm to reach office after a programme at Bagbazar.        
	The heart of the city choked, the police were left gasping less than 24 hours after they were caught grinning at the sight of a Chowringhee devoid of traffic snarls and hawker raj.        
	A half-bitten ice cream cone in one hand and several shopping bags in the other, Madhuparna Guha sighed Ohmygawwd as she stepped on to Chowringhee Road from Lindsay Street. The Asutosh College student lives in Serampore and takes a train home from Howrah every day. The station seemed so far away on Thursday afternoon.        
	Sitting in a car stuck at the red light, JD Birla School student Racheta said it took her 15 minutes to reach the SN Banerjee Road-RR Avenue crossing from the Press Club, less than a kilometre away.        
	Monika Debnath would have shrugged hearing Rachetas plight. This is the usual. Wednesday was an exception, said the fashion designing student walking down Chowringhee Road to escape the jostle on the pavement.        
	Monikas shrug would have heaved into a Mexican wave if all those who said this is the usual were put together.        
	Rohit Gupta had even found the Grand hotel arcade kind of weird when the hawkers disappeared as Chowringhee put its best face forward for the President. It definitely looked much cleaner and better but kind of weird, said the youth.        
	As he spoke, someone was introducing and reintroducing Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee our popular chief minister on the dais about 100 metres away. A lady teacher in the audience stole a glance at her watch and turned to see the anarchy around.        
	Have you thought how youll reach home (Madhyamgram)? Orey baba!        
	Who do you blame for the traffic chaos at Esplanade? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Old boys club: Maharaj and Chhota Maharaj
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Old boys club: Maharaj and Chhota Maharaj
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                                    WHEN A NAUGHTY CRICKETER MET A GOOD BOY: Yuvraj Singh and Sourav Ganguly indulged in some fun and games on the sets of Dadagiri at the Dumurjola Stadium in Howrah on Wednesday. Pictures by Aranya Sen                                  
	Yuvraj yaane ki Chhota Maharaj Dada was the Maharaj of the team and I was the Chhota Maharaj.        
	That was then. When one was the Team India captain and the other his protg. Today both the southpaws are struggling for a place in the squad  Maharaj in KKR and Chhota Maharaj in the Team India Test side.        
	So when Sourav Ganguly met Yuvraj Singh on Wednesday afternoon, it was a reunion of a very different sort. The venue was a stadium all right  Dumurjola stadium in Howrah  but the only cover drive being played here was a round of Q amp;A. For it was on the sets of Dadagiri where Dada the quizmaster met Yuvi the special guest.        
	While quizzing was the main course, the two spent considerable time on starters and tidbits  remembering the good ol days in the dressing room. And there was, of course, an appeal from the ex-skipper to bring one of his favourite former teammates back in the squad.         
	Yuvraj has got very limited opportunity to perform in Tests... wish he gets more chances in that form of the game, Sourav said, adding that a lot more is to come from the stylish six-hitter.        
	Later Yuvi confirmed to Metro that Dada had made the time to pass on some tips on his Test batting.        
	Yuvraj won his first India cap when an injury kept Sourav out in 2003. He is a better player than the player he replaced, Dada quipped, even as Yuvi  described as matchwinner and outstanding player  protested.        
	Sourav also batted to bolster Yuvrajs off-the-field image, despite referring to him as a naughty cricketer and even Romeo.        
	I have played with Yuvi for 10 years and let me tell you that much of what is said about him is blown out of proportion.        
	Yuvraj on his part lived up to his mast image dancing to the Dabangg title song and admitting that female fans would have to pass through Chhota Maharaj before being able to reach Maharaj when they both were among the most sought-after men in blue. I was always a good boy, Yuvi can vouch for me, Sourav chipped in.        
	The screen behind was playing out the not-so-good- boy images of Sourav Ganguly waving his shirt on the Lords balcony after the Natwest Trophy triumph.        
	That was then. At the Dumurjola Stadium on Wednesday, the naughty cricketer quickly took a couple of steps and checked out what the good boy was wearing inside. No cricket gear, for sure.        
	Who is a better batsman: Sourav or Yuvraj? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com

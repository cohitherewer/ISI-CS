The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Skipper still on song
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Skipper still on song
          RITH BASU                                          Sourav at the college function. (Aranya Sen)        
	With his first Team India captain padded up as a politician on Monday, Sourav Ganguly donned the hat of KKR skipper-cum-reluctant cheerleader for a college function.        
	Cries of Korbo lorbo jitbo re greeted Sourav at a Nazrul Mancha packed for Prayas, the annual socials of Prafulla Chandra, better known as South City College. Egged on by band Cactuss lead vocalist Sidhu, the crowd just refused to stop their chanting of the KKR anthem, demanding that their hero sing along.        
	He is our idol, the icon we look up to and as far as cricket is concerned, he is our god, Abhishek Chakraborty, the cultural secretary of the college, told Metro, barely audible above the happy din.        
	Jeeti agey, tarpor eta geyo (First let us win, then you can sing this song), pointed out Sourav to roars of laughter.        
	No, seriously, he drove home the point, I have promised Shah Rukh Khan never to sing this song again before we actually start winning.        
	The start was tentative, but by the time his 20-minute cameo ended, Sourav was in full flow. Enough for him to briefly break his promise to King Khan and join the college band in singing the opening line of Korbo lorbo jitbo re.        
	Earlier, the 37-year-old had thanked the students for inviting him to the first annual socials of a school or college that he had ever attended. I am told you have been doing well in the CAB and CU cricket tournaments, as well as in football, smiled the footballer-turned -cricketer.

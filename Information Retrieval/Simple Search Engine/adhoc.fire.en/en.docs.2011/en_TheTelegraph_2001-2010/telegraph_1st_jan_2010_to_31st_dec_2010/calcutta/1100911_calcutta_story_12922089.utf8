                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Students relent after promise
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh comes out of Aurobindo Bhavan after the gherao was lifted. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Jadavpur University students lifted the over 50-hour gherao of the 15 executive council members on Friday evening following an assurance that they would have a say in where security cameras will be installed on campus.        
	We are happy that the authorities have accepted our demand, said a leader of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu). He also expressed satisfaction with the authorities assurance that security measures would be reviewed.        
	Leaders of Jadavpur University Teachers Association (Juta) tried to end the stand-off on Friday morning by holding a series of meetings with the council members and students who staged the gherao.        
	The gherao started at 3pm on Wednesday while a council meeting was in progress to finalise the implementation of a string of security measures, including installation of closed-circuit television cameras on campus and students hostels.        
	The protesters had not budged even after some executive council members on Friday morning complained of health problems because of the strain.         
	Vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh made it clear after the gherao was withdrawn that cameras would be installed at certain spots on the campus even if students object.        
	There are some critical spots, such as Aurobindo Bhavan that houses our main administrative offices, the libraries and the university gates. We will not entertain objections to cameras being installed at these spots, said Ghosh.        
	Agitating students had expressed reservations about security cameras being installed at Aurobindo Bhavan and in the libraries on Wednesday.         
	The vice-chancellor clarified that the review of the measures as demanded by the students would not lead to a major change in plan.        
	Since I have not discussed the issues directly with the students, I do not know what exactly they want. But we will not change our decision on installation of CCTV cameras, said Ghosh.         
	We were concerned as the situation had been getting from bad to worse. Moreover, the agitation was also affecting the normal classes in the departments. So we decided to intervene, said a Juta leader.

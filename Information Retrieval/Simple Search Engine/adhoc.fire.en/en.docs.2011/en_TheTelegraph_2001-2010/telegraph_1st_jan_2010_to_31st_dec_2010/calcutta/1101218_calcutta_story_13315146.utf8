The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Note on unity in diversity
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Note on unity in diversity
          SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI                          Ramachandra Guha at the LSG event. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	A day after the Calcutta launch of his book, Makers of Modern India published by Penguin, Ramachandra Guha was back at the Taj Bengal on Friday evening on the invitation of the Ladies Study Group of the Indian Chamber of Commerce to speak on why India is the most interesting country in the world.        
	Taking out a crisp Rs 500 from his wallet, Guha held it up for the audience. The denomination is written in 17 different scripts. The rupee note represents the extraordinary diversity contained in a single nation-state, he said. That makes India the most interesting country in the world.         
	The European concept of nation is based on three criteria: a) a common language; b) a common religion; c) a common enemy. But Indian nationalism was not founded on these principles.        
	Describing India as bizarre, unique, magical, The Telegraph columnist admitted that while it may be exasperating to be a citizen of India, it is a privilege to be a historian of this country. And he finds manifestation of this ever so often, be it in an Amritsar dhaba between Itanagar and Guwahati or whisky-guzzling, non-vegetarian Punjabis putting their money in a bank headquartered on Rajaji Salai in Chennai.        
	Five different revolutions are taking place simultaneously in India  industrial, urban, national, democratic and social, said Guha. Juxtaposing India with the US, he showed how the US went through a national revolution in 1776, an urban and industrial revolution in the 19th century and a social revolution only in the 20th century. That makes India the most interesting country in the world.        
	India produces the most interesting characters, was the next line of thought. Guha touched upon the extraordinary lives of three people as diverse as the country itself  Chandi Prasad Bhatt, a Class X pass-out of peasant origins and a bus conductor-turned Gandhian social activist who led the Chipko Movement; Miraben, the daughter of an English admiral who became one of Gandhis close disciples; Kannada novelist-activist Shivram Karanth. All pioneers of the green cause in their own way.        
	And when the floor was thrown open to the audience, the questions were longer than the answers they received. That makes India the most interesting country in the world.

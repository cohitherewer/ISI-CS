                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      SC boost to bar on bus entry
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the state governments right to refuse permits to stage carriages (long-distance buses) to stop them from entering Calcutta, thus increasing congestion and pollution.         
	The state transport department had refused two permits  between Dhulian Bazar and Calcutta and Raghunathganj and Calcutta  sought in 1997 and 1998 on the basis of recommendations of an expert committee.        
	The transport authority had offered the applicants permits from Dhulian Bazar to Barasat and Raghunathganj to Barasat.         
	The applicants had challenged the decision in Calcutta High Court. In April 2001, a division bench of the court had held that the authorities did not have the right to curtail the routes.        
	The state government then moved the Supreme Court, which ruled that the government could stop buses from entering Calcutta.         
	The Bengal government had argued that the entry of vehicles into Calcutta was being restricted in a phased manner according to recommendations by experts.         
	The applicants sought exemption on the ground that their applications pre-dated the policy. The apex court rejected their plea. The judgment was delivered by justices R.V. Raveendran and P. Sathasivam.

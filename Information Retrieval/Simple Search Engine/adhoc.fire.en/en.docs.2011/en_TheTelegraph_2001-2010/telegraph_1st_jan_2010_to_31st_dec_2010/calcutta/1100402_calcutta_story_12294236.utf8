The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blaze victims launch unity bid
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Blaze victims launch unity bid

	Representatives of all four blocks of fire-ravaged Stephen Court met on Thursday for the first time since the March 23 disaster to discuss reviving the old residents association or forming a new one to face the challenges ahead together.         
	Sources said the meeting at Calcutta Swimming Club, attended by 15 representatives, agreed on the need to have an active residents association but there were differences over the fate of the highly dangerous and unsafe parts of Blocks I and II, recommended for demolition by the civic body.        
	Residents of Blocks I and II raised questions about how the association would press the authorities to reconstruct the damaged portions and let them reside in the building, said one of those who attended the meeting.        
	The committee probing the fire tragedy also met for the first time on Thursday and decided to invite depositions in writing from members of the public to kick-start the probe.        
	The commission will set up an office at Jal Sampad Bhavan in Salt Lake, from where it will operate from next week. We will soon place print advertisements seeking depositions in writing, said former chief secretary S.N. Roy, who is the chairman of the committee.         
	An expert from Jadavpur University joined the 11-member committee on Thursday, which later met at the office of the state human rights commission at Bhawani Bhavan.        
	The panel will first look into the legal condition of the building and the nature of modifications and alterations carried out over the years. It will also look into allegations of negligence on the part of the owners or tenants of Stephen Court.        
	Earlier in the day, a team from CESC inspected Stephen Court and asked the residents of the unaffected blocks to submit the necessary safety clearance from the authorities for power to be restored to the building.        
	They need to get the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the fire services departments clearance along with a certificate from any government licensed electrical contractor stating that the wiring is fine, said a senior CESC official.         
	Power supply was disconnected on the afternoon of March 23 when a fire broke out on the fourth floor of the Park Street landmark, killing 43 people.        
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti had asked the Stephen Court residents to either revive their defunct association or form a new one to co-ordinate repairs and ensure proper maintenance of the building.        
	We decided to form a new association as most of the residents were dissatisfied with the attitude of the members of the old association that primarily comprised elderly people. Most of the residents present at the meeting on Thursday were in favour of a new association with young members holding the crucial posts, a source said.        
	The small turnout at the meeting, however, prevented the association from being formed immediately. A meeting of all residents has been convened on Sunday to elect representatives to the committee.        
	Persons nominated for the main posts will be put to an open vote by raising hands. A select group of residents will attend a meeting on Friday to discuss the issues raised in the first session and try and answer the questions that could come up on Sunday, a flat owner said.

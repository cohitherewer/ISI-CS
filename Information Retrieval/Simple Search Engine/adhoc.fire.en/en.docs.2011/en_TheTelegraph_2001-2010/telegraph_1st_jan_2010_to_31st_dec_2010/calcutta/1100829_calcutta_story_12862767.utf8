                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A visionary amp; two little warriors 
  Knowledge hub in the heart of rural Bengal                                      Santosh Kumar Das at Gangadharpur Shiksha Mandir in Howrah. Pictures by Anindya Shankar Ray       
	Nestled among ponds and paddy fields, around 38km from Calcutta, a narrow brick lane leading to it, a school of learning is growing bit by determined brick  the toil of a 74-year-old man never giving up on his dream.  
	Santosh Kumar Das, now a retired headmaster, was three months old when his father died and he moved from his village Semanti in Howrah to his maternal uncles house in Gangadharpur in Howrah.        
	It is here that Das sowed the first seeds of change four decades ago. It is here that a full-grown tree of learning now stands, with three schools, two colleges and the hopes of a university.        
	It is this dedication to the cause of education that saw Santosh Das being inducted into The Telegraph Hall of Fame at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence on Saturday.        
	As the Science City auditorium rose to salute Sir, he softly said: Many thanks. But I dont think I deserve the honour given to me today. I have much more to do. But this gives me encouragement and motivation to go on living and working even harder.        
	Days before the awards function, when Metro visited him on his turf of toil and triumph, the educationist in white dhoti-panjabi rewound to the very beginning. No one in this village was interested in education. Most just worked in the fields. I wanted to bring education to the people here.        
	But first, Das had to struggle to complete his own studies. He trudged 12 miles on foot to Amta College for BA classes in Bengali. To make ends meet, he had to take up a job in 1954  as the headmaster at Jagatpur Adarsha Bidyalay, two years after he passed his school final examination. He completed his graduation in private and went on to do his Masters in private.                  
	The seed of my dream had already been sown, of bringing a school and college to the village so that no one would have to struggle like me, said Das, sipping tea from a tiny cup in the faculty room of his latest addition to Gangadharpurs educationscape  its first B.Ed College.        
	His mother Umashashis insistence and his experience of the Ramakrishna Mission way of life while studying for his B.Ed degree in Belur Math began to shape the dream.        
	In 1964, Das set up the first school in his village and named it Gangadharpur Vidyamandir High School.        
	In 1969, Das set up the first girls school in his village and named it Gangadharpur Balika Vidyamandir.        
	There was no stopping the man that generations in Gangadharpur know simply as Sir.        
	All these institutions are spread over 75 bighas of land that I have pieced together painstakingly, first through voluntary donations and then by buying them from the landholders here, said Das.        
	This is one land acquisition process that has caused no heartburn, in a Gangadharpur grateful to its education messiah.         
	I would never have completed my education if it had not been for Sir. I was in the first batch in the Gangadharpur Vidyamandir High School and now look at me  I am the assistant headmaster! smiled Mohan Haldar.        
	A portion of the 75 bighas has now been set aside to build a hospital and house the Jawahar Naboday Vidyalay, a central government initiative to spread modern education.        
	Education has remained the focal point of Dass life despite a brush with politics. In 1977, he became a Forward Bloc MLA. I joined politics with many ideals, to do something more for the people here. I was quickly disillusioned and turned down the offer to contest in 1982, said Das.        
	Now, at 74, with his wife no more, his four children busy with their lives, and Gangadharpur something of a model village for education, what drives Das?        
	There is just one more dream that I need to fulfil, a rural university. I hope that I will be able to see it happen before I pass on, he said with a twinkle in his ageing eyes as he gazed at his creation  the schools, the colleges, the hostels and the buildings under construction.        
	Who would dare deny Santosh Das his dream?                           CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

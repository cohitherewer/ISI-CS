	The economic intelligence wing of the state finance department and police will jointly probe why IPL Club Lounge tickets at the Eden Gardens were sold for Rs 32,000 each despite the printed price being Rs 20,000, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said on Tuesday.         
	A senior police officer at Lalbazar said they were yet to hear from the department regarding the matter.        
	The minister added the government would charge an entertainment tax from the IPL authorities after it was ratified by the Assembly. If there is a problem in charging entertainment tax, we will levy a special tax on them, said Dasgupta at Writers Buildings.        
	He welcomed the central probe into IPL funds.

                                       The king wins: To the question Who is a better batsman: Sourav or Yuvraj? (Old boys club: Maharaj and Chhota Maharaj, December 23), there can be only one answer: Sourav Ganguly is the best.  Yuvraj is no doubt a great batsman but Sourav is better in totality. During his captaincy, the cricket team was in   superb condition and the concept of Team India was born. Yuvraj is hot and Ganguly is cool!			   Shankha Shuvro Chattopadhyay,  Dhakuria     
	Destruction of greenery in Calcutta is a common phenomenon (Pillage of Park Circus Maidan, December 18). If the book fair is not allowed to be held on the Park Circus Maidan on grounds of pollution, how can a circus be given the go-ahead?             
	It proves that the city civic body is irresponsible and worthless. It also proves that the wrongs perpetrated by the previous board of the corporation is continuing in the hands of change.           
	Legislative measures or even court orders wouldnt suffice to prevent environmental pollution. Like the distraught resident Mohammed Hashim of Talbgan, everybody feels that civic consciousness is conspicuous by its absence in Calcutta.           
	I think its only collective resistance by conscious citizens that can prevent the politically backed organisers from holding a circus on the Park Circus Maidan.

	Ramachandra Guhas latest book Makers of Modern India, published by Penguin, is an outstanding work (Bowl for past, bat for change, December 17). His selection of 19 persons who have shaped modern India is commendable. It is a matter of personal selection and assessment.             
	However, the exclusion of Swami Vivekananda is a little disheartening. Values preached by Vivekananda are practical and extremely relevant in the modern times. Campus violence, murders, students thrashing teachers, and abuse of women  all speak of a dark modern India. The nation needs a great teacher like Vivekananda.           
	I fear that if his views are deemed archaic today, the future generation, which might not be acquainted with his work, will discard Vivekananda altogether.

	The article Boy punches principal, December 16, reported a disgraceful incident that has dragged the teacher-student relationship to its nadir. I think what happened at St Aloysius Orphanage and Day School goes to show that the principal had no compassion for students, which is why he resorted to corporal punishment.

	Honking unnecessarily has become a habit with Calcuttans. Thanks to Metro, we finally have a proper drive to make the masses aware about the hazards of honking (Leander serve-and-volley in campaign for silence, December 21).             
	A few months back, I was in Thailand, where I could not hear a single horn on the road. I think we have to spread the message through leaflets and stickers in Bengali, Hindi and English to educate drivers of taxis, autos, buses, motorcycles and private vehicles about the ill-effects of honking.           
	This has to be a concerted effort by the traffic department, police and citizens.

	To treat a social evil we need to look at the roots of malaise. Spreading awareness against honking is fine, but we must ask: why do people honk? Leander Paess diagnosis is right that people blow the horn just to say I am here! It is a motorists way to let the world know that he has arrived. Making noise is perceived as empowerment by some. Case in point: auto drivers blaring deafening music, commuters on local trains playing loud music on cellphones, roadside temples playing devotional songs and private vehicles honking all through Calcuttan roads.

	The picture accompanying the report Politics draws campus blood, December 18, speaks volumes about the hypocrisy of our leaders. Politicians incite students and in case someone is injured or killed, they come out with wreaths. Students must learn from such incidents and stay clear of such leaders and violence.

	Increasing incidents of political clashes at educational institutes, gherao of teachers, boycott of exams and other student unrest indicate that everything other than studies is happening on our campuses.           
	Students would not have got the time or scope to indulge in politics if academics had kept them busy. The deterioration of teaching quality has robbed students of their interest in studies and led them to politics.

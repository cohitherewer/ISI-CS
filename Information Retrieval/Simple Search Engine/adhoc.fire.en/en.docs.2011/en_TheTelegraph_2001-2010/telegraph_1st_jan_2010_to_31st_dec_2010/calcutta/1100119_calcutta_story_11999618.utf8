The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Basus parting gift to science   Docs hail donation
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Basus parting gift to science

	Jyoti Basus body will be preserved and used to impart anatomy lessons to medical students once it is donated, the SSKM authorities announced on Monday.        
	Whether students would use the scalpel or the chalk on the body will be decided once doctors examine it, said Pradip Mitra, the director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM.        
	Donation is like cremation. Nobody should be inquisitive about what is happening to a donated body. Well decide how to use it best, he added.        
	Later, after attending a meeting convened by the health minister at Writers Buildings, Mitra revealed plans to preserve Basus brain and bones.        
	Donated bodies are typically used for dissection by students under the supervision of their teachers. But, anatomists said, cadavers of people who were thin could be preserved for surface marking  in which students are given pieces of chalk and asked to mark positions of the internal organs on the bodys surface. A cadaver preserved for surface marking can be used for at least two years.        
	According to SSKM doctors, Basus body will be taken to the temporal bone and cadaveric dissection laboratory of the anatomy department, where it will be measured and weighed before being injected with ethyl alcohol, formaldehyde and glycerine.        
	The body will then be put into the second chamber of the mortuary cooler and preserved at sub-zero temperatures. After seven to eight days, it will be ready for practical anatomy lessons.        
	To preserve the body any longer, it would have to be immersed in a formaldehyde solution and put into the mortuary cooler.        
	Dissections on human cadavers provide first-year medical students their first crucial lessons in human anatomy, said Prashant Natekar, a professor of anatomy at Goa Medical College.                                
	But even senior surgeons return to anatomy laboratories to sharpen their skills in a range of procedures from neurosurgery to joint replacements to ear operations by practising on cadavers, Natekar added.        
	Anatomists across the country hailed Basus decision to donate his body to medicine.         
	Theres a nationwide shortage of cadavers. Ideally, we need one body for 10 students, but in some colleges dozens or hundreds of students get to use a single body, said Sunder Lal Jethani, a professor of anatomy at the Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences, Dehra Dun, and the editor of the Journal of the Anatomical Society of India.        
	SSKM, however, does not suffer from a shortage of cadavers, said Mitra. But Tuesday will still be momentous.

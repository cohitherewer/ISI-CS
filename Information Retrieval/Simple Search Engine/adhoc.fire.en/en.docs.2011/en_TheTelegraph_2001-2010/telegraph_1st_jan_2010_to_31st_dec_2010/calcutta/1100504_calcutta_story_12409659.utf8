The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Early brush gets the wall in graffiti free-for-all
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Early brush gets the wall in graffiti free-for-all
  - Hawk eye of Election Commission makes way for indulgent gaze of state monitor for municipal vote          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          CPM graffiti on Sarat Ghosh Garden Road in Dhakuria                                        
	Graffiti raj is back in the city of might-is-right with the paintbrush brigade being allowed a free run for the civic polls after last years Election Commission-enforced Lok Sabha lull.        
	It is not possible for us to start a crackdown on our own. We will initiate action if house owners file specific written complaints with the returning officers or the police, declared S.N. Roychowdhury, the secretary of the State Election Commission.        
	For graffiti gangs straining at the leash since the central poll panel imposed the no-writing-without-permission rule last year, that is an open invitation to splash your walls with the united colours of political graffiti without so much as a by your leave.        
	At least two parties had sought my written consent to write graffiti on a wall during the Lok Sabha election. This time, they defaced the front wall of my house without asking me even once, said a resident of Shyampukur, under ward 10 of north Calcutta.                       Trinamul poll propaganda on BB Chatterjee Road in Kasba      
	So is he going to lodge a complaint? The Election Commission isnt the poll monitor this time. Who will stand up for me if I am targeted? he asked.        
	A senior official claimed that the state poll panel did not have the resources, including manpower, to enforce the model code of conduct in the manner the Election Commission did.        
	The Election Commission had formed 120 roving squads that went around town recording violations and reporting them for legal action. We dont have that luxury, he said.        
	Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), claimed hardly any violation had taken place so far for the cops to launch a crackdown, though the Metro pictures tell a different story.        
	Returning officer Khalil Ahmed, the district magistrate of South 24-Parganas, said action would be taken when the time comes.                             BJP wall writing on BB Chatterjee Road. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)      
	 The graffiti rules are the same for every election with writing on walls of government buildings banned and written consent necessary for private walls. If a wall has been defaced without the owners permission, the poll monitor  in this case, the State Election Commission  can ask the police to initiate appropriate steps against the violators.         
	The police can take suo motu action, too, and lodge a case under Section 202 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act of 1980. The maximum punishment for an illegal paint job is imprisonment for up to six months or a fine of up to Rs 50,000.        
	 As the model code of conduct is the same for all elections, there is no reason why enforcement should be different, said an official who was part of the Election Commissions anti-graffiti drive last year.        
	A house owner in Kankurgachhi, under ward number 33, said he might file a complaint if his wall was defaced but was wary of being harassed like some of those who went to the police last year.        
	CPM leader Faiyaz Ahmed Khan claimed that all party workers had been asked to follow the model code of conduct. We will not write graffiti without the permission of house owners, he added.        
	Trinamul Congress leader Partha Chatterjee said his party would follow the graffiti rule in letter and spirit.         
	Pradip Bhattacharya, the working president of the state Congress, insisted that graffiti was a part and parcel of any poll campaign. But we do try to stick to the rules, he said.

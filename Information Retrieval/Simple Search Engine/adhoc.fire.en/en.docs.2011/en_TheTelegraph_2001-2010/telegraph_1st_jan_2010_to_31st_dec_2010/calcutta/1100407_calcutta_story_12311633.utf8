The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Prisoners of delay shock court
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Prisoners of delay shock court
  - Slashing of hand, banging of head					 					      TAPAS GHOSH AND AMRITA GHOSH            
	Two undertrial prisoners driven to desperation by delayed hearings slashed themselves while others banged their heads on walls in a painful cry for justice that rang out loud through the corridors of city courts sitting on a mountain of cases.         
	Tushar Mondal, arrested six months ago on a murder charge but still awaiting his first hearing, slashed his hand with a blade in the lock-up of the city sessions court after learning late on Tuesday afternoon that he would have to return to his cell yet again without a trial because of a shortage of judges.         
	Barely an hour earlier, suspected narcotics smuggler Rahaman Ali Mandal had smashed the glass door of the 3rd additional district judges chamber in Howrah to pick up a shard and cut his chest before the cops overpowered him.        
	Tushar and Rahaman survived the suicide attempts but the judicial system was left shaken by the days events, including the sight of 23 undertrials banging their heads on the walls of the sessions court lock-up and shouting slogans (see illustration by Uday Deb).        
	I have not seen anything like this in my career of over two decades, said lawyer Kallol Guha Thakurta, standing outside the courtroom on the Bankshall Court premises.        
	Around 4pm, chief judge Kalpana De was forced to come out of her chamber to calm down the prisoners. I am told that the vacant posts of judges will be filled up in another fortnight or a month at the most. Your cases will come up for hearing soon after the new judges join, she promised.        
	The sessions court has nine sanctioned posts of judges, of which four are vacant. Calcutta High Court is worse off with as many as 30 of the 58 posts vacant.        
	Sources said 3.25 lakh cases were pending in the high court and 13 lakh-odd in the lower courts.        
	Tushar, who was treated in the medical unit of the high court  a seven-minute walk from the sessions court  said his was not a pre-planned act. He claimed to have found the blade with which he slit his hand on the floor.        
	So what drove him to the suicide attempt? I have been brought to court at regular intervals over the past three months but there is no sign of the trial beginning. Each time I come here hoping that I will get a hearing. How long can I wait? asked Tushar.         
	An employee of the medical unit said Tushars wound wasnt serious but might have been fatal if the police hadnt snatched the blade from him.        
	Tapan Das, who was in the group that went berserk inside the sessions court lock-up, said the violent protest was the result of pent-up frustration.         
	I was arrested seven months ago with three others on the charge of looting a cellphone shop. I was remanded in police custody three months ago but my trial doesnt look like starting anytime soon. We are brought here and taken back without a hearing each time, he said.        
	In Howrah, 27-year-old Rahaman told the police that he had attempted suicide out of depression at being kept behind bars for over two years allegedly without a proper trial.         
	Rahaman was arrested along with Biplab Dutta, 29, in November 2007 on the charge of narcotics smuggling. The chief judicial magistrate of Howrah granted Biplab bail but remanded Rahaman in judicial custody.         
	A few days ago, Biplab was arrested in Dum Dum again for another alleged crime and brought to court on Tuesday. Biplabs lawyer demanded that eight of the 10 witnesses in the case should be asked to testify again. A fresh probe would mean that Rahamans already delayed trial would take more time, which is why he tried to commit suicide, an officer said.

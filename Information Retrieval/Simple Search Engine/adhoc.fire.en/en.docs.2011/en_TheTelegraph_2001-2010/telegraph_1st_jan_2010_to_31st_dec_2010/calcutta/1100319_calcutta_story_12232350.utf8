                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Police targeted after truck kills schoolkid

	A 12-year-old boy died on his way to school on Thursday morning after a truck hit his bicycle and ran over him on Nilgunge Road in Khardah.         
	A mob torched the truck and two police vehicles and fought a pitched battle with cops while protesting the mishap, throwing traffic on the road out of gear for five hours.        
	Local residents said that around 10.30am, Riyajul Islam, a student of Class VI at a local madarsa, was cycling when the truck carrying flyash from the opposite direction hit him. Riyajul fell to the ground and the rear wheel of the truck crushed him, said local resident Mohamed Dilawar.         
	Riyajul is the younger son of Abdul Kuddus, a mason.         
	The truck driver fled leaving behind the vehicle, which the angry residents set on fire. They also blocked the road to protest lack of policing on the stretch. In February, a local woman was killed in an accident on this road. There were two more deaths in the past year on this stretch. How long will this continue? wondered Asrajul Ali, another resident.         
	The agitators alleged that heavy vehicles regularly plied through their locality instead of using Kalyani Expressway as it was a short-cut. Three schools are located off this road but there are no traffic cops to prevent heavy vehicles from plying through our locality illegally, Ali added.         
	With the agitation holding up traffic, officers of Khardah police station arrived in a jeep and an autorickshaw. The protesters forced the cops out of the vehicles and set them ablaze. The officers ran away and took refuge in a mango orchard, said a witness.         
	Later a larger police force, including combat personnel, arrived from Barrackpore and lathicharged the mob.

                A police officer went to Delhi on Monday to record the statement of ministry of human resource development official G.L. Jambulkar who had lodged a complaint saying Ramesh Bhattacharjee, Anthony Arun Biswas and Dilip Datta were not authorised to visit La Martiniere for Boys premises on Loudon Street. According to the complaint lodged by Jambulkar, the deputy educational adviser of the ministry, Bhattacharjee is a member of Rashtriya Sanskrit Parishad, and has no right to enter the school premises to enquire even about the study of Sanskrit in the school. Jambulkar had raised these points in a letter to the police commissioner of Calcutta on June 25.    A bus of Julien Day School carrying 30 students was hit by an unidentified bus heading towards Barasat at Doltala near Madhyamgram early on Monday. Police said the bus was heading towards the school at Ganganagar when the mishap occurred. None of the students was hurt but the driver sustained injuries in his arm.     Sheikh Sikander, Sanjay Shaw, Mohammad Nausi and Bhola Shaw, who were arrested recently for stealing a car and murdering its driver Avijit Das in Jharkhand in April, were produced before the chief judicial magistrates court in Howrah on Monday and remanded in police custody for seven days. Police said the four had murdered Das to steal the car.    Denise Martin, in her 40s, was arrested in the New Market area on Monday evening for duping a youth of Rs 1 lakh by promising him admission in a medical college. The youth, an SN Banerjee Road resident, had lodged a complaint against Denise, who lives in Tiljala.    Smoke was seen coming out of an empty bus of Heritage School on Monday afternoon near Kadapara on the EM Bypass. Police said the fire was possibly caused by a short-circuit in the battery because of waterlogging and rain.    Four unidentified persons on motorcycles fired a round and threw two bombs in front of Kailash Construction in Andul Purbapara in Howrah on Monday afternoon. The attackers entered the premises when owner Arup Nandi was in a meeting in the office. They locked the security guard in a room, fired inside the office, dropped the bombs and fled. Police said they had probably come to extort money from the owner.     Sanjay Smart, the La Martiniere for Boys teacher who was arrested on May 17 on the charge of demanding a laptop as bribe, was produced in court on Monday. Smarts bail prayer could not be heard as the lawyers of the Metropolitan Magistrates Court did not attend court to mourn a colleagues death. Court sources said Smart would be produced again on Tuesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Presi panel files report
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Presi panel files report
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The seven-member committee set up by Presidency University to probe the fire that gutted two of its chemistry laboratories on October 29 has suggested immediate measures to ensure proper safety arrangements on the campus.        
	The panel comprising teachers and officials of the institution submitted its report to vice-chancellor Amita Chatterjee on Monday. The report states that some of the laboratories, canteen, library and a number of other facilities on the campus lack firefighting arrangements.        
	I received the report today. I will forward it to the state government at the earliest and request it to take steps for the implementation of the suggestions, Chatterjee said.        
	The report does not identify the cause of the fire but suspects that it had originated from a refrigerator in one of the gutted laboratories.        
	Its impossible for the committee to ascertain the cause of the blaze as most of its members are teachers, who are not fire experts, said a member. But given the circumstantial evidence, we feel the fire had spread from a refrigerator.        
	The director general in the fire services department, Jogesh Chatterjee, has submitted a preliminary report which held the refrigerator in one of the two labs as the primary suspect.

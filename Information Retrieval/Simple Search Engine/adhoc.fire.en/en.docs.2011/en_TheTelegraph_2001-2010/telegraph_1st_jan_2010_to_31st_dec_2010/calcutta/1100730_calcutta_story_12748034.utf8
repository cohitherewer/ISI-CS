The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Booze raid on JU campus
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Booze raid on JU campus
  - Cops or caution for students found drinking, smoking ganja          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Raids by the Jadavpur University authorities across the campus over the past three days have caught over a dozen students smoking ganja and downing alcohol during class hours and afterwards.        
	Four of those caught were former students, who were handed over to police. The varsity was more lenient with those on the rolls, calling up their parents and complaining about their misdemeanour.        
	Some parents reacted with shock, asking the varsity to act against the guilty immediately while others found fault with the institution rather than their children.        
	The students were mostly caught drinking alcohol. But there were some students who were found smoking marijuana, said a senior varsity official who was a part of the team that conducted the raids in the afternoon and evening. We have seized several bottles of beer, whisky and rum and some marijuana.        
	The authorities had decided to crack down as part of a drive to stop illegal activities on the campus and unauthorised entry of outsiders.         
	The move followed the recent controversy after Debolina Chakraborty, a former student who stands accused under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act for alleged Maoist links, held a news conference on the campus.        
	The council was unanimous on the need to launch the crackdown. Our institution had been getting a bad name because of a very small section of students who use the campus for activities that students are not supposed to indulge in. We are determined to stop this, said council member Parthapratim Biswas.        
	The raids revealed that a section of ex-students regularly use the campus to consume drugs and alcohol. At least four among those caught were ex-students. We have handed all of them to the police, said registrar P.K. Ghosh.        
	For the rest, we summoned the guardians and warned them that their wards would be expelled if caught again. Many of the guardians expressed shock and most welcomed the drive, he added.        
	Several students said they were sure such vigil on the part of the varsity would only last a few days. We are sure things will get back to normal within a fortnight. We need to be alert till then, said a sociology student.        
	There were others who welcomed the clean-up drive. Such things should never be allowed in an institution, said Aritra Gangopadhyay, a postgraduate student of history.

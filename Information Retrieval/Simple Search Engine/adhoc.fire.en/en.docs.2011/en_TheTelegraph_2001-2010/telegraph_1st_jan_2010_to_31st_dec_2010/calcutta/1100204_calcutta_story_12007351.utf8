	A Malaysia-based infrastructure solution provider has evinced interest in setting up a monorail connection between Majherhat and Joka, recently proposed by railway minister Mamata Banerjee.        
	Scomi Engineering Bhd, the Malaysian company, had joined hands with Larsen amp; Toubro to set up Indias first monorail link between Jacob Circle and Chembur in Mumbai. It is set to be the technology partner and system integrator for a similar project in Bangalore.        
	We have engaged officials to conduct a preliminary study of the market in eastern India. We would visit Calcutta with a presentation to showcase how monorail has transformed mass transportation across the world, the CEO of the Scomi group, Shah Hakim Zain, told Metro in Kuala Lumpur.        
	We also plan to build a monorail coach factory in India soon, he added.         
	Mamata had announced that a survey had been commissioned for starting a monorail service between Majherhat and Joka.The Railway Board is working on the project and has even made preliminary surveys, said a senior official of Indian Railways.         
	We plan to visit Calcutta by end-February and pitch strongly for the project, said Scomi International president Kanesan Veluppillai.        
	The technical committee of the Railway Board is open to a presentation on monorail. It is important to have a look at different models and how they operate before a final call is taken, said a board member.        
	In use in Tokyo since 1963 and in Kuala Lumpur for the past five years besides China, monorail trains run on a narrow beam.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HC for simple IIT cut-off
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HC for simple IIT cut-off
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court division bench on Wednesday said a simple process should be followed to fix the cut-off marks in the IIT entrance exams but declined to interfere because it had no expertise on the matter.        
	Justice A. Banerjee and Justice K. Mukherjee made the observations while hearing a students petition challenging the legality of the IIT admission process. The bench dismissed the petition.        
	We dont have any expertise to look into the matter. We can only say that there should be a simple method to ascertain the cut-off marks. But that does not mean that the process adopted is wrong, the bench stated.        
	The petitioner, Sanchit Bansal, son of an IIT Kharagpur faculty member, had appeared in the entrance examination in 2006 and scored 75 in mathematics, 104 in physics and 42 in chemistry. Experts had fixed 37, 48 and 55 as the cut-off marks for mathematics, physics and chemistry, respectively, said the lawyer who appeared for IIT.        
	A single-judge bench of the high court had dismissed Bansals petition in June.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops issue no-dig diktat
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops issue no-dig diktat
  - Agencies must clear road mess well before Puja          PRONAB MONDAL                                    
	City police have clamped a ban on digging roads from August 31 and declared a September deadline for completion of all repairs to ensure that the mess on the streets doesnt drag till Durga puja.        
	From the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to Calcutta Telephones, agencies that routinely disrupt traffic by digging up thoroughfares and stretching deadlines have been asked to mind the calendar and the clock from now on.        
	We wont allow them to dig up roads after August 31. Only emergency work will be allowed after that. Routine jobs like replacing cables or pipes wont be allowed if these entail digging up roads, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), Jawed Shamim, told Metro on Thursday.        
	The no-digging diktat and the deadline for completion of work were issued during a meeting between the police brass and representatives of various agencies, including the PWD and CESC.        
	Road repairs have to be completed within the first week of September, Shamim announced.        
	The CMC is currently working on 26 roads across the city. The thoroughfares include Nimtala Ghat Street, Beadon Street, Cossipore Road, Rashbehari Avenue and Hazra Road.        
	Mayoral council member Firhad Hakim blamed rain for the repairs running behind schedule, although Met records prove that the city has not had enough showers this monsoon.        
	We will try our best to complete the repairs within the first week of September. But it is getting delayed because of the rain. Patchwork can be done even if the road is wet but the surface needs to be dry for comprehensive repairs, insisted Hakim.        
	However, Hakim promised a smooth ride on most thoroughfares by Puja. Citizens wont be inconvenienced even if the monsoon stretches till October, he added.        
	Joint commissioner Shamim said Lalbazar had made it clear to the departments concerned that a round of cosmetic repairs could be carried out before Puja but current projects must stick to the deadline.        
	The condition of most city roads is not very bad, possibly because the monsoon hasnt peaked yet. But if the rain gets heavy close to Puja and the roads are still dug-up, we will be in trouble. So we have asked the CMC to complete its ongoing work within the first week of next month and be ready for another round of repairs before Puja, Shamim added.        
	Tuesdays discussion at Kalamandir, the first pre-Puja co-ordination meeting between the police and different agencies, also drew up a strategy to avert untoward incidents triggered by violation of civic norms.        
	Sources said the police brass read out the high court directives to Puja organisers on erecting pandals and various security norms.

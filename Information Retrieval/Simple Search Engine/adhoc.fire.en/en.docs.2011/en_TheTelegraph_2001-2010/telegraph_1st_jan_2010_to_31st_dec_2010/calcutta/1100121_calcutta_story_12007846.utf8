          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                                    A giant banner atop the gate with Jyoti Basu looking on with a benign smile greeted the Saraswati puja crowd that flocked to Citizens Park on Wednesday, the evening after thousands had thronged the park to bid a final farewell to the former chief minister.

	4.40pm, Tuesday, Citizens Park: Thousands have thronged to catch a last glimpse of Jyoti Basu. The park opposite the Academy of Fine Arts is flooded with red flags at half mast and giant banners mourning the countrys longest serving chief minister. A huge police posse struggles to contain the surging crowds. The faces are grim, some eyes are teary. The mood is melancholy, the sun is about to set.        
	4.40pm, Wednesday, Citizens Park: Scores of young couples in their Saraswati puja best are all smiles. It is the Bengali Valentines Day, after all. There is a remnant of yesterday  a giant banner of tribute atop the gate from which Basu looks on with the hint of a smile, and a few more scattered inside. Outside, there is no policeman in sight. The mood is mirthful, an evening of romance lies ahead.                
	The cycle of life was at work  or play  in Citizens Park on Wednesday evening.        
	Yes, I do feel bad about Jyotibabu. But business suffered yesterday as we were not allowed to set up shop. Today, business is good, said Tarak Majhi, 33, a chaat-seller outside the main gate of the park where the 95-year-old leader was given the three volley rifle salute before disappearing from the public eye.        
	About 10 feet above Majhi, a black banner, with Basus portrait, read Mor naam ei boley khyato hok/Aami tomaderi lok (Let me be remembered / As one of you).        
	Wasnt it ironical that the place of mourning had been turned into a place of merriment 24 hours later?        
	For Smita, a 20-year-old B.Com student accompanied by her boyfriend, thats more normal than ironical.        
	Jyoti Basu will never be forgotten but that should not stop anyone from having a good time on a day like this. These days, young couples hardly get to spend quality time together so Saraswati puja is special, reasoned the girl in a yellow sari.        
	On Tuesday, the sonorous strains of The Last Post being played by the army band had filled the winter evening as it settled over the park. The gun carriage bearing Basus body stood in the middle with four pall-bearers. Basus family sat under a shamiana with the CPM veterans. White was the colour of the day, from wreaths to bouquets.        
	On Wednesday, the CMC-owned park thrown open by Pranab Mukherjee in 2005 was a youth hangout  with him in traditional-yet-trendy kurta-pyjama and her in saris, yellow and red.        
	The transformation of the green address made some see red. I had come to visit this now historic venue, but what I saw disheartened me. It is a lovers paradise today. The authorities should do something to make sure the new-found sanctity of this place isnt desecrated, frowned 57-year-old Hiren Banerjee, employed with a nationalised bank.        
	Others like Sunil Jha, a 62-year-old retired central government employee did not have a problem with what they saw at Citizens Park, the evening after. Its almost impossible to believe that this was where we saw the last of Jyotibabu last evening. It looks cheerful and pretty, with flowers in the lovely garden and happy young people dressed up in kurtas and saris, said Jha. Thats life.

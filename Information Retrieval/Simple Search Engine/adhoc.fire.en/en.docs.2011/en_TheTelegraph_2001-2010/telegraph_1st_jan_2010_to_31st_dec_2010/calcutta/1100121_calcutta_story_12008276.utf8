The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cold days here to stay
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cold days here to stay
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The cold day condition prevails in Calcutta and its surrounding areas, with the maximum temperature on Wednesday remaining five degrees below normal at 22.2.        
	The minimum was 12 degrees Celsius, a couple of notches below normal.        
	The chill is likely to intensify as the Met office has predicted a renewed slide in the mercury over the next few days because of an active northwesterly flow.         
	The cold day condition, marked by a drop in the maximum temperature by at least five degrees below normal, is still prevalent in the city and is likely to persist at least another couple of days. The minimum temperature, too, may dip further, said an India Meteorological Department (IMD) official from Delhi.        
	The weatherman has also predicted morning fog in the city and other parts of Indo-Gangetic plains in the next two days because of excessive moisture in the air.        
	The Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore said the sky on Thursday would remain mainly clear though there will be fog or mist in the morning. Temperatures may vary between 11 and 21 degrees Celsius.

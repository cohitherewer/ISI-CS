	Prints are still looked upon with suspicion by viewers and collectors and galleries are reluctant to exhibit them as they rarely sell. The Birla Academy of Art and Culture held a printmaking workshop under the guidance of graphic artist Atin Basak in its lawns last week.         
	It attracted some well-known practitioners who rarely try their hand at printmaking. All of them, including Ganesh Haloi, Jogen Chowdhury, Jaya Ganguly, Niranjan Pradhan, Tapas Konar, Rabin Mondal and Aditya Basak, were given zinc plates on which they drew whatever came to mind with a needle.        
	The results were quite exciting as apart from making prints the artists interacted among themselves.         
	They came up with works that were quite different from what they usually create.         
	Ganesh Haloi became so enthusiastic he made two drawings instead of one.        
	The prints created by the 42 artists will be turned into albums with editions of 15, and going by current prices of art they will be sold at a ridiculously low price.                   Soham Baba steps down from his BMW in Calcutta.   Picture by Sudeshna Banerjee      
	Green sanyasi         
	Soham Baba, the Naga sanyasi in saffron, is actually quite green. The spiritual leader, who has his headquarters in Netherlands, led a Kumbh Mela bathing procession of Naga sadhus earlier this year raising slogans about planting trees: Ek dubki lagao, ek ped lagao (Take one dip, plant one tree).         
	He recently travelled to Cancun, Mexico, to take part in the United Nations Climate Change Conference.         
	I addressed a press conference there on December 9. Everyone asked me why I was there, says Soham Baba, who hails from Burdwan. He claims he is a neurosurgeon but avoids questions on his purbashram (life before relinquishment) and had spoken of the effects global warming in the Himalayan glacial terrain in Calcutta in January this year. But he is now addressing matters more internal.         
	At Cancun, I told them to change the inner climate first and then talk of the climate outside. Consumerism does not lead to happiness. I spoke about how in the Hindu way of life, we worship herbs and trees  tulsi (basil) for Narayan, hibiscus for Kali That doesnt mean Baba is not high on climate jargon such as historical emission, upcycling and CDM grant. The Soham Baba Mission has tied up with a local NGO, Paschimbanga Yuba Kalyan Mancha, to plant 2 lakh trees on the city fringes.         
	International, spiritual, environmental. Who are we to complain?       SUDESHNA BANERJEE

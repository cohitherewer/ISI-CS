The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A passion for building cars 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          A passion for building cars

	Class IX student Devang Kumar is different from the average 14-year-old. Instead of using his free time watching cartoons, this La Martiniere for Boys student likes to build model cars and do science projects for a hobby.         
	At their Ballygunge Park residence, Devang has a hobby room where he has spent many happy hours coming up with models like the clap-responding car, the water car and the fan that works on solar energy.         
	I have been taking apart toy cars my parents bought me for as long as I can remember, he says. He builds the cars from scratch, researching on the Internet and buying the materials from local stores.         
	His favourite is the water car, that separates hydrogen and oxygen from water by electrolysis. The hydrogen is used to generate electricity that runs the car, he explains.         
	Or take the clap-responding car. The microphone picks up the sound waves caused by the clap and forwards it to the circuit that helps it move. The second clap stops the motor, he explains.         
	But nurturing the hobby requires deep pockets. The clap-responding car costs at least Rs 1,400 to build.         
	His parents have always supported him. We noticed that he was more interested in the workings of the car than what it looked like, said mother Ritika.        
	Devangs other interest is aeromodelling, something he picked up from his father. Aeromodelling is the science of controlling model airplanes using a remote control. Ive always accompanied my father to the Behala airport, where he practises, he says. Now he has his own models.         
	Devang has been participating in school science fairs and even participated in the district-level science fair at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum in December last year. But what is taking up most of his time is the biogas project he is building for his school science fair in July.        
	It uses cowdung to generate methane gas, that can be used to light lanterns or as cooking gas, explains the youngster.         
	In future, he would not like to turn his hobby into a profession as that would take the fun out of it, he says.              
	Whats on your mind this week  
	SHOUT OUT LOUD  
	Time for action  
	How long will the innocent get killed by Naxalites while our politicians look elsewhere? The latter make lofty promises before elections but all are forgotten the minute they sit on the hot seat. Its high time the politicians stop their blame-game and tackle the Naxalite problem seriously. An all-party solution has to be reached fast before more lives are lost and violence rips our state apart. The Naxalite problem has been there for decades. Its time we sit with them and reach a compromise.

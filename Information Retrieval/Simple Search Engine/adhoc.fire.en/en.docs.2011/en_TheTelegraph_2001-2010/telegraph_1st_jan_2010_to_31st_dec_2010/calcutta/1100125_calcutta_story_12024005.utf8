The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trio held with fake note shipment
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Trio held with fake note shipment
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta police on Sunday seized fake notes of Rs 3.92 lakh from three Malda residents who had checked into a lodge on Kyd Street.        
	The three, who were arrested, allegedly confessed that they had procured the fake Rs 1,000 notes from an agent in Bangladesh and were in the city to deliver the consignment to another person, who is part of a currency racket.        
	Rabiul Islam, Mohammad Rabiul and Muzibar Sheikh, residents of Kaliachak in Malda, arrived in the city on Saturday.         
	The city police have seized counterfeit currency notes worth nearly Rs 60 lakh in the past year.         
	Pranab Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (Special Task Force), said the quality of the notes seized from the trio was such that most people would find it difficult to spot them as fake.        
	The texture of the fake notes and the quality of the paper were almost similar to that of real notes. The manufacturers found a way around some of the security checks adopted by the Reserve Bank of India but not all, said Kumar.        
	Preliminary investigation revealed that the three had visited the city several times and spread lakhs of rupees of fake notes.        
	They also went to other cities across the country to spread fake Indian notes, said an officer of the Special Task Force.        
	The investigators are yet to obtain the name of the man who was supposed to receive the consignment of fake notes from the arrested trio.        
	An STF officer said there was a tip-off from sources about the Malda residents. We waited till they paid the lodge manager with the fake notes. We surrounded them and searched their bags, he added.        
	In another incident, Raju Chowdhury, in his late-20s, was arrested in Watgunge when he tried to buy cellphones using fake Rs 500 notes. The police seized Rs 28,500 in fake notes from him. A man accompanying Chowdhury managed to flee.        
	According to cops, Chowdhury and the other man went to a cellphone shop and selected two handsets worth Rs 23,000.        
	The shopkeeper became suspicious after seeing the Rs 500 notes the two handed over. He asked owners of adjacent shops to check the notes. When they, too, suspected the notes were fake, they called the police, said an officer of Watgunge police station.

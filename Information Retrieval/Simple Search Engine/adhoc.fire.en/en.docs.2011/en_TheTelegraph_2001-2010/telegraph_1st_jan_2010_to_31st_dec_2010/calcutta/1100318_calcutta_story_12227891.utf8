The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Students thumb nose at winds of change
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Students thumb nose at winds of change
  - SFI wrests JU arts union after three years          A STAFF REPORTER                           Jubilant SFI supporters at Jadavpur University. (Sanat Kr. Sinha)                                        
	The CPM students wing on Wednesday swept the union election in Jadavpur Universitys arts faculty, the second win on a prominent city campus after Presidency College since the Left Fronts rout in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls.        
	The Students Federation of India wrested the union from the Forum for Arts Students (FAS)  an independent group that had run the union for the past three years  winning the posts of all four office-bearers.        
	Last year, the SFI could win only one post  that of assistant general secretary (evening). The CPM-backed organisation had last run the union in 2006-07.        
	In February, the SFI had retained its control of the Presidency College students union for the second time in a row.        
	SFI leaders said the JU victory proved that the youth had still not jumped on the paribartan bandwagon. The outcome reflects that students have not been swayed by the so-called winds of change, said Ritabrata Banerjee, the all-India general secretary of the SFI.        
	Madhuparna Dasgupta, an SFI supporter, said: The students have seen through the duplicity of the opposition parties and have realised that they have no ideology at all.        
	Campus sources, however, attributed the SFI win to a fractured opposition. There were differences of opinion between FAS and the All India Democratic Students Organisation over seat-sharing. To add to the oppositions woes, the Students Democratic Front had walked out of the grouping over Lalgarh, said a source.        
	Sattwick Barman, the FAS candidate for the post of general secretary, blamed their defeat on organisational weakness.        
	For the post of assistant general secretary (day), there was a tie between SFIs Kanyakumari Chanda and FASs Somak Mukherjee. Both parties decided to hold the position jointly.

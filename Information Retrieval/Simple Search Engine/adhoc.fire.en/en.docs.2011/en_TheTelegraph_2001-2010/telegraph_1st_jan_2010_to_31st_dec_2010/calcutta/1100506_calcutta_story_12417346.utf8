                      Nature in a new light                    At crucial points in the collective history of mankind, new art practices have evolved to address the changing relationships between nature, society and the individual. Nature Revisited, the ongoing group show, attempts to visually articulate some of the radical new ways of responding to the environment. It showcases works by 11 Indian artists and looks to depict how, within contemporary practices, perspectives about art and issues pertaining to nature are dynamic. The works on show abide by the tradition that views art as a mirror of nature. At the same time, there is an awareness of aesthetically appreciating nature for its own sake, besides its form as a work of art. The paintings also take a critical stance towards the picturesque, either by depicting objects or scenes that do not conform to the conventional idea of the picturesque, or by presenting what are considered traditionally beautiful aspects of nature in forms that are deliberately distorted. Participants: Debnath Basu, Nantu Behari, Tapas Biswas, Jayashree Chakravarty, Adip Dutta, Rajan Krishnan, K.S. Radha Krishna, Jagannath Panda, Manisha Parekh, Mithu Sen (a painting by her appears here) and Anjum Singh. Curated by Jayashree Chakravarty and Anirudh Chari.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Graft probe at JU
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Graft probe at JU
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Some employees of Jadavpur Universitys finance department, including an official, stand accused of trying to clear a false bill for Rs 2.20 lakh submitted by a contractor.        
	The universitys executive council on Wednesday set up a two-member committee, headed by a retired judge, to probe the complaint.        
	The finance section of the university had detected a financial irregularity a few months ago. A two-member panel set up by the executive committee will conduct a thorough inquiry into the matter. Action will be taken on the basis of the inquiry report, said pro vice-chancellor Siddhartha Dutta.        
	The finance officer had detected the alleged irregularity in August last year. He found that a cheque for Rs 2.20 lakh had been issued to the contractor who supplies laboratory equipment to the university on the basis of a false bill, said an official.        
	The payment against cheque was stopped and Manoj Mitra, a former dean of the universitys engineering faculty, was asked to probe the matter.        
	Mitras report, submitted last month, stated that the allegation was true.        
	A member of the executive committee said the new inquiry would pinpoint the culprits and find out exactly how they had planned to siphon off university funds.         
	The amount of money involved is not very huge. But we want a detailed inquiry to ensure employees do not commit such irregularities again, the member added.        
	Several employees have alleged that the authorities had delayed the probe in an attempt to shield the culprits, who they claim are close to senior CPM leaders.        
	The one-man committees report confirming the allegation of irregularity has shocked teachers and other employees.         
	This is the first time that a probe panel has been set up with a retired judge as it head to probe a financial irregularity. What a shame, said an official. The incident reveals lack of transparency in the universitys administration. The authorities should take stern action against the culprits once the two-member panel submits its report.

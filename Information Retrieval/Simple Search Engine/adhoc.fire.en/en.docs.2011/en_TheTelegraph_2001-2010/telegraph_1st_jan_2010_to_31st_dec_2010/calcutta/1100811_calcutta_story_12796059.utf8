                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Leh tourists return home
  - Visitors from Bengal recount days of doom          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          Tourists who were stranded in Leh after the August 6 cloudburst bid one another a happy goodbye after reaching Sealdah station on Tuesday afternoon.

	They were forced to come together as calamity struck Leh on August 6, killing 166 and rendering 400 missing. Five days after a cloudburst wreaked havoc on the picturesque holiday destination in Kashmir, 50-odd tourists from Bengal arrived at Sealdah station on Tuesday afternoon, more than happy to finally part ways.         
	There was utter devastation everywhere around us. Some 50 of us from Bengal stuck together, waiting for help, said Joyita Mandal, 28, a tourist from Dankuni.        
	The tourists, who had gone to Leh separately, reached Calcutta on the Sealdah Rajdhani Express and Duronto Express. As they got off the trains, relief lit up their fatigued faces.         
	We are lucky to be alive and so happy to be back. We just want to go home now, said Tutul Mukherjee, a 43-year-old homemaker from Dum Dum Park.        
	Most of the 50-odd tourists had reached Leh on July 30 and 31 and put up in hotels. As the tourists were staying in concrete buildings, the cloudburst did not affect them. But relief soon turned into shock as they realised the extent of destruction all around them.         
	Though all of us escaped without injury, the death and devastation we saw really shook us up. Weve never seen anything like this. It will take quite a while for many of us to recover from the experience, shuddered Mukherjee.        
	As anxious relatives hugged the tourists on the platform, some of them started recounting their days of doom.         
	The cloudburst was so intense that mountain peaks disappeared overnight. There was a massive mud-flood that swept away all the huts. We lived almost without food or water for three days, said Swapan Sadhukhan, a resident of Barrackpore.        
	There was no cellphone connectivity, roads were submerged or blocked and several bridges were destroyed, they said.         
	None of our mobiles were working. On Saturday, a day after the cloudburst, one of us managed to call up the Lalbazar control room from his cellphone. The cops then got in touch with officials of the state government in Delhi, said Swapan Hazra, a Kakinara resident.        
	Calcutta police officers and officials of the state government reached Leh on Sunday and stayed with the stranded tourists, helping them arrange their return. On Sunday, the tourists were sent to Delhi via flights and put up in Banga Bhavan. They boarded the trains back to Calcutta on Monday evening.        
	The local authorities were nowhere in sight, said Barnali Biswas, 37, a homemaker from Naihati. It was a welcome change to find our state government doing everything right. They made swift arrangements to get us out of there as soon as possible, she added.

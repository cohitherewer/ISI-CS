The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Good ol school trip goes global
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Good ol school trip goes global
  - Students return from abroad more confident          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          Students of Mahadevi Birla with a Marilyn Monroe lookalike at Universal Studios in Singapore                                        
	When Devanshi Dabriwal returned home from school two months ago holding a note from the principal about a five-day trip to Thailand, mother Dollys first reaction was: But can you manage alone?        
	Devanshi finally had her way and Dolly is glad she did let her daughter go. She came back a much more confident girl. The trip taught her how to adjust to situations, especially how to carry herself when alone in a foreign land, Dolly told Metro.        
	With more and more students aspiring to go abroad for higher studies and criss-crossing countries for business and pleasure becoming common, parents like Dolly are looking at school trips abroad as part of the grooming and growing-up process.        
	Loreto House conducted its first international trip  to Thailand  last October. Delhi Public School, Megacity, and St James School have planned foreign excursions next year.        
	Birla High School for Boys and Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School intend making excursions abroad an annual fixture, while the likes of The Heritage School and Lakshmipat Singhania Academy have been conducting such trips regularly.        
	Overseas trips organised by schools make children independent. When they travel with their parents, everything from currency change to immigration clearance is taken care of. But when they are on their own, students get to do most of these tasks and learn to become responsible, said Gouri Basu, senior co-ordinator of Loreto House.         
	For Class XI student Devanshi, the Thailand trip was an eye-opener in more ways than one. I realised that I couldnt throw tantrums. I had to be more responsible and alert, said the student of Loreto House, who is eyeing the US for higher studies.        
	Given the benefits, many parents now insist that schools organise such trips regularly. They have realised that there is more to such trips than sightseeing, said Mukta Nain, the principal of Birla High School for Boys.         
	But what about the high cost of foreign travel? Trips to parts of Asia are now affordable because of low-airfare options, said a teacher at St James School.        
	For parents, the idea of their children visiting places they themselves might never see is also a factor. It is not possible for every family to holiday in an international destination. So when there is an opportunity for the children, almost every parent is willing to make a few sacrifices, said Bharat Kumar Manot, whose teenaged daughter visited Singapore and Malaysia as part of a trip organised by Mahadevi Birla.        
	Travel operators are quick to cash in on the trend. AR-ES Travels, based in Park Street, recently took the teachers of five city schools on an all-expenses-paid trip to Malaysia.        
	The idea was to acquaint teachers with these places before they take children there. If international school trips become a regular affair, even the off-season will be a busy period for us, said Anil Punjabi, the director of AR-ES Travels.

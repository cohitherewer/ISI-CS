The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Year-loss threat for JU students
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Year-loss threat for JU students
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Jadavpur University officials warned students on Tuesday that they would lose a year if they skipped the semester exams beginning shortly.        
	The Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu) has threatened the boycott to pressure the university into withdrawing the FIR against students who clashed with police while trying to prevent the chief minister from leaving the campus on November 9.        
	The examinations will be held as scheduled. Those who dont show up will be considered absent, vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh said on Tuesday.        
	According to university rules, those who skip semester exams are allowed to take supplementary tests but only for three papers.         
	Students missing more than three papers are not allowed take the supplementary tests. Which means those who boycott the exams will have to write their papers in November 2011, said a university official.        
	We cannot go against university rules, said Ghosh.        
	The students can boycott the semester exams and still not lose a year only if a special supplementary test is held.        
	The authorities are not yet considering any such measure for engineering students.        
	The JU authorities are confident that most of the 3,000 students who are set to appear in the first semester exams, apart from the fourth-year engineering students who are not part of the boycott, will turn up for the test.        
	Only 100-odd students may join the boycott. We are sure that the 2,900 others want to sit for the test. Why should all students suffer for a few? asked Ghosh.        
	The engineering exams start on Friday and the arts and science faculty exams on Monday.        
	According to sources, students outside Fetsu have started enquiring about the consequences of the boycott and feel the agitation will die a natural death. The vice-chancellor said even if there was a re-examination for the boycotting students, the publication of results of the other students would suffer.        
	Fetsu, however, claimed popular support for its boycott cry.

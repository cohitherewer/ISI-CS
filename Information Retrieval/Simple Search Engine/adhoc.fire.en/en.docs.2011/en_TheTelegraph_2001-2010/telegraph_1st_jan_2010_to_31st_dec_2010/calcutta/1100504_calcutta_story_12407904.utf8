The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Doctors stall SSKM work
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Doctors stall SSKM work
          OUR BUREAU                          An accident victim refused admission at SSKM on Monday. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                  
	Junior doctors at SSKM Hospital withdrew their ceasework on Monday evening following threats of disciplinary action, but by then several critical patients went back untreated and all state-run hospitals were asked not to send patients to Bengals biggest referral healthcare provider.        
	The decision to call off the strike, on since Saturday, followed a daylong tug of war between the doctors and the authorities, with the protesters repeatedly turning down pleas to resume work even after all their demands were met.        
	The college council decided in the afternoon that strong action would be taken against the junior doctors if they did not join work. The ceasework was finally withdrawn, said Pradip Mitra, the director of Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM.        
	Throughout the day, the hospital kept sending back one patient after another.        
	Haripada Talukdar, 65, of Belghoria, has been suffering from acute chest pain and renal problems. He was taken to RG Kar hospital and NRS before being brought to SSKM. Doctors here didnt even examine him. We have to take him to another hospital, said a relative.        
	The doctors struck work after six of their colleagues were assaulted over the alleged negligence in treating a newborn. Four persons have been arrested for the assault.        
	On Monday morning, the protesting doctors met hospital officials and demanded immediate suspension of the three cops who they alleged were mute spectators to the violence. The police promised to transfer the trio  including Animesh Chakraborty, the inspector-in-charge of the SSKM outpost  start a probe against them and prepare a report within 72 hours.        
	The authorities also accepted the other two demands  step up security on campus and restrict entry of outsiders in the wards.        
	But despite pleas from Mitra and superintendent Debashish Bhattacharya, the doctors refused to budge. We will continue with the ceasework till security is stepped up, asserted Dilip Dutta, a junior doctor.        
	An angry Bhattacharya then announced that he had been forced to ask all state-run hospitals not to refer patients to SSKM. We dont want patients to be harassed.        
	Soon after this, the college council met and decided to take stern action against the doctors if they refused to join work. The agitators finally relented around 6pm.

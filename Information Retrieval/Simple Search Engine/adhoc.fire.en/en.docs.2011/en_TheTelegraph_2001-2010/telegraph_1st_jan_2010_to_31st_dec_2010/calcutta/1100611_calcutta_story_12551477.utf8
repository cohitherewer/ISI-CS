The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Held up on train, horror on mind
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Held up on train, horror on mind
          OUR BUREAU                          Duronto Express passengers could afford a smile after the train reached Howrah on Thursday afternoon. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Dark coaches with curtains drawn, rumours of the train being hijacked by Maoists, an order from the authorities not even to venture into toilets....        
	Passengers on the Mumbai-Howrah Duronto Express suffered perhaps the most harrowing 17 hours of their lives after their train got stranded in Ghatshila and Tatanagar on Wednesday following rumours that Maoists had planned to attack it near Jhargram.        
	The train finally arrived at Howrah at 12.17pm on Thursday, almost 17 hours behind schedule.        
	We were almost reliving the Jnaneswari Express horror, said Vineeta Sharma, who was travelling in coach A3.        
	After the train had arrived at Ghatshila at 5.30pm on Wednesday, the authorities announced that there was a problem and asked us draw the curtains and not even to go to the toilet unless it was an emergency, said Rama Acharya, a passenger of B1. The Dum Dum resident was returning home from Mumbai with her daughter.        
	With the train being stranded in a Maoist belt and memories of the Jnaneswari Express tragedy fresh in everyones mind, rumours started flying thick and fast.         
	Some of us feared that Maoists had stormed the train while a few said landmines had been planted on the tracks. Passengers immediately switched off the lights out of fear, said Liluah resident Vineeta, who was travelling with her two-and-a-half-year-old son. With the compartment absolutely dark, I sat tight clutching my child, recalled Vineeta.        
	The train was taken back to Tatanagar around 10pm and dinner was served at 2am but most passengers were too scared to eat.        
	The train left for Calcutta in the morning but was stuck again at Ghatshila for 45 minutes from 7.15am. The bomb detection squad flashed the all-clear sign at 7.55am. After that the train left for Howrah, said an official.        
	Mumbai resident Bireswar Chatterjee, who was travelling with his wife, children and mother-in-law, said no securitymen could be seen at night.

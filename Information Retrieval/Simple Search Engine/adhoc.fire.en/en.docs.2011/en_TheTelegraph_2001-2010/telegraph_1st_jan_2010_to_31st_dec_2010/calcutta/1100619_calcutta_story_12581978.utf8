          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	First-year college student Sutanuka Chatterjee committed suicide by jumping in front of a Kavi Nazrul-bound Metro Railway train at MG Road station around 5.15pm on Friday.         
	She was cheerful when she left her Howrah home around noon to go to tuition classes, said her family members. She had said that she would return home after seeing a homoeopathy doctor since she was suffering from indigestion.         
	Trains operated between Maidan and Kavi Nazrul stations till 5.50pm, when the body was removed from under the rake and normal service restored, said a Metro official.

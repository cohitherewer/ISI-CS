The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blame shiver on wind chill
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Blame shiver on wind chill
          OUR BUREAU                          Young Calcuttans beat the chill on Monday night. Picture by Pabitra Das                                  
	Calcutta shivered at 11.4 degrees Celsius on Monday with cold winds from the north and northwest raising the chill factor beyond the mercury reading and forcing some schools to contemplate delaying the morning bell.        
	The city is currently the meeting point of the north and northwest wind flows, which explains why you are feeling the chill. This is likely to continue over the next 48 hours, an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) told Metro from New Delhi.        
	According to meteorologists, wind chill has a stronger impact on the body than the Celsius.        
	Simply put, wind chill is the apparent temperature felt on exposed skin because of a cold breeze. How much we feel the cold depends on air temperature and wind speed, said a senior scientist of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida.                
	But if the city is feeling the chill, why isnt it showing on the Celsius scale?        
	Wind doesnt directly pull down temperatures because other factors are also at play. But when the temperature is 12 degrees Celsius and the wind speed is around 10 knots, you would feel as cold as you would when the mercury reads 10 degrees. That is what is happening in Calcutta, explained O.P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of a private Met agency.         
	The human body loses heat largely by evaporative cooling and convection. The rate of heat loss depends largely on the wind speed  the greater the wind speed, the faster the surface cools.        
	The Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore has forecast a chilly Tuesday morning, with the minimum temperature hovering around 11 degrees. Mondays minimum reading was two degrees below normal, which has been the trend for much of the past fortnight.        
	The northwesterlies are becoming colder and stronger while passing through the Jharkhand-Chhattisgarh-Orissa belt, which is experiencing a cold wave. The intensified northwesterlies have already resulted in a cold wave over Bankura, Purulia, Birbhum, West Midnapore and East Midnapore districts, where the minimum temperatures are five degrees or more below normal at the moment, an official of the Alipore Met office said.        
	With the minimum temperatures in central and adjoining east India likely to fall further by three to four degrees over the next 48 hours, Calcutta and south Bengal are set to feel the chill as well over the next few days.        
	Several schools that reopened on Monday after the Christmas and New Year holidays received requests from parents to allow their wards to report for class later than usual because of the morning chill.        
	The morning madness at home was more than usual on Monday with our son refusing to get out of bed. We had to drag him out from under the quilt to ensure that he reached school by 6.50am, said Runu Sinha of Golf Green, the mother of a Class IV student of Ram Mohan Mission School.         
	Sujoy Biswas, the principal of this ICSE institution in south Calcutta, said he would excuse late arrivals as long as the cold spell persisted.        
	We understand how difficult it is for the little ones to get out of bed in this weather and get ready for school. It is not possible for us to keep our institution closed, though we are ready to give some relief to the kids in terms of coming a little late, Biswas said.        
	Nabarun Dey, the principal of Central Modern School in Baranagar, made a similar announcement.         
	Holy Cross School, near Baruipur on the southern fringes, has decided on an 8.30am start  instead of 8am  from Tuesday.        
	At Vivekananda Mission School in Thakurpukur, which starts its day at 7.30am, the school authorities were prepared to extend the holidays for the primary classes but Monday saw no late arrivals. The first day went off without a hitch, and we are keeping our fingers crossed about attendance figures over the next few days, said principal Keya Sinha.        
	Students of Christian missionary schools in the city are lucky the cold spell has coincided with their holidays. All these schools wont reopen until next week.

	Fire minister Pratim Chatterjee on Monday submitted to the chief minister a report on the role of firemen in dousing the Stephen Court blaze and the problems they faced in the process.         
	I have suggested the changes necessary in the department. The recommendations would be sent to the finance department and once its approval comes, new equipment would be purchased, said Chatterjee, declining to elaborate on the contents.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had met the fire minister shortly after the Stephen Court blaze and asked him to submit a report listing what the department needed to improve its functioning.

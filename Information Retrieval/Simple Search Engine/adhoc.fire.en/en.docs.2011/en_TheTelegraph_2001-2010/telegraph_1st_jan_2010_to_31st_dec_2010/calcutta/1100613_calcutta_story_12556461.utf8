                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tress of hair amp; doodles
                                Adip Dutta and Jayashree Chakaraborty put up the exhibition, Writing Visuals, at Harrington Street Arts Centre. Picture by Aranya Sen. (Right) A still from the film Sabuj Dwiper RajaPosters on Writers rsquo; Buildings wall                                 
	Mithu Sens tresses set the tone for the well-researched show. The invitation card in off-white and charcoal grey depicts a tangle of hair. The exhibition, Writing Visuals, opening at the Harrington Street Arts Centre on Ho Chi Minh Sarani on Monday, is not only about drawing as we know it, but its extension in other media as well.         
	Adip Dutta, the curator and also a participant, says there was always the danger of the gallerys magnificent colonial space overwhelming the works he had handpicked, most of which is of an intimate and personal kind. The place is so inviting, indeed, with its high-ceilinged halls and one long verandah shaded by khus that it is natural for many to be attracted to it for reasons other than art. Especially in Calcutta, starved as it is of good places.         
	Dutta is touched by the cooperation of senior artists. Vivan Sundarams bad drawings for Dost, an exhibition in honour of Bhupen Khakkar, are on show. Jogen Chowdhury has lent his notebook of 1995 vintage. It contains his jottings and sketches of some important works such as the leaping tiger and the fierce-eyed goddess. Among other artists are Manisha Parekh, Dilip Ranade, Debnath Basu, Partha Pratim Deb, Sudhir Patwardhan, Alex Matthew, Samir Roy and Paula Sengupta. Jayashree Chakaraborty displays a large painting of nature under duress. And Kishore Chatterjee, a man not usually associated with paintings, has put up his doodles.        
	Wish on the wall                  Posters on Writers' Buildings wall      
	A fortnight ago when the PWD minister announced the governments decision to make the whole of Writers Buildings go thanda thanda cool cool, it demonstrated once more the power of the writing on the wall. No AC, No work the posters were screaming, especially ever since it was out that the PWD department workers had coaxed their minister to get an AC for the summer on rent. It is a different matter if the ACs were lulling the babus into a deeper slumber in between tea breaks.         
	The wall did its bit even in procuring the dearness allowance. Rather than the more routine posters the ones that must have pricked the finance minister more were the creative ones. One took recourse to the poetry of protest  Hajirar prohoshon,/ Tofa achhey proshashon/ Paona chaile pore/ Bansh debe Bibhishon/ Karmochari onaharey/ Bajarey jwale agun/ Bokeya ar DA mere/ Asim-er bhatghum. Another got downright sarcastic. Headlined Sandhan pele janan (Inform if found), it reads in translation: The state governments sack of dearness allowance has gone missing. Anyone finding it, please inform Asimbabu. Needless to say, the DA too has been hiked last March.         
	To take over Writers, does Mamata Banerjee just need to put up some poetry on its walls?         
	Kakababu in English                   A photocopy shop in Chandernagore claims to be the original even as a shop of the same name stands next to it. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta       
	Sunil Gangopadhyays Kakababu has been a hero for many teenagers. Crippled and on crutches, Kakababu has had amazing adventures that not just challenged him mentally but put him in difficult situations physically. Now his exploits will be accessible to a larger audience. His first published adventure story Bhayankar Sundar and the most popular Sabuj Dwiper Raja are now available in English, translated by Nirmal Kanti Bhattacharjee and Tridiv Chowdhury respectively.         
	Published by Ponytale Books, these books are available at Rs 125. At the launch at Starmark, poet Nirendranath Chakrabarti recalled how in Anandamela, of which he was then editor, Kakababu was drawn without a moustache. I think Sunils brilliant characters will now be popular with a vast number of children. It is a very good day for literature, he said. Gangopadhyay himself was pleased with the translations and hoped that the children will continue to like Kakababu.

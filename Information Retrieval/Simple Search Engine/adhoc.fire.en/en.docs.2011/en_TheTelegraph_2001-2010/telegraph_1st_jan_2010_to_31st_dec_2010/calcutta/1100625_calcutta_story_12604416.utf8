	VINAY SHRESHTHA, 
  Salkia        
	I would like to have Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo in my favourite club team because he has amazing footwork and makes great passes. Next I will choose Argentinas Lionel Messi because he is superb. After that my choice is German striker Miroslav Klose, the golden boot winner in 2006 Fifa World Cup, because he has been a real revelation in goal scoring. Last but not the least, my choice will be Brazilian mid-fielder Kaka because of his flamboyant soccer skills.              
	

SOMESH NANDI,

	Only getting three or four top players in a club cannot make a club better. Proper coordination and respect among the players is the key to success. The four players of my choice are Lionel Messi (forward), Xavi Hernandez (midfielder), Nemanja Vidic (defender) and Edwin Van Der Sar (goalkeeper). Seeing these players together on Calcutta grounds would surely be a dream come true for all football fans and Im no exception. Whether they play in Mohun Bagan or East Bengal does not make any difference. The thing that really matters is their presence on our grounds. There wont be any empty seats in the stadium if they come.               
	

SAMIR CASSIM ARIFF,
  Amartalla Lane,         
	The four footballers from the Fifa World Cup 2010 squads, that I would love to have in my favourite club team in Calcutta are Miroslav Klose from Germany, Ronaldo from Portugal, Wayne Rooney from England and Lionel Messi from Argentina. They are the worlds best players and soccer legends.               
	

AAKASHDEEP DUTTA,
  Barasat         
	I am a supporter of Mohun Bagan club. My favourite players are Ronaldo, Messi, Drogba and Kaka. Id like to include them in a Calcutta team to inject life in Bengal football.        
	

INDRANIL SANYAL, 
  Dhakuria        
	The four footballers I want for Mohun Bagan are Lionel Messi of Argentina, Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal, Cannavaro of Italy and Fernando Torres of Spain. The inclusion of these footballers will not only uplift the standard of Calcutta football but will inevitably help the club add feathers to its crown. While Torres and Messi will mesmerise the opponents by their dodges and dribbles in the attacking third, the wing play of Ronaldo will add venom to the penetration. Cannavaro will act as the defensive screen and take care of the opponent strikers. His presence will act as a wall in the Bagan defence.         
	

CHIRAG MANDAL, 
  Belur         
	Julio Cesar, the Inter Milan goalie, is my first choice as goalkeeper. With his experience and exceptional reflexes, he is also a good bet for Brazil in the penalty shoot-outs. Nemanja Vidic is probably the best defender at the moment. This Manchester United and Serbia player is known for his tough play. He always breathes down the neck of opposition strikers and also has a good header which comes in handy in set-piece situations. Xavi Hernandez, the talismanic mid-fielder, plays for Barcelona and Spain and is known for his precision-perfect passes with a virtual compass attached to his feet. Lionel Messi needs no introduction. Any coach would dream to have him in his team. The Barcelona and Argentina forward is a true successor of Diego Maradona and this World Cup can herald him as one of the greatest ever to have graced the game after Pele and Maradona.               
	

TRIDHA GHOSH, 
  Duttapukur         
	I want Robinho, Cristiano Ronaldo, Juan Sebastian Veron and Bastian Schweinsteiger in my Mohun Bagan team because I love their technique of playing, their way of defending, power and speed.

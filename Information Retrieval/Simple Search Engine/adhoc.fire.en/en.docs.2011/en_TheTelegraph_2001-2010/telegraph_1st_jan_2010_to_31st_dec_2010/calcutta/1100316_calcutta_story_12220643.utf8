The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clear the clutter and allow art in public space
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Clear the clutter and allow art in public space
  - International symposium underlines the need to break out of the PWD brand of aesthetics          SOMAK GHOSHAL                          Artists Jogen Chowdhury (centre) and Ganesh Pyne light the inaugural lamp for Mondays international symposium on art, while Goethe-Institut director Reimar Volker looks on. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                        
	Gregor Schneider, the German artist working on a major public art project for Calcutta, has chosen Swapnapuri as his working title. But harsh realities far outweighed the dreams in the course of the daylong international symposium, Art in Public Space: Waste or Wonder?        
	Organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and Goethe-Institut, in partnership with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), the seminar hosted distinguished artists, art historians, curators and administrators from India and abroad. Strong opinions and feisty audience participation summed up the mood of the day.        
	The morning session was flagged off with an incisive speech by Rakhi Sarkar, chairperson of the Ficci Committee on Art and Business of Art, and managing trustee of the upcoming Kolkata Museum of Modern Art (KMOMA). Noting the lack of a holistic aesthetic utterance in urban spaces, Sarkar lamented the prevailing ethos of a public works department (PWD) brand of aesthetics.        
	It would have been interesting to hear the mayors take on the matter, but he could not attend, thanks to the municipal budget. Municipal commissioner Arnab Roy stated the obvious: Art in public space does not feature on the CMCs agenda as yet. The audience could not agree more.        
	Jogen Chowdhury emphasised the need to clean up the existing clutter. For public art projects to take off, the administration must create suitable spaces for the artists to work in. He felt that the many neglected parks and the filthy riverbank could be revived by the CMC as venues for artistic excursions.        
	The captivating presentations by Christine Litz, curator and art historian, drove home Chowdhurys point. Speaking on arts power to influence national perceptions, Litz showed a slideshow on the sculpture project in Mnster, a German city which turns into a museum of contemporary art every 10 years.        
	In fact, the long-term hope for Calcutta, as Sarkar said, is to also have a Mnster-like experiment every five years. Reimar Volker, director of Goethe-Institut, added that Indo-German projects like 48C (New Delhi, 2008) have already opened up possibilities of public art in India.        
	But Calcutta has a long way to go.         
	Problems that afflict Calcutta are familiar across India. As art writer Gayatri Sinha said, A laissez faire attitude of neglect is central to Indian public life. Vivan Sundaram agreed, comparing the measly government grants available to artists in India with the extraordinary indulgence enjoyed by those in Europe.         
	Another artist, Balan Nambiar, also shared his bizarre, often intensely frustrating, experiences. Vandalism of artworks being a routine affair in India, Nambiar wondered why the safety of the installed objects is never given priority. The reason, he said, could be the abysmal ignorance about art, especially among bureaucrats and policymakers.        
	The idea found resonance in the post-lunch interactive session. Vivek Bharadwaj, chief executive officer of the CMDA, was amenable to the idea of an urban arts council though he confessed his utter ignorance of art.        
	So who, then, decides what goes into public space and how? Artist Jitish Kallat insisted that this question be woven into any discussion of public art in India, where there is daily war on the streets. Illegal constructions, eviction notices and land grabbing have to be taken into account for art to be meaningful in Indian public life.        
	Architect Ayan Sen also stressed the need to redefine the public realm by making the residents of a neighbourhood active stakeholders in an ongoing project. People must be made to look beyond PWD standards and realise the potentials of modern architecture, a sentiment echoed by K.T. Ravindran, chairman of the Delhi Urban Art Commission. Reflecting on the first principles, Ravindran referred to the rule, in place since 1972, of allocating 2 per cent of the funds for public projects to public art.         
	What, then, is happening to the money? A highway has obstructed the faade of the Indian Museum, hideous billboards have effaced the city. quot;These would be unimaginable in any civilised nation, quot; said art writer Sovon Som.        
	There was a consensus on the need for greater public awareness through discussions in the media, by including art education in school curricula, and by involving artists in the life of the community. But, as writer and filmmaker Ruchir Joshi said, public art projects should be allowed to grow in Calcutta even as the city tidies up itself.

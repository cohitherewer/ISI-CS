The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Army pulls down gate
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Army pulls down gate
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four men in olive green uniform dismantled on Monday morning a temporary gate put up in front of Netaji Indoor Stadium to mark the Left Fronts 33-year rule in the state, according to a complaint lodged with police.         
	The organisers of a programme held at the stadium on Monday to celebrate the occasion lodged the complaint.        
	We are trying to find out who in olive green uniform dismantled the temporary gate. The organisers had the mandatory permission from the state governments sports department to hold the programme at the venue, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	According to the police, a group of five to six army men came in a jeep to the stadium around 6.30am and pulled down the gate. They were hardly there for 10 minutes, said a police officer.        
	Lalbazar sources said army men contacted the police headquarters and said that the organisers had not sought permission from the army to organise the event.        
	We told them that organisers do not need army clearance for holding programmes at the stadium. We issue a no- objection certificate to organisers after they get the nod from the sports department, said the officer.        
	Army officers refused comment.        
	The police accused the army of creating a problem without any reason.         
	They were talking about beautification of Maidan. How can a temporary gate in front of the stadium disturb Maidans beauty? Besides, the army is supposed to keep an eye on any permanent or semi-permanent structure being constructed in Maidan. How can a flex-made gate fall under such a category? asked the officer.

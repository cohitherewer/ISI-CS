The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Woman knew killer: Police
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Woman knew killer: Police
          A STAFF REPORTER                            The first-floor apartment of Chetna Sanghvi; (above) the flats door. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                 
	Chetna Sanghvi was throttled to death and she apparently knew at least one of the killers, police said on Tuesday.        
	The 55-year-old, whose husband Mahesh runs a gift shop in Burrabazar, was found murdered in her first-floor flat in Rays Lane in Bhowanipore around 6.30pm on Monday.        
	The post-mortem has revealed that the bone in the womans neck was crushed under heavy external pressure. One of her ribs, too, was broken. It seems at least one of the killers sat on her and throttled her, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of the detective department.        
	Sleuths suspect a niece of Mahesh was involved in the murder. The niece, a resident of Liluah in Howrah, is absconding.        
	We have found a ladys bag on a wooden rack beside the main door of the flat. The bag does not belong to the Sanghvis. Inside were a cellphone and a receipt of a life insurance premium issued to the niece. The woman must have left her bag in her hurry to flee, said an officer of Bhowanipore police station.         
	Witnesses told the police that two men and a woman had come to the Sanghvis flat together on Monday afternoon.        
	We suspect the woman was the niece. Seeing her, Chetna Sanghvi must have opened the door and let in her killers. We have examined the door-frame; there was no sign of forced entry, an investigating officer said.        
	We suspect the killers had raided the flat in search of valuables, not knowing that the family had kept all its jewellery and other valuables in bank. There was very little cash at home, the officer added.        
	Chetnas body was discovered when her maternal uncle Vinod Mehta, who lives on the second floor of the building, opened the flat with a duplicate key after repeated knocks on the door went unanswered.        
	She was lying in the bed on her back. The bed-sheet was intact and there was no sign of scuffle or resistance. We were told the gold chain and bangles she wore are missing, said Sarbadarshan Ghosh, the Sanghvis neighbour.

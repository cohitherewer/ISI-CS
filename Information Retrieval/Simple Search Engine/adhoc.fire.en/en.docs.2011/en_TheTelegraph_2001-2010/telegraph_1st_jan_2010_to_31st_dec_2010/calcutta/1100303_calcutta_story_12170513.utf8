The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Freak fog disrupts flight schedules
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Freak fog disrupts flight schedules

	Unseasonal fog enveloped Calcutta airport on Tuesday morning, disrupting several flights and leaving thousands of passengers stranded.        
	Planes could not take off from or land at the Dum Dum airport between 6.06am and 7.41am. Twenty-five flights were delayed by half an hour to two hours, said an official.         
	Air Indias service to Port Blair and Kingfishers to Raipur were the only flights that could take off before the visibility dropped.        
	At 6am, Air Indias flight to Mumbai went to the runway but had to return to the parking bay. A chartered flight from Dubai was diverted to Dhaka. Two other planes had to hover over the city for more than 30 minutes.        
	The visibility requirement for take-off from the airport was recently lowered to 150, 175 and 200m for various categories of aircraft. For landing, the visibility must be 300m or more.        
	The visibility dropped below 100 metres in the morning, making it impossible for flights to operate. Even after the fog lifted, flights were delayed because of runway congestion, said an official.        
	The runway visibility started improving at 7am. Flight operations resumed at 7.41am with an Emirates flight from Dubai landing after hovering for more than 30 minutes. Kingfishers flight to Bangalore was the first to take off after the weather improved.        
	The weatherman attributed the unseasonal fog to high humidity. A high pressure zone over the Bay of Bengal had formed on Monday evening, which resulted in higher humidity over south Bengal. The residue of a western disturbance that passed through north Bengal also contributed to the fog, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the Alipore Met office.        
	The climatic conditions have also pushed up the temperature. The minimum temperature has stayed well above normal almost every day in the past three weeks (see chart). On Wednesday, the minimum rose six notches above normal to 23.2 degrees Celsius.         
	The maximum temperature too has been high over the past few days. It was five degrees above normal at 36.2 degrees Celsius on Monday.        
	The minimum has stayed high because of hot and dry continental winds that are following the western disturbances through Bengal, added Debnath. According to him, the maximum temperature has risen over the past few days primarily because of the high humidity.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Official delay dogs voter roll revision

	Officials reporting for work late and shortage of forms are delaying electoral roll revision even after the deadline for the process was pushed back from July 23 to July 30.         
	On July 21, Metro had reported how state and central government officials responsible for distributing and accepting forms had been showing up late at four centres in the central Calcutta.        
	On Tuesday, Metro revisited the centres and found that little has changed since last week.        
	At 12.05pm on Tuesday, the queue at St Georges Free School on BB Ganguly Street had 15 applicants and only one official was present to take their forms.        
	Another official arrived at the centre at 12.10pm. According to the rules, the officials should have been at the centre from 11am. The duty hours extend till 5pm on Sunday and till 4pm on other days.         
	There was no one at the counter when I came at 11am so I had to return, said Bodhodoy Chakroborty, a Bowbazar resident in the queue.         
	Those waiting to submit their applications at Maheswari Bhavan on Sovaram Basak Street in Posta narrated a similar experience.        
	I first visited the centre on July 21 but there was no one to accept my application. I left after waiting an hour. I returned around 11.45am the next day and found that no officer had turned up, said Gouranga Shaw, a resident of Hariram Goenka Street.         
	At Calcutta Muslim Orphanage School on New CIT Road, only one out of the two designated officials had turned up at 11.10am on Tuesday.        
	Applicants complained of scarcity of forms. I had to photocopy another applicants form, said one of those who had queued up.         
	There are many illiterate and semi-literate people in this area. The election commission was supposed to issue a separate form for them but did not, said an official in a centre at central Calcutta.         
	The number of forms given to us is inadequate. We asked for more forms but the authorities did not send us any, said another official.         
	He added his centre has only 15 copies of the form for new applicants.        
	On an average, 15 new applicants come each day, he added.         
	The state election commission admitted to the problem. It is for this reason we accept photocopies of the forms and applications typed in the same format, said Sunil Gupta, the chief electoral officer of West Bengal.

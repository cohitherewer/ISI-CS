The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops to trim cracker list
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops to trim cracker list
        A STAFF REPORTER                          Crackers being exploded during the test on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Half the crackers exploded on the Maidan on Thursday failed the decibel test, prompting police to decide on revising the list of fireworks that can be sold at Baaji Bazaar starting Saturday.        
	The state pollution control board officials who conducted the test with police refused to divulge the results, but insiders said 19 of the 38 types of crackers put to test failed to make the cut.        
	Some of the crackers even violated the national standard, less stringent than what has been set by the state. In Bengal, any cracker that produces more than 90 decibel sound at five metres from the point of origin is banned. The national limit is 125 decibel at four metres from the point of explosion.        
	Some of the crackers exploded today recorded anything between 122 and 128 decibel at a distance of five metres. This is shocking, said a pollution control board official.        
	The board will send us a new set of recommendations based on todays findings, following which we will revise the list of fireworks that can be sold at Baaji Bazaar at the Shahid Minar ground, said an officer at Lalbazar.        
	The results left many wondering how banned crackers, or raw materials used for making such fireworks, were finding their way to local markets despite cops making arrests and seizures everyday in the run up to Diwali.        
	There is a problem. Most of the licensed manufacturers operate nationally and some of their products are aimed for states other than Bengal where the limit is 120 decibel. So crackers banned here are legal outside, said Damayanti Sen, the joint commissioner of police (crime).        
	We have made several arrests and seized crackers that were making their way to the city from outside. Over the past four days, cops arrested three persons and seized 3,450 kg of crackers from different parts of the city.        
	Sanjoy Dutta, the secretary of the Burrabazar Fireworks Dealers Association, which organises Baaji Bazaar, expressed surprise at so many types of crackers failing to clear the decibel test. This year we have been very cautious about the types of crackers we are bringing in, but strangely some of the items that had passed the test last year failed this year. How can that be?        
	Pollution control board experts reasoned that though the labels on the crackers have remained the same, the composition might have changed.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      God of glam comes calling
  - Bollywoods biggest designer in town for t2 events          A STAFF REPORTER                          HOW WOULD SHAH RUKH LOOK IN THIS? Manish Malhotra checks out street fashion in the Oberoi Grand arcade on Sunday afternoon. Picture by Pabitra Das                                        
	The women in Calcutta are really so beautiful.        
	Every famous face from B-town talks about how beautiful Calcutta women are. But when it comes from the man who has made every Bolly heroine from Madhuri Dixit to Priyanka Chopra, Kajol to Kareena Kapoor look their best, it sure means something.        
	The women in Calcutta are beautiful, stressed Manish Malhotra on Sunday afternoon, in town to spend time with Team t2 and attend a few events organised by the lifestyle tabloid of The Telegraph.        
	Bollywoods numero uno costume designer wasnt just talking about Raima and Riya Sen  both of whom he finds very pretty  but of Calcutta women in general. And he should know, given how the demand for the Manish Malhotra look has been growing among brides-to-be in town.        
	In the last year or so, my Calcutta clientele has gone up in a major way, he revealed. I think the perception has changed drastically. A lot of brides from here now want to wear a Manish Malhotra, especially for an event like the sangeet. They just want the all-glam look.        
	Manish is, of course, no stranger to the city, having shown here quite a few times including at TT Weddings, one of the Kolkata Fashion Weeks and most recently at the first IPL Nights party on March 14.        
	I love Calcutta, said Manish. Its a city which can hold its culture. Also, I like the colonial feel. The people are warm and the food is good. Its just so calming to be here. I get such nice vibes, he added, over a working lunch of rolls from Nizams.        
	The man, who in the past couple of decades has changed the way the Indian heroine looks, remembers how in 2003 he had scoured the lanes of Kalighat to get the perfect cotton sari and bangles for Rani Mukerji in Mani Ratnams Yuva.        
	On this trip, Bollywoods god of glamour is scheduled to go partying at Shisha, have a meal at Mangio, spend time with aspiring fashionistas and t2 readers at Roxy, and catch up with fellow fashion designer Anamika Khanna.

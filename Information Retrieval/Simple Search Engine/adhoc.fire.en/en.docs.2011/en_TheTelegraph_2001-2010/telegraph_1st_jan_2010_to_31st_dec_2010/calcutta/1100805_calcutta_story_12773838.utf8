The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schools learn post-cane lessons
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Schools learn post-cane lessons
          SUBHAJOY ROY                                             
	Class IX student Abir thought he had done something awful when his class teacher informed him last month that she and a colleague would be visiting his parents at their home the next day. The pre-visit jitters soon turned to joy when Abir heard the duo telling his parents how well their son was doing in school despite the occasional lapse in concentration.        
	And I thought they had come only to complain to my parents about the pranks I play in class and the guardian call note I had hidden from them, recalls a relieved Abir.        
	Exit corporal punishment, enter discipline with a dose of compassion.        
	City schools are rewriting the old code of mischief and punishment in the classroom to come up with a list of innovative best practices meant to help teachers spare the rod without spoiling the child.         
	At St Xaviers Institution in Panihati, on the northern fringes, parent-teacher meetings have already shifted from the school to the home to keep things private, informal and constructive.         
	We introduced it last month and its worked well. It gives us the opportunity to identify the strengths and address the weaknesses of each child individually, said principal Sikha Mukhopadhyay.        
	At Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, breach of discipline now invites additional responsibility. Errant students are kept busy with remedial tasks like making sure everyone attends the morning assembly and nobody loiters in the canteen after the lunch break. Some are asked to report early and manage traffic in front of the school before class starts.        
	These tasks give children a sense of importance and teaches them that rules are meant to be observed, not broken. Responsibility also keeps the naughtier ones occupied, said principal Malini Bhagat.        
	Delhi Public School, New Town, disciplines high school students by turning them into teachers during the lunch break. They have to teach math and English to junior school students. That makes the penalty for indiscipline a constructive one, said principal Udita Ganguly.        
	The rush to find innovative ways to enforce rules was apparently triggered by the suicide of Class VIII student Rouvanjit Rawla four days after being caned at La Martiniere for Boys. Most schools, however, insist the controversy has nothing to do with the changes.        
	Officials at Apeejay School, where students need to stay back after the final bell and arrange the desks with the teachers if they are guilty of any misconduct, point out that they introduced the concept of parents in the classroom a year ago.        
	For the last one year we have been inviting parents of one student every Friday to attend class along with their ward. The idea is to help them understand what goes into schooling. They can then send us their views, said Janardan Ghosh, cultural co-ordinator of Apeejay School.

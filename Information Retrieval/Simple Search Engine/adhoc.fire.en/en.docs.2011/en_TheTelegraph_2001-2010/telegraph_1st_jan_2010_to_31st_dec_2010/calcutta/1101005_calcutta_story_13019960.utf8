                      Looking back for a future art idiom                    Before Jamini Roy forged his unique style that earned him national and international fame, he spent a long time mastering the styles and techniques of western academism. Soon, the spirit of nationalism captured his imagination and he began to paint watercolours featuring lyrical images of Santhal women in almost bare rural settings. His quest for a distinctive style made him turn to folk and tribal art traditions of his native Bengal. Inspired by its expressive freshness and formal vitality, he developed his idea of modernism, which was nationalist in spirit and urban in temperament. The ongoing exhibition of his works bears traces of all the significant stages of the masters artistic development.

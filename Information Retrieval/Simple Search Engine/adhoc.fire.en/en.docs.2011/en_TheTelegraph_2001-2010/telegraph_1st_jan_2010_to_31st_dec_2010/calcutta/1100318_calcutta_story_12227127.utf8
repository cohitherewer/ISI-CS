The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Eden loyalty goes for a 6
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Eden loyalty goes for a 6
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                              
	Kolkata Knight Riders vs Chennai Super Kings. Over no. 17. Laxmi Ratan Shukla to Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Length ball, the enemy skipper clears front foot and heaves the ball high over long on. SIX. Eden Gardens erupts  in joy.              
	It no longer matters whose bat the big hits are coming from, Sourav Gangulys or Mahendra Singh Dhonis. Eden Gardens is out to have fun this IPL season, hitting loyalty to team and talisman for a six.        
	I came here to enjoy a T20 match without getting tense over victory or defeat. Some of Dhonis hits were huge, smiled Nilanjan Chattopadhyay of Caf Coffee Day, after Team KKR had made a hash of chasing 165 to win on Tuesday.        
	Not that Nilanjan didnt want the colour of victory to be purple rather than yellow. But with national pride not being at stake, his tickets worth of entertainment was more important to him than a KKR win.        
	Many of those who stayed back after Souravs dismissal were even baying for KKR wickets. It was, as an Eden regular put it with polite restraint, a revelation.        
	What was the turning point in the tale of team loyalty? The home team had started off well, taking three Chennai wickets by the ninth over. Then in walked Dhoni and the equation changed. As he started slamming the ball, fans in purple who were rooting for Bond, Shane Bond, began cheering the Team India skipper.        
	Bagha Jatin resident and Dhoni fan Abir Dasgupta was taken aback. Chennai na jitley aaj para-ey dhuktey debe na (If Chennai doesnt win, I wont be able to enter my locality), he had said while entering the ground, thinking that his would be the lone pro-Dhoni voice in the stands.        
	By the time the scoreboard read Dhoni: 66 off 33 balls, Abir was leading a strong cheering squad for Chennai in J Block. Many of them were female fans like student Nikita Agarwal, who would rather have Dhonis poster in her bedroom than Souravs.        
	The huge support must have surprised Dhoni, who was asked by Sunil Gavaskar before the match how it would feel to have the Eden crowd roar against, and not for him, weeks after beating South Africa at the venue.        
	Squeals of Dhoni, Dhoni during the presentation ceremony almost equalled the Shah Rukh...Shah Rukh chorus that is now a ritual at the Eden for KKR matches.        
	Businessman Prahlad Agarwala, whose company is a KKR associate, didnt seem unduly bothered that the home team had lost. Its just one private club facing another, he laughed.         
	Psychiatrist Bhargavi Chatterjea Bhattacharyya attributed the shift to cognitive dissonance, in psychology parlance. The crowd came wanting Sourav and KKR to play well and win. While that didnt happen, Dhoni did exactly what they had expected the KKR captain to do. With Sourav and Dhoni sharing the identity of Team India captain  yesterday and today  in their minds, it was natural for loyalties to shift to the winning option without pricking their conscience.         
	Ballygunge homemaker Suman Agarwal, who came to the lower tier of the club house in a group of 40, bore her out. There were Indians on both sides, she said.        
	So, will Sourav enjoy greater crowd support during his next home match on April 1 against an Aussie-led Deccan Chargers? Only if a V.V.S. Laxman doesnt hit the KKR attack for a six.

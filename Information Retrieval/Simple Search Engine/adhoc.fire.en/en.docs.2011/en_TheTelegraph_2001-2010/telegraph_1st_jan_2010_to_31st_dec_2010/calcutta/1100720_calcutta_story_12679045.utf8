The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mishap hazard at chaos crossroad
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mishap hazard at chaos crossroad

	Commuting through the AL-BL block crossing, one of the busiest in Salt Lake, has become risky with minor accidents happening every other day. Metro takes a look at the problems that plague the three-point intersection of the Salt Lake AL-BL block box bridge, approach road to Nabadiganta flyover and the Rajarhat Expressway connector.              
	Missing guard rails        
	The paths towards the box bridge and the approach road to Nabadiganta flyover were demarcated with the help of guard rails that regulated the movement of vehicles to and from Salt Lake.         
	The guard rails were removed during the recent municipal elections and have not been re-installed, which allows vehicles to suddenly swerve at the crossing thus posing a threat, said Sanjeev Agarwal, who works in a Sector V company.        
	An official of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, which is responsible for the tech hub administration, said the cops had re-installed some guard rails following his instructions but those were removed by motorists.         
	Cop crunch        
	Cops are hard to spot on the stretch even on weekdays. According to residents, policemen can only be seen at the intersection if VVIPs take the route to the airport or on their way to the city.        
	At least nine minor mishaps had occurred at the intersection in the past month.        
	Officers of Electronic Complex police station expressed helplessness, citing staff strength of only 23.        
	With so few men available, its difficult for us to depute officers along the stretch daily, said an officer of the police station.        
	Mixed signal        
	Traffic signals were erected at the intersection earlier this year following demands by residents and Sector V employees. However, the lights still do not work and motorists cross the intersection at will, putting lives at risk.         
	At times, it becomes very difficult to drive through the intersection with vehicles coming from all directions. Last month, a Matador brushed past my car, leaving dents and scratches. With the signals not working and no policemen around to control traffic, the situation will remain the same, said DL block resident Ananta Chatterjee.        
	Dark danger         
	Street lights are not working on the stretch for months, making the area accident-prone.         
	After dusk, the headlights of vehicles are the only source of illumination. In the dark, rickshawpullers often pedal down the wrong lane to reach their stand faster, said Ritoban Chatterjee, an employee at a New Town IT firm who is a regular on the stretch.        
	Cramped corridor        
	Construction materials such as sand and stone chips are dumped by the side of the Rajarhat Expressway approach, narrowing it and making driving hazardous.         
	Since there is no zebra crossing on the stretch, pedestrians cross the road wherever they want.        
	Official version        
	We cannot replace the guard rails with permanent median dividers since the channel is occasionally used by VVIPs to enter and leave Salt Lake. However, I would immediately ask my officers to put the guard rails back in place at the crossing, said a senior officer of North 24-Parganas traffic police.        
	I would also check if construction materials are dumped along the road and take steps to make the traffic signals functional, he added.

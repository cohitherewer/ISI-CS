The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Youth held with fake notes
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Youth held with fake notes
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth carrying a bag full of fake Rs 500 notes was arrested outside the western gate of New Market on Monday morning.         
	Biswarup Deb Burman, a resident of South Dinajpur, had received the counterfeit notes of Rs 2 lakh from a Bangladeshi man who had sneaked into India, said an officer of the Special Task Force (STF).         
	Deb Burman, in his late-20s, was to hand over the money to another person, suspect the cops.         
	The fake notes were of good quality and common people would have found it difficult to tell them from original ones, said Rajeev Kumar, the additional commissioner of police (STF).        
	We received a tip-off that a youth would visit the city with a consignment of fake currency. We checked the registers of all guesthouses and hotels in the area where these people put up and tracked down Deb Burman.        
	To catch the youth red-handed, plainclothesmen waited for him outside New Market.        
	During interrogation, Deb Burman initially claimed he did not know that the notes were fake. But he later broke down and confessed to the crime. He said it was the first time he was ferrying counterfeit notes for a commission. But we are not ready to accept it, said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Train tragedy drains railway coffers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Train tragedy drains railway coffers
          A STAFF REPORTER                          EAR Me: Mamata Banerjee and Sovan Chatterjee at Majherhat railway station on Monday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	The Jnaneswari Express tragedy, Maoist threat and the fuel price hike have combined to pinch the railway pocket, Mamata Banerjee said on Monday.        
	The Jnaneswari Express had got derailed at Rajabandh in West Midnapore and was hit by a goods train coming from the opposite direction early on May 28, killing over 150 people.        
	Night running of trains in that section has been suspended since then, severely affecting freight services. This has caused a loss of Rs 250 crore, the railway minister said at Majherhat station while flagging off four suburban trains.        
	Because of the Maoist threat, Mamata added, pilot trains have to be run at night. This has reduced number of goods trains from 12 to four at night in the section. If a train runs, the Maoists will either hurl bombs at it or open the Pandrol clips, she said.        
	The rise in petrol prices has led to an extra burden of Rs 450 crore on the railway. We would have to run trains smoothly and earn revenue without raising fares, said Mamata.        
	She also announced that several employees of South Eastern Railway had been suspended after the engine and two coaches of the Mumbai-bound Duronto Express got detached from the rest of the train near Uluberia station last Friday. We have taken action and an inquiry is on, said Mamata.        
	According to the minister, work for developing Majherhat into a terminal station would start soon. A multi-purpose complex, nursing training college and a medical college are slated to come up near the station.        
	Metro Railway, Calcutta, and Rail Vikash Nigam Ltd have started a survey for Metro routes from BBD Bag to Behala and Joka, she said.

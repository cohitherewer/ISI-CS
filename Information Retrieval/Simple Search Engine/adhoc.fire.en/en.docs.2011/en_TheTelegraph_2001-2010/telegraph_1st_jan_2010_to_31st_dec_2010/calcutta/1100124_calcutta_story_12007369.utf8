										      BRIEF LIVES                        A portrait of Catherine Grand				                           
	This week, Brief Lives travels nearly 250 years to bring you the life-story of Madame Grand, possibly the first beauty in Calcuttas recorded history. Of dubious and questionable memory, her life spanned three countries and two continents. From the obscurity of a town on the Coromandel Coast, she rose to become the second lady in the court of Napoleon Bonaparte.         
	Catherine Noel Werlee was born in the Danish colony of Tranquebar on 21 November 1762; her father Pierre Werlee was French and sometime harbour-master in Pondicherry, while her mother was Laurence Allamay, possibly a Danish subject. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Chandernagore, where Pierre Werlee was appointed Capitaine du Port by Monsieur Chevalier, the governor of Chandernagore.         
	Chevalier was known for throwing lavish parties at his country seat, Ghyretty House, and during the 1770s, these parties were regularly attended by governor-general Warren Hastings and his cronies.         
	One such hanger-on was a youngish man called George Francois Grand, who had first come to India in 1766 but was thwarted in his attempts to make a career. His second innings in 1776 proved to be more fruitful and he managed to obtain a writership in the office of Hastings.        
	To cut a long story short, George met Catherine at one of M. Chevaliers parties, the two fell in love and got married on July 10, 1777. Catherine was a few months short of 16 at that time, and by all accounts, considered one of the most exquisite beauties in and around Calcutta. The newly-weds took up residence in a garden-house near Alipore and seem to have had a happy first year of married life. But all this was to change on December 8, 1778.         
	Much later, in 1814, George would publish his own account of the events that were set in motion on that fateful night: On December 8, 1778, I went out of my house, about nine oclock, the happiest, as I thought myself, of men; and between eleven and twelve oclock returned the same night to it as miserable as any being could well feel.... Scarcely had I sat down to supper at my benefactor, Mr Barwells society... that I was suddenly struck by the deepest of anguish and pain. A servant, who was in the habit of attending Mrs Grand, came and whispered to me that Mr Francis was caught in my house, and secured by my jemadar.        
	On reaching his house, George found not Philip Francis but George Shee (later Sir George Shee) tied to a chair while Mr Shore (afterwards Lord Teignmouth) stood entreating the jemadar Rambux to release him. From Rambuxs account, it transpired that Francis had scaled the compound wall with the aid of a folding ladder, had broken into Catherines bedroom and had subsequently been apprehended and tied up by the domestic staff. However, his friends, who had been lurking outside rushed in, freed Francis and created a fracas in which Francis was able to make his escape. Rambux and his party, not to be outdone, took George Shee as prisoner.        
	This was the scene that greeted George Grand when he rushed back to his garden house in Alipore. The Mr Francis mentioned above was none other than Philip Francis, one of the members of the Bengal Council and sworn enemy of Warren Hastings, with whom he was later to fight a famous duel over the conduct of the Maratha campaign.         
	A very full account of this incident, as well as the subsequent lawsuit, can be found in H.E. Busteeds celebrated book, Echoes from Old Calcutta. George Grand sued Francis in the Supreme Court, and a bench consisting of Elijah Impey, Robert Chambers and Justice Hyde heard the case in February 1779. What emerged was an extraordinary account of midnight alarums, folding ladders, fisticuffs, close shaves and on the whole, thoroughly blackguardly behaviour by four high-ranking company officials. After a month-long hearing, the judges found for the plaintiff and Francis was fined to the tune of 50,000 sicca rupees.         
	In the meantime, Catherine had been effectively given marching orders by George Grand. Before she left, Catherine sought an interview with her husband. In the words of George: (I)t lasted three hours, interrupted with the most poignant lamentations. From her own lips I learnt an unvarnished relation of the base arts employed for the seduction of a stranger and (sic) attained only to her sixteenth year. I pitied her from my heart. I sincerely forgave her and with a sorrow approaching to distraction we parted.

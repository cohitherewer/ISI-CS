The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | More eyes for mobile tower vigil
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      More eyes for mobile tower vigil

	The West Bengal Pollution Control Board has asked all mobile service providers to obtain site clearance for transmission towers from the Union telecom ministry and annual structural stability certificates from engineering institutions recognised by the central or state government.         
	The directive, issued by member secretary Sandipan Mukherjee, also made it mandatory for mobile towers to be cleared by corporations, municipalities and panchayats.         
	We recently received a communiqu about central norms regarding site clearance and stability certification. So we have decided to include these in the state guidelines, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the pollution control board.        
	The original state guidelines, in force since 2008, bars installation of mobile towers above school buildings and hospitals. It also stipulates a minimum distance of three metres from residential buildings, though this is one rule that is violated the most.        
	Most complaints to the board are about illegal mobile towers. But there is confusion about who will take action against violators. The latest directive makes it clear that illegal towers can be demolished by the municipal authorities with the help of police, said Mukherjee.

										      VISHNU VARMA      YoungMetro                          Union minister Salman Khurshid with students of Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, on Tuesday. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)
                        
	It was a day to remember for the students of Delhi Public School (DPS), Ruby Park. Union minister of state for external and minority affairs Salman Khurshid visited the school campus on Tuesday to inaugurate the schools month-long vanmahotsav campaign.         
	The minister, a former student of DPS Noida, had inaugurated the school when it was set up seven years ago. On Tuesday, he planted a sapling as part of a tree-planting ceremony. Vanmahotsav is a month-long annual campaign organised by the school every year to spread awareness about the environment.        
	Addressing the students, Khurshid recalled his days at DPS Noida. Our school didnt have permanent structures. When it rained, water would gush into the room. So a rainy day would mean a holiday for us, he smiled.        
	The former president of the Delhi Public School Society also interacted with students on subjects like environment, religion and even the importance on investing money wisely.         
	Upon being asked how young people could contribute towards protecting the environment, he advised: Save electricity and water. Stop trees around your house from being cut down. Street theatre can also be a useful tool to raise awareness on the issue.         
	Religion divides people, how can we make India more secular, asked one.         
	Religion is personal and it should not influence our social interactions, replied the minister.        
	Students from Class VIII to XII also put up a dance performance on the Chipko movement and the effects of deforestation as part of the vanmahotsav initiative.

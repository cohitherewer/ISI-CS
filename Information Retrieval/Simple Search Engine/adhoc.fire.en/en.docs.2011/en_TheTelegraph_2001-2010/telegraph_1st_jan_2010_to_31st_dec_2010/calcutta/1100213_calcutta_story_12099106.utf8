          PRIYANKA ROY                                        
	If Shah Rukh Khan had chosen to be in Calcutta on Friday, he would have been one happy man. Passion and not protests greeted My Name Is Khan. Metro visited seven city cinemas swept by the SRK wave.              
	INOX Forum, 9.15am        
	SRK fans trooped in bright and early at the citys oldest plex. Show one out of 16 saw a mix of senior citizens and college kids. Once inside, GenX started clapping from the time the Kuch Kuch Hota Hai theme played. GenEx was more restrained but there was no missing the sniffles through Rizvan Khans journey.        
	INOX City Centre, 11.30am        
	The queue at the box counter office wasnt long but sentiments ran high in the audi screening the Karan Johar film. I am a huge SRK fan and there was no way I was going to miss the first day first show, gushed Sumit Shukla, a Sector V techie. If many had bunked office and college, there were some families too. The film has a great message and the performances are extraordinary, said homemaker Shuchi Jain.        
	Priya, 1pm        
	A face in the crowd was Avinash, an employee of a Sector V company who had bunked work for SRK not Citu. Once you see the movie you feel that Shiv Sena are the terrorists. I want to meet Shah Rukh and thank him.        
	Fame South City, 1.45pm                  
	Fearing trouble (a boycott threat over the KKR tie-up with Ashok Todis Lux Cozi), Fame had sought police protection, but all that one got to see were eager SRK fans. Even if I was in Mumbai, I would have watched My Name Is Khan on the first day, said Vineeta Sharma, a student.        
	Navina, 2.20pm        
	At the Prince Anwar Shah Road cinema, Shah Rukh and Kajol were barely visible under the marigold garlands. The fans beat drums, danced and garlanded MNIK posters, said manager Naveen Chokhani. A Bal Thackeray effigy was burnt.        
	Basusree, 2.45pm        
	A sea of heads, garlanded posters and the beat of drums greeted the film at the Hazra cinema. This kind of frenzy hasnt happened in a long time, said a Basusree official.        
	Paradise, 3.15pm        
	You are the best King Khan. Because your name is Shah Rukh Khan, screamed a poster. Flaunting SRK posters  some were even turned out like their hero, but in Gopal rather than Gucci  and dancing, they all came to the My Name Is Khan party.        
	Unlike Mumbai, Shah Rukh Khan fans in Calcutta will never allow his film screenings to be stopped, claimed Rukhsana Baig, two-year-old daughter Razia in tow.        
	Policemen watched from a distance. They would rather have been inside the hall.                    WITH INPUTS FROM OUR BUREAU

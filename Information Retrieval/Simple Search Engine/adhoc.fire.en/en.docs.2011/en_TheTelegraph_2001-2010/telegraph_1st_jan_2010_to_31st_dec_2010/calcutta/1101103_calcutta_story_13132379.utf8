	A fire department team on Tuesday recommended overhauling of the electrical wiring and installation of modern firefighting equipment in all laboratories of Presidency University to prevent a repeat of last Fridays blaze.        
	Two laboratories in the chemistry department of the university had been gutted in the blaze.        
	Jogesh Chattopadhyay, the director-general of the fire and emergency services department, led the team to the College Street campus to find out the cause of the fire and recommend safety measures.        
	The team wanted the electrical wiring to be overhauled and modern firefighting equipment installed in all laboratories. It also highlighted the need to draw up a list of highly inflammable substances in the labs and send copies to the fire department, said a university source. Apart from inspecting the gutted facilities, the team also visited the other labs before meeting vice-chancellor Amita Chatterjee.        
	The college will reopen on November 16. The team will give us its suggestions within a couple of days. We will implement them immediately, Chatterjee said.        
	A forensic team had on Monday visited the campus and collected some samples from the gutted labs and their adjacent areas. We will tally the analysis with our findings during the spot visit, said Dhurjyoti Sengupta, the director of the state forensic laboratory.

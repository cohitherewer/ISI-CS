                      Interplay of words and images                    On the occasion of the release of Roland Barthes Incidents, The Seagull Foundation for the Arts presents the ongoing show of photographs by Bishan Samaddar. The selection of photographs appear in Barthes book, but not specifically as an accompaniment to the text. They have their own personal rationality of being and make no effort to be particularly meaningful. Curated by Sunandini Banerjee from a diverse set of portfolios, they have been so designed that the text and the photographs appear to connect and converse with each other, opening up the book to startling new interpretations. The relationship between word and image plays out at various levels of difference in location, time and age. This show is, thus, an exhibition of a photobook, a celebration of how words and images can play with each other.            Event: An exhibition of photographs by Bishan Samaddar When: Till December 4 (except Sunday); 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C S. P. Mukherjee Road

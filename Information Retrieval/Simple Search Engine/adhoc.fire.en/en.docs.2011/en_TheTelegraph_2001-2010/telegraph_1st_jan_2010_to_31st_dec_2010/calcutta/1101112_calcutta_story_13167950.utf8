                      Going green for good living                    We first came to know about flower power way back in the 1970s, but here is an event that will make us realise its significance in the true sense of the term. These days, it is fashionable to have some flowers in your garden, or even some pretty flowers placed at focal points in your house. And in a city like ours, where highrises do not leave much space for nature, house plants become all the more important. They fulfil the needs of a healthier living environment and, at the same time, beautify the space around us. With this idea in mind, the Agri-Horticultural Society of India (AHSI) is hosting its annual House Plants Expo, which focuses on beautifying interiors with house plants. House plants not only brighten up a room with colour and energy, they are pleasing to the eye and have several health benefits. Decorating the house with house plants can purify the air in and around it. Such plants can also make one feel calmer and more optimistic about life, and can do wonders for the morale. This years exposition showcases a great many varieties that, besides being aesthetically beautiful, also have a number of beneficial properties.                  Event: Annual house plants expo hosted by Agri-Horticultural Society of India When: Till November 14; 7 am - 7 pm Where: Agri-Horticultural Society of India, main lawn and H.B.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Citu strikes at supply line
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Citu strikes at supply line
  - Day of disruption with strategic stops        OUR BUREAU                       A closed ATM on Ganesh Chandra Avenue, in central Calcutta, on Friday evening.   (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                
	 Two US citizens, representing a global tech giant, huffed and puffed up a dingy staircase to reach the eighth floor of Bikash Bhavan.        
	 A young professional had to borrow money from his friends as he found all ATMs of a private bank, from Gol Park to Russell Street, shut.        
	 Food and water supplies to a Salt Lake tech firm were affected forcing the employees to go out and buy food.        
	As Citu, CPMs labour arm, flexed its muscles across the city, people from several walks of life bore the brunt of disruptive politics and different sectors, from tech companies to tanneries, suffered losses because of the impact on work flow.         
	The lifts were not working at the 10-storeyed Bikash Bhavan in Salt Lake, which houses all the education departments, as the Citu supporters had put the lifts under lock-and-key.        
	In several parts of the city, Citu supporters had forcibly downed ATM shutters creating an artificial cash crunch for people in need of money.        
	Our staff of 100 employees remained without tea and snacks because the support staff of the canteen were not allowed to enter the building, said an official of Sapoorji Pallonji, which has an office in Infinity Benchmark of Sector V in Salt Lake.        
	Even as Citu leaders claimed that the strike to demand a better deal for over 25 lakh contractual workers in the state was spontaneous and successful, reports of shutdown supporters forcing people to join them poured in from across the city.         
	A member of Calcutta Leather Complex Tanners Association told Metro that Citu supporters had closed all the three entry gates to the facility from 6am on Friday and didnt even allow permanent workers to report to work.        
	They also shut down the effluent treatment plant, which comes under essential services, said the trader.         
	As support staff involved in various functions  like guarding ATMs, operating lifts, serving food and water and maintaining electricity  stayed away in several offices, it was no longer business as usual.        
	I cant understand why they had to lock the automatic lifts We could have operated them, said a 55-year-old woman, who took around 15 minutes to climb up the staircase to reach her seventh-floor office in Bikash Bhavan.        
	The perpetrators of inconvenience didnt distinguish between the public and private sectors. A group claiming to represent Citu had on September 10 stormed the Metropolis Mall at Hiland Park and defaced private property with posters urging workers to join the strike. Five posters were pasted on a glass door and walls in the mall. Our repeated pleas to remove the posters fell on deaf years, said Indranil Srimani, the operations head (east) of Hiland Park.        
	The mall authorities approached East Jadavpur police station but the officers allegedly refused to lodge a general diary. S.K. Chaudhary, the additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas, however, said East Jadavpur police station had registered a police complaint. I have asked my officers to submit a detailed report.        
	On Friday, several employees of a leading tech companies  sunrise sector, according to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee  found it difficult to enter their offices as Citu supporters squatted at the entrance.        
	Barely a few hundred metres away, Debanjan Chakraborty, a state secretariat member of Citu, was crowing about a successful strike. People joined us voluntarily, said Chakraborty.        
	What about yet another workday taking a hit in beleaguered Bengal? The Citu leadership just shrugged.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shut order for factory at Ray home
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Shut order for factory at Ray home
          JAYANTA BASU                             The cardboard factory at 100A Garpar Road; (below) the facade of the building. (Amit Datta)	                                
	An illegal factory sharing space with a school at a north Calcutta heritage address where Satyajit Ray once lived has been asked to shut down.        
	The management of the cardboard manufacturing unit (Jainind), which operated from the ground floor of a heritage building, has failed to submit any statutory licence. So, we have no hesitation to close it down with immediate effect, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the state pollution control board.        
	The officer-in-charge of Narkeldanga police station has been asked to ensure that the factory shifts all materials from 100A Garpar Road within 15 days, failing which the power supply would be snapped.        
	The closure order was issued last Saturday following a hearing at the boards Salt Lake headquarters, which was attended by the factory management, residents of the neighbourhood and the headmaster of Atheneum Institution, the school which owns the three-storeyed building and functions out of the top two floors and a part of the ground floor.  
	The hearing was held on a petition by the residents who complained that the noise emitted by the factory was affecting the ambience of the school where most of their children study. They also claimed that the factory  which employs 11 people and runs from 9am to 6pm  was creating pollution that was affecting the stability of the building.        
	Arunendu Banerjee, an architect who specialises in heritage building conservation echoed the residents concern.         
	The noise and vibration generated by the machines affect the load-bearing structure and sub-structures of the building. The emission, too, eats into the lime-surki mortar. Such buildings are predominantly built on karis and bargas and even if one of them gives away, the entire structure will be in danger, he said.         
	Sabitadeb Banerjee, a complainant and former student of Atheneum Institution, said: We have finally received justice after knocking on the doors of the chief ministers office, civic body, fire department and the pollution control board for several years.        
	Monoranjan Swar, the headmaster of the school, said that at times the noise, stench and emission from the factory became so overpowering that the teachers and the students had to rush out. We had repeatedly asked the factory owners to relocate but they turned down our pleas, he said.        
	The Jainind owners refused to say whether the factory was running without licences. I have no comments to offer, said Pawan Surana, one of the owners.        
	The building was constructed in 1914 by Satyajit Rays grandfather Upendrakishore Raychowdhury. Ray was born and spent his early childhood in the building. Author Lila Mazumdar, too, lived there.        
	A financial crisis following Sukumar Rays death prompted the family to sell the building to Baidya Nath Mallick in the 1920s. The school moved in as tenant in 1931.         
	The school bought the building from Mallicks descendants in 2007.

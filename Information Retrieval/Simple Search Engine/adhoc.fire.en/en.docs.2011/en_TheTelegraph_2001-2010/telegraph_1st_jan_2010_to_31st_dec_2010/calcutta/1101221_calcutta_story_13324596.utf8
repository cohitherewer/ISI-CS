The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ansari calls for varsity funds
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Ansari calls for varsity funds
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Vice-President Hamid Ansari at the Calcutta University programme                                  
	Higher education in India can improve only when cash-starved state universities get enough funds, Vice-President Hamid Ansari said on Monday.        
	Anecdotal evidence suggests that the budget of one central university is same or more than the budget of all state universities in some states, Ansari said while delivering the foundation day lecture at Calcutta University, one of the state varsities.        
	Ansari had graduated from St Xaviers College, which was then under Calcutta University.        
	State universities, he stressed, enrol the bulk of the students pursuing higher education and badly need to upgrade the infrastructure.        
	He appreciated the Centres move to bring every child within the elementary education system through Sarva Siksha Abhiyan but stressed the Centre should also vastly enhance its support to state universities as a shared national enterprise.        
	He called for the upgrade of the college education system across the country. Sadly, undergraduate education does not get the attention it deserves amidst of paucity of funds..., he regretted.        
	The Vice-President felt more avenues must be created for vocational education. We need to ensure that entering a university does not become a default choice of students for the sake of employment, particularly for those who might not have any interest in the subject or desire for higher education.        
	Addressing the gathering, governor M.K. Narayanan said Calcutta University should perform better to retain its glory.        
	The university is not what it used to be 100 years ago, said Narayanan, who is also chancellor of CU. It had served as a benchmark of education in the whole country. I am sure the university will redeem its spirit.         
	State higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri was present on the occasion.

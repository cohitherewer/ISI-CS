                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Next weekend you can be at ... Tajpur
                                          
	This hamlet in East Midnapore offers a beach of your own to escape city life. Laze around on the silver sand watching the sunrise or listening to the sound of crickets under the starry sky.         
	Mouth-watering snacks and fried fish served by the resorts are other attractions.        
	Tajpur is a sparsely populated fishing hub on the coast of the Bay of Bengal, 180km from Calcutta. The beach is lined with casuarina trees. Flying cranes and birds you dont know by name give you company as you feel the warmth of the sun and the coolness of the sea breeze on your face.        
	During low tide, the sea retreats nearly 2km leaving behind colourful shells and stones that are a collectors delight on the muddy white sand.        
	It is safe to take a dip in the sea. Just be careful about the stone chips that remain embedded in the sand.         
	Even if you are not game for a swim, you will not be bored. Just sitting on the shore alone or with your loved one is very pleasant.        
	Walk to a lagoon on the beach. It looks like a painting against the backdrop of the sea.        
	Those who are adventurous can ride a boat to Mandarmani.         
	Red crabs abound on the beach. From a distance, it seems as if a red carpet has been spread across the sand. The crabs disappear into their holes as soon as you get close.        
	Going        
	Tajpur is near Contai, a town in East Midnapore. You can take an early morning express train from Howrah. The journey takes around two hours. Resorts arrange pick-up from the station. More transport options are available from the bus stand. Tajpur is 5km from Chawlkhola crossing        
	Staying        
	There are two private resorts. Swapanpuri (9932696841) and Tajpur Retreat (9830705512/ 9830271064). There is a nature camp near the lagoon. Stay away from the sea at night                    (METRO ON SUNDAY THANKS READER SOMEN SENGUPTA FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION.

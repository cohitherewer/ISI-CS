The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Make-up tips from Mumbai   Rs 750cr vs zero planning
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Make-up tips from Mumbai     Rs 750cr vs zero planning
          SANJAY MANDAL                            Both Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport may be in the throes of transition, but pictures tell a different story. The money set aside from the modernisation budget has given Mumbai airport rsquo;s old facilities (top) a new look while passenger comfort and cleanliness at the city airport (below) have taken the backseat in the name of work in progress.

	If men at work make Calcutta airport look dishevelled, foresight and financial planning help Mumbai airport maintain its sparkling appearance despite being a similar work in progress.         
	Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL), the consortium engaged in modernising the countrys busiest airport, had incorporated a Rs 750-crore interim plan into its Rs 9,800-crore budget to refurbish the existing facilities even as it started work on a new, integrated terminal.        
	The idea was to ensure that fliers werent inconvenienced and the existing facilities were maintained well while we worked on modernising the airport by 2013, a spokesperson for MIAL told Metro.        
	So what stopped the Calcutta planners from drawing up a similar interim plan as part of the larger Rs 2,300-crore modernisation project?         
	The Airports Authority of India is a very old organisation unlike MIAL. For us, airport upgrade is a continuous process for which we allot funds at regular intervals. So we didnt feel the need to earmark a fraction of the modernisation budget for refurbishing the existing terminals, a senior official said over the phone from Delhi,         
	On paper, around Rs 60 crore has been spent over the past couple of years on adding facilities that have made very little difference to passenger convenience. Metros comparison of the upgrades at Calcutta and Mumbai airports tells the story of MIALs efficiency and AAIs institutionalised inefficiency.        
	MUMBAI        
	Terminals: The Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport has two domestic terminals at Santacruz, 1A and 1B. MIAL built a new domestic arrival terminal at 1B and opened it to the public in October 2007, enabling the airport management to shift 65 per cent of the daily domestic arrivals from 1A.         
	Air India, Kingfisher Airlines and Kingfisher Red now operate out of terminal 1A, while SpiceJet, Indigo, JetLite, GoAir and Jet Airways run their services from 1B.        
	Last April, MIAL unveiled a new domestic terminal, 1C, at Santacruz to connect 1A and 1B. Spread across 2,97,194sq ft across three levels, terminal 1C has increased the passenger handling capacity of the domestic terminals while enhancing passenger comfort and convenience. The terminal, equipped with six aerobridges, offers seamless connectivity between 1A and 1B.        
	Facilities and frills: Additional check-in counters have been set up, taking total to 34. Wi-fi facilities have also been introduced, enabling flier to access the Net from anywhere in the three terminals. Several new duty-free outlets, food courts, foot reflexology and beauty parlours and fast food kiosks have added to passenger convenience. There is a hotline booth for fleet cars, hotel booking counters and car rental services.        
	Seating arrangements have been increased for fliers checking in at 1A and 1B. Terminal IA has 228 seats in the check-in area while IB has 140. After security check, passengers in terminal IA have 1,160 seats to choose from. Terminal 1B has 997 seats along with 24 slumber beds. Terminal 1C has 900 seats in the boarding arena.        
	The arrival area of the domestic terminal has also been upgraded with food kiosks, restaurants, toilets and other facilities for visitors.                                 
	CALCUTTA AIRPORT         
	Terminals: Traffic has galloped but the airport still makes do with one congested terminal each for domestic and international departures and arrivals. The only significant change carried out by the authorities so far is shifting the glazed glass faade by 800 square metres to create some extra space within the domestic terminal for airline and other counters.        
	Facilities and frills: The in-line baggage X-ray system has been kept mothballed because the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security hasnt cleared it yet. The unofficial explanation for the delay is that the personnel chosen to handle the system are yet to be fully trained.        
	Car lanes demarcated by concrete kerb dividers have come up in front of the domestic terminal, but poor traffic management has added to the congestion rather than solve the traffic chaos.         
	Mechanised mopping has been introduced but, alas, nobody has designed a machine yet that can make lazy people work. The result? An unkempt terminal building peppered with dirty, smelly toilets.        
	Shortage of security-check counters often triggers long queues. As of now, there are only five at the domestic terminal.        
	Seating arrangements in the security hold are woefully inadequate with around 900 seats distributed across two floors. The number of seats in the pre-check-in lounge has been reduced to 300.              
	MONEY MATTER        
	If eight per cent of the modernisation budget  it works out to Rs 184 crore  had been reserved for interim planning like in Mumbai, the city airport would have been a different experience for fliers.        
	The arrival area could have been refurbished with a cafeteria and toilets outside the terminal. If the canopies were extended further and seating arrangements made, then visitors would not have to enter the terminal and add to passenger congestion.         
	More trolleys could have been purchased, saving passengers the hassle of frantically looking for one after getting off their vehicles with luggage.         
	The in-line baggage X-ray system could have been introduced earlier, doing away with the obsolete system of scanning registered baggage at separate X-ray counters that take up a lot of space and add to check-in time.        
	More retail outlets could have been set up inside the terminals.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The hearing of petitions by two organisations challenging the handover of a 62-cottah plot in Salt Lake to Sourav Ganguly concluded in the high court on Friday.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice M.S. Shah and Justice P.C. Ghosh asked the parties concerned, including the state government and Sourav, to make written submissions by February 15. The bench will deliver its verdict after that.        
	Souravs counsel told the bench that the government had handed over the plot to the Ganguly Education and Welfare Society so that the former Indian skipper could open a school.         
	According to the lawyer, the fees of the proposed school would be Rs 1,000 per month and students would be given mid-day meals. Souravs wife is a very good dancer and she will teach students dance. Sourav and other players of his standard will train students in cricket, the lawyer told the judges.         
	Counsel for the petitioner questioned how a general plot could be handed over to an individual for a commercial project.

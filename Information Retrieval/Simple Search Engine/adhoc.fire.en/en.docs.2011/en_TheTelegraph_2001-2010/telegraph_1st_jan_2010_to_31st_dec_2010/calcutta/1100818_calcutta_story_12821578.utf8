                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Teacher held after boy suicide bid
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A teacher of St Helens School in Kalighat was arrested on Tuesday after a Class XII student tried to commit suicide in school on Monday accusing her of mental torture.         
	Nabanita Nag, a Hindi teacher, was granted bail later in the day.         
	Police said Mohammad Sajjir Khan was found in a semi-conscious state in a bathroom by a teacher.         
	Someone from the school called around 3.30pm to say that my son was ill. I went to school and brought him to our home in Ekbalpore, said the boys mother Samsad Khan. Sajjir told his mother that he had taken four sleeping pills. She rushed him to CMRI Hospital, where his stomach was washed and he was allowed to go home.         
	Sajjirs parents found a note in his school diary accusing Nag of humiliating and mentally torturing him. My son would go to school one day and then stay back home for three days. I did not know what was wrong, said Samsad.        
	According to her, Nag used to regularly pull up Sajjir in class and insult him before the girls, which Sajjir found humiliating. Sajjirs parents lodged a complaint against the teacher with Kalighat police station on Monday. She was arrested on Tuesday morning and later granted bail.        
	We dont want to take legal action against the school as the teachers are generally kind. But if the school does not remove the accused teacher, we may be forced to take steps, said Mohammad Nasir Khan, Sajjirs father and a contractor at Calcutta port.        
	The Khans have also accused the school of negligence, as Sajjir was not immediately shifted to a hospital after he took ill. The principal was unavailable for comment but the school authorities said they were looking into the matter.        
	We are very concerned that rules werent followed. We have a rule that if any student falls ill he or she should be taken to hospital, said Tapas Das, the secretary to the managing committee of the school.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Triple hurdle for traffic
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Triple hurdle for traffic
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Rupanjan Bhattacharyya took over an hour on Monday afternoon to drive from Girish Park to Esplanade, a stretch he usually covers in less than 20 minutes even on a busy weekday.        
	The 35-year-old businessman watched helplessly as he saw passengers get off stranded buses and taxis to take the Metro. It was madness, said Bhattacharyya, who missed a vital appointment as the traffic either came to a standstill or moved at a snails pace for the better part of the day.        
	Traffic officers blamed the road chaos on three factors  waterlogging in the heart of the city, traffic-stopper rallies and traffic signals going on the blink.        
	As many as 14 traffic signals at key crossings  such as the MG Road-College Street and near Bridge No. 4  were out of action.        
	Four political outfits  the Trinamul Congress, SUCI, Citu and the Bandi Mukti Bahini  had their road-choker programmes lined up in and around Esplanade in the afternoon. As their supporters started approaching the venues from noon, traffic came to a halt in the central business district, with the ripple effect spreading to the adjoining areas.        
	Over 5,000 SUCI supporters gathered at the crossing of JL Nehru Road and SN Banerjee Road and started demonstrating under the banner of the All Bengal Electricity Consumers Association. The protesters were allotted Metro channel but they chose the busy intersection as their venue, said an officer in the traffic police department.        
	The police moved in around 3.30pm after the protesters refused to vacate the crossing, resulting in a clash that left three cops injured.        
	Both north and south-bound traffic through Esplanade came to a halt at this stage. With Anganwadi Workers holding a protest under the Citu banner on Rani Rashmoni Avenue, SN Banerjee Road, too, got choked.        
	A section of CESC contract labourers, backed by Trinamul, held a meeting outside Victoria House, resulting in vehicles getting stranded on Central Avenue till the BB Ganguly Street crossing between 3 and 4pm, said an officer.        
	A rally by the Bandi Mukti Bahini at the base of Lenins statue at the KC Das crossing added to the commuter chaos.        
	Traffic cops said the situation could have been better had the traffic signals not stopped functioning. Traffic management on a wet day calls for an effective mix of manual and automatic operation of signals. As so many signals went out of order, there was too much of manual operation, resulting in traffic chaos, said an officer.

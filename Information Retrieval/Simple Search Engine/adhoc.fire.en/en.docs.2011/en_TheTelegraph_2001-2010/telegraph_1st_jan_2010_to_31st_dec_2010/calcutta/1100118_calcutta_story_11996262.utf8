The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Day of shiver at minus 10
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Day of shiver at minus 10
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sunday was one of coldest days the city has ever seen though the minimum temperature was only a degree below normal.         
	The clue to the unusually cold day lay in the maximum temperature reading, which at 17.2 degrees Celsius was 10 notches below normal. The minimum temperature was 13.2 degrees Celsius.         
	Between 2.30am and 2.30pm on Sunday, the temperature rose by just four degrees. The dip in the maximum temperature is the first weather anomaly in the new year.        
	Its difficult to say when the maximum temperature in winter dipped more than five degrees below normal, said O.P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of a private Met agency.        
	By definition, a cold day occurs when the maximum temperature drops five or more degrees below normal.         
	The dramatic dip of the mercury is because Calcutta is caught between two cyclonic circulations. The sudden cold is because of two cyclonic circulations  one over the Bangladesh-Bengal coastline and the other over Bihar and adjoining north Bengal, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the Alipore Met office.        
	Monday and Tuesday are likely to stay as cold. The conditions would prevail at least till late afternoon on Tuesday, said Debnath.        
	Active western disturbances and stronger flow of northerlies and northwesterlies are also adding to the cold by cranking up the wind chill factor. Wind chill is the apparent temperature felt because of a cold breeze.        
	For instance, when the temperature is 12 degrees Celsius and the wind speed is 10 knots, one feels as cold as when the mercury reads 10 degrees. The wind is making Calcuttans feel even colder, explained Sharma.

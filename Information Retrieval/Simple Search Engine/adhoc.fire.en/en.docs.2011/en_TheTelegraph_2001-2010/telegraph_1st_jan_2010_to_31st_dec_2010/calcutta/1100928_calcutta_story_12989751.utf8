The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Train stuck on tracks slows down Metro
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Train stuck on tracks slows down Metro
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	A snag on the tracks disrupted Metro Railway services for over an hour on Monday afternoon with the ripple effect continuing till evening.        
	Officials said a fault was detected at the crossover point of New Garia station around 1.54pm when the driver of an empty rake was trying to change tracks.        
	The train got stuck on the Down (south-bound) line till our technicians repaired the snag at 2.58pm, said a Metro official.        
	For the entire duration the train was stuck, the authorities suspended services between Tollygunge (Mahanayak Uttam Kumar) and Gariabazar (Kavi Nazrul).        
	Its among the teething problems we are facing. We had run a check on the extended route till Briji last month.... but the trains have been running on the new tracks for hardly two weeks, said a Metro spokesperson.        
	There was no reason to panic as the fault was minor. Once it was repaired, trains were changing tracks without any problem.        
	Earlier, empty rakes used to change tracks at Briji (Sahid Khudiram) before starting their north-bound journey. But since September 12, they have been running the full stretch till New Garia.        
	Passengers waiting for trains on the extended route alleged that the authorities kept them in the dark.        
	We were not told about the snag when we bought tickets. There was no announcement even when we were waiting for trains on the platform. Many passengers left the station in disgust, said Rangan Bose, an insurance agent who waited 40 minutes at Gitanjali station (Naktala) for a train to arrive.        
	Commuters on the entire route alleged the services were irregular till the evening.        
	The services had improved over the past two weeks but today I had to wait for over 20 minutes for a train, said Sujit Chatterjee, who managed to board an overcrowded train at Rabindra Sarobar around 4.10pm.        
	Baguiati resident Kalyan Ghosh arrived at Dum Dum station at 3.48pm, after a Kavi Nazrul-bound train had just left.        
	The next train was scheduled for 3.56pm but it did not arrive. The electronic display board went on the blink and there was no announcement either. When a train finally arrived at 4.07pm, it became overcrowded. Commuters at subsequent stations could not board the train, recalled Ghosh, who had to fight his way through the crowd to get off at Chandni Chowk.        
	Metro officials blamed the inconvenience on the slow running of trains between Briji and New Garia for safety reasons.        
	Dilip Mukherjee of Metro Railway Mens Union said the situation could have been salvaged had the authorities not discarded the earlier crossover point at Briji.

  - Protest over security measures on campus, VC stands ground          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A move by the Jadavpur University authorities to install closed-circuit television cameras and make identity cards mandatory on campus sparked student protests that continued till late on Wednesday.        
	Students from all three faculties  engineering, science and arts  gheraoed members of the executive council, including the vice chancellor, pro-vice chancellor and registrar, demanding immediate revocation of the security measures.        
	The students are mainly opposed to the move of installing CCTVs on campus, seeing it as an invasion of privacy. The decision has been taken with an intention to stop student movements, alleged Sattwick Barman, a representative of the Forum for Arts Students (FAS).        
	We have been told that the authorities will spend Rs 16 lakh on installing CCTVs and implementing the other security measures. The university lacks basics such as drinking water, medical treatment and internet facilities for students. The authorities should improve those basic facilities before spending lakhs to keep an eye on students, said a leader of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union.        
	A comprehensive plan prepared by the varsity in consultation with the police to intensify security on the three JU campuses  the 52-acre main campus, and the ones at Salt Lake and National Instruments  and also hostels was placed at the meeting of the executive council on Wednesday for its approval.        
	The authorities had decided to draw up the security plan after an outsider had attacked an electronics engineering student in her department a year ago. On Tuesday, the body of an outsider was recovered from a pond on campus.        
	CCTV apart, the plan includes making ID cards on campus mandatory for students, teachers, employees and officials, monitoring visitor entry, restricting entry of vehicles and more.        
	The students alleged that the authorities had not sought their opinion before finalising the plan. They also protested the mandatory use of ID cards on campus.        
	Vice-chancellor Pradip Narayan Ghosh said that council members were unanimous on remaining firm on installing CCTVs on campus.        
	We will not accept the students demand. We are determined to implement all the safety measures, including the installation of CCTVs, said Ghosh.

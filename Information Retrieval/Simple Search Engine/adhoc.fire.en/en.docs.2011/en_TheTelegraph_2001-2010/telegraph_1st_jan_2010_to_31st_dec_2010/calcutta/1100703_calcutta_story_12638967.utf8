          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court division bench on Friday asked the CMDA not to reserve flats on the basis of religion and amend a notification in which it had proposed to do so.        
	The government agency had declared in the March 10 notification that 26 per cent of the 300 flats it was building at Patuli would be reserved for minority communities like Muslims, Christians and Parsis etc.        
	This was the CMDAs first attempt to reserve flats on the basis of religion.        
	The bench of Chief Justice J.N. Patel and Justice B. Bhattacharya on Friday held that the CMDA could reserve flats on the basis of economic status but not religion and directed it to amend the notification.        
	Two PILs were filed last week challenging the notification. The CMDA had stopped allotment of the flats soon after. The division bench heard both the PILs on Friday.         
	Appearing for petitioner Amal Chandra Das, advocate Kaushik Chanda said: The CMDA does not have the legal right to issue such a notification. In a secular country like India, reservations cannot be made on the basis of religion.        
	Appearing for the CMDA, advocate P.S. Bose told the bench that the agency had decided to change the notification and reserve 26 per cent of the flats for socially and economically weaker sections among Muslims, Christians and Parsis etc.        
	The judges said the CMDA would have to amend the notification without mentioning any religion.        
	CMDA chairman Asok Bhattacharya said: I have not received the court order. We will abide by it.        
	Advocate Sardar Amjad Ali said: Karnataka High Court had recently passed a similar order that was challenged in the Supreme Court. The apex court has not issued an interim stay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The man who weaves shadow magic with hand
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      The man who weaves shadow magic with hand
          ARKA DAS                          Bablu Mallick shows his art at his Gariahat home. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                  
	Moulin Rouge, Paris, circa 1982. Forty can-can performers, a bevy of statuesque model-dancers dressed in nothing but lipstick, figure-skating artistes, acrobats, live dolphins and horses as part of an extravagant act choreographed to a tee with live music.        
	Witnessed by 2,500 spellbound spectators twice a night, seven days a week. The closing act, which always earned a standing ovation? Lasting barely a few minutes, its an awe-inspiring show of hands by a dark, lean, smiling man with a French-cut beard.        
	Bablu Mallick weaves his magic through bare hands, creating everything from animals to birds to caricatures of famous personalities like Ronald Reagan, Henry Kissinger, Stalin, even Indira Gandhi.        
	Sounds like a dream? Pradip Bablu Basu Mallick  who used only his nickname for the legendary Parisian stage  lived every bit of that dream, wowing audiences worldwide with his intricate art of shadow puppetry. Till date, the 71-year-old remains the only Indian to be part of the high-profile roster of artistes at the Moulin Rouge and The Hilton, Las Vegas.        
	Mallick, whose grandfather was the famous Yoga exponent Bishnucharan Ghosh, was an active fitness practitioner at his neighbourhood akhra. Art, too, was in his blood: right from his childhood, he was fascinated by Kathakali practitioners in the family and their mudras. I used to practise the effects of these mudras as shadows on the wall and played with these forms from an young age, says Mallick, after a short, strenuous but awe-inspiring performance for Metro at his Gariahat Road apartment.        
	In 1959, at the age of 20, Mallick undertook a 13-day voyage to Genoa, Italy, and then to Dortmund in Germany. Working at a factory for six months, Mallick switched to Hamburg, Germany, starting life as an apprentice shipbuilder at a rivetters factory.        
	I never really enjoyed factory life. I promptly bought an accordion and learnt to play by ear. Soon after, hearing my music, a German lady gave me the contacts to enroll in a music academy at Krozingen, he recalls. Along with his music studies, he kept practising his shadow puppetry skills.        
	It was at a workshop organised by the academy that Mallick, out of a lark, performed a short shadowgraphy skit. I did a few animals, and also Kennedy and Charles de Gaulle. The response was overwhelming.        
	This was the beginning of a new phase in Mallicks life: he was advised to apply for a TV show looking for new talent in the German town of Baden-Baden. He was called over for an audition, landing up without any lights, costume or music to accompany his act. Mallick sailed through it. Within two weeks, he was sent a contract from the TV station. He performed his first shadowgraphy show for TV at age 24 at Baden-Baden.        
	The next step was to broaden the scope of his show. The Bengali association at Stuttgart  named Bharat Majlish  organised a programme where artistes from 63 countries participated. Mallick was the only Indian performer. He received a standing ovation and also officially acquired his stage name, Bablu Mallick.        
	Things rolled smoothly after this: Mallick bought his first car, a second-hand Volkswagen and drove to Basel, Switzerland, for shows. I practised harder and focussed on my stage act and presentation. On moving to Geneva, he was contacted by Madame Bajou, a Paris-based impresario. His contract to work in Paris was almost immediately furnished.        
	Mallick left Germany for the scintillating stage life of Paris in 1972, working seven nights a week at the Millionaire Club.        
	While Moulin Rouge is always a dream venue to perform for every artiste, entry into its hallowed stage is never easy. Luck a card in Mallicks favour in the late 70s when he was called to replace another artiste within a short period.        
	I had no time for rehearsals with musicians. I still didnt speak French, and the stage manager didnt know English or German. Fortunately, his dancer girlfriend was English, and she sorted out the issue, says Mallick.        
	With a 20-day contract staring him in the face, Mallick got a taste of the Rouges gruelling routine, performing as many as four times a night on certain nights. He never looked back: the period over, he was offered a yearly contract. An apartment at Paris and a Mercedes soon followed.         
	My stint at Moulin Rouge lasted for a decade, and it was like a dream, recalls Mallick. His art was praised and brushing shoulders with celebrities became common, including Hollywood superstar Dustin Hoffman, soccer legends Franz Beckenbauer (who landed up with the entire German World Cup squad in 1978) and Michel Platini and Gene Kelly.        
	As part of the Moulin Rouge troupe, Mallick travelled and performed in all of Europe, Alaska, Korea and Japan, along with a few stints in the US. In between, he also managed time to come over to India and get married.         
	Mallick returned to India in 1994, settling in Pondicherry first and then returning to Calcutta. He continued touring, though: his last tour was of Germany in 2004, till he was affected with the debilitating arthritis.         
	Painkillers only subside the physical pain; but whats the medicine for the pain I feel in my heart for not being able to perform in front of an audience? he asks.

                Golam Ambia Sheikh, his son Bapi Sheikh, brother Sheikh Jahangir and Abul Hussain Bora were arrested in Tiljala on Tuesday in connection with a fake arms licence racket. The four work as guards in an agency and were deployed in BSNL offices. Fake arms licences, seven firearms and 19 rounds of ammunition were found on them. Police suspect that they used to procure fake licences from Bihar and Nagaland.																																																								  Mugging attempt: An unidentified youth tried to snatch away a bag containing Rs 60,000 from 55-year-old Jagachha resident Barun Kundu outside the NSC Bose Road branch of a nationalised bank on Tuesday morning. Kundu, who was on a bicycle, fell down but did not let go of the bag. The youth took out a gun and pointed it at him but could not take the bag as many pedestrians rushed to the spot seeing the two jostling. Kundu lodged a complaint with Howrah police station.   Boy rescued: A boy, around 3 years old, was rescued from a pond in New Town after residents saw him struggling to stay afloat. The boy could not say his name, his parents names or their address.																																																								  Run over: Palani Sau, 50, was run over by a car on the EM Bypass on Tuesday morning. She was taken to NRS hospital, where she was declared dead. The driver was also injured after the car hit a tree while trying to save a motorcyclist.																																																								  Power cut: A large part of Calcutta, including Lake Town, Kankurgachhi, Phoolbagan, Chandni Chowk, Camac Street and Elgin Road, went without power for nearly half an hour on Tuesday evening. A CESC official said the blackout was caused by a temporary glitch in a 250MW unit at its Budge Budge generating station.																																																								  PCB chairman: Prabuddha Nath Roy, a member of the state planning board, would become the next chairman of the pollution control board, said an official. The appellate authority of the board has been reconstituted.

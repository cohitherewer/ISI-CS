The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teacher held for cop assault
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Teacher held for cop assault
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 32-year-old schoolteacher was arrested for manhandling a traffic sergeant who had intercepted him for violating a stop line at Chiria More on Thursday evening.        
	Sushanta Halder, who teaches in a Dankuni school, was near the Dum Dum Road-BT Road intersection, riding north on his motorcycle, when the signal turned red around 5.55pm.        
	All the other vehicles on the flank stopped but Halder, a resident of Konnagar, rode on and tried to weave through the pedestrians and vehicles moving from east to west.         
	When some pedestrians asked the teacher to move back with his motorcycle, he refused, prompting the sergeant to intervene, said witnesses.         
	I directed him to move back but he refused. I pointed out that he was violating traffic rules, at which he became furious and started abusing me and my colleagues, said Joy Mukherjee, the sergeant.        
	I asked Halder to park the motorcycle and hand me his licence but he continued abusing me and the police force, added the cop.         
	According to pedestrians, the teacher refused to produce his driving licence, daring the officer to do whatever he wanted to. He reportedly told the sergeant that he was in no mood to listen to anyone after travelling 60 kilometres, least of all the police, since he knew how they worked.        
	After a heated exchange, Halder first pushed Mukherjee and then tried to slap him. The sergeant pulled out the ignition key of the motorcycle and asked a constable to keep an eye on the teacher. He then rushed to Cossipore police station, a few metres away.        
	Based on a written complaint by the sergeant, we sent personnel and brought the teacher to the police station. We tried to reason with him but to no avail, said an officer of the police station.        
	The worst part is that he continued arguing and even attempted to assault one of our officers. We had no option but to lodge a case against Mukherjee for trying to deter a public servant from discharging his duty, under Section 353 of the IPC.          
	On Friday, Halder was produced in a city court and granted bail till December 3.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A young woman locked up in a highrise apartment by her prospective employer for turning down an allegedly indecent proposal was rescued on Friday morning after she found a landline phone and dialled 100 for help.        
	The call to the Lalbazar control room brought a police team to Avishikta apartments, off Ruby General Hospital on the EM Bypass, where the 23-year-old woman was found huddled in a room of the fifth-floor flat in a state of shock.        
	Her alleged tormentor, 30-year-old rice mill and school owner Sudipta Nath, was arrested later in the day after the police used a couple of his friends to call him over for a chat at an unspecified location.         
	He has been charged with molestation, attempted rape and illegal confinement.         
	According to the victim, who is from Behrampore in Murshidabad, Sudipta had lured her to Calcutta on Thursday by promising to help her get a job in a good city school.         
	Once they reached the city, the accused took her to his flat and made sexual advances. He later tried to rape her, said an officer at Kasba police station, where the woman lodged a complaint.         
	The victim told the police that she knew Sudipta, who is also based in Behrampore, well enough to accompany him to the city but had no idea that he was planning to take advantage of her desperate need for a job.        
	Although she claimed to have screamed each time her alleged tormentor tried to rape her, nobody in the apartment block apparently heard her. Sudipta would visit his flat occasionally; so his neighbours didnt even know he was around, said an investigator.        
	The woman got her first chance to seek help around 9.30am on Friday, when Sudipta left the flat after locking the main door from outside but leaving the landline connection active. As she thought about whom to dial for help, the victim remembered seeing the number 100 in an advertisement for police helplines and promptly dialled it, said S.K. Chaudhuri, the additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas.        
	Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), said Lalbazar passed on the information to Kasba police station, which sent a team to Avishikta based on the landline number from where the call came.         
	She could only tell us that she was locked up in a room. She hung up before giving us the detailed address, he added.        
	The police team rescued the woman after breaking open the main door.         
	After hearing her story, we decided to scan Sudiptas cellphone records to check who he was in touch with. We contacted a couple of his friends and asked them to call him over to a location of their choice. The strategy paid off, said an officer.

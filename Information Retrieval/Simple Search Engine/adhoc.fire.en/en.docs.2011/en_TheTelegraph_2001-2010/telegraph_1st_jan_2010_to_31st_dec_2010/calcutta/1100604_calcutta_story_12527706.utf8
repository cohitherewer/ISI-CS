The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pockets of rout amp; resistance   Winds of change fell Left tree in added areas
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pockets of rout amp; resistance     Winds of change fell Left tree in added areas
          SUBHAJOY ROY                                                  
	Till the beginning of this decade, it used to be said in Jadavpur and its adjacent areas that the CPM could win an election even if it fielded a tree as its candidate.        
	But on Thursday, as the Left Front stared at a poll scorecard that read CPM and allies 8; Trinamul 30 in the added areas of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, those who had witnessed the rise of the red brigade on the citys fringes couldnt help wondering how fast and hard the mighty had fallen.        
	If someone told me even five years ago that things would change so drastically by the time the next election was held, I would have thought he was insane, admitted Baghajatin resident Rabin Malakar.        
	The Left Front won a solitary seat out of seven in Borough XII that falls under chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Assembly constituency and includes parts of Kasba and Kalikapur. In 2005, the Left had won six wards in that borough.        
	The red rout was complete in boroughs XIII and XIV, where the Trinamul Congress won all 18 wards, including Behala, Thakurpukur, Bansdroni and Netaji Nagar. Trinamuls powerhouse performance in these areas may have, however, failed to guarantee the next mayors post for a representative of the added areas.        
	Sovan Chatterjee, the six-time councillor from ward 131 in Behala, was one of the contenders for the first citizens seat until Mamata Banerjee decided to go with a high-powered expert committee to run the civic body instead of an all-powerful mayor.        
	Large parts of Jadavpur, Behala, Kasba and Garden Reach were added to the CMC in 1985, allegedly to make it easier for the Left Front to win civic polls given its dominance of these areas. A large population of refugees from erstwhile east Bengal shored up the Lefts support base in these added areas.        
	Many people now living in boroughs XI, XII and XIII came from beyond the border. In the subsequent years, the undivided Communist party fought against the Congress for the rights of the refugees. So these people became very loyal to the party, explained a retired government employee.         
	But the next generation apparently didnt take the Left Front at face value. They wanted more.        
	We didnt face the struggle that our parents did. Our generation doesnt have the sense of loyalty towards the CPM that the older lot has because we dont see ourselves as refugees, said Suryo Subho Bandopadhyay, a schoolteacher in his mid-20s. We wanted development, which the CPM failed to give.                    
	Over time, the stink from the Tolly Nullah, the narrow roads and the generally unkempt look of areas like Bansdroni, Kudghat and the localities off Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Road  connecting Garia with Tollygunge  came to be identified with red rule.        
	CPM leader Sujan Chakraborty admitted that the Left Fronts support base in the added areas was no longer what it was but blamed mass hysteria for the civic poll debacle. The mass hysteria against the Left Front has been continuing since the Lok Sabha elections. It will take some time to stop, he said.        
	Leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee, credited with leading Trinamuls invasion of this red bastion, said the swing in favour of his party was recent. Even in 2006, these areas were hard to crack. But years of neglect have prompted the people to vote in our favour. So many private hospitals have come up off the EM Bypass but not a single government healthcare facility. There are large housing complexes but no drainage system, he said.        
	The only pocket of support left for the Left Front was Borough XI, which is also in the chief ministers constituency.

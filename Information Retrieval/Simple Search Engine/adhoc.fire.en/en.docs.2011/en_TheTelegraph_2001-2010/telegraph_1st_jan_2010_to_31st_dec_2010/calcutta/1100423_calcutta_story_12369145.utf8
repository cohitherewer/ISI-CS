          Todays question: Can teachers manage a class without reprimanding students? More letters will be published next week

	It is not possible for a teacher to manage a class without reprimanding students. As most of them are adolescents, playing pranks is inevitable. No one expects them to be all sincerity and maturity. If teachers dont scold students pandemonium will take place in the classroom. But the degree of punishment must be looked into. A stern glare may work wonders more than beating the wards black and blue.

	A teacher prepares students not only for text-based exams but also for life. This cannot always be achieved by sweet talk. A teacher needs to be strict at times. Reprimanding students was accepted as a regular part of school life a generation back. There were hardly any complaints. But students now are subjected to such intense pressure to perform well that it makes them emotionally fragile. A few harsh words are often reason enough for them to commit suicide. So now the teachers have to gauge the personality of a student and choose their words accordingly. They have to take care not to hurt the childs self-esteem.

	I think teachers are like parents in school and students are like their children. So they know best whether a class can be managed without reprimanding students or not. The teachers are trained to do so during their training course, so they become students first and teachers later.

	Reprimanding students to manage a class cannot be justified in absolute terms. The answer lies between a yes and a no. Earlier teachers were considered like guardians. They knew how to impart true education.      
	To manage a class and enforce discipline the teachers should have the authority to reprimand students. This way they learn to be obedient. But these days, scolding the students is unjust because it is believed to have a negative impact on their minds. Pupils can be made to understand things in a friendly manner. But the deterioration in the education system should not be forgotten. Anybody can become a teacher now without knowing the responsibilities involved.

	Teachers are the managers of classrooms. If the interactions between them and their students are cordial, then there is no cause for disturbance in the classroom and the question of reprimanding them does not arise. Moreover if the classroom environment is student-friendly and interesting, the students are less likely to create mayhem.

	Its very hard to manage a   class of 30-40 students without   shouting and scolding. Stu  dents are generally talkative   and if the teachers are soft,   they try to take advantage of   the situation. So, teachers feel   the need to intimidate to keep   the class in control. But, harsh   words and rude attitude   should be not be the rule while   dealing with students as that   can only hurt them rather   than make them understand.

	As a parent of two school-going children, I view teachers as parent figures when they are in class. In situations where there is a lack of respect, teachers should reprimand students. Otherwise we will lose the intrinsic distinction between teacher and student.

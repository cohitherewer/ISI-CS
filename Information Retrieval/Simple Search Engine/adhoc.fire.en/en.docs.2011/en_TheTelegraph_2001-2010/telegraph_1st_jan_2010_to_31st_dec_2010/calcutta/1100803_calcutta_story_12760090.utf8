The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Idol hubs debate the great divide 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Idol hubs debate the great divide 
          POULOMI BANERJEE                            Artisans work in open spaces at Kumartuli and (above) the shed at the temporary rehabilitation shelter on Bidhan Sarani. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                 
	Its a tale of two Kumartulis this Durga puja.         
	A part of Calcuttas idol hub was relocated to a temporary site in April to facilitate the renovation of the premises, while many artisans continued to live and work in their old quarters.         
	At the new address, big Durga idols in various stages of creation and the bold white letters on the gate announcing Rehabilitation for Kumartuli Urban Renewal Project are the only clues that this is, at least for the time being, an idol-makers hub. But the big sheds on Bidhan Sarani that have been converted into the living and working area for artisans dont look anything like Kumartuli.         
	For one, every spell of rain doesnt send the artisans scurrying to cover their idols with tarpaulin sheets, one of the most familiar sights at Kumartuli ahead of Puja.         
	At the new workshop, the artisans continue to work even as it pours outside. But their brows are still creased  the shed keeps out not just the rain, but also air and sunlight.         
	In Kumartuli, we worked in open spaces and the idols would dry up easily. Here the shed has windows, but not enough air and sun come in, which means we have to keep the fan on at all times. It increases the power bill, explained Nemai Chandra Pal, the president of the Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskriti Samity.         
	The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), which is revamping Kumartuli, paid the electricity costs in May and June, but the artisans have to foot their own bills from July.         
	Also, in case of a power cut, work comes to a grinding halt, even if there is sunlight outside.         
	A five-minute drive away is Kumartuli, with the familiar buzz that comes about this time of the year. But a part of it is being pulled down. And in the other blocks, the artisans are battling the perennial problems of space crunch and inadequate cover.         
	Divided into two, the artistes of Kumartuli are unsure which part is better.        
	The working conditions are better on the new premises. Recently it rained the whole day. At Kumartuli it would have affected work badly. But here the idols are safe, said Nemai Chandra Pal.        
	But others rue the frequent power cuts at the temporary shelter. Power cuts are common and this place is so dark, you cant work without the light even during the day, says Swapan Paul.         
	Other costs have gone up too. I still get my raw materials from Sovabazar, but it costs more to transport them here than to Kumartuli, he said.        
	Tarak Pal, another idol-maker, is upset that he doesnt have a safe to keep his money in the new workshop. Before the pujas, we spend most of the day at the workshop. In Kumartuli, I would cook near by workshop, but that is difficult here, he grumbled.         
	But Bhabesh Paul, who is in the old locality, said he was tired of his leaky roof. I am in block B, so I cant shift now. But I really want to, he insisted. I have visited the new site  it is clean and has more space than here.         
	But those at the new shelter have a greater worry  the slow pace of orders.         
	Of course, Puja is later this year than last year and we cant be sure till August 15, by when we hope more orders will start coming in, says Nemai Chandra Pal.         
	The fact that a greater number of artisans are still living and working in the old, familiar hub has added to the worries of those on the other side.         
	It would have been better if everyone had relocated. But since only a handful of us have shifted, we cant be sure that all our customers will find us, said a worried artisan.        
	The union has put up big signboards at Kumartuli announcing the changed addresses of each of the artists who have moved out. Those who remain at Kumartuli have also been asked to redirect clients to the Bidhan Sarani shelter.         
	But when one of my old customers came to Kumartuli looking for me and was told that I had shifted to Bidhan Sarani, they didnt want to make another trip and placed the order with an artisan there, said Nemai Chandra Pal glumly, adding that only 5 per cent of expected business had happened at the rehabilitation site yet.        
	Agreed Swapan Paul. New orders are not coming. Some of my old customers have taken the trouble to seek me out at the new address, but even then I dont have enough orders, he said.         
	A few are optimistic. Its a new place, so may be we have had lesser customers than we expected. But we really cannot say that business is bad till August 15, said Indranath Pal.         
	He is happy with the rehabilitation site because of the space, the abundance of water, the relief from worrying about how to keep the idols safe from the rain and the pleasant ambience.        
	Mintu Pal, the joint secretary of the Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskriti Samity, who is still at the old hub, feels it is too early for the artisans at the temporary site to worry.         
	The bigger organisers, who book the more famous artisans at Kumartuli, start placing their orders around Rath Yatra. But the bulk of the orders come after August 15. We have adequately publicised the change in address and regular customers are being re-directed there. Of course, new orders or customers who have no fixed artisan in mind are coming to Kumartuli, but we hope that they will soon start visiting the rehabilitation site too, he said.

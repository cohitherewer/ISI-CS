                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Curfew on tracks, stranded   at station
  - Early-morning departures force passengers to spend nights on platforms          SANJAY MANDAL AND TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          Passengers of rescheduled trains set to leave early in the morning spend the night on a Howrah platform.

	The nightmare continues for Jnaneswari Express passengers, and not just those scarred by the May 28 disaster.        
	A temporary change in the trains departure time from 10.55pm to 4.30am  the earliest start for a long-distance rail service from Calcutta  has been forcing many passengers to spend the night at Howrah station braving mosquito bites on crowded platforms and waiting rooms.        
	Army officer Kalyan Sinha and his family spent Monday night on a platform wondering whether it was worth saving the extra taxi fare that they would have had to pay to arrive from Kalyani an hour before departure instead of several hours before.        
	I knew the departure time had changed but had little choice but to arrive at Howrah (around 50km from Kalyani) the night before. If we had wanted to start early on Monday, we would have had to pay triple the fare. There are very few taxis available at that time and it wouldnt be safe either, said Sinha.        
	Business management student Gaurav Bharadwaj and his sister Sonam werent even aware that the Jnaneswari Express would leave at 4.30am instead of the time printed on their ticket. We arrived for a 10.55pm start, only to be told that the train would leave more than five hours later. We are new to the city and didnt dare return to our relatives house at night. So the platform was the only option, said Gaurav, a resident of Raipur in Chhattisgarh.        
	Several other passengers said they hadnt seen a single advertisement announcing the change in departure time, necessitated by the night curfew for trains going through the Maoist-infested Kharagpur-Rourkela and Kharagpur-Adra sections.         
	The curfew took effect after the Jnaneswari Express sabotage in which 150 people died.        
	For passengers, lack of effort by the railways to publicise the change in timings was as much a gripe as the state of amenities at the railway station. You wouldnt notice it if you came during the day but staying the night at the station is an eye-opener, said a youth waiting to catch a rescheduled train.        
	Damayanti Devi, 66, came to Howrah with husband R.P. Singh six hours before the Mumbai Mail was to leave at 5.30am because they were told transport would be hard to find from midnight till 5am. The elderly couple went from one waiting room to another but didnt find a place to sit, let alone put up their tired feet.        
	We spent the night seated on the floor of a dirty platform. I felt like going back home, said Damayanti Devi.        
	Co-passenger Joyita Sarkar said she hadnt seen a dirtier toilet than the one she entered at the station that night. Worse still, the pay-and-use toilets are closed from midnight till 3am, she added.        
	With the enquiry room also shut after midnight, passengers spending a night at the station have nowhere to go if they want any information.         
	South Eastern Railway insisted that the onus was on passengers to call the helplines for train timings before coming to the station. Its not possible to inform all passengers individually. In any case, we are having to review the rescheduled timings every few days, said an official.        
	He also contested allegations about passengers being inconvenienced by the lack of amenities. We have dedicated staff for cleaning the toilets and platforms. There are also six waiting rooms across the old and new complexes.

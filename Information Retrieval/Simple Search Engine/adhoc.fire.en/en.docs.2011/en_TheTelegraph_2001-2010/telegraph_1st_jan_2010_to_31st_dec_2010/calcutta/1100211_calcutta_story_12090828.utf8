The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | School leader by example
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      School leader by example
          ADITI RAY                          Naman Shah                                  
	Whether it is academics or extra-curricular activities, Naman Shah is always on the go. The Class XII student of St Xaviers Collegiate School received the Complete Xaverian Award for 2009-2010 on February 3. Naman, 18, received a gold medal and Rs 11,000.         
	He is a natural leader, feel his teachers. He was Loyola House captain in Class XII, having held leadership positions throughout school. You can be assured that Naman will finish the task assigned to him on time, said Andrew Singh, master of Loyola House.        
	The commerce student was one of the coordinators of Exuberance, the school fest. I did everything, from getting posters printed to managing the crowd, he says.         
	A trip to Ireland in 2007, as part of an exchange programme with Belvedere College in Dublin, is his favourite memory. I travelled with 14 students and stayed with a family in a village for 15 days. I picked up a lot of local culture, he said.         
	Naman, who scored 95 per cent in his Class X board exams, wants to study either law or economics in future.         
	His father is his inspiration. He taught me how to lead by example, he says. He has kept aside the award money as a gift for his father.

                      Idiom of modern art                    Traditional notions of culture and social protocol have undergone an intense and rapid transformation due to the influence of globalisation and the experience of electronic media in our daily lives. Myth, Metaphor and Allegory, the ongoing show, features works by four artists born in the 1970s and staying in Baroda and, as such, bears distinctive traces of the major influences of that generation. Three of the participants being originally from Calcutta, their works consequently carry a multitude of idioms that are homespun and also picked up from their second home. The works of Pappu Bardhan, Prithwiraj Mali (a painting by him appears here) and Sharmi Chowdhury offer scope to study the nature of the idioms that have fused so finely in their renditions, improvising on an already established visual language particular to Baroda. What is also important in understanding their works is a tendency to move along a specific trajectory. K Prasun Roys paintings show a marked tendency to deconstruct the aura of the transcendental, which currently pervades our social environment.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by young artists of Baroda and Calcutta When: Till May 29 (except Sundays); 11 am - 7 pm Where: Mon Art Gallerie, 6 Hungerford Street, 3rd Floor

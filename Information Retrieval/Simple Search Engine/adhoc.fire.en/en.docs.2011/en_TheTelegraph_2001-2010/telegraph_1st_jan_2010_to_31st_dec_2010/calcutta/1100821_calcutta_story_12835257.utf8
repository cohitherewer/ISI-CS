The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Township faces cave-in curse
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Township faces cave-in curse
          A STAFF REPORTER                                               A crack in the road surface in 
  IB Block. (Tamaghna Banerjee)      
	Roads in Salt Lake have caved in at over 16 spots, an inspection by civic officials revealed on Friday, a day after a 3ftx2ft crater near island No. 8 tripped several motorcyclists.         
	Craters were spotted in IB, IL and AE blocks. Civic officials blamed leaks in underground pipes and the receding of the ground water level for the spurt in cave-ins.         
	Sewage pipes have sprung leaks in a number of spots, wetting the soil above. As a result, the metalled road surface is getting weak. We have started work on the pipelines. Once the repairs are over, the PWD will work on the roads, said Debashis Jana, member, chairman-in-council, conservancy.        
	Municipality chairperson Anita Mondal expressed concern over the water level. The ground water level is receding steadily in Salt Lake (and not being replenished). As a result, a hollow space is being created and sand from the upper layer is coming down, triggering cave-ins, she said.        
	According to experts, Salt Lake has a layer of sand below the ground, which is compounding the problem. There is sand in place of soil underneath Salt Lake roads. With the fall in the water level, the sand is sinking fast, said architect Jyoti Ranjan Roy.        
	To make matters worse, the layer beneath the ground is filled with slush instead of a mixture of gravel and sand, which has made it weak.        
	So, what is the way out?        
	More surface water needs to seep into the ground. This can be done through rain-water harvesting, digging bore-wells and pumping rainwater into the ground rather than pumping it into canals, suggested Roy.        
	The cave-ins have left the residents worried. The footpath outside my IB Block home and the road near it have developed cracks . I wonder if our buildings are safe, said homemaker Rina Chatterjee.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Three held with fake currency
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three persons, including a couple, were arrested on Saturday evening for allegedly spreading fake currency in the city.        
	The couple and another man were buying goods from shops in two parts of the city in exchange for fake Rs 500 notes. They were caught by shop-owners who suspected the notes to be fake, said an officer of the Special Task Force.         
	Mohammad Sabir Ali and his wife Afsana Begum were shopping in Burrabazar. They allegedly settled their bills in two shops with fake notes before the owner of a clothes store alerted Burrabazar police station. Officers arrested the two after five fake Rs 500 notes were allegedly found on them.         
	The couple, who own a leather goods shop in Entally, claimed they had received the notes from a customer but an investigator said they were probably working for a racket.        
	Sheikh Faiyaz was arrested at Babubazar near the port while buying stationery. He too had bought goods from two shops before a storeowner called the police. Five fake notes were found on him, claimed the police.        
	During interrogation, Faiyaz, who works in a biryani shop in Mominpur, said his employer had given him the notes to buy stationery. The employer is absconding.

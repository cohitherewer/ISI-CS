The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | They hear the Cup we see   Their eyes are trained   to hear
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      They hear the Cup we see             SUBHAJOY ROY                          PICTURE THIS: Didier Drogba of Ivory Coast and Portugals Cristiano Ronaldo in action during Tuesdays match                                  
	Sourav Halder can barely see but he is the eyes and ears of an entire room of visually challenged soccer fans on World Cup nights.        
	Goal hoyechhe (Is it a goal)? quizzes Amar Kumar Shaw, a Class VIII student seated on a bench behind him. Na re, ektu-r jonyo holo na (No, missed the goal by a whisker), replies Sourav, a Class X student.        
	Amar repeats the question after another excited shout from the TV commentator trying to make himself heard amidst the drone of vuvuzelas, but Sourav doesnt lose patience. Ki holo janish? Ball-ta...(You know what happened? The ball...), he starts again, giving a running commentary even as he tilts his head to watch the replay on the flat-screen TV with the one eye that has 60 per cent sight.        
	I like doing this. At least I can see a little, smiles the teenager, a student of Lighthouse for the Blind near Tollygunge police station, after Portugal and Ivory Coast end up goal-less after 90 minutes on Tuesday evening.         
	Sourav will be doing duty as guide and commentator for his schoolmates at the residential institute this entire World Cup, thanks to the broadcasters  including state-run Akashvani and Doordarshan  turning a blind eye to the needs of visually challenged fans.         
	I was so disappointed not to find live commentary of the Argentina-Nigeria match when I switched on the radio last Saturday, says Anita Kumari Jayshoal, a Class X student at the Lighthouse.        
	So why didnt she sit beside the TV in the dining hall and hear the English commentary? Its difficult to make out what the commentators are saying in English. And the noise is annoying, says Anita.        
	For Amar, the English is a problem, though he understands the language of soccer better than most. I may not be able to follow the commentary but I know when a goal is scored, or if its a corner or a free kick, insists the sports trivia fan.                          
	He goes on to explain how Michael Ballacks departure has left Germany a weaker side, despite a four-goal victory in the first match, and predicts that the next World Cup in Brazil would be the best ever.        
	So how does Amar update his sports quotient? I go home every Saturday and on Sundays I follow a TV show called Khel Samachar. I listen to and record the information that the show provides, adds the boy from Manoharpukur, in south Calcutta.         
	According to an Akashvani official, live radio commentary has been scheduled for only seven of the World Cup league matches. The Asia Cup day-night cricket matches that involve India need to be broadcast as well, he explains.         
	What about the knockout stage of the World Cup? The decision on how many matches will be covered has not been taken yet, says the official.         
	Had Amar and friends been in South Africa, they could have watched a match live in any of the six stadiums sitting in special enclosures where 15 seats each are reserved for the visually challenged.        
	The seats come with headphones over which trained commentators provide live commentary.

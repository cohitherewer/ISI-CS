	The high court on Tuesday heard the anticipatory bail plea of a teacher accused of detaining a student in Class IV after being denied a laptop as bribe. The division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice R.N. Ray will give its ruling on Thursday.        
	The teachers lawyer, D. Kabir, dubbed the allegations baseless. The student failed twice under different class teachers. My client tried his best to help the student but unfortunately the boy was not good in studies.        
	Jaymalya Bagchi, who appeared for the boys father, said the accused teacher, a member of the school panel that looks after students promotion, had made an unlawful and unjustified demand of his client. The father was forced to give the teacher a desktop computer but that did not satisfy him.

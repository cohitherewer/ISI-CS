The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Milan Mela Phase II pricier
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Milan Mela Phase II pricier
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The open space in Phase II of Milan Mela, the permanent fairground off the Bypass, will be costlier than the four halls in Phase I taken together.        
	The government has fixed the rent for the 2,65,621sq ft fairground in Phase II, likely to be unveiled next year, at Rs 4 lakh a day. The daily charge for each of the four halls in the first phase is Rs 60,000.        
	An official in the West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation, a wing of the industry department that looks after the site, said around Rs 12 crore had been spent on developing the 2,87,396sq ft Phase II.        
	Apart from the paved fairground, the phase will have water bodies, nine food kiosks, motorable roads and an underground power distribution network.        
	We have spent a huge amount on developing the open area in Phase II and want to realise the money from fair organisers. We had sent a proposal to the finance department on the rate structure for Phase II and it has been accepted, said industry secretary Dipankar Mukherjee.        
	The state governments decision is unlikely to affect Calcutta Book Fair because the organisers, Publishers and Booksellers Guild, enjoy government patronage.        
	Last year, we had paid around Rs 38 lakh though the rent was Rs 57 lakh. This year we have scrapped the entry fee and requested the government to offer us a discount, said Sudhangshu Dey, a guild functionary.        
	Milan Mela will be given at half the rate to NGOs and government agencies. There is no change in the policy on offering rebates. We want to develop the site to international standards and several steps have been taken in that direction, said an official.

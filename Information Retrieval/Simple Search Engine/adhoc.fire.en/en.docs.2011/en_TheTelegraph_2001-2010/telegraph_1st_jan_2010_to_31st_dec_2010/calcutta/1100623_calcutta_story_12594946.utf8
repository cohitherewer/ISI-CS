          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Short spells of light rain on Tuesday afternoon gave way to heavy showers in the evening that broke the monsoon lull since last week.         
	The monsoon flow has got a boost from a low-pressure trough passing through Bengal and its neighbourhood. There would be substantial rainfall over the next 48 hours, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Tuesdays showers accompanied by strong winds lowered the mercury by around three degrees from the days high of 35.9 degrees Celsius.        
	If there are several spells of rain, temperatures are likely to fall by a few degrees over the next two days. The weather is likely to stay comfortable, said an India Meteorological Department official.

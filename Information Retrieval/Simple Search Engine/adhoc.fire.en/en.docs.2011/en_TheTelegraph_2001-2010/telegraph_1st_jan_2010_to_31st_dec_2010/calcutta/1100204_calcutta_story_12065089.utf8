The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tech threat to class discipline
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tech threat to class discipline
  - Cellphone is teachers worst enemy        JHINUK MAZUMDAR                                                  
	1990: Class VIII student caught reading a mens magazine is punished by being banished from class for half an hour.        
	2010: Class VI student caught sending a lewd SMS joke to a female teacher from classroom is advised counselling.        
	Technology has thrust new-age discipline problems on schools in the city, taking classroom crime and punishment beyond a naughty students grin and an angry teachers glare.        
	I call it techno indiscipline. Cellphones, iPods and digital cameras have invaded the campus, making enforcement of discipline not only more challenging but a bigger issue than it used to be, Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, told Metro.        
	A cellphone in a schoolbag rather than mischief in a students mind is now the teachers worst enemy. Not only does it top the list of most-misused tech tools, it is also something that a section of guardians insists their wards carry to school.        
	Students use the cellphone not only to communicate with friends and store music, pictures or clips but also as a tool to cheat in examinations. Nothing irritates me more than a student busy with his cellphone when he should be paying attention to what is being taught, complained a teacher of a south Calcutta school.        
	But arent cellphones banned in schools? Most institutions confiscate cellphones and other electronic gadgets like music players and CDs or DVDs if these are found in schoolbags. At Calcutta Girls, St James and St Augustine, confiscated items are returned once school gives over. Mahadevi Birla punishes repeat offenders by putting them on traffic duty at the gate.        
	Richard Gasper, the academic inspector of the St Augustine Group of Schools, said random checks at regular intervals were necessary. We usually announce a check during the assembly to ensure that students cannot hide gadgets if they have any in their bags, he added.        
	According to a math teacher who did not wish to be named, the most alarming thing about technology being easily available to children was that they were learning to do the usual teenager things in their pre-teens.        
	It is not uncommon to find kids as young as those in Class V or VI sharing explicit MMS clips or lewd jokes through their cellphones. By the time they are ready to leave school, such children have this been-there-done-that air about them, which leads to brazen defiance of authority, he rued.        
	Some principals feel the bigger problem is not so much innocence going out of classroom antics as a section of parents condoning their wards behaviour when teachers report incidents. Parents need to be a little more respectful of teachers. They sometimes criticise teachers in front of their wards, which is unacceptable, said Basanti Biswas, the principal of Calcutta Girls.         
	Veteran teachers find the changing body language of students more disconcerting than incidents of indiscipline. Times have changed and technology has taken over our lives but some values need to be maintained. The overall change in the attitude of students has made punishment for indiscipline a more complex affair than most people can comprehend, said a teacher who has schooled two generations.        
	Rita Chatterjee, the principal of Apeejay School, said offensive body language was more difficult to handle for a teacher than a routine incident of indiscipline. On many occasions, the body language of students is so offensive that you have to ask, can you please explain where I went wrong in correcting you? she added.        
	Punishment for indiscipline has also become milder because teachers fear triggering extreme emotions. Most students of today are fragile in the mind. No school would like to crack the whip in a way that prompts children to either become too aggressive or timid, said Gasper of St Augustine.

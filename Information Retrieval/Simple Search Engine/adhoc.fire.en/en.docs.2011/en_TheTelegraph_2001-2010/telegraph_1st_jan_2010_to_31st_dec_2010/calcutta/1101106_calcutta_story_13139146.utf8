	Coming soon is destination No. 11 on Calcuttas fast-growing multiplex map.         
	Broadway  a four-screen plex from the entertainment arm of realty giant HDIL  will throw open its doors to the city in the first week of December.        
	Located in Salt Lakes Sector III and spread across around 30,000sq ft, this will be the multiplex chains first property in the city.        
	Ever since the entertainment division of HDIL was set up three years ago, we have been aiming for a pan-India presence. With Calcutta being an upcoming entertainment hub, we thought of coming here before going anywhere else, says Mukesh Gupta, chief executive officer, HDIL Entertainment.        
	With 23 screens spread across Mumbais Vasai, Andheri and Goregaon, Broadway is also setting up shop in Indore in November.        
	The four-screen property in Salt Lake will screen the latest Holly, Bolly and Tolly blockbusters. Despite so many multiplexes in the vicinity, we decided to come to Salt Lake because we feel that the demand for good movie-going facilities in that area far outstrips supply, says Gupta.        
	Originally scheduled to operate from November, the delay in procuring the requisite licences have pushed the Broadway opening to December.         
	While last-minute details are still being worked upon, Broadways distinguishing factor will be its competitive price point.         
	Our ticket rates will never be upwards of Rs 150, while most of our shows will be priced below Rs 120, says Gupta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Small turnout at Peerless hearing
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Small turnout at Peerless hearing
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Peerless lobby after a mob ransacked it                                  
	Only 47 people attended the first hearing held by the state health department panel probing the alleged refusal by Peerless Hospital to admit some accident victims on April 13 and its subsequent ransacking by a mob.        
	Those who deposed at Swastha Bhavan in Salt Lake on Thursday included one of the accident victims, Kalpana Dhali. I became unconscious after the accident. When I regained consciousness hours later, I found myself at MR Bangur Hospital, said Kalpana.        
	I heard that Peerless Hospital had refused to admit my niece Arati Roy, who died. However, I did not see that myself, the resident of Kestopur added.        
	The others who deposed and made written submissions included employees of Peerless Hospital and agencies employed by it, patients, residents of the area and workers in a nearby mall and school.        
	The number of witnesses is not satisfactory. We had expected more relatives of the accident victims to be present. We hope the turnout will be much more in the next hearing, said a member of committee.        
	The panel comprises RK Vats, Mrityunjay Mukhopadhyay, Swapan Chakraborty and Bhaskar Bhattacharjee, all senior health department officials. It is also looking into the alleged refusal by Apex Institute of Medical Sciences to admit the accident victims.        
	Somnath Dey, another witness who deposed before the panel, was being treated at the emergency ward of Peerless Hospital on April 13.        
	I was suffering from pain in the abdomen and was lying on the stretcher after being administered an injection. Suddenly I saw some injured persons being brought into the ward. The next thing I remember is hundreds of people shouting and ransacking the hospital. Scared, I fled into the toilet, said Dey.        
	Subhas Dutta, a guard in a shopping mall opposite the hospital, told the panel: The number of doctors was inadequate compared with the number of injured persons who had been brought in on April 13 morning. The doctors tried their best but could not cope with the situation.        
	The next hearing will be at East Jadavpur police station on Saturday. The panel has summoned officials of both hospitals to Swastha Bhavan on May 13.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A young woman molested on a crowded Metro train and slapped hard for protesting mustered the courage to drag the assailant out of the compartment on reaching a station and pinned him down with the help of some passengers.        
	The incident, which occurred on a Dum Dum-bound train during the Monday morning rush hour, would have been treated as just another instance of a molester targeting women in crowded places had the braveheart victim not decided to hit back at the risk of reprisal.        
	Shafique Imran, a 23-year-old resident of Bishnupur in South 24-Parganas, allegedly molested the 24-year-old working woman  Metro is withholding her identity on request  when she was standing close to the seats reserved for women between Rabindra Sadan and Maidan stations.        
	According to the complaint lodged by the woman with Maidan police station, she boarded the train at Rabindra Sarobar around 9.45am and had barely found a spot to stand when she noticed Imran trying to get too close for comfort. She followed his gaze for the next few minutes and screamed when she felt a hand touch her.         
	He was taken aback by my reaction and claimed that somebody else might have touched me. As we argued, the train stopped at Rabindra Sadan and more people entered the compartment. My protest seemed to drown in the din. And then he slapped me, she recounted.        
	Didnt her co-passengers stand up for her?        
	The train was too crowded and maybe some people didnt even notice. Some women passengers who were seated and saw what happened supported me, though, she said.        
	As the train entered Maidan station  the woman was headed for Russel Street  she grabbed Imran by his shirt and pulled him out of the compartment. The youth wriggled free and ran but the woman ran after him, followed by commuters alerted by her screams.        
	Imran was finally pinned down near the turnstiles, from where security personnel took him to Maidan police station.         
	But for all the trouble taken by the victim, salesman Imran was produced in court and freed on bail within a few hours of his arrest. He was booked under Section 509 of the IPC, which deals with acts, words or gestures intended to insult the modesty of a woman. It is a bailable offence.         
	We had to let the youth out on bail because that is what the law stipulates, said an officer.        
	The deputy commissioner of the detective department, Damayanti Sen, said the cops would follow up the case.         
	Although Imran may have got away without spending even a night behind bars, many of those who saw his victim fight back the way she did said they were glad a strong message had gone out to molesters on the prowl.        
	Its not often that you see a woman take on a molester in this manner. We need more like her, said a Metro Railway employee.

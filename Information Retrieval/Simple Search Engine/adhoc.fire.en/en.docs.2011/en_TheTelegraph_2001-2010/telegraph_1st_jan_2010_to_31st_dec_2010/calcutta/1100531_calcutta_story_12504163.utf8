The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | She votes for a reason
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      She votes for a reason
          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                           Ayesha Khatoon, 105, being escorted to a Park Street booth on Sunday.   (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                        
	She was born the year Albert Einstein propounded his Theory of Relativity, but you neednt have known why E=mc sup2; to figure out the force behind 105-year-old Ayesha Khatoons energy as she stepped out in the sun on Sunday.        
	Dadi wouldnt skip this election, come what may. After all, her daughter-in-law is contesting, smiled great-grandson Sarfaraz Hussain, part of wheelchair-bound Khatoons entourage at the Seventh Day Adventist Day School booth on Park Street.        
	The grand old lady of the Hussain household at 9/1 Collin Lane, off Park Street, has seldom missed voting in any post-Independence election, but this Sunday was special because daughter-in-law Meherbano Ahmed is on the candidates list for ward 63.        
	If Khatoon let her enthusiasm speak for her, many other city women who lined up at the polling booths were verbose about their reasons for voting in this civic election. Some spoke about empowerment, a few about change and almost all of them about the prospect of Calcutta becoming a better place if it had more women councillors.        
	Aparna Chatterjee, 30, of ward 28 said she was happy to be a voter in a reserved seat. Reservation by rotation for women is essential to break the status quo. Some candidates may have got tickets by virtue of being someones sister, wife or daughter but you cant call all of them puppets, she added.        
	The State Election Commission had no ready data on the turnout of women voters but officials said it was more or less the same  around 35 per cent  as in previous polls.        
	Arundhati Bose, a 22-year-old postgraduate student from ward 85, insisted that her vote was not gender-specific. We first need to know how to exercise our right to vote; only then will it lead to meaningful representation in policy-making. My vote would always go to the person who I think is good for my ward. I am not one to be swayed or influenced by gender, she said.        
	For 47-year-old homemaker Sonal Bavish, from reserved ward 69, exercising her franchise this election meant more than voting for a well-maintained ward.        
	Issues like child molestation and female foeticide are never highlighted in any election, leave alone a civic poll. But when you have a woman in charge of your ward or Assembly or parliamentary constituency, you can expect someone raising such an issue to at least get a patient hearing, said the resident of Sarat Bose Road.        
	Mili Das, a retired higher education department official from ward 85, said she was all for a woman councillor, though not because she was a woman herself. Women have an eye for detail. It could be something as simple as keeping the ward clean. Across the world, whenever they have been given positions of responsibility they have been successful, said the resident of Panditiya Road.        
	Dass ward has two women in the fray.

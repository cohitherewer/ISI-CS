The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Thank god, its Madhyamik   Exam brings 14-day relief
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Thank god, its Madhyamik     -   Exam brings 14-day relief
          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                                            
	Samrat Dutta had a frustrating start to the week, as usual  40 minutes to cross chaotic Esplanade en route to his workplace; loudspeakers blaring at a street-corner meeting next to his Kankurgachhi home; lights out just as he was settling down to watch TV.        
	Then came Tuesday, and things changed.         
	Over the past three days, it has taken the 27-year-old not more than 10 minutes to cross Esplanade, the loudspeakers near his house have gone silent, and there has been no power cut to cut short his TV viewing.        
	A lot has changed in three days, smiled Dutta. TGIM!        
	Stumped? Thank god, its Madhyamik!        
	Between February 23 and March 8  the duration of Madhyamik 2010  Calcuttans are supposed to be officially spared three chronic problems that plague their city: long traffic snarls, loudspeakers and loadshedding.        
	The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education held a series of meetings with the police, transport and power departments in the weeks leading to Madhyamik to ensure that the examinees  and the rest of the city by default  were not inconvenienced in any way.        
	So while the police have taken up the responsibility of keeping the citys chaos zones relatively clutter-free, CESC has mobilised man and machine to stay ahead of the demand curve throughout the exam season.        
	The decibel devil is on a leash, too, with the state pollution control board banning loudspeakers and mikes throughout Madhyamik.        
	Organisations affiliated to various parties have also fallen in line by promising not to organise processions, rallies, street-corner meetings, roadblocks and blockades on rail tracks till the exams are over.        
	Sadly, the good times  subject to adherence to what has been put on paper  will last merely a fortnight.        
	We should have exams 365 days of the year. Adults should be given permission to sit for various kinds of exams through the year so that the city becomes a better place to live in, suggested funnyman and t2 columnist Mir.        
	But is the entire city really reaping the fringe benefits of Madhyamik?         
	Thursday saw no complaints from examinees about traffic snarls or other disruptions. The roads were clear even during peak hours, and examinees did not face any problem reaching the centres. We were also able to send the question papers and answer scripts to the centres on time, said Mamata Ray, the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education.        
	A senior police officer said no rallies and demonstrations in the city had automatically translated into smoother flow of traffic. We havent drawn up a traffic management strategy as such for Madhyamik. Its just that there are no disruptions, he added.        
	What if someone does break the exam code over the next 11 days?        
	Freelance writer Anupam Chakravartty, 25, said he wasnt sure the authorities would act on complaints. What action will be taken and how promptly it comes will be known if someone actually steps forward to lodge a complaint. With the CMC elections round the corner, meetings and rallies are being held almost every day.        
	On Thursday, commuters faced traffic snarls in parts of central Calcutta and along the EM Bypass towards the afternoon. But for most Calcuttans, Madhyamik does seem to have changed things. For the better.        
	D. Ghosh, an RBI official, said extra transport arrangements for examinees  46 exam special buses and eight additional trams meant an easier commute to and from work. What a relief it is to see buses that arent jam-packed, even if only for a fortnight, added Ghosh, 58.        
	Ballygunge homemaker Arunima Roy, 32, said a power cut-free Madhyamik fortnight would be a welcome change from a glitch-ridden winter. We suffered power cuts because of CESCs maintenance work this winter despite demand being low. Now that exams are on, I presume the lights wont go off,  she hoped.        
	Officials of CESC insisted that all possible steps had been taken to ensure that examinees didnt suffer power cuts. The third unit (250MW) at Budge Budge is up and running. The Budge Budge to East Calcutta 330KV transmission line is also operational. So we are much ahead of the demand curve for Madhyamik, said a CESC spokesperson.        
	During the exam season, the peak power demand is 1,150-1,300MW.        
	The other demand, of course, is for the benefits of the exam season to carry on.

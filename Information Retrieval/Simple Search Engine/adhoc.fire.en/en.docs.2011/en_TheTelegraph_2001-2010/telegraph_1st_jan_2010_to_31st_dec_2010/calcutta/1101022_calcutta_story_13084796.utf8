                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Probe team on track
      Our bureau                              
	The railway ministry on Thursday replaced the committee formed by the Metro Railway general manager to probe Wednesdays derailment with a panel comprising four Railway Board members.            
	The railway board committee  member staff V.N. Tripathi, member (engineering) R.N. Lal, member (planning) B.N. Rajashekhar and adviser (tourism and catering) Kamlesh Gupta  started their investigation soon after reaching Calcutta from Delhi on Thursday.             
	They visited the Noapara car shed and made certain observations. Tomorrow they will meet senior Metro Railway officials in this connection, Amar Nath, the general manager of Metro Railway, said on Thursday.            
	The four experts spent five hours at the shed examining the rake that had derailed and speaking to Metro officials. They did not visit Central station, near which the mishap had occurred.             
	The meeting that had been planned between state chief secretary Samar Ghosh, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti and Metro Railway officials to discuss safety of passengers was cancelled on Thursday.             
	The meeting could not be held as the Metro Railway general manager was busy with the members of the Railway Board who have come from Delhi. The meeting can be held when he is free. Right now they are investigating the incident, said Ghosh at Writers Buildings.            
	The state government has not written to the rail wing about the meeting, said a Metro spokesperson on Thursday.             
	When asked about the matter, Ghosh said: I have spoken to the general manager of Metro Railway. Why should I write? Yesterday I could not contact him as he was in the tunnel and his cellphone was out of reach.

                      Innovative impressions                    The process of making artworks by printing, normally on paper, printmaking usually covers only the process of creating prints with an element of originality, rather than just being a photographic reproduction of a painted work. In Prints21, the ongoing group show, printmaking has stepped beyond its traditional limits and acquired a wholly new dimension. Innovative and adventurous in design and composition, each of the works poignantly articulates the trials and terrors of the modern world. While traditional forms are juxtaposed with new visual idioms in Sujay Mukherjees work, Srikanta Pauls woodcuts use a traditional technique to derive an expression that is amusing, scary or even bizarre. Dhrupadi Ghoses eerie photographic montages echo the silent rage of Santanu Chakrabortys lithographs. Jaysree Basak and Riddhi Narayan Nandy combine conventional processes with excellent technical artistry to produce works that charm and soothe the senses. Annabel Schencks work appears to be inspired by the dark and the uncanny.                  Event: An exhibition of recent works by a group of aspiring young artists When: Till May 29 (except Sunday amp; public holidays); 11 am - 7 pm, Mondays, 3 pm - 7 pm Where: Studio21, 17L Dover Terrace

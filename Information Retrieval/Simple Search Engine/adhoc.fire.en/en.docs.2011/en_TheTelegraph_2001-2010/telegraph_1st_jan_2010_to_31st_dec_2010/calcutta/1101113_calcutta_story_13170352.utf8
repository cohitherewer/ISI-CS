                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Two men held for foreign job dupe
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The mastermind and another operative of a nation-wide racket that had duped several people who wanted jobs abroad into working as bonded labourers in Malaysia have been arrested in the city, claims the CID.         
	Ashok Sen, a 54-year-old veterinary surgeon who was picked up from Jadavpur, is the suspected mastermind. He runs in Serampore an agency named Teknik-N-Skill Consultancy Services that had published advertisements offering jobs abroad.        
	Sen, who hails from Nadia, had been living in Thane, Maharashtra. He was arrested in Jadavpur on Thursday, said a CID officer. Shankar Bose, 30, is the other man arrested in this connection. He was held in his Barasat home.        
	The CID started the investigation on the complaint of Roopjan Laskar, whose son Khurshid Alam Laskar, 32, had gone to Malaysia in September to take up a job in the hotel industry, but ended up a labourer in a palm oil factory.        
	The victims of the racket, spread out across the country, shelled out between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh each. Once they reached Malaysia, their passports were taken away. Unable to return, they were forced to do menial jobs, said special IG (CID) Anuj Sharma.

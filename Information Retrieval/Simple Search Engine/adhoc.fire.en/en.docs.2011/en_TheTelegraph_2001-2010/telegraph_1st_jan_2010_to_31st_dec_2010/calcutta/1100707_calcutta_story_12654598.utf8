                      Love conquers all                    Tagores Chitrangada is the story of a warrior princess who falls in love with Arjuna of The Mahabharata. He rejects her because he has taken a vow of celibacy. Chitrangada, who has been the epitome of strength and valour all her life, feels that Arjuna has forsaken her as she does not possess feminine grace or beauty. She feels that a womans physical appeal and feminine charm are more desirable to even the greatest of heroes. In her quest for Arjunas love, she seeks the intervention of Madana, the God of Love, who transforms her into a beautiful woman. Chitrangada overwhelms Arjuna with her newfound charm. But his mesmerised acceptance dampens her spirit as he has chosen illusion and temptation over heroism, sincerity and truth. Eventually, the hero in Arjuna awakens. A time comes when he overcomes her superficial appeals and seeks redemption from it all. He is touched by the noble princess Chitrangada who is both a mother and a noble ruler of her citizens. Realising that truth has finally triumphed over delusion, Chitrangada relinquishes her physical charm to reveal her real self. Their union is marked by sublime glory, true love and mutual respect.

	Welfare Society for the Blind, in association with the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, held an interactive session between corporate bigwigs and the visually challenged on expanding job opportunities for the latter at the Chambers premises on March 13.        
	Mala Banerjee, the president of Welfare Society for the Blind, told the gathering: We do not want you to employ them either out of sympathy or to fill a quota in your corporate social responsibility cell, but to appreciate their efforts and give them equal opportunities and the same level of work.         
	Among those who have bagged jobs, Sudeshna Bhattacharya, 34, recounted how she had to persuade her initially sceptical employer about how she worked. The firm was not aware of the software, she said. Bhattacharya suffers from glaucoma since birth and now works as a consultant in an IT company in Salt Lakes Sector V.         
	Ashish Jha, 33,was refused jobs despite doing well in several interviews. Reason: he is visually impaired. But he fought back and is now with IBM. In hindsight, the failures were a boon for me. After all, this company gives me a better pay package, he smiled.         
	There were discussions on the competence of the visually impaired in the mainstream job market. Its important for the visually challenged to identify their capabilities and showcase them, said Arup Dasgupta, the managing director of Metalogic Systems.         
	Sushmita Ghose, the joint honorary secretary of Welfare Society for the Blind, cited the example of a leather factory off Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, in which 12 out of 200 employees are visually impaired. Their work involves counting and sorting. A visually impaired person can hold the job of a teacher, telecaller, computer-aided back office employee, announcer or singer of ad jingles, she said.         
	According to Jappreet Sethi, the vice-president (human resources) of Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj, the process has to be more inclusive rather than transactional, where the push has to come from both sides. It has to be a two-way traffic, said Sethi.

	As part of our field trip, 20 of us paid a visit to Compass, the information technology exhibition held at Netaji Indoor Stadium recently. The exhibition exposed us to the amazing world of gizmos and gadgets, with representation by companies like HCL, Dell, Foxin and Microsoft. Manned by an ex-student of our school, the iBall stall exhibited a range of ultra small and portable wireless mouses. It was a whole new experience for us, as we learnt about new technological advances.

	Oxford High School, in Howrah, observed Life Orientation Day in the meditation hall of its premises recently. The teachers took theoretical and practical classes on different meditation techniques and exemplified them with the biographies of great men. Every day, the school starts with a session of meditation and such camps are held frequently.

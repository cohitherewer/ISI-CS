	Knowing was not enough; whether students could use their knowledge to solve practical problems was what counted at a science quiz with a difference held in the city on Wednesday.        
	The first edition of the TTIS Science Hungama, presented by Motion IIT-JEE, saw 57 teams from 30 schools across the city compete for the Alpha trophy at the St Xaviers College auditorium.         
	The Science Hungama is about application of theories learnt in class to solve problems, said a TTIS spokesperson.         
	The prelims of Science Hungama comprised only three tasks  solving a science crossword puzzle, solving five problems based on 25 ice-cream sticks and determining how many triangles were there in a treasure square.        
	It is so much fun. It is not like the usual quizzes at all, said Vishal Haldar, a Class XI student of Birla High School for Boys who participated in the event.        
	Army Public School, Assembly of God Church, Delhi Public School New Town, Don Bosco Bandel, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Apeejay School and Kendriya Vidyalaya Ballygunge were among the other schools represented in the event.        
	Ten teams out of 57 made it to the semi-finals. After two rounds of rapid-fire questions, six teams  two from South Point High School and one each from Laxmipath Singhania Academy, Frank Anthony Public School, St James School and Don Bosco Park Circus  made it to the finals.        
	This is a good endeavour. It is different from other quizzes and also very different from how things are taught in schools. It makes learning fun and without fun, learning is nothing, said physicist Meher Engineer, an ex-director of Bose Institute who was the chief guest and scientific expert at the event.        
	In keeping with the unique concept behind Science Hungama, the format of the final was different from those of other quizzes.        
	Teams which made it to the finals had to perform four experiments and identify scientists based on facets of their life that had nothing to do with what made them famous.        
	Seminars and lectures are pass. Adding fun to learning is very important. That is what Science Hungama is about, said Abhishek Jalan, the centre head of Motion IIT-JEE, a coaching institute.        
	A team from South Point, comprising Diptaishik Chowdhury, Korak Kumar Ray, Deeptish Mukherjee and Sharbatanu Chatterjee, won the title.

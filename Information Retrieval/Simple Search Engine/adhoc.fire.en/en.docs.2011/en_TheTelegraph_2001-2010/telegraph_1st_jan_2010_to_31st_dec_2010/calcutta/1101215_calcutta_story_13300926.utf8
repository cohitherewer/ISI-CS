The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bank official held for account fraud
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bank official held for account fraud
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police arrested an official of a nationalised bank on Tuesday for helping a trader to open a savings account in the name of a dead man.        
	Arindam Ghosh, posted in the Posta branch of Bank of Rajasthan, was picked up from his home in Chandernagore in Hooghly district.        
	Sleuths said he was hand in glove with two men, who opened the bank account for the trader by submitting forged documents.        
	Ghoshs act came to light when police started probing a complaint lodged by Behala resident Sachin Sharma, who had recently received a letter from the bank thanking his long-dead father Raj Kishore for opening an account.        
	Kishan Loharuka, the trader who had allegedly got the account opened in Raj Kishores name, and two of his associates  Dipak Sau and Jayprakash Singh  were arrested last week.        
	We found during the probe that a Himachal Pradesh-based company had deposited a cheque for Rs 1.2 lakh in the Bank of Rajasthan account. The money was later transferred to Loharukas account in the Hare Street branch of Union Bank, said an officer of the detective department.        
	Sleuths said Loharuka could get the account opened because Ghosh did not conduct the mandatory verifications.        
	According to rules, a bank would agree to open an account only if an existing account holder certifies the applicant. The person certifying the applicant must mention his account number in the application form. Sau claimed he had an account in the Posta branch and certified the application in Raj Kishores name. He mentioned a fake number in the form. Ghosh approved the application, suppressing the fact that Sau did not have an account with the bank, said Damayanti Sen, joint commissioner of police (crime).        
	The police claimed they had been suspicious of Ghoshs role since starting the probe.        
	All the documents submitted by Sau, including the PAN card and voters identity card, were false. Ghosh failed to give any satisfactory reply when we asked him why he approved Saus statement, said an officer investigating the case.        
	Singh, the officer said, had helped Sau arrange the forged papers.        
	Six arrested: Six Bangladeshi nationals have been arrested from a rented house in Thakurpukur for allegedly duping two men of Rs 2 lakh. Over Rs 1 lakh was found on the arrested men.

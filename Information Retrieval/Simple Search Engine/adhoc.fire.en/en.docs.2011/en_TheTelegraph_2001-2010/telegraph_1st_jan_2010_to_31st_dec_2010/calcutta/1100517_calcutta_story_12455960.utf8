The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cannes rises for a rare ruin restored   Cannes claps for comeback
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cannes rises for a rare ruin restored     - Khandahar maker returns to second home          AMIT ROY IN CANNES                          Mrinal Sen at Cannes on Saturday night. (Amit Roy)                                        
	Mrinal Sen murmured apologetically, I am nobody here, but the appreciative cinema audience in Cannes, which can distinguish an enduring classic from one that is merely very good, did not agree.         
	To shouts of Bravo, bravo, the audience in the Salle Bunuel rose last night to applaud Sen after watching a restored version of his film Khandahar (The Ruins), which was screened in the section of the festival known as Cannes Classics.        
	It was a homecoming both for the film, which was first shown in 1984 in the Un Certain Regard category kept for different and original works, and the director himself. I have been (here in Cannes) so many times, Sen told The Telegraph later. Up to a certain point in time Cannes was my second home.        
	He had only one regret. I feel very sad that my wife (Gita Sen) could not come  she is weak, he said. She played the mother (in Khandahar).        
	After a tortuous journey from Calcutta and a missed connection in Frankfurt, Sen arrived in Cannes late on Friday on what was his 87th birthday. He was joined by his US-based son, Kunal, and daughter-in-law, Nisha. Reports of Sens poor health appear to be greatly exaggerated or perhaps he was buoyed by the warm glow of audience goodwill that swept over him.        
	 To prolonged applause he was introduced to the audience by one of the key figures in the festival, Thierry Frmaux, the director general who pretty much decides what is shown at Cannes. Khandahar could not be shown last year as both Sen and the print were in poor condition.        
	On Saturday night as Sen entered the Salle Bunuel, accompanied by Kunal, he blinked in surprise at the size of the audience waiting expectantly for him and admitted: I never expected such a large crowd to see my film.        
	He said he had forgotten about Khandahar, which is set in the ruins of a palace and has a cast that includes Shabana Azmi and Naseeruddin Shah. Sen announced he would watch the film with the audience because he had personally not seen the restored version. It has been restored as part of the National Film Archive of Indias initiative for digital restoration and content processing of over 1,000 classic films.        
	I am grateful to the government, the money backers, who have kept it alive, he told the audience. The film was dying its normal death. The delicate mission was undertaken by a team at Reliance MediaWorks. Sens judgment on the finished product was: Very, very good.         
	Many commented on the sharpness of the images, the richness of colour and the quality of the sound. Only one person thought that in a few places the colour might have been a trifle overdone.                                
	Sen was also delighted with the sound. The song part is very good. I am all praise for the people who have redone this film.        
	During the screening perhaps a dozen people cut class and crept out under cover of darkness but hundreds stayed the distance.        
	One of Sens friends from Germany, Donat Ulrich, joined the fan club after the screening. We always to come to Cannes to see films, (but) this is a particular occasion, so great, so wonderful, he enthused. It is very, very moving. I have been friends with Mrinal over many, many years, decades. We have shown his films (in Berlin), distributed his films, we have shown retrospectives and we have met him personally in Europe and in Calcutta. We drove with him to his shooting place by car. It was the most wonderful experience. The whole of life, the whole of Indian cinema is impersonated (represented) in him.        
	Turning to Sen, he added: We still have some of your prints in Berlin. So many memories.        
	Sen confirmed that Khandahar, with its haunting locations, was shot 20km from Santiniketan at Lord Sinhas ancestral palace at Raipur.        
	I dont go there now.when I saw the film (tonight) and saw the place, I was deeply moved, he confessed.        
	He had been inspired by a story though the idea to adapt it into a movie had taken time to form. It was the original writer (who must be given credit). He was a poet. I read the story about 20 times but never realised that a film could be made out of it.        
	But one night, in the middle of the night, I just woke up and couldnt sleep. I started reading the same story once again and I dont know how it happened. I could see the film in between the lines and above the lines and under the lines.        
	And then I saw this place (near Santiniketan) and both (the story and the location) came together. But I am not going to talk about how I made the film. I am talking about how it has been remade....

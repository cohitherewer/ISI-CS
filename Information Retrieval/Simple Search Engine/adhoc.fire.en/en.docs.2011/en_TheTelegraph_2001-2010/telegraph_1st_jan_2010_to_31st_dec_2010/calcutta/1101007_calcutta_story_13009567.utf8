The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rap for visa malpractice
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rap for visa malpractice
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The German consulate office, the sole European mission issuing Schengen visas in Calcutta, has appealed to the citys travel trade to bring in greater transparency in information sharing and weed out malpractice.        
	Since we are swamped with applications and must handle up to 100 cases a day in peak season, we are hard-pressed for time. Erroneous information, accidental or deliberate, might escape scrutiny and the traveller might land in trouble with the border police, Andrea Fischboeck, the vice-consul in the citys German consulate, cautioned travel agents.        
	Fischboeck was addressing eastern region members of the Travel Agents Federation of India (Tafi) on Schengen visa procedure.        
	We appreciate all the meticulous paperwork the travel agents do for their clients to make our visa offices work much easier most of the time. However, we have also handled cases where the agent had forged the clients signature, and this is a criminal offence, which forced us to scratch the agents name from our roster, the diplomat added.        
	Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Tafi, rued that some unscrupulous elements had been conspiring to undo the good work being put in by the organised travel trade in town.        
	We are sending out mails to all our 90-odd members in eastern India, stressing the need for good practices to keep our bridges strong with diplomatic missions.        
	A Schengen visa allows the holder to travel freely within the 25 Schengen zone member states. While the German consulate remains the main window in town where one can apply for a Schengen visa now, the Italian mission is also issuing visas in some cases. The French consulate will start visa procedures by the year-end.

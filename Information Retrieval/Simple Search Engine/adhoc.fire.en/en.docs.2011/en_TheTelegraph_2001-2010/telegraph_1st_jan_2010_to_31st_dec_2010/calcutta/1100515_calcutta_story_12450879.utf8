	The state election commission has lodged a police complaint accusing Avijit Ghoshal, the Trinamul Congress candidate in ward 18 of Bidhannagar Municipality, of suppressing information while filling up the nomination form.         
	According to the complaint filed with Bidhannagar South police station on Thursday night, Ghoshals name is on the voters list of ward 57 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation but while filling up the nomination form, he had only mentioned that his name was on the voters list of ward 18 of Bidhannagar Municipality.        
	The complaint does not bar Ghoshal from contesting the election, said an officer.        
	The police were not able to contact Ghoshal till late on Friday.        
	The candidates cellphone was switched off.

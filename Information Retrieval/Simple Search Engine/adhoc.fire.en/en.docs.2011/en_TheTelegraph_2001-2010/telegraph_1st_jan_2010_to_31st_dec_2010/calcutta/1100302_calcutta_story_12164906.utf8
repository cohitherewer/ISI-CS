The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City footballers to train in France 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City footballers to train in France

	This July, a group of youths from Calcutta would be flying to France to be trained as players and coaches in a facility used by Olympique Lyon, one of Frances top football clubs which beat Real Madrid just a fortnight ago.        
	The dream tour would be the result of a sports exchange programme between Sport dans la Ville (SDLV) of France and Tomorrows Foundation, a city NGO. Both organisations work with underprivileged children.        
	We want to launch an exchange programme whereby kids from Calcutta can go to France and get training, said Pierre Emonot, operational director of SDLV, in Calcutta.         
	Emonot was in India for 14 days with eight young footballers. With football, we work on the behaviour of kids. In France that is a huge problem, said Solenne Roland, SDLFs Delhi-based member.         
	The programme was founded in 1998 with the goal of using sports as a means of encouraging youngsters living in difficult neighbourhoods to stay away from trouble and learn the values of social integration. There is a ghetto mentality at work. They dont speak to people outside their district. Through football, they learn to trust others, Roland explained.        
	The trip to India was a reward for youngsters with the programme who had been the most disciplined. Nassim Zidane, Zinedine Zidanes Algerian compatriot who turns out for a third division Swiss club, was the star of the squad.         
	Watching him take the field at Jadavpur Stadium with the others versus a local club was a fatigued Mohamed Bouchentouf, 19. SDLV gave me the chance to meet Juninho, Rai, Anderson and Dhorasoo. (Zinedine) Zidane came to one of our programmes, he recalled. But he was more excited about the Calcutta trip, especially a boat trip on the Hooghly and My Name is Khan.         
	It was hard without translation but we will see the film again if it releases in France, he said. The top footballing moment was beating a village team in Howrah 4-0 in front of a thousand-strong crowd. The crowd made them feel like professionals, laughed Roland.        
	Just as excited was host team captain player Arindam Datta. His father drives an auto and he plays for Kalighat Byayam Samity. Though the 1-4 loss brought on the blushes, he gushed about the benefits of training with French players over a week.         
	We want to make the exchange an annual affair, said Arpan Bhattacharya of Tomorrows Foundation.

										      Dear Mother : Derek O rsquo;Brien                                    
	Dear Mother,        
	Where should I start? Father Bouche and 1976? Or the book of pictures in 1992 where you wrote the captions? Or the time you gently chided me... na, Mother, lets not get so nostalgic about you. You live in the present. So much so that the sign at the door of Mother House still reads Mother Teresa IN.        
	So Mother, lets begin by thanking you for a really super 100th birthday party last Thursday.        
	I dont know if you spotted me, but I got in early  never been to church 45 minutes before Mass starts (but then, Mother, you have this magical effect even on backbenchers).        
	Will treasure the memento with your picture which each of us got on our way in. I tried to sneak a second one for my daughter Aanya (lazy girl, did not want to get up so early) but the nuns were sharp. No luck.        
	Sister Lyn was sweet enough to take me to the first floor. Must confess, I was pleasantly surprised with the Mass being beamed live to those on the other two floors. Really cool.        
	Did you come up with that funky idea? Or was that one from Sister Prema? I know what you are going to say. Neither, right? It was the good Lord on the top floor at work! Mother, youll never change.        
	The choir gave me goosebumps. I once asked in a quiz what your favourite hymn was  Make me a channel of your peace. On your birthday morning I heard the Bangla version for the first time  Amay tomar shantir doot koro. The blue and white balloons, the white doves, the story by Cardinal Toppo in his sermon about asking you for an autograph...oh and the breakfast too! Caring through sharing.        
	You know, Mother, just after the ceremony, when I was on the staircase outside the chapel I saw something really special. One of the senior priests went up to Sisters Prema and Nirmala and wished them Happy Birthday. Just so beautiful.        
	I missed all the fun on the tram ride. Later in the afternoon though I had the privilege and honour of being the tour guide when the sisters boarded the new mobile train exhibition.        
	Truthfully, I think I was a terrible guide. Simply because all the sisters knew more about your life and work than I did. There was a lovely picture of you and Sister Nirmala in Rome. She told us all about it and suddenly the tour guide became the sishya.        
	The kids from Sishu Bhavan then charmed us on stage and the teenagers from Shanti Dan depicted your life through dance form.        
	Are we leaving something out here? Yes. At the end of a long, memorable day the nuns headed back. Tired. I drove back home too; had a glass of beer and went straight to bed. But every single sister from your Missionaries of Charity would have done what you taught them to do every single day of their lives. Spend an hour in silent adoration. Makes me feel so small Mother.         
	Pray for me. Promise?              
	Q: What do the residents of Gandhiji Prem Nivas Leprosy Centre at Titagarh do for the Missionaries of Charity?

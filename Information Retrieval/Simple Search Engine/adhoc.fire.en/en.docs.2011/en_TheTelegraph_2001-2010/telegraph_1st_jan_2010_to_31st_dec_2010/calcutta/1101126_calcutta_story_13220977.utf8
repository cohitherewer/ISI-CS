										      SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI      Friday: Rally by pro-Left farmers 
                        Gitali Chakraborty, who came from Burdwan                                 
	Gitali Chakraborty, 45, left her Burdwan home at 6am on Thursday to take a train to Howrah. Next, a ferry to Babughat and then a bus to Esplanade. It took Gitali six hours to reach her destination  Day II of the Left Fronts weeklong reach-out rallies, dubbed Mahila Diwas.         
	At the same venue was 25-year-old Beckbagan girl Firdous Minar, in a pretty salwar suit with net sleeves. She had taken 40 minutes to reach the choked rally zone.         
	The two women, leading different lives, had one thing in common  great expectations of their leaders.         
	I teach underprivileged children under a government scheme, said Gitali, a member of the Paschimbanga Mahila Samiti for 12 years.         
	I am hoping they will announce a salary hike along with permanent status for anganwadi workers, she added.        
	For Firdous, a student of history, just being at the rally meant empowerment. I want an identity of my own. I would also like to know what jobs are in store for me after I graduate and whether women would ever be safe on the road. I was harassed even today, she said.         
	So was Firdous convinced her concerns would be addressed? Her silence was defeaning even as screams of Inquilab Zindabad reverberated over loudspeakers.         
	The rally proved Gitali and Firdous share something else, too  a glaring gap between their expectations and delivery from their leaders.         
	Gitalis concern  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)  did find mention, but all she learnt was about the gangrape and murder of an ICDS worker by 21 alleged Trinamul men. Eta shune amader ma-bonera gorje uthoon ei Maobadi-Trinamul jallad bahinir biruddhe (Our mothers and sisters must roar in protest against the Maoist-Trinamul killer army), screamed a lady on the dais.         
	The women below were busy with another kind of an army  of hawkers selling fruits, patties, cake, sonpapri, jhalmuri, fritters and chips.                       Firdous Minar, who came from Beckbagan				     
	Sheila Kapoor, the CPM councillor of ward 46, summed up the day. This is a political rally. The women are repeating what the men said yesterday.         
	 After the rally, Gitali was to travel another six hours to reach Burdwan while Firdous needed to brave the usual lecherous comments and looks on the way back home.Thursday didnt change anything for either of them.         
	If the Left rally for women did make a difference, it was by increasing their tolerance of disruption  of being stuck in buses and trams while bringing kids back from school, of being forced to walk the entire Esplanade stretch because taxis wouldnt go there, of being delayed for meetings, of missing appointments with doctors or just a day out with friends under the warm November sun.

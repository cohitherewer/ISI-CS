	An undergraduate student who was staying at Jadavpur Universitys main hostel without taking permission from the authorities drowned in a pond in the compound early on Tuesday.        
	A group of boarders was with Zoramthara  who was not a student of the university  when he drowned on the Prince Anwar Shah Road premises around 4am on Tuesday. Some of them alerted the night guard when they saw him struggling in the water.        
	Unable to trace Zoramthara, the guard woke up hostel officials, who telephoned the police. After the cops, too, failed to locate the body, we sought the help of the fire services department. Divers pulled the body out around 7.15am, said a hostel official.        
	Guests of boarders are allowed to stay in the hostel for a day or two after taking permission from the authorities. None of the boarders had approached the authorities so that Zoramthara could spend Monday night in the hostel, added the official.        
	Some boarders claimed that the youth was sharing a room with a third-year electrical engineering student who hailed from Mizoram.        
	The third-year student left the hostel on Tuesday afternoon without informing us. His sudden disappearance has triggered suspicion that there could have been foul play behind the drowning, said a teacher of the university.        
	JU registrar Pradip Kumar Ghosh told Metro that the incident would be probed.        
	The university has lodged an FIR with Jadavpur police station. We will also start our own inquiry on Wednesday to find out how the boy entered the campus and how he drowned, said Ghosh.         
	After preliminary investigation, the police said that it appeared to be a case of accidental drowning.         
	There was a bucket with fishing equipment on the edge of the pond. It seems that he was fishing in the pond, said an investigator.         
	Even if Zoramthara had gone to the pond to fish, why did he have to wade deep into the water. We need to find answers to these questions, said the JU official.        
	Some students alleged that the divers took a long time to reach the hostel.        
	The body was handed over to an official of the Mizoram government. It was not possible to get in touch with the boys family members, a police officer said.

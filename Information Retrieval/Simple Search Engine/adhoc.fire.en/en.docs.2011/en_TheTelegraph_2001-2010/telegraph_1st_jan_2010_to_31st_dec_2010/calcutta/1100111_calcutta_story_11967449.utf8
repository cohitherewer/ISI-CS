                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Four in net for woman murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four persons were arrested on Sunday afternoon on the charge of killing 41-year-old Mina Dutta at her home in Howrahs Jagachha late on Tuesday.        
	Soma Das, 22, Reyaz Ali Mullick, 30, Sathi Nandi, 16, and Sanjay Das, 26, were picked up from Esplanade while they were trying to board a bus for Digha. It was a planned murder. The quartet strangulated Dutta before hitting her on the head with a bonti, said an officer of Jagachha police station.        
	Dutta, a widow, was found lying dead on her bed by son Abhijit when he returned home from work around 5.30am on Wednesday. Abhijit, 24, works as a guard at a Salt Lake institute.        
	The police said Dutta used to fix clients for Soma and Sathi, both residents of Sinthee. Reyaz and Sanjay, who live in Uluberia, were the duos clients for the past year, said an officer probing the case.        
	The relationship between Dutta and Soma soured of late over money. She and Sathi felt Dutta was not paying them their dues. So they decided to teach her a lesson and approached Reyaz and Sanjay to kill her, the officer added.        
	On Tuesday evening, the four went to Duttas home with food and liquor. The woman did not suspect their motive and drank with them.        
	A little past midnight Soma hit Dutta on her head with a bonti. As the woman slumped, Reyaz and Sanjay strangulated her with a wire, the officer said.        
	The accused reportedly kept drinking till 4am, after which they left the house with the cash and jewellery they stole from the almirah in Duttas room.

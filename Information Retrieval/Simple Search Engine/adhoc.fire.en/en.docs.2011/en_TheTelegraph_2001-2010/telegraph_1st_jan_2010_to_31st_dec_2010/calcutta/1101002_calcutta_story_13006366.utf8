	Uttarakhand has called off the search for three missing trekkers from Howrah.        
	N.P. Rao, Anal Das, and Arun Adak  missing for over 16 days in the flood-ravaged Uttarakhand  were part of an eight-member team that went trekking on the Gangotri-Kalindi-Badrinath route.        
	We called off the search on Thursday, said Piyush Rautela, the managing director of the disaster management board of Uttarakhand. Bengal chief secretary Samar Ghosh said: Uttarakhand had decided to stop the search earlier but they conducted another search following our request. Now its up to them to decide whether the operation will continue.

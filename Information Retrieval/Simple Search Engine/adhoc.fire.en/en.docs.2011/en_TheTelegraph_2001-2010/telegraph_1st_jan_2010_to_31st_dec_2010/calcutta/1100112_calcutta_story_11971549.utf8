          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Subrata Roy, alias Anil, the 24-year-old alleged kingpin of an inter-state car theft racket operating in and around the city for the past couple of years, was arrested at a Sonarpur hideout on Sunday. Raids are on to trace his six associates, said police.        
	Anil and his gang used to sell cars and motorcycles stolen from Calcutta in neighbouring states like Bihar, Orissa and Jharkhand. The vehicles were later smuggled to Nepal, said the officer.        
	Officers of Karaya police station found out about the gang while investigating the theft of a Tata Sumo and a motorcycle last month.         
	Anil told us that the gang mainly targeted Tata Sumos. The members used to get into cars parked in the open using a master key, added the officer.         
	The detective department busted another car theft racket last week.

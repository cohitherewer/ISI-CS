	Police, relatives and colleagues are clueless about the motive for the murder of bank manager Pulak Chakraborty, who was shot dead a few yards from his home in Sodepur on Monday evening.        
	We have been living here for 16 years and never had any enmity with anyone, said Pulaks son Pratyay, a Class XI student of St Xaviers Institution in Panihati.        
	The 50-year-old manager of the Shantipur branch of Allahabad Bank was walking home after getting off a train at Sodepur station when he was shot, presumably from behind. A police officer said the bullet went through his body, piercing a lung.        
	We are gathering information about his personal and professional lives in an attempt to identify the motive for the murder, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	Police sources said they were trying to find out whether Chakrabortys murder was the fallout of any dispute over disbursement of bank loans.         
	Chakraborty had been the manager at the Shantipur branch in Nadia, about 80km from his home, since January 2008. He used to travel by local train to work and back.        
	He was friendly and never had any problem with our customers, said Sirish Chandra Sarkar, Chakrabortys deputy at the branch.        
	The two used to take the same train home. On Monday, too, they were together till Chakraborty got off at Sodepur. He shared his problems with us but never told us about any dispute, said another colleague.        
	Chakrabortys neighbours in the Mandela Park area of Sodepur were terrified. I heard a noise and came running with many others. We found Chakraborty lying on the edge of an open drain, said a youth. The spot where the body was found was barely a two-minute walk from the managers home, where he lived with his wife and son.        
	Another neighbour said the killers must have been aware of Chakrabortys movements. They knew that he always took a short-cut to his house through the railway tracks instead of walking down the road.        
	Pulaks wife Kaberi is inconsolable, said a relative.

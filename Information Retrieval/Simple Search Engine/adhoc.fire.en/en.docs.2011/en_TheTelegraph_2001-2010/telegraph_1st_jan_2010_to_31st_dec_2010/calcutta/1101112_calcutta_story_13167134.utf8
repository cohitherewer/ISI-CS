The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Call for clean fuel revival
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Call for clean fuel revival
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The two major bio-diesel manufacturing units in the state are on the verge of closing down as demand for the clean fuel had dried up after the Centre barred its marketing last year, said stake-holders and experts at a seminar in the city on Thursday.         
	The high court had later stayed the central directive but the demand for the fuel did not take off. The participants at the seminar called for promotion of bio-diesel to improve air quality.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Airport flu check to stop
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Airport flu check to stop
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Swine flu screening is likely to be stopped at the Calcutta airport from this month, officials said on Friday.         
	The technical committee on swine flu of the Union health ministry will meet next week and decide on stopping the screening at the Calcutta airport. The panel will take inputs from the state health department. In all likelihood, the tests will be stopped from the end of the month, said a senior health ministry official.        
	In most airports across India, including the ones in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, swine flu screenings have been stopped since no significant case has been reported over the past two months, he said.        
	With fliers from abroad arriving at Calcutta complaining about unnecessary delays because of the screening process, the airport authorities on Friday wrote to the state health department seeking a review of the procedure. A number of passengers have verbally complained about the delay because of the screening. So we have asked the health department to review the system, said airport director R. Srinivasan.        
	In the last review meeting of the technical committee in December, the state health department had insisted that the screening process should continue. The last confirmed swine flu case was detected in Calcutta on December 29.

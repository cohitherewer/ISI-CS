	Pool car operators blocked Kona Expressway on Thursday afternoon and forcibly drove away two vehicles seized by the Road Transport Authority (RTA) for plying without permits. The operators made home-bound schoolchildren wait for over an hour while the blockade continued.         
	Police said five RTA officials seized two pool cars near St Johns Diocesan School and were taking them to Dhulagarh in Howrah via Vidyasagar Setu. Around 3pm, nearly 20 pool cars packed with students blocked their way on Kona Expressway.         
	The blockade was lifted after 30 minutes, but the operators gheraoed the RTA officials for another half an hour. Tired and hungry students were spotted crying inside the cars.         
	Tamal Das, the assistant road transport officer, Calcutta, said: Policemen just stood and watched the pool car operators heckle us .        
	Abir Roy, the secretary of the Pool Car Owners Welfare Association, said the transport minister had assured them that no action would be taken against pool cars till January 31.

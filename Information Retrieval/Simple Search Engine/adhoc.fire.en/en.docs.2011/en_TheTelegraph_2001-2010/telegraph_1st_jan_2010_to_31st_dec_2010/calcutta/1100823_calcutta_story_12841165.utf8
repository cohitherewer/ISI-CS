The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | There to frisk, not play spot-the-star
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      There to frisk, not play spot-the-star
          OUR BUREAU                                        
	Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishras starry tantrums on being stopped for a security check at a Bypass hospitality address this weekend have shocked star hotel regulars who willingly face frisking despite being familiar faces at these spots.        
	The rule of the land is the same for everyone and there is no reason why I should be checked at the gate and a VIP exempted from it. After all, if something happens both of us will die, declared 27-year-old Mukul Mall, who works out at the Hyatt gym five days a week and happily undergoes a routine check by security personnel during each visit.        
	Officials of hospitality addresses in town said post-26/11 most guests, including celebrities, understand that security personnel manning the gates are supposed to make the hotel premises as secure as possible rather than play spot-the-star.         
	Our team has been trained to communicate to all guests the importance of security procedures, said a spokesperson for ITC The Sonar Calcutta.        
	But what does a hotel do when someone like Mishra turns up with a dont-you-dare-frisk-me air about him?        
	In the rare event of any of our VIP guests refusing to go through a public security check, we request him or her to co-operate with us and undergo frisking with a hand-held metal detector in private, Uttam Chakraborty, security manager at the newly opened Swissotel in City Centre 2 , told Metro.        
	Minister Mishra was at Hyatt Regency for a meeting with his central counterpart Ghulam Nabi Azad on Saturday when he threw a fit on being stopped for frisking. He called officials, who summoned the police to secure an apology. The government even ordered an inquiry.        
	Chakraborty of Swissotel said every star address had a VIP list but that didnt mean anyone on it shouldnt be frisked. Only when the government intimates us about the arrival of a Z-category guest and gives the necessary clearance do we make a departure from the drill, he added.        
	Percussionist Bickram Ghosh agreed that everyone should be treated equally but called for good behaviour from the guards, who would be expected to show some respect.        
	In Mumbai, star hotels do not frisk X,Y and Z-category VIPs as the police plan their visits in advance. But the city of celebrities generally seems to have taken the security drill since the 2008 terror attacks well. General awareness about the need for security procedures and compliance is much better now, said an official of the Taj Palace Hotel, which bore the brunt of 26/11.         
	He revealed that last year, the then minister of state for external affairs Shashi Tharoor patiently waited to be frisked before entering the hotel to meet the visiting Israeli ambassador.        
	In the case of some celebrities, say Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan or Salman Khan, the frisking is done in a separate area to avoid crowd chaos. Their baggage, though, has to go through the mandatory screening machine.

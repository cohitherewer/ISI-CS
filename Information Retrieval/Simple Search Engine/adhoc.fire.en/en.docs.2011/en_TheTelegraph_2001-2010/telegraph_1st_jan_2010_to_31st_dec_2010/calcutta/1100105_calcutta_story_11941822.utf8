The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HC time extended
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HC time extended
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Monday extended its working time by 15 minutes a day in an attempt to clear the backlog of cases.        
	The court will now sit from 10.30am to 4.30pm, with half an hour recess from 1pm, said a court official. Earlier, the proceedings would end at 4.15pm.        
	An official in the state law department said around 3.5 lakh cases were pending in the high court. Across the country, 3.2 crore cases were pending till December 2007. Experts said the figure has risen by five per cent since.        
	The apex court has advised all high courts to hear cases on Saturdays. But Calcutta High Court instead extended the working time by 15 minutes a day, said a source.         
	A litigant said: The apex court advice would have yielded an additional two-and-a-half hours of working time a week. The high court move would result in only one hour and 15 minutes of extra time a week.

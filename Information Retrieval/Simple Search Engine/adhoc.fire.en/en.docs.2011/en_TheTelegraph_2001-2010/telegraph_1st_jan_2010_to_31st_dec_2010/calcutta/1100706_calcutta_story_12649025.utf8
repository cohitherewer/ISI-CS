The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mamata drives Metro 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mamata drives Metro 
  - All 213 trains run on a day nothing else moves in town          A STAFF REPORTER                          An almost empty Metro train on Monday. (Rashbehari Das)                                        
	Mamata Banerjee kept Calcuttas transport lifeline on track even as life in a metro ran out of fuel on the first working day of the week.        
	With the railway minister monitoring services from her Kalighat home, almost the entire Metro workforce reported for duty as usual and took extra care to maintain normal operations, sources said.        
	We ran all 213 scheduled trains at a frequency of six, eight or 10 minutes, depending on the time of day. There were few passengers in the morning but we decided to continue running the trains, a spokesperson said.        
	Many Metro employees from the suburbs spent Sunday night at Howrah and Sealdah stations so that they could attend duty on bandh day. Tapas Mukherjee, the general secretary of the Trinamul-backed Metro Railway Workers Congress, said car pick-ups were arranged for them.        
	Ninety per cent of officials and most of the 119 motormen and other technical staff reported for duty, some of them forced to walk long distances. I trudged from Howrah to the Park Street station as there was no transport, said panel operator Gautam Bhowmick.        
	 A Group D employee walked from his Kudghat home to Tollygunge station, almost 4km away. Our union asked us to report for duty without fail, he said.        
	The uninterrupted Metro connectivity came as a pleasant surprise for those desperately looking for transport. Polish tourist Olek Rasek, 27, and fiance Agnes Komasensta were worrying about how to reach the airport to catch a flight to Kuala Lumpur when they learnt that Metro services were on. At least we wont have to walk all the way to the airport now, said Rasek, boarding a train at Park Street station.        
	Till 6pm, the Metro passenger count was around 28,000, against 3.5 lakh on a normal working day.

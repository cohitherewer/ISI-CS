                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Shut order on garden cafe

	The state environment department has ordered police to close down the Shibpur botanical garden cafeteria that had hosted a wedding reception on January 24.        
	Food was illegally cooked in the open for the party, organised by a Howrah trader with political connections, and the invitees ate and littered on the greens. Metro found garbage and plastic items strewn on the grass after the party despite the garden being a no-plastic zone.         
	The departments chief law officer Biswajit Mukherjee passed the interim order on Friday at a hearing attended by senior officials of the garden and representatives of the cafeteria.         
	We have directed Shibpur police station to immediately shut down the cafeteria for violating the plastic ban. The cafeteria owner has been asked to submit in writing why he should not be punished further for the violation, Mukherjee told Metro on Sunday.        
	Environment activist Subhash Dutta alleged a cover-up. The garden authorities could not have been unaware of the violation. Vehicles and guests were allowed inside without tickets. Why havent the garden authorities taken action against employees for allowing the programme? he asked.        
	The cafeteria owner said he was being made a scapegoat.        
	The department asked the garden authorities to submit in writing the action taken against the cafeteria for the violation and the steps taken to stop entry of plastic items in the garden.         
	Officials of the garden said the cafeteria owner had been showcaused for the violation and his contract would be terminated.

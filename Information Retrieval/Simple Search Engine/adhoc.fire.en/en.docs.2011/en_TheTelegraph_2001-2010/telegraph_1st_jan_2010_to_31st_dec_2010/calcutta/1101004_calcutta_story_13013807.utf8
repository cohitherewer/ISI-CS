	The monsoon may be on its way out despite cloudy skies and a sprinkling of rain cooling the city after a day and a half of dry heat.        
	The hot weather throughout Saturday and Sunday morning was apparently the result of low incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal, which the weatherman sees as a sign of the monsoon drawing to a close.        
	 We are now in the transitional phase. The monsoon has started withdrawing from north India. The wind flow patterns are changing as well, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	Weather scientists, however, said it was still early to say for certain that rain wouldnt play spoilsport this Puja. It cannot be said with certainty as of now. We need to wait for a few more days to be able to say if the monsoon will stay long enough to cause rain during the festival (still 10 days away), said a scientist of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida.        
	Sundays shower was caused by a cyclonic circulation over the Bangladesh coast, adjoining Gangetic Bengal. The higher moisture content in the air aided the formation of thunderclouds over the city and its neighbourhood. The weather over the next couple of days is likely to remain more or less the same, said an official of the India Meteorological Department.         
	The monsoon had arrived on June 13 this year, a little later than usual, and remained weak until a late surge in September saw the rain count shooting up.         
	The deficit of July and August was partially compensated in September. The city received 378.92mm of rain  the average is 295.9mm  over 20 rainy days. September usually has an average of 13.4 rainy days.        
	The monsoon had departed from the city on October 20 last year, 13 days behind schedule.

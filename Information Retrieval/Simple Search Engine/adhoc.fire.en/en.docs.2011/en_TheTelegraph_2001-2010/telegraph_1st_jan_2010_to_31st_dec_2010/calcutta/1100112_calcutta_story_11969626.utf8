                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Delay in CU law exam
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University has not finalised changes in the Llb course, as asked by the Bar Council of India, even a month after the first semester exam under the new rules was due.         
	Nearly 1,000 first-year Llb students in seven colleges affiliated to the university and its own law department are awaiting their first semester examination, which was supposed to have been held in December.         
	The bar council had last year directed all law teaching institutions across India to replace the annual exams with semester ones from the 2009-10 session.        
	CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said he would look into the matter.        
	According to a source, the universitys board of studies in law had revised the syllabus and examination rules, on the lines of the bar council guideline, in October. The draft was approved by the faculty council of law in November.        
	The faculty councils decision needs to be ratified by the universitys syndicate. We do not know why the authorities are reluctant to place the revised syllabus and exam rules before the syndicate, said a law teacher in the university.        
	A senior CU official alleged that the authorities were reluctant to approach the syndicate because of loopholes in the councils suggestions.

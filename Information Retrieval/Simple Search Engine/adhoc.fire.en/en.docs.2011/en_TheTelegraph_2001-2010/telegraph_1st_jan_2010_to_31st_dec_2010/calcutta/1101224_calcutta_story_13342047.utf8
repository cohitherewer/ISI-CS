                Governor M.K. Narayanan had to wait for around 10 minutes before the gate of Calcutta airports ceremonial lounge was opened to him on Wednesday afternoon. VIPs with Z-category security like the President, Prime Minister, governors and the chief ministers are entitled to wait in the ceremonial lounge on the ground floor, adjacent to the international terminal. Though the airport authorities had been informed that the governor would take a flight to Chennai from the city, the lounge was not opened till officials accompanying Narayanan complained to the manager of the international terminal, said Raj Bhavan sources. Nothing of this has been reported to me, said airport director R. Srinivas.    Five men have been arrested in the city since Wednesday night for allegedly possessing drugs and banned narcotics. Asim Baidya, in his mid-30s, was arrested from the premises of a Bongaon hospital on Wednesday night. About 1.25kg of heroin, worth Rs 1.25 crore, was seized from him.

Sushil Ghosh, 50, was found dead on his bed in his Govindapur Road home in the Lake police station area on Thursday morning. Preliminary probe suggests he had been hit with a sharp weapon. Ghoshs wife Pratibha, 40, could not be found.

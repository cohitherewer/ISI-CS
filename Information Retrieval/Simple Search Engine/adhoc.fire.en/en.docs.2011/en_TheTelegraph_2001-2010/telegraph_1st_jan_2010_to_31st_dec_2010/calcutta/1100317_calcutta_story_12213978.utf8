The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teachers on protest path
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Teachers on protest path

	The state governments move to regularise the service of part-time college teachers has raised hackles of the 5,000-odd part-timers who fear losing their job once the new system is implemented.        
	Around 100 such teachers organised a protest by selling vegetables and tea in front of Bikash Bhavan, which houses the higher education department, from 1pm to 5pm on Tuesday.         
	We protest the dismissal of teachers, said Ilora Biswas, a part-time college teacher for 19 years.        
	Higher education minister Sudarshan Raychowdhury, who met the protesters, said: The colleges will try to accommodate the teachers. I can call a meeting of the part-timers and the principals.        
	The higher education departments move follows a UGC directive asking all state governments to pay part-timers according to enhanced scales as recommended by the Sixth Pay Commission.        
	The government has revised the part-timers salaries  the figures vary between Rs 7,000 and Rs 10,000  but has also laid down guidelines in an attempt to rein in the erratic system of appointing such teachers.        
	Most part-timers fear the new conditions would make them ineligible for the job. None of the conditions was followed when we were appointed. Let alone getting enhanced salaries, most part-timers would be thrown out of job in the new regime, said Manik Bhattacharya, the advisor to the West Bengal College and University Part Time Teachers Association.        
	The government has made it mandatory for every college to get a resolution adopted by the governing body before recruiting a part-timer. The appointment has to be cleared by a committee which will include university representatives.        
	The other conditions require the part-timers to crack NET or Slet and the colleges to produce certificates from the university stating that the teachers have participated in exam duties, including evaluation of answer scripts.        
	Most existing part-timers will fail to make the cut. We will be forced to ask them to quit and appoint a new set of teachers, said the principal of a south Calcutta college.        
	Students of most colleges fear the academic activities would collapse once the part-timers are asked to leave.         
	A third-year computer science student of a city college said: There is only one whole-time teacher in our department. Most of the subjects are taught by part-timers.

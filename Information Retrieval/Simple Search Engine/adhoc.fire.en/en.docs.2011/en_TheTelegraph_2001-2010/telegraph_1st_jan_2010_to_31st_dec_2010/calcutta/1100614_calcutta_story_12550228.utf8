The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chips down for realty
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Chips down for realty
          SUBHRO SAHA                          Real estate and infrastructure projects have been hit with the supply of stone chips drying up following violence in Birbhum. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Real estate and infrastructure projects in and around Calcutta have almost come to a standstill because of an acute shortage of stone chips following a series of clashes at the main source, Pachami in Birbhum.        
	Work at most sites have slowed to a trickle and we are down to barely 10 to 15 per cent of optimum capacity, since stone chips form an integral part of construction, said Pradeep Sureka, the president of the state chapter of Credai, the realtors apex body. Even government infrastructure projects have been hit, he pointed out.        
	As there is no hint of the crisis being resolved anytime soon, city developers fear delivery deadlines will go haywire and the consumer could end up paying more.        
	Pachami, located in a tribal belt, is the fountainhead of stone chips supply to most construction sites in the city and on its fringes.        
	Our Renaissance project (an integrated 256-acre township) in Burdwan has been severely affected by this strike, said Rahul Todi, the managing director of Bengal Shrachi Housing. Shrachi Burdwan Developers Private Limited, a group company, is executing the project.        
	Rampurhat, another supply source for the material, doesnt conform to required standards, and Salbatra, a third source, has jacked up rates while functioning at a much lower capacity, complain realtors.        
	As a result, instead of the 20 trucks of supply we need every day, we are getting just about two to three vehicle-loads. Unless the issue is resolved quickly, it could snowball into a crisis just when the real estate industry is beginning to look up, said Sushil Mohta, the managing director of Merlin Projects.        
	Most of the ready-mix concrete plants are idling and all casting work has come to a halt thanks to the shortage of stone chips. Not just overheads, our interest burden on borrowings will also go up because of the delay and at some point we may fail to absorb it anymore, warned Merlins Mohta, a former Credai-Bengal secretary.        
	Around 90 stone crushing units in the Pachami belt are closed for almost two months following the violence that led to the death of three persons. The association of crusher owners has sought police help to run their units. We have narrated our problems to the district administration. We cannot run our business unless we are provided with police protection, said association chief Najir Hossain Mallik.         
	Birbhum district magistrate Saumitra Mohan said: The government had sent a team a few days ago to take stock of the situation. Directions to resolve the problem may reach soon.

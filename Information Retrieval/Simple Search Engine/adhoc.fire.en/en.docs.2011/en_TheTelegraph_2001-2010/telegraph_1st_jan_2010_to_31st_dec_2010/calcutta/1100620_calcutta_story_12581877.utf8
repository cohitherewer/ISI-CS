										      Art that enriches a city is born of its people, says Somak Ghoshal, back from a trip to Germany                         A poster in the Neuklln region of Berlin and (below) exhibits from the 48 Stunden Neuklln art festival				                                       
	Mamata Banerjees dream of turning Calcutta into London may be wishful thinking, but there are far simpler goals that the city can set itself. Ensuring basic municipal functions can make a huge difference to the quality of life in Calcutta. But being the so-called cultural capital of the country, Calcutta has many more opportunities to reinvent itself as an interesting city to live in, as well as to draw more visitors to it from far and wide.         
	A recent visit to Germany, facilitated by the Goethe Institut in association with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, revealed to me a blueprint of how community participation, without extensive funding, can enrich the character of a city and give it a significant place on the global tourist map. The Neuklln district in the city of Berlin offers a case in point. Described as the Bronx of Berlin, this is the region with the highest concentration of migrant population in the city. There is a distinct North-South divide that separates the area into two halves, each distinguished by its own idiosyncrasies but also coexisting in mutual harmony somehow.         
	In the grungy North, you find cheap apartment blocks that are not very comfortable to live in, startling graffiti on the walls, sometimes on entire faades of houses, and a bizarre mix of people, 60 per cent of whom are not German. In contrast with the more bourgeois and genteel South, this part of Neuklln has the ambience of Hanif Kureishis Brixton and reminds you of the helter-skelter atmosphere of north Calcutta. For any administrative body responsible for such a diverse area, the challenge is to maintain law and order while creating possibilities for the community to grow and come together.         
	The local authorities were quick to realise that only inclusive cultural policies can help foster social cohesion in such a plural neighbourhood. And so they came up with the idea of a Kulturnetzwerk Neuklln e.V., an organisation for cultural networking in the region that is supposed to assist the district council to evolve an integrative approach embracing the interests of a large and heterogenous community.         
	To begin with, such an endeavour must be necessarily based on a cosmopolitan outlook, devoid of intellectual snobbery. As Dorothea Kolland, the director of culture, Berlin-Neuklln, put it, It doesnt have to be Bach, Rap makes it possible, too, to learn about the dimensions of perception and creativity in ourselves. Freedom of self-expression is thus the crucial force that holds together this tremendous melting pot of 320,000 inhabitants, with people coming from as many as 165 nations from across the world. It is one of the aims of the Kulturnetzwerk Neuklln e.V. to create new platforms for interaction among this mixed bag of people.         
	Its most successful experiment so far has been the art festival, 48 Stunden Neuklln, started 11 years ago and is still organised every year over two days. From inception to execution, this is a thoroughly democratic effort. Institutions, alternative spaces, artists groups and individuals submit proposals for public projects of their choice. The ideas are, expectedly, varied  from sculpture and painting to installation and performance art.        
	The events are open to the public, and the artists, in most cases, do not have to pay any rent for the space used during the festival. There is no screening and anyone can put up any work in any place, of course within reasonable limits of decency. Sometimes local residents become part of a work of art in fascinating ways.        
	The artist, Seraphina Lenz, for instance, had once requested residents of a particular apartment block to switch on a green bulb she had installed in their flats at a certain hour one evening. The result, captured in a photograph, shows the colossal building against a dark skyline being lit up in a goblin glow.         
	Casual it may sound, but a lot of careful planning and thought goes into each years events. Although the project is organised by an underfunded non-profit organisation, the running costs are covered by the district council of Neuklln. Over the years, the growing popularity of the festival has attracted sponsors and funding bodies, enhancing the prestige of this part of Berlin and bringing in tourists and artists from all around.        
	What better way to revive urban space and earn some revenue as well? Instead of the routine beautification of Calcutta, which most often ends up looking like cosmetic surgery gone awry, the city authorities could consider a similar idea to revive the drooping spirits of this grand, old metropolis.

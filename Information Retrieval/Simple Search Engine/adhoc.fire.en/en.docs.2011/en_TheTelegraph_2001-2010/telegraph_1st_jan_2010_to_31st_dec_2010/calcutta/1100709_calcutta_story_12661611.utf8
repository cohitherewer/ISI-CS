The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Caf catches match fever
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Caf catches match fever
          POULOMI BANERJEE                          Spain supporters at Rajs Spanish Caf celebrate Puyols goal on Wednesday. Picture by Rashbehari Das                                  
	Celebration and heartbreak Rajs Spanish Caf witnessed both on Wednesday night as Spain halted Germanys onslaught in the World Cup and won its first entry into the final.        
	As the referee blew the final whistle, the Spanish fans were jumping, arms around each other, and singing Yo soy Espaniol (I am Spanish), while a a German supporter in a black kurta stormed out of the caf.        
	A Spanish flag fluttered below the screen on which the game was being played out. Owner Rajendra Pratap Pal or Raj had removed the tables and chairs and spread a sheet on the floor to accommodate more people.         
	Its fantastic. We had won the Euro Cup in 2008 by defeating the Germans, and today we defeated them again. Also, this is the first time that Spain has gone beyond the quarter-finals in the World Cup, said 26-year-old Alberto Tio, from Barcelona.        
	A handful of Germans had gathered in the caf on Sudder Street, hoping their team would finally take the Euro Cup revenge. Its ok, shrugged a disappointed Jana Bohme as the screen flashed the final scoreline: Spain: 1, Germany: 0.        
	Even before their team lost, the German supporters were mostly quiet, though confident. Subdued, perhaps, because of the loud cheering by the Spaniards.        
	When Anette, a German, predicted a 2-1 victory for her team, Alberto retorted: 3-nil. We will defeat you 3-nil. Well be kind to you, as his countrymen burst out laughing.         
	As Germany made an attempt for a goal and Spain valiantly defended it, Alberto retorted: You thought that was easy.        
	A little later, he told a German supporter: You are not doing anything else. You are defending well.         
	So are you, snapped back the German.        
	By half-time, neither team could score a goal. After the game resumed, the German supporter in the black kurta started clapping for her team vigorously. Alberto growled at her: You need permission for that here.         
	And then Spanish defender Carles Puyol got a goal and Alberto and his friends were crazy with joy. The anonymous German moaned softly, as she put her arms up to shield herself from the celebrating Germans. A picture of despair, she started speaking in low German, egging her team on.        
	As the 90 minutes got over and injury time started, she desperately demanded a goal from her team.         
	Tense, German and Spanish supporters stood up together to catch a better glimpse of the match. And then it was victory for Spain and the end of the World Cup dream for Germany.        
	The match with Germany was the real test for us. I think we will win the World Cup now, said Nacho Miro, summing up the feelings of the Spanish gang.

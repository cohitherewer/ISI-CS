The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU plans entrance tests 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CU plans entrance tests

	Calcutta University (CU) will conduct admission tests for postgraduate courses on the recommendation of an expert committee.        
	The panel, which was set up after the high court ordered the university authorities to admit 10 graduates of the autonomous St Xaviers College, submitted its recommendations to the CU syndicate on Tuesday.        
	We had agreed to introduce entrance tests for admissions to postgraduate courses in principle. Today, we decided to introduce entrance tests from this year, said CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.         
	The university would conduct tests on the nine honours subjects taught at St Xaviers College, added Das. Entrance tests would be conducted in the other subjects from next year, he added.        
	The universitys policy on admitting students from autonomous colleges had come under the high court scanner after graduates from St Xaviers College filed a case, alleging that they had been denied admission on the basis of discriminatory entry criteria.        
	The court had ordered the university to admit 10 graduates from St Xaviers College.        
	CU had set up the committee soon after to chart a roadmap for conducting tests for admission to postgraduate courses. The panels report was approved by the syndicate, the universitys highest decision making body, on Tuesday. A high-powered committee was also set up to examine the modalities of the entrance exams.         
	The committee will look into everything, from the type of questions to the weightage to be given to marks in the graduation examinations. The report will be submitted as soon as possible. The whole process has to be completed by June this year, in time for admissions, said Das.        
	The dispute over last years admissions had arisen from the normalisation of marks, a statistical process through which the CU authorities tried to achieve parity between the marks of St Xaviers students and those from affiliated colleges.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Vigil inside and outside building     Duty throws help back into hell hole
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                           Khushiram Tiwari. (Tamaghna Banerjee)                                         
	A loyal domestic help who narrowly escaped the Stephen Court blaze risked his life and sneaked back into the still smouldering building the morning after to guard his employers apartment, only to be discovered 18 hours later by workers looking for bodies.         
	The protagonist of this tale of loyalty  misplaced, some would say, because the mans employer allegedly ordered him back in  is 59-year-old Khushiram Tiwari from Bihar.        
	Khushiram, who has been working for Narendra Kumar Sahnis family for 22 years, was found in flat number 5B on the fifth floor early on Thursday struggling to sleep in the eeriness of a building that had witnessed death and destruction barely 36 hours ago.        
	It was probably around 3am. I had kept the main door ajar just in case I needed to run out of the building again. Suddenly, someone pushed the door wide open and I was blinded by the beams of a torch, Khushiram recalled on Friday.        
	The people who found him were workers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation who were passing by that block  not affected by the fire  after looking for bodies in the fire-ravaged sections. The team of workers took Khushiram to be a thief and dragged him down to the ground floor, where they handed him over to police.        
	Main chor nahin hoon, main sirf ghar ka pehra de raha tha (I am not a thief, I was only guarding the apartment), Khushiram pleaded.        
	The cops interrogated the domestic help for around half-an-hour before letting him go with a warning not to step beyond the barricades. Khushiram spent the next few hours on a Park Street footpath waiting for dawn to break so that he could find a PCO and call his employer, staying with relatives in Alipore.        
	By the time Sahni arrived, word had spread about a man being found alive in the building.         
	The retired leather goods trader denied ordering Khushiram to go into the unsafe building parts of the ravaged fifth and sixth floors did cave in on Thursday  and claimed that the police knew his domestic help was staying in the flat.        
	He has been a member of our family for two decades. It was he who volunteered to go back there because we did not even get the chance to lock our apartment when the fire broke out. He has always been very trustworthy, said Sahni, in his 60s.        
	Khushirams employer, however, wouldnt let anyone speak to him.  Hes a simpleton and is not used to so much attention. Please leave him alone, pleaded Sahni.        
	When Metro caught up with Khushiram minutes before Sahni whisked him away, the domestic help said he did fear for his life when he went back in around 9am on Wednesday. Dar lagta tha par kya karen? Maine ye sab malik ke liye kiyamera aur yahaan koi bhi nahin hain (I was afraid but what else could I do? I did this as a duty towards my employerI dont have anybody else in this city).        
	So how did he manage to go back in without the cops noticing?        
	On Wednesday morning, some workers were entering the building and I merged with them. My employer had bought me some food, which I carried to the apartment. Besides, there was some food in the fridge, said the domestic help.        
	Khushiram, who came to Calcutta from Buxar in Bihar after his wife died over two decades ago, has since been cooking for the entire Sahni family  comprising the patriarch, his two sons, daughters-in-law and a grandson  apart from doing other household chores.         
	He has a son who does not keep in touch.        
	This is the only home I know. My employers family is my family, he said.         
	A senior police officer confirmed that CMC workers found Khushiram in the 1,500sq ft flat on the fifth floor in the wee hours of Thursday.         
	Going back in was a dangerous thing to do after such a big disaster. His employer should have considered the risks before letting him go, he added.

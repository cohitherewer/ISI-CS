The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Finland eyes Bengal bond
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Finland eyes Bengal bond
          SUBHRO SAHA                          A view of the Kvarken archipelago                                  
	Finland, the home of Santa Claus and Nokia with a yen for speed on the F1 tracks and cutting-edge design, is keen to bond better with Bengal, with primary focus on tourism and cultural exchange.        
	We are aware of Calcuttas rich history and its cultural and intellectual capital, not to mention its strategic location. Its extremely critical to foster people-to-people ties, and we will first focus on boosting tourist traffic to Finland from this region, the Finnish ambassador in India, Terhi Hakala, told Metro.        
	Besides the endless days of summer, the endless nights of winter and all that snow, there are a host of attractions in Finland like sailing among thousands of islands in the Kvarken archipelago, or on one of the innumerable lakes in eastern Finland, she declared.        
	The best part is you can reach Helsinki in six hours from Delhi by our national carrier Finn Air, said Hakala, who was in town to officially present a special award from Finnish president Tarja Halonen to Satish Kapur, the honorary consul of Finland in Calcutta, in recognition of his services in promoting Finlands interest in eastern India.

	Visit Finland, the official tourism promotion agency in the Scandinavian country, has thematic tours featuring skiing, boating, hiking and music festivals. An interface with local travel-trade representatives for customised packages can easily be worked out, felt Kapur.        
	Besides being home to Formula One aces Mika Hakkinen and Kimi Raikkonen, Finland is also an important seat of contemporary architecture, which would excite Calcuttans, the diplomat felt.        
	The size of Finlands bilateral trade with India now stands at a modest Euro 1 billion. This figure should multiply manifold over the next five years, Hakala hoped.

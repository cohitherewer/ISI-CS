The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seven days on, witnesses wait for scars to heal
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Seven days on, witnesses wait for scars to heal
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          Stephen Court on Tuesday afternoon. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Traffic constable Tapas Kumar Dass mind raced back 168 hours to relive the tragedy of a lifetime in the 180 seconds that it took for the light to turn green at the Birla Planetarium signal on Tuesday afternoon.        
	A shiver ran down my spine as I looked at my watch and thought about where I was at that time seven days ago. I could no longer hear the horns blaring on the street. I could only hear the screams of people crying out for help, Das told Metro, recalling his 2.05pm moment on Tuesday, exactly a week after the Stephen Court fire tragedy.        
	Das was manning the traffic-light kiosk at the Park Street-Middleton Row intersection on March 23 along with colleague Kanai Raychowdhury when he saw the first trails of smoke billowing out of Stephen Court and sent a wireless SOS to the South Traffic Guard.        
	I saw a girl fall to her death. I also saw terror-stricken faces looking out of the windows, waving towards us for help. I couldnt do a thing to save them, rued the constable, in his forties.        
	K. Balasubramaniam, a customer support manager at Gunnebo India Ltd, stood near the main gate of Stephen Court along with five colleagues on Tuesday afternoon trying to make sense of the human tragedy that had unfolded before their eyes exactly a week ago.        
	There were around 20 of us in our second-floor office when peon Sunil Pal, who was sent to fetch lunch, came back with news of the fire. I asked my team to vacate the office before running down the stairs. I looked up after reaching the street and saw a man falling from the fifth floor, recounted Balasubramaniam.        
	The Gunnebo staff have since been coming to Park Street to try and enter the building to retrieve office files, only to end up reliving the horrors of March 23.        
	For accountant Rajiv Biswas, lunchtime on Tuesday brought back memories of a guard at the adjacent Young Womens Christian Association (YWCA) building, where he works, screaming Aagun legechhe (A fire has broken out), before all hell broke loose.        
	Park Street was buzzing, as usual. My colleague and I were having lunch just like any other day when suddenly everything turned topsy-turvy, he recalled.        
	Biswas skipped lunch on Tuesday, spending the afternoon break seated on a sofa with a colleague and rewinding to a week ago. How can one eat when so many deaths have occurred next door? Life isnt the same for us. Try as we might, its difficult to shut out the tragedy.        
	So is there anything he would have done differently if he could turn the clock back? I would try to save some lives. I regret not being able to do so that day. It is something that will haunt me forever, said Biswas.        
	What could have been is haunting Swapan Sarkar, an assistant zonal officer at the Greater Calcutta Gas Supply Corporations office near Stephen Court, as well. I was in my office when the fire broke out. As I stepped out to see the chaos all around, my blood pressure shot up alarmingly. If only the building had fire safeguards and the rescue operation was more effective, he wished.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Apex court shrugs off plea on Memorial
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Apex court shrugs off plea on Memorial
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY IN NEW DELHI                           Victoria Memorial Hall. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The Supreme Court on Monday shrugged off green activist Subhash Duttas objections to a proposed building in the Victoria Memorial compound which will house an administrative unit, a library and a cafeteria.        
	Do you have any serious objections? chief justice K.G. Balakrishnan asked Dutta after he sought to establish that the proposed structure would be harmful for the marble monument as well as the adjoining green belt.        
	The proceedings ended with the bench indicating that it would list the case for a verdict shortly.        
	Appearing for Memorial curator Chittaranjan Panda, senior lawyer Harish N. Salve quoted an expert committee report which had said the proposed structure would not encroach on the green but would replace a clutch of old, dilapidated structures.        
	Is it for the court to say that you have a new building/old building? The new structure would only be 10ft high and would remain hidden under a canopy of trees, Salve submitted. The complex is spread across 57 acres and the proposed building would stand on less than an acre, he added.        
	The lawyer wondered whether the court should interfere and stay work even when there were institutional safeguards to deal with such issues. In this context, he referred to the Memorials board of trustees and the expert committee the authorities had appointed to look into the issue.        
	Dutta, on his part, quoted a report of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute which had suggested that the entire area around the complex be preserved as a green belt to protect the monument. Buildings in the compound, experts from the institute felt, could be constructed underground.        
	The Memorial authorities, Dutta alleged, wanted the building for commercial and recreational purposes.        
	Initially, the board of trustees had agreed to construct the building outside the complex. Now they want it in the compound, Dutta said.         
	Any new structure, he added, would result in felling 200-300 trees. He also referred to huge sums of money promised by a London-based trust to build the structure. No one knows who is giving the money. The chief justice, however, scoffed at his arguments, saying: Do you have any serious objections?        
	The Memorial authorities had on February 1 moved the apex court against a Calcutta High Court order disallowing new structures in the monument compound. Any new construction, the high court had observed, would be detrimental to the monument.

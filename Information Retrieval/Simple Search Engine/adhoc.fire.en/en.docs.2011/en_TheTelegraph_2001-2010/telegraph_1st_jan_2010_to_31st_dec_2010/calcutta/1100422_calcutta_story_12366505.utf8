          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Trader Vijay Jain was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly duping a bank by declaring himself insolvent and helping others do the same.         
	Jain, the owner of a consultancy firm on Bentinck Street and a resident of Dakshindari in Lake Town, took a loan of Rs 8 lakh from a private bank for starting a business in early-2009.        
	He stopped paying equated monthly instalments (EMIs) after four months and declared himself insolvent, said an official in the anti-fraud wing of the detective department.        
	Jain is part of a racket that helped a number of businessmen default on bank loans by providing them insolvency certificates obtained fraudulently, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner (detective department).        
	Trader Anil Mahensaria was earlier arrested for allegedly duping a private bank in the same manner.        
	On Wednesday, Calcutta High Court refused to vacate its interim stay on the issue of insolvency certificates as sought by Mahensaria in a petition.         
	Mahensarias counsel argued that since the private bank from which his client had obtained the loan did not lodge a complaint against him specifically, the court should not hear the case. Justice Sanjib Banerjee turned down Mahensarias plea.        
	Acting on a petition by five private banks, the court had called for a probe into the allegation that traders had not been paying back dues after falsely declaring themselves insolvent. The registrar of insolvency was ordered not to issue any certificate till further orders. All insolvency declarations since April 1, 2008, were stayed.        
	The banks had pointed out that more than 1,400 individuals had been declared insolvent in the past three years.        
	During Wednesdays hearing, the court said it would dispose of the matter soon. The judge, after going through a report placed by a joint commissioner of Calcutta police asked the advocate-general to keep it in his custody, said counsel of a private bank.

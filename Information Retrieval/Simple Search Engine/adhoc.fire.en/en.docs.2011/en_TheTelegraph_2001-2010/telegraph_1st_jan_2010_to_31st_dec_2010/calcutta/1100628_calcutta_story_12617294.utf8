                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      2 dead, 30 injured in truck mishap

	Two men died and 30 were injured when a Tata 407 overloaded with labourers skidded on slush on a road narrowed for East West Metro work, lost control and overturned outside Mayukh Bhavan in Salt Lake on Sunday afternoon.        
	The deceased were identified as Nilkantha Mal, a 24-year-old resident of Debra in West Midnapore and Panchanan Manna, a 55-year-old resident of Kultali in South 24-Parganas.        
	The injured, who were being taken from a project site in City Centre to their shelter in Sector V, were admitted to Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital with head, spine, leg and neck injuries. Four of them were shifted to NRS Hospital in a critical condition.        
	The driver, 21-year-old Chandan Mahato, who fled the accident spot, was arrested in the evening.        
	According to witnesses, he was speeding recklessly with about 40 labourers on board. The driver swerved left off the metalled road into a muddy patch beside it to avoid hitting a car coming from the opposite direction. He lost control while trying to swerve back on the road and overturned on the other side of the road.         
	Most of the labourers were trapped under the vehicle while some were flung to the adjoining construction site, filled with mud. We rushed to their aid, said Lakshmi Das, who owns a tea stall close to the spot.        
	The mishap once again highlighted the practice of ferrying labourers like cattle. Gammon India, which had hired the labourers, claimed that on other days they were sent to their shelter on a special vehicle. Two of the injured, Umar Sheikh and Noor Islam, refuted the claim.        
	The company will pay a compensation of at least Rs 5 lakh to the family of the deceased while the injured will get between Rs 50,000 and Rs 2 lakh depending on the nature of injury, said a senior official of Gammon India.

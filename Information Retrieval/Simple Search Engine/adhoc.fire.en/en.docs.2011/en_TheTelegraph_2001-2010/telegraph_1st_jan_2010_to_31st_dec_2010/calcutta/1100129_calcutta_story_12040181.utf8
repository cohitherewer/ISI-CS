The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Booksellers cry foul over dark fair
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Booksellers cry foul over dark fair
          A STAFF REPORTER                           A dimly lit stall on Thursday. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                   
	Publishers and booksellers participating in the 34th Calcutta Book Fair are beginning to fear theres no light at the end of the Milon Mela tunnel.         
	Prabhat Chowdhury had applied for eight light points to illuminate his 200sq ft stall, displaying 6,450 books, but has been forced to make do with merely two 40-watt tubes three days after the book fair was inaugurated on Monday.        
	I had only 20 visitors after 5pm. My business is suffering badly because of inadequate light, Chowdhury told Metro, which had counted 150 unlit stalls on Wednesday.        
	Till 5.30pm on Thursday, at least 10 of the 650 stalls had no lights while nearly 60 were so poorly lit that visitors couldnt read the titles of the books on display, leave alone browse through them.        
	Is this the way things are organised in Calcutta? asked a representative of a Bangalore-based company dealing in edutainment (educational entertainment).        
	Officials of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild admitted to shortcomings but promised to set things right by Friday. We apologise for the inconvenience, said Suprokash Basu, the vice-president of the guild.         
	The promise of things being set right within 24 hours is something the stalls have been hearing from Monday evening.        
	On the lack of guide maps for visitors, Basu said five lakh copies were being printed. When student Krishnendu Majumdar asked for one, he was told distribution would start on Friday. I have been trying to locate a stall for the past 10 minutes but in vain, he said.        
	The only map available to visitors was the one pasted on a wall of the guild office. Its time the guild and the government realised that the citys image is suffering, said retired teacher Angshu Prakash Chattopadhyay.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had asked the organisers and officials of the West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation, the promoters of the fairground, to plug the gaps in infrastructure during a meeting on Monday.         
	But participants complained that the authorities had done little to improve infrastructure at the fair since the inauguration.        
	Chandan Mukherjee of Wiley India Pvt Ltd, said his company was given a raw deal. We paid Rs 1,70,000 for the 800sq ft stall. But we have only four lights. The rear of our stall is so dark that you cant see anything properly.

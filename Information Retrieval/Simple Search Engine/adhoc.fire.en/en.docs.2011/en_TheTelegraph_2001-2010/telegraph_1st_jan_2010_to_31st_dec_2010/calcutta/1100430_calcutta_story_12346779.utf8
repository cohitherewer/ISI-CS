The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hospital reopens doors but feeling of alienation keeps residents away amp; angry
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hospital reopens doors but feeling of alienation keeps residents away amp; angry
          RITH BASU                          REMAINS OF THE DAY: Peerless Hospital wears a ravaged look after a mob ran riot on its premises on April 13				                                 
	Peerless Hospitals diagnosis of the unprecedented mob attack on its premises a fortnight ago may have missed the main malaise: a missing heart.        
	Shahid Smriti, the nearby colony from where the mob had sprung up to attack Peerless following the death of a young accident victim they didnt even know, apparently reacted the way it did because the hospital had allegedly shut out its residents for a long time.         
	The list of allegations against Peerless is long  denial of admission to nearby residents, demand for huge deposits and refusal to handle even emergencies if the patients happen to be poor.        
	It may not have been part of Peerless Hospitals business plan to generate employment for the residents of the area, which is fine by me. Nobody should support vandalism but it can be said that Peerless could have avoided it by maintaining a local connection, including reaching out to the residents with affordable healthcare, said economist Aviroop Sarkar.        
	A day after the mob fury on April 13, Shahid Smriti resident Uday Halder was busy with the shradh of his father Haripada but his mind was elsewhere. The police have picked up 13 people from our locality on the charge of rioting but why dont they question the Peerless authorities about the illegal things they do? he railed.        
	Udays father, who died of internal injuries after someone poured acid down his throat during an altercation, had been refused admission by Peerless on April 1.        
	 Not just my father, they have done nothing for the neighbourhood. We had great expectations of Peerless but it caters only to the rich, complained Uday.        
	A right turn from the spick and span hospital takes one to Shahid Smriti, a study in contrast with rows of shanties on either side. According to local estimates, more than 25,000 people  not including residents of highrise buildings  stay within a radius of 2km of the hospital.         
	 Just try finding one woman from this neighbourhood who has delivered a child at Peerless even though this is the nearest hospital. Kanti Ganguly (minister and local MLA) had told us that free beds were reserved for us in this hospital. Where are those? wondered Gaurango Ghosh, a 52-year-old newspaper vendor from Ghoshpara in Shahid Smriti.        
	Peerless had allegedly refused to admit Gaurangos pregnant daughter-in-law one night in November 2008, and he has since been nursing a grudge against the hospital. April 13 was my revenge, he said.        
	Sociology professor Swapan Pramanik said the trigger for the attack on the hospital reflected an unmistakable class divide.         
	When you live in utter poverty and see riches all around you, a grudge builds up in the mind and waits for a chance to erupt. The same thing happens when a car hits a pedestrian, he explained.        
	So could Peerless have done anything to stymie those feelings?        
	Such organisations should try to reach out to people in the neighbourhood who are not so well off, he added.        
	Peerless Hospitals medical superintendent Sudipto Mitra insisted that there was no written undertaking to the government or anybody else to provide free beds or treatment to the poor. But Peerless does have a policy of organising free health camps from time to time. In the late 1990s, we extended flood relief to the adjoining areas, including Shahid Smriti, he added.        
	Dipankar Sinha, the chief town planner of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, said development planning in and around the EM Bypass was faulty with housing complexes and private hospitals mushrooming but no government hospital coming up.         
	The nearest affordable hospitals from Peerless are National Medical College, the Beleghata Infectious Diseases Hospital and EEDF in Jodhpur Park. This is hardly ideal, he said.        
	Peerless came up in 1993 on a 9.5 acre-plot bought from two co-operative societies.                     WITH INPUTS FROM ZEESHAN JAWED AND SUBHAJOY ROY

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Postal map misses 18A Park Street
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Postal map misses 18A Park Street
  - Stacks of snail mail with Stephen Court as address stay undelivered          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          Some plaques bearing the addresses of those living or working in Stephen Court                                        
	Fire-ravaged Stephen Court is a vital city landmark now but it has ceased to be a postal address.        
	Stacks of undelivered snail mail addressed to people working or living in 18A Park Street have been piling up in the Middleton Row post office  diagonally opposite the buildings back gate  and in the nearby offices of private courier agencies since March 23.        
	It feels strange to see 18A Park Street standing where it was but with nobody around to deliver the mails to. I go around the building once every day hoping to find someone to hand over a letter or a parcel, said one of the 15 postmen who cover the area.        
	According to him, 220 to 250 letters and parcels addressed to residents and offices in Stephen Court have not been delivered since March 23 because of inaccessible addresses.        
	The norm is to retain mails for seven days and post these back to the sender if the addresses are wrong or the addressee is unavailable. We are making an exception for Stephen Court, though, postmaster-general Gautam Bhattacharya told Metro.        
	The post office has decided to retain all mails marked Stephen Court for longer than the stipulated period because residents expecting letters and parcels have started making enquiries.        
	 The other day, three residents came to us to submit alternative addresses where their mails can be delivered till they return here, said an official of the post office.        
	Ibrahimuzamman Safvi, whose trading company used to operate out of the sixth floor of Stephen Court, said the fire not only left him without an office but also snapped a vital mode of communication. There is only so much you can do with email. What about all the consignments that our clients send? said Safvi, who has since set up office on Camac Street.        
	Ajay Biyani, a franchisee of courier company Flyking, said he had at least four fixed clients in Stephen Court. On an average, we would deliver eight packets and collect a few every day, he added.        
	Baidyanath Saha, the officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani police station, said the cops could at best provide a list of residents with their contact numbers if the local post office wanted it.         
	There are over 120 offices and 30-odd flats at 18A Park Street.

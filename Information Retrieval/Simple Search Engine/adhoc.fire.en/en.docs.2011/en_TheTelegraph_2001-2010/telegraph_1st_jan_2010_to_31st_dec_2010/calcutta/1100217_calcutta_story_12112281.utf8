The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mind games to win Test crown
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mind games to win Test crown
  - South African adventurer-cum-motivator fields questions from Team India          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                          Mike Horn at Udayan on Tuesday.   (Bishwarup Dutta)                                              
	Late on Monday he had urged Team India to score 420 by lunchtime on Day III without losing a wicket. His wards at the Eden Gardens  who had bombarded him with questions on mind games during his motivational sessions  managed to score 11 extra runs in the first session on Tuesday for the loss of the nightwatchmans wicket.        
	Not bad for a man who would rather travel to the North Pole than to a cricket ground.         
	Meet Mike Horn, the South African adventure-explorer, who has been called in by Team India for a motivational talk twice in 72 hours to help them square the series against South Africa and retain the Test crown.        
	His first pep talk was over dinner at Taj Bengal on Friday and the second after play on Day II. And at both, the man had to field questions galore. They asked me a 1,001 questions. The thought process of a professional adventurer and a professional cricketer is 100 per cent similar. The boys are a good bunch, smiled Horn, on his way to Udayan on Tuesday, as part of an environment mission with youths.        
	So, what did Dhoni and Co. ask? What does one do in moments of doubt? They meant for example, what does a batsman do if he is intimidated by a bowler? I told them not to give anything away with their body language. Look like youre still playing the game with confidence.        
	It is this confidence that has helped Horn circumnavigate the Arctic Circle alone, travel to the North and South Poles and even do the Latitude Zero, an 18-month circumnavigation of the earth around the equator.        
	There were questions like, How does one stay committed to the goal?, for which Horn drew parallels from his expeditions and experiences. Sitting there and getting a 100 can get a little boring  but make that your set routine. I told the cricketers that I am 100 per cent committed to my goal. If I lose, I lose my life and theres no replay. Just like the North Pole is my goal, winning a match is theirs, said the athlete-turned-adventurer.        
	Fear of failure also figured high on the question list of Indias star sportsmen. Block out all negative thoughts, so there is space for only positive, urged Horn.        
	Fancy having to tell Virender Sehwag that!

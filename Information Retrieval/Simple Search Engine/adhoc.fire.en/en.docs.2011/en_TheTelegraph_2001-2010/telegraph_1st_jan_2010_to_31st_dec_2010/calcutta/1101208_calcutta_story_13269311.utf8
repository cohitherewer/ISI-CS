The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Not a phoney probe, this
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Not a phoney probe, this
  - Judges stolen mobile          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Police have recovered the stolen cellphone of a judge of Calcutta High Court almost one-and-a-half years after he lost it, proving that priority investigation in phone theft is the prerogative of the VIP.         
	Although the cops couldnt beat their record of tracing actress Rituparna Senguptas stolen cellphone within a couple of days of the theft earlier this year, recovering one that went missing in August 2009 over 15 months later is being touted as an achievement in itself.        
	The announcement comes even as piles of lost-cellphone complaints lie pending in police stations.        
	The IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number helped us track down the present user of the cellphone despite a different SIM card being inserted into the phone. We wrote to the service provider seeking details of the person in whose name that SIM card was issued. The rest was easy, said an officer at Shakespeare Sarani police station.        
	Once the required details were supplied by the service provider, investigators discovered that the judges Nokia N-series cellphone was being used by one of the employees of Mohon Motors, the Jawaharlal Nehru Road showroom from where it was stolen. He claimed to be unaware that the cellphone he had bought from a former colleague for Rs 200 was a stolen one.        
	The cops have yet to trace the alleged thief, but the cellphone will be back to where it belongs. On Monday, the chief judicial magistrate of Bankshall court issued an order to return the recovered cellphone to its rightful owner.        
	So what stops the cops from showing the same seriousness in tracing the lost cellphones of ordinary citizens? Its a cumbersome process. We dont have the technology and the expertise to quickly ascertain the details of a cellphone user merely from a number. We depend on the service providers who take a lot of time to provide information, said an officer.         
	Stolen cellphones also change hands quickly and the cops apparently do not have the time, manpower or inclination to trace them. Unless, of course, you happen to be a VIP like a high court judge or a celebrity like Rituparna Sengupta.        
	Going by the book, the first step in a stolen cellphone investigation is to determine the IMEI number of the missing handset. If the complainant fails to furnish the number, the police seek call chart of that number from the service provider. The IMEI number comes along with the call chart.         
	All service providers are alerted to the unique IMEI number of the cellphone, which the cops say is where the investigation goes cold. It takes months to get a response from the service providers. In many cases, we discover that the users have provided incorrect details while buying the SIM card. Thats a dead end, said an officer.

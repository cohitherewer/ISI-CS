                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Licence scan on private guards
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An intelligence input on fake arms licences has prompted the police brass to ask private security agencies to furnish the number of armed guards employed by them.        
	Its a major concern and the private agencies have been asked to provide all details, including a copy of their arms licences, to local police stations. We have learnt that over 150 guards with private agencies are working with fake licences, said an official of the detective department.        
	More than 100 private security agencies operate in the city.        
	Several of these agencies are illegal as they are yet to get licences from the state home department. They are functioning only on the strength of the trade licence issued by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the official added.        
	A probe revealed that hundreds of guns were bought over the past few years by producing fake licences.        
	These fake licences were issued by touts in some districts, including Murshidabad and Burdwan, and in some neighbouring states. They get a cut between Rs 15,000 and Rs 25,000 for each fake licence, the officer added.        
	Fake licences are much in demand among private guards as they guarantee a higher salary. The racketeers forge the signature of the district magistrate. An official of the CID expressed the fear that some fake licences might have reached Maoists as well.        
	The detective department is probing the case. Several people have been arrested in this connection, said Basab Dasgupta, the deputy commissioner (Reserve Force). In January, the police had arrested Golam Sheikh, his son Bapi and two others on the charge of being involved in the licence racket.

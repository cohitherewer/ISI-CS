The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | From Man Friday to most wanted
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      From Man Friday to most wanted
  - Assistant Joykrishna speaker of choice at condolence meetings for Basu          ZEESHAN JAWED                          Joykrishna Ghosh offers a floral tribute to Jyoti Basu. (Amit Datta)                                        
	His phone hasnt stopped ringing since Sunday. Programmes are being rescheduled so that they dont clash with the dates he has given to others. Many are still waiting to hear when he will be available so that they can finalise their dates.        
	So who is this new most-wanted man about town? Joykrishna Ghosh, the late Jyoti Basus Man Friday of over three decades.        
	Ghosh, who had said after Basus death that he was orphaned for the second time, has since been flooded with invitations to be the chief guest at condolence meetings being organised by everyone from chambers to clubs, cultural organisations to community clusters.        
	Basus confidential assistant, appointed when he became chief minister for the first time in 1977, has so far accepted around 15 invitations while many more are waiting for his consent.         
	 Yes, I have been receiving numerous calls to attend condolence meetings because people want to hear about Jyotibabu, whom they loved so much. But it is not possible for me to attend every condolence meeting, Ghosh told Metro on Thursday evening.         
	On Thursday, Ghosh attended three such condolence meetings, narrating interesting anecdotes about Basu and lighting candles in his memory at the Merchants Chambers in central Calcutta, a club in Salt Lake and at the ongoing Bidhan Nagar Mela.        
	He is scheduled to take the podium at Burrabazar this weekend and at Spring Club  on the EM Bypass  the next.        
	Our condolence meeting would be incomplete if Joyda is not present. His long association with Jyotibabu makes him the person to hear at such an event, said a member of the Spring Club committee.                           
	Our condolence meeting would be incomplete if Joyda is not present. His long association with Jyotibabu makes him the person to hear at such an event, said a member of the Spring Club committee.         
	Some say that Ghosh has become a permanent fixture at condolence meetings for Basu because he is easily available.         
	 Now that Basu is no more, he has all the time in the world. The party leaders who could have replaced him are busy preparing for the official rally in memory of Basu on January 24, and his son Chandan has refused to attend any such programme. So that leaves Ghosh, who is using the opportunity to creating some space for himself, said someone who shared the dais with Ghosh at a meeting.        
	Although Ghosh didnt hold any government post, he wielded immense clout not only when Basu was chief minister but even after he stepped down. Till 2000, he would liase between the chief ministers office and the CPMs Alimuddin Street headquarters.         
	He was close to the business community as well. If anybody wanted access to Jyotibabu, Joyda was the man he needed to go through, said a businessman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | THE CALCUTTA CRATER
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      THE CALCUTTA CRATER
  Pothole Peril  TT For City                                 
	One wet day and the warts are showing. Metro went from Bypass to Behala on Monday and at several points found roads replaced by potholes or roads rendered perilous by the surface being washed away. Here are four faces of the city that leave us red-faced              
	Western flank of Behala Silpara main road to Chowrasta crossing                          
	What: Huge potholes and waterlogging.        
	Pothole prize: Thirteen potholes were in the fray but one with a diameter of around 8 feet won comfortably.        
	Watch out for: Damage to vehicles trying to dodge the numerous potholes, often partially visible thanks to the waterlogging. Accidents waiting to happen.        
	Way out: Take the opposite flank. Chances are you wont be booked for it till things improve.        
	Cop: If the waterlogging doesnt get you, the potholes will. It is impossible to manage this stretch, said a senior officer of Thakurpukur police station.              
	EM Bypass  between Science City and the Ruby roundabout                        
	What: Small potholes, road surface washed away and flying stone chips.        
	Watch out for: Skidding wheels (three motorcycle accidents reported since Sunday evening). Traffic snarls.        
	Way out: Drive in slow motion.        
	Victim: The roads are a mess in what is being touted as the second central business district of the city, said Subal Halder, who lives off Ruby.              
	Diamond Harbour Road, between Kadamtala and Thakurpukur in Behala                        
	What: Muddy patches in the middle of the road coupled with large potholes.        
	Watch out for: Traffic snarls. Breakdown of heavy vehicles. Skidding of two-wheelers.        
	Way out: Avoid the stretch; take James Long Sarani as far as possible.        
	Victim: Driving through the stretch has become a nightmare. To make matters worse, the Kadamtala crossing was dug up to lay a pipeline but never restored, said Ranjan Chakraborty, a resident of the area.        
	Official: We have decided to restore the potholes for the time being with rough bricks and will undertake a thorough repair before the puja. But the CMC must first ensure there is no waterlogging, said a senior engineer of the PWD.              
	EM Bypass  off Parama Island                        
	What: Potholes galore.        
	Pothole prize: At least three large ones, several small ones and one king-sized one with a diameter of around 10 feet in the middle of the road.        
	Watch out for: Vehicles veering right and left to try and avoid the potholes. Traffic snarls.         
	Way out: Pray your vehicle survives the ordeal.        
	Cop: We have alerted the CMDA as an accident is waiting to happen, said a traffic constable at the Parama Island crossing.        
	Official: Our inspectors will visit the stretch on Tuesday and do the necessary patchwork. But complete restoration work of this Bypass stretch is not possible till the end of the monsoon, said a CMDA official.                    TEXT BY TAMAGHNA BANERJEE.

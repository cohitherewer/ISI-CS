The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teachers told to hold their tongue
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Teachers told to hold their tongue
  - Church advisory to schools in the wake of twin student suicides          MITA MUKHERJEE                                        
	THINGS STUDENTS SHOULD NOT HEAR  
	 You are good for nothing  
	 You are a loser  
	 You rsquo;ll grow up to be a grocer   
	 I rsquo;ll be surprised if you can make it to college  
	 Shut up or I rsquo;ll throw you out of the window  
	 If you know everything, why are you in school?  
	 Are you the teacher or me?  
	 Didn rsquo;t your parents teach you manners?      
	The Church is telling Calcutta schoolteachers what Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told P. Chidambaram recently: mind your language.        
	The Church of North India (CNI) has recommended training teachers how to behave in the classroom after two students of reputable missionary-run institutions committed suicide in February because they were allegedly humiliated in school.        
	A source said an internal probe failed to confirm whether classroom incidents had triggered the twin suicides  first by a Class XII girl and then by a Class VIII boy  but the CNI was convinced that teacher-student interaction needed to improve.        
	We are shocked (by the incidents) because apart from having high academic standards, all our institutions maintain a very student-friendly atmosphere. But we need to try and make our education system even better, said Ashoke Biswas, the bishop of the Calcutta Diocese of the CNI.        
	The CNI advisory focuses more on how teachers need to moderate their behaviour towards students rather than how discipline should be enforced. It recommends that teachers be handed a list of words and phrases they should avoid while communicating. They must also be made aware of the legal implications of verbal abuse.        
	Teachers should avoid making negative remarks because that can have a long-term effect on young minds. A teacher might casually tell a boy of 10 that he is good for nothing, not realising how that can lower his self-esteem, said Supriya Dhar, the secretary of the La Martiniere schools.        
	A common complaint is that most teachers focus their attention on the more intelligent students, leaving the rest battling an inferiority complex. A partisan attitude can drive a student to serious depression, said a CNI official.        
	Dhar said the La Martiniere schools were already taking steps to eradicate any trace of favouritism. Students spend as much time in school as they do at home, and we are trying to make each student feel happy to be in school.         
	According to psychologists, todays students have become hypersensitive to criticism with the old spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child sermon assuming new meaning.

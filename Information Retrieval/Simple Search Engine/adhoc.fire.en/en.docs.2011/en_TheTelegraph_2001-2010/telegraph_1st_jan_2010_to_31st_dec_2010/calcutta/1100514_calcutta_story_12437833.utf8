The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mint project in cleft stick
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mint project in cleft stick
          SOUMITRA DAS                          The old mint on Strand Road                                  
	The project to conserve and develop the disintegrating old mint complex on Strand Road has remained stalled for almost two years now, thanks to a dispute between the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited (SPMCIL), a company owned by the Centre, and the CMDA, a state government agency.        
	Not only would the Rs 149-crore project have saved a priceless example of colonial architecture, it also has the potential to raise the profile of the dingy Burrabazar area into a tourist destination.        
	The Silver Mint, as it was called, was constructed between 1824 and 1829 to replace the old mint in Church Lane. Designed by Major W.N. Forbes, the main building is in Grecian Doric style and its central portico was built to resemble the Temple of Minerva of Athens at half the scale. It was declared a protected place in 1923, silver coin minting stopped in 1952, and in 1972, it stopped operating as a silver refinery house. The silver and other valuable reserves were shifted to the new mint in Taratala in 1972. The main building was abandoned thereafter, and it has been crumbling since.        
	Designated a protected area, armed BSF men stand guard behind a kiosk in the portico. But who are they protecting the structure from? Certainly not from the vagaries of nature or the intransigence of government officials.        
	Only recently, the finance ministry had decided to develop the heritage property through a public private partnership. On September 30, 2008, the IL amp;FS Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd had made a presentation identifying project components like a mint museum, archive, centre for Indology, mini-convention and performance art centre, heritage hotel and an art and craft village. There was also a plan to set up a printing museum devoted to printing processes and equipment.        
	The project was awarded to Eden Infrastructure and the commitment was to finish work before the Commonwealth Games in October.        
	But there is no progress at all, says Ajay S. Singh, the general manager (internal audit) of SPMCIL, because the CMDA from February 2009 had taken up the construction of the Vivekananda Road flyover that would encroach on the mint complex covering 12.5 acres and also block the view of the proposed structures. At the planning stage, neither the state nor the central organisation seems to have been aware of the two projects at cross purposes.        
	Director (socio-economic) CMDA Kalyan Roy says the dispute was over accessing from the flyover the two multi-storeyed car parks planned as part of the silver mint development project. It was agreed that a ramp would be built for the purpose, but says Roy, CMDA could not foot the bill of about Rs 10 crore.        
	Singh says since the mint was losing a part of its land there was no question of bearing the cost of constructing the ramp. SPMCIL cannot pay this amount either because it may be construed as a favour to Eden Infrastructure, he points out. Kalyan Roy asserts CMDA would go ahead with the project after waiting for a reasonable period.        
	Unless the problem is resolved Calcutta stands to lose another magnificent structure.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court blocks phone tower atop roof
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court blocks phone tower atop roof
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court has issued an interim injunction on the civic bodys decision to allow a telecom service provider to install a cellphone tower on the roof of a four-storeyed building in Kasba.        
	Justice G.C. Guptas order came on Thursday in response to a petition by Rupa Mitra, the owner of a flat on the second floor of the building. Mitra had accused the CMC of allowing the telecom company to put up the tower without consulting her.        
	According to Mitras lawyer Subroto Mookherjee, she purchased the flat in 2005 and came to know two years later that the landlord and the realtor had signed a deal with the telecom company to install a cellphone tower on the roof.        
	 My client immediately initiated legal action, prompting the CMC to clarify in court that it had not sanctioned any tower. But in May this year, a company started putting up the tower, said Mookherjee.         
	Mitra later found out that a structural engineer of the CMC had issued an order dated June 1, 2009, allowing the company to put up the tower.        
	The CMCs structural engineer claimed that none of the occupants of the building had raised any objection when he conducted an on-the-spot inquiry before issuing sanction. But that is untrue. My client was never consulted before taking such a step, said lawyer Mookherjee.        
	Cellphone towers atop buildings have long been the bone of contention because of health concerns and roof-ownership disputes.

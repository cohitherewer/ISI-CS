Rafael Nadal amp; Wasim Akram   You are warm, loyal and an expert in binding people together. Often your element is outdoor, enjoying nature. Although you are careful about investments still saving money is not your cup of tea. You are hardworking and cooperative. You are sensitive and honest and like to understand your partner before you commit. Try to be less impulsive, you can do much better by stopping and thinking first.

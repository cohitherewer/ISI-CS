The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Airport approach options await nod
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Airport approach options await nod

	Two alternative proposals to decongest the approach to the airport have been gathering dust for months, with the authorities failing to meet even once to zero in on either.        
	The Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the transport department, the agencies involved in drafting the plans, are convinced that only a flyover on VIP Road can ensure a smoother flow to and from the airport but their views differ on the highroads alignment and use (see graphic).        
	The AAIs plan was submitted to the government three months ago while the transport department had finalised its blueprint a little before that.        
	We have submitted the proposal to the state government and will hold a meeting to finalise the design. This new flyover has been planned to ease the congestion on the road approaching the airport, said airport director R. Srinivasan.         
	Both proposals have been sitting idle. A meeting between the two sides could have resolved the differences and got work started, said an airport source.        
	The principal secretary in the state transport department, Sumantra Chowdhury, said: A meeting was scheduled for the second week of January but it was deferred. We will decide on a new date.        
	The project cost and other details can be worked out only after the authorities approve one of the proposals.        
	The transport departments flyover  meant for vehicles not bound for the airport  will run along VIP Road, stretching between the Jessore Road crossing and a point close to New Town Road intersection.        
	Once the flyover comes up, only airport-bound vehicles will use the VIP Road-stretch beyond the New Town crossing, easing the congestion to a great extent, said a transport department official.        
	But the AAI feels that buses and taxis will seldom use the flyover, defeating the purpose of setting it up.        
	According to the airports plan, the flyover will take off from VIP Road and descend on the airport premises. Around 300 metres from that point, another flyover will take off and stretch up to the new terminal. The length of the first flyover will be 425 metres.        
	Officials in the airports engineering department said a dedicated flyover for the airport would be more effective in easing the congestion that has been holding up passengers and even pilots.        
	A few months back, police and the AAI had decided to mark a lane on the VIP Road only for airport-bound vehicles. But vehicles headed for Jessore Road started using the lane, delaying the entry of the fliers into the airport. The governments proposal, if implemented, will suffer from the same flaw, said an official.        
	The Airline Operators Committee said the congestion is maximum in the afternoon and evening when around 20 flights leave within two hours.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dyslexic girl wins exam duel     - HC prods schools to identify, help students with disorders          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          A scene from Aamir Khans Taare Zameen Par, based on the story of a dyslexic boy played by Darsheel Safary                                         
	Payel Sarkar, the dyslexic student barred from writing the CBSE Class XII examinations on grounds of inadequate attendance, won the battle against board rules on Wednesday with Calcutta High Court directing the authorities to treat her as a special case.        
	Justice B. Somadder not only asked the CBSE chairman to allow teenager Payel to sit for the exams that got underway on Wednesday  her first paper is slated for March 10  but also make efforts to identify students with learning disorders and counsel rather than penalise them.        
	The CBSE should issue circulars to all its affiliated schools, asking them to arrange for adequate infrastructure to identify and help students suffering from learning disorders. The board should also ask every school to appoint at least one educational psychiatrist to help dyslexic students deal with the problem, Justice Somadder said.        
	Payels school, Fort William Kendriya Vidyalaya, had allegedly refused to hand over her examination admit card citing board rules that stipulate a minimum of 70 per cent attendance in an academic year.        
	Her mother Alpana Das Sarkar moved court, arguing that her daughter had cleared the selection test and was, therefore, eligible for the main exam. The court admitted the petition on Tuesday and summoned the principal on Wednesday to explain why Payel was being barred from the exam.                          
	Asked whether the school authorities knew about Payel suffering from dyslexia  a learning disorder characterised by difficulty in reading, spelling and sometimes doing arithmetic  principal Kanta M. Chugh said her parents made no mention of her condition in the official records.        
	Justice Somadder said he understood the reluctance of parents to disclose any such disorder their children might be suffering from. He then put the onus of detecting learning disorders, if any, in children on the school authorities.        
	When the principal replied that Fort William Kendriya Vidyalaya did not have the requisite infrastructure to identify students suffering from learning disorders, the judge immediately issued a directive to the CBSE to ensure that all its affiliates appointed experts to help such students.        
	Lawyers appearing for the Sarkars had based the case on the CBSE issuing an admit card to Payel and there being separate rules for special students.

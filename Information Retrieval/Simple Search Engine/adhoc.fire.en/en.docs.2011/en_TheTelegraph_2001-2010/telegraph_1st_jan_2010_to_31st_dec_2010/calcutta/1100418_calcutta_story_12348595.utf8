	The article The M-Class quotient, February 7, was meant in jest, yet a few things did not strike the right chord. For instance, tucking the tummy in is not restricted to the middle class. Also, with limited resources at their disposal, not everyone has the guts to buy mutual funds and stocks.             
	And they dont tip at salons because they dont go there more than once a month or two. The zoo or Victoria Memorial may be their favourite place for a winter holiday with their bags full of food, newspapers and badminton rackets. But all these dont make being middle class shameful!

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hi-tech healthcare comes to town

	Two top-line healthcare institutes are ready to open in the city soon.         
	Fortis will commission its 400-bed unit, off the EM Bypass, by the end of August while the 150-bed Tata Medical Centre in New Town is likely to open its doors to patients in October.        
	Healthcare experts said modern treatment methods like nuclear medicine for cancer, single-incision laparoscopic surgery and non-invasive cardiovascular surgery will be available in these two hospitals.         
	Both projects were delayed by six to 12 months because of several factors, ranging from funds crunch to legal hurdles over land.         
	The legal complications over the land that we took from the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has been settled, said Vishal Bali, the CEO of Fortis, on Thursday.         
	The first phase, with 250 beds, will be commissioned by August-end, he added. The second phase is set to be ready in seven to eight months.        
	The 12-level building is built on 1.5 acres at a cost of Rs 170 crore. It initially belonged to the Wockhardt group.         
	Precision knee replacement, beating heart surgery and non-invasive cardiovascular surgery are some of the facilities we will offer, said Bali. Spine implants through minimally invasive procedures and keyhole brain surgery would also be conducted.         
	The cancer super-speciality hospital, for which Ratan Tata had laid the foundation stone in February 2006, will finally be ready in October.         
	The hospital, to be managed by the Tata Medical Centre Trust (TMCT), Calcutta, which has been formed for this purpose  is coming up on 13.3 acres.        
	It will have the first complete nuclear medicine unit which has received the clearance from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (Barc), a hospital source said.         
	A radio isotope therapy ward will be set up offering high dose radio isotope therapy for patients suffering from thyroid cancer and neuro and endocrine tumours.

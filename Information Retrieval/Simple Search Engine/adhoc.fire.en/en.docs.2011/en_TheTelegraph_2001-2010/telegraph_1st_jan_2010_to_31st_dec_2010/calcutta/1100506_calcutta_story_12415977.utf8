                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CBI probe for teacher recruitment             OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday ordered the CBI to probe charges of irregularities in the recruitment process of the college service commission (CSC) which appoints teachers for the 420-odd colleges in the state.        
	This is the first time the commission has come under the scanner of the central investigation agency.        
	The CBI will verify the college service commissions papers related to the appointment of a lecturer for Vidyasagar University and file a report by June 15, the judge said.        
	When contacted by Metro, commission chairman Himangshu Ghosh said he was unaware of the ruling.        
	The order followed a petition by Suman Kalyan Samanta, a resident of Tamluk in Midnapore East, who had applied for the post of a lecturer in anthropology in Vidyasagar University in response to an advertisement published in newspapers on September 20, 2005.        
	The commission called him for an interview in March 2006 but the authorities did not inform him about the outcome, said Samantas lawyer Subir Sanyal.                          
	On March 20, 2007, the CSC published another advertisement seeking applications for the post of a lecturer in anthropology at Vidyasagar University, Sanyal added.        
	Samanta then wrote to the commission asking whether anyone had been selected from the earlier interviews. CSC secretary Kalipada Das wrote back, saying the advertisement had been published in anticipation of a vacancy.        
	The secretarys reply did not satisfy my client and he moved the high court. Acting on the petition, Justice Kargupta asked the CSC chairman to file an affidavit stating details about the recruitment process, Sanyal said.        
	The chairman stated in the affidavit that the panel did not preserve all documents related to the appointment of lecturers. But the judge insisted that all relevant papers be placed before him, said Sanyal.        
	The panels lawyer, Pulak Mondal, then submitted that the chairman had retrieved the assessment report of the interview board.         
	The papers revealed that the selection committee had found none of the candidates who had applied for the interview fit for the post but the documents bore the signature of only one of the four selectors.        
	After studying the papers, the judge asked for an affidavit from the principal secretary in the higher education department.         
	The affidavit reached the court today but it was just a reiteration of what the chairman had stated. The judge then ordered the CBI to probe the recruitment process, Sanyal said.        
	This was the first Calcutta High Court order for a CBI probe since the apex court clarified in January that the states consent was not required to order an inquiry by the central agency.

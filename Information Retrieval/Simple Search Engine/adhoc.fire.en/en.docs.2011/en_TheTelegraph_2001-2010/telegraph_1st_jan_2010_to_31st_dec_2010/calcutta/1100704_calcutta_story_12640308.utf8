	Apropos Pyramid Basu, 20 June, the banner put up by Mithuns fan club is very unique. One wonders what geometrical figure would rightly depict the beleaguered Buddhadeb Bhattacharya. It should perhaps be an inverted pyramid depicting the chief minister flat on the ground with voters vanishing in thin air.             
	A.S. Mehta, New Alipore                               
	It was interesting to note the list of festivals for the entire year (Endless party, June 13). But the list should have also mentioned bandhs as they are enjoyed like any other festival by Calcuttans. On a typical day of strike, children get to play since morning, while office goers catch up on their sleep or enjoy a nice meal and adda.             
	Atif Ayaz, Serampore                               
	Pronam is a joint initiative of The Bengal, an organisation of prominent Calcuttans, and Calcutta police. In the article Talk to me (June 27) The Bengal was not mentioned. The error is regretted.       Letters on reports appearing   in Metro may be sent to:

          A STAFF REPORTER                      The petrol pump where Tapasi was shot at. (Tamaghna Banerjee)                          
	An 18-year-old girl was shot at and grievously wounded by two bike-borne youths on Tuesday night when she tried to stop them from looting the cash box at a petrol pump in Patuli, not far from Hiland Park, where she works.        
	Tapasi Chanda Das had a bullet lodged inside her and paralysis in her right hand to show for her brave act of loyalty towards her workplace of barely two months, a pump which hires only women.        
	A surgery has been performed to drain out blood from near her lungs. The bullet is still lodged at the base of her throat. Our primary focus now is on curing the paralysis in her right hand, said Suman Ghosh, the superintendent of AMRI Hospitals in Dhakuria, where Tapasi is being treated in the critical care unit.        
	Tapasi, who gets a salary of Rs 1,800, is the elder of two daughters and is the primary earning member of her family.         
	The duo had arrived at the pump, on the EM Bypass, apparently for a refill around 9pm. While Tapasi was refuelling the vehicle, the pillion-rider suddenly got off and started looting cash from a box kept nearby.         
	When she tried to stop them, the youth on the bike shot at her. He fired two more rounds in the air and one aimed at the pump owner before fleeing with around Rs 1 lakh, said Tumpa Saha, another employee. The bullet missed the owner, Debasis Sinha Roy.        
	Police arrived within 15 minutes following a call from Roy and helped local residents and pump employees  five other women were working then  take Tapasi to Peerless Hospital.        
	She was admitted to the intensive care unit but left untreated for four hours. We had no option but to shift her to AMRI at 1.30am, said Tapasis mother Anima.        
	Family members said no doctor came to see Tapasi. Instead of arranging for her treatment, the authorities asked us to bring blood and oxygen, said Anima.        
	The hospital management, however, denied the allegation. The relatives demanded a surgery which would have been very dangerous in that situation. They ransacked hospital property and damaged an oxygen line, said a spokesperson for the hospital.        
	The medical expenses of Tapasi, a Class VIII drop-out, will be borne by Roy, the petrol pump owner.        
	Additional police superintendent S.K. Chowdhry said a probe had been started. No one was arrested till late on Wednesday.

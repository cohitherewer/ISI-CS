The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Long live Calcutta Book Fair, but with quality and cohesion
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Long live Calcutta Book Fair, but with quality and cohesion
          SIDHARTH PANSARI                                    
	Calcutta Book Fair, one of the largest and most successful consumer book fairs in the world, is what motivated me to set up one of the largest flagship stores of the Crossword chain in Calcutta, the intellectual capital of the country.        
	What differentiates Calcutta Book Fair from other book fairs?        
	 The experience and nostalgia of buying books in the open air with a sea of book lovers surrounding you.        
	 The co-existence of traditional and modern book store formats. The mix of small book vendors from around the country and major international publishers.        
	 A great opportunity to stock up your library with non-fiction, rare books and distinct literature normally not available in commercial bookstores.        
	Despite the confusion and chaos over the venue for the past few years, the Book Fair bounced back at the last edition held in Milon Mela, drawing unprecedented crowds.        
	Though there were a lot of organisational and operational issues, stakeholders supported all endeavours and stood by the organisers, hoping that the guild  with the continued support of the Bengal government to this landmark event  would take this fair to a different level this time with more author interactions, availability of distinct literature, new and noteworthy participants and so on.        SUPERHIT 2009		            SLIP-UPS 2010		        
	To say that we, from the publishing industry, have been disappointed with 34th edition of the Calcutta Book Fair would be saying the very least.        
	What affects me most at a personal level, just like it would every genuine book lover of Calcutta, is the absence of good quality publishers. Apart from Penguin, the other three top general book publishers, namely Random House, Harper Collins amp; Hachette group, have not participated. Random House, Parragon Publishers and some others who participated in the last edition, have silently excused themselves this year.        
	Several participants had raised issues and concerns with our friends in the guild both formally and informally after the last Book Fair ended, but none of these was addressed. The guild as a body chose to ignore them and did not even invite the stakeholders for a meeting or a brainstorming session to discuss the grievances and draw up an action plan for the benefit of the public at large.        
	All of us are aware of the total chaos and confusion created by pre-scheduling the opening of the fair from January 27 to 25, without prior information or discussion. It remains a mystery as to why the fair was opened for the public when the organisers were well aware that the fair infrastructure was incomplete, stalls were not ready and electricity connections had not been provided.        
	Even till as late as the evening of the 27th, several stalls, including ours, were not provided with electricity points to operate stall lights, computers and credit card terminals which ensured darkness in stalls and great inconvenience to book lovers.        
	In an event of this magnitude, the absence of basic infrastructure and organisation standards really needs serious introspection and review. Organising an event like this with the present infrastructure is easier said than done. Lapses do occur even in more prestigious events. But one has to learn from their mistakes and experiences.        
	The problem here is not of intent. It is of capacity and capability. In the absence of a regular team and/or an outsourced professional agency handling the day-to-day operations, the guild mostly depends on its members to manage most of the affairs of the fair but needless to say most of them are busy managing their own stalls and interests.        
	I spoke to a few friends of the guild and other colleagues from the industry to conclude that this is nothing but a divided house. There are a select few in the guild who work their heart out throughout the year to make the Boi Mela a success.         
	Some of them worked through the night to ensure that electricity was restored on Sunday morning but most others are individuals with vested interests. Some of these individuals feel that the Book Fair is their private property and certain privileges they enjoy, including subsidised stall pricing, is their birthright.        
	While my friends and I from the industry fully appreciate the role and contribution of guild members over the years, we also feel that the affairs of the guild with regard to the Book Fair should be more transparent and all benefits be made public to avoid animosity and bitterness among participants. The same has been communicated several times to the guild by several participants.        
	While writing this, I have no doubt that this edition of the Book Fair will be a great success. But that will only be because of the spirit and approach of the book lovers of Calcutta who tend to forget all constraints and problems when it comes to their love and passion for books.        
	As the chief minister said on the occasion of the inauguration of this Book Fair, Calcuttans still believe that books not only make a man, they also go a long way in shaping society and culture.        
	But for Calcutta Book Fair to continue to play the role that it has, I sincerely hope that:        
	 The fair evolves into a platform where people can gravitate to be informed, entertained and even enlightened. For that, there has to be more literary exchanges and an extended scope for exchange of ideas, opinions and opportunities in publishing.         
	 More qualified and capable people from the cultural, literary and publishing community come forward with fresh ideas.        
	 Organisers work towards getting more distinguished regional and international publishers to participate.        
	 If there are concerns regarding costs and revenues, they be shared so that all stakeholders can come together for a solution, including alternative sources of revenue. The smaller publishers and book vendors have to co-exist with the larger corporations, but there has to be transparency.        
	 All stakeholders and agencies come together putting individual differences aside to discuss issues and problems and prepare a master plan for the coming fairs.         
	 Safety, security and basic civil infrastructure be given top priority. A back-up plan, including evacuation, be prepared and all participants be trained with proper drills for all exigencies, including fire, rain, load-shedding and stampede arising out of a crisis.        
	 The operations and on-ground management of the fair be outsourced by the guild to a professional agency for better co-ordination amp; management with participants and other agencies involved to avoid chaos and confusion.

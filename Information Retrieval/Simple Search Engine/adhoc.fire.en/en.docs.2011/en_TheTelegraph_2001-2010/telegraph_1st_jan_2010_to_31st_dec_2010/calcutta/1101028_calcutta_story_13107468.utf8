The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clinic blaze triggers panic
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Clinic blaze triggers panic
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A fire broke out in the top-floor kitchen of a nursing home in Thakurpukur on Monday morning, triggering panic among patients some of whom had to be evacuated.        
	The blaze not only exposed the lack of a proper fire-safety system at the five-storeyed Kasturi Nursing Home but also turned the focus on similar lapses in most of the clinics mushrooming across the city and its adjoining areas.        
	Officers in the fire department said the only fire-safety devices the Diamond Harbour Road clinic could boast of are a few extinguishers.        
	There is no water reservoir in the building. Nor was there any sprinkler. The authorities are not bothered about public safety, said Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services.        
	The blaze prompted the authorities to shift patients from the ward adjacent to the kitchen to wards on the other floors. Witnesses said some of the patients panicked and started running. Fortunately, there were no critical patients in the ward.        
	As news of the fire spread, patients relatives rushed to the nursing home. I am so relieved that the patients are all safe, said a relative of a patient.        
	The fire perhaps started from oil that spilled out of cooking utensils, said Achintya Mukherjee, a divisional officer in the fire department.        
	Three tenders brought the fire under control within 30 minutes. Despite repeated attempts, no one from the hospital could be contacted for comment. Many clinics are operating without following safety norms, said a fire officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU exam rules tweaked
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CU exam rules tweaked
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Undergraduate students of Calcutta University will not have to score a qualifying mark in the compulsory additional subjects from next year.        
	In a simultaneous move, the university syndicate also decided on Wednesday to shed some of its examination load and empower the affiliated colleges to conduct the tests in the two compulsory additional subjects, English and Bengali.        
	Students who will appear in the BA, BSc and BCom Part-I exams in 2011 will be the first batch to come under the new system.        
	In the current system, students are required to score at least 15 per cent in the compulsory additional papers.        
	Once the changes take effect, students will only have to appear in the examination.        
	As for the test, officials said the university would set the question papers and send them to the colleges. The students will write the papers in their own colleges, unlike the other undergraduate exams that students of one institution take sitting in another.        
	Teachers will evaluate the answer scripts of the students of their own colleges.        
	We have long been considering a plan to decentralise the functioning of our examination department. Empowering the colleges to conduct the exams in the compulsory additional papers will quicken the process of preparing results, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, pro-vice chancellor (academic).        
	The syndicate, the highest policy-making body of the university, also approved a proposal to scrap the system of awarding numerical mark to students in the compulsory additional papers.        
	Instead, the students will be awarded grades on a three-point scale. Those scoring 60 per cent or more will be awarded Grade A, those between 31 and 59 will be given Grade B and the rest, Grade C.        
	Train disruption: Trains were disrupted in the Sealdah South section for 50 minutes on Wednesday morning after a driver spotted a crack on the tracks between Ballygunge and Park Circus stations. Services resumed after repairs.

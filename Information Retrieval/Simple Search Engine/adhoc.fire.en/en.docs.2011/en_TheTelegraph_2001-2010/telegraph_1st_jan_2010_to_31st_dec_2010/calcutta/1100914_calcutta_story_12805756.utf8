The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | German surgery hope for patient
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      German surgery hope for patient
          RITH BASU                              
	A Calcutta-based cardiologist recently performed a non-invasive procedure to repair the leaking mitral valve of a patient, also from the city, at Hamburg in Germany  because the surgery is allowed only in some European countries.        
	The present day treatment for the ailment, called mitral valve regurgitation or leaking heart valve, is an open surgery, the strain of which patients with weak heart muscles cannot withstand.         
	One such patient was Santosh Kumar Duggar, a 55-year-old director of a real estate firm with a history of cardiac trouble since 2000.        
	Not only had the patient suffered a severe heart attack 10 years ago requiring angioplasty, he developed cardiomyopathy or heart muscle weakness. Subsequently, he underwent stem cell therapy and had a pacemaker implanted since he was suffering from repeated cardiac failures, said P.K. Hazra, the head of the cardiology department at AMRI Hospitals, Dhakuria.        
	When an echocardiography revealed this year that he needed treatment for mitral valve regurgitation, top doctors in the country said an open surgery would be too risky, added Hazra, who has been treating Duggar since his cardiac problems started.        
	Mitral valve regurgitation is a condition where the mitral valve does not close properly, allowing blood to leak back into the heart.        
	The non-invasive procedure involves feeding a clip through a catheter into the patients groin. The clip travels up to the mitral valve and grasps and tightens its leaflets, preventing blood from leaking. The clip remains in place while the catheter is withdrawn.         
	After being refused by US government, where the non-invasive technique is still under clinical trial, Hazra got in touch with Olaf Franzen of University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. The German doctor had performed 142 such procedures all over Europe.        
	On May 3, Frazen and Hazra, along with two other doctors, performed the procedure on the patient. The package cost Rs 27 lakh.        
	I came back to Calcutta and joined work. I still suffer from breathlessness but it is nothing like before, Duggar told Metro.        
	Talks are on between the developers of the clip and the Centre and the technology should arrive in India within an year, which will see the cost drop significantly, said Hazra.

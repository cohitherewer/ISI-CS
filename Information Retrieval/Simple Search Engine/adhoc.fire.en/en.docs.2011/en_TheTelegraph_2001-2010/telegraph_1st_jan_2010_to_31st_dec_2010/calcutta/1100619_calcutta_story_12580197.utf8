	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee on Friday morning toured the fire-ravaged Stephen Court and assured residents of steps to speed up their return home.        
	We had visited the mayor on Thursday. He promised to visit the building and speed up arrangements so that we could return to our flats soon, said Debasis Guha Neogi of Block III.        
	The residents plan to soon submit a re-construction blueprint drawn up by a private structural engineer to the civic body for approval.         
	We will consider the residents plan and send our engineers to inspect the building and allow the reconstruction if they feel it is feasible, said Chatterjee during the 45-minute tour.        
	He added that the original plan of the building would be adhered to as much as possible and illegal portions, if any, would be demolished.         
	After entering the building, the mayor headed to the fifth floor of Block III, the part that had been damaged the most in the March 23 fire. Battery-operated torches lit his way as he walked slowly, occasionally stumbling.        
	This is where the roof had collapsed and many bodies were found below the debris, pointed out Debasis Kar, the director-general, building (II), as Chatterjee and his companions reached the fourth floor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bhagat benched in station rename game
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bhagat benched in station rename game
          OUR BUREAU                          WAIT amp; WATCH: Will Rabindra Sarobar become Shahid Bhagat Singh?                                  
	Bhagat Singh will have to wait, but not Goshtha Pal or Tipu Sultan or Mother Teresa.        
	The railway ministry has decided not to rename Kalighat station after the Sikh freedom fighter, after all.        
	There is no change announced for renaming Kalighat Metro station in the official budget speech, read a Metro Rail statement on Thursday.         
	But on Wednesday, Mamata Banerjees budget speech had mentioned that Rashbehari would be renamed after Shahid Bhagat Singh.        
	No Metro or suburban railway station is named Rashbehari but Kalighat Metro station is bang on the Rashbehari Avenue crossing.        
	Similarly, her budget speech had mentioned that Park Circus would be renamed after Mother Teresa, but what she meant was Park Street Metro station.        
	The day after, one icon was benched in the rename game with a senior railway ministry official confirming from Delhi: Kalighat stations name will remain the same.        
	Does that mean Bhagat Singh loses out completely or that he must await his turn?        
	Nothing has been finalised, but Rabindra Sarobar station being renamed Shahid Bhagat Singh cannot be ruled out, said a railway source.        
	That move would serve three please-all purposes  for those opposed to Kalighat (drawing its name from the temple nearby) being renamed, for those upset over Bhagat Singh being denied a station name and those sniggering at Mamatas Rashbehari faux pas as Rabindra Sarobar is close to Rashbehari Avenue.        
	Grumbles on both counts  Kalighat being renamed and Bhagat Singh being denied  were heard on Thursday. We were happy that a Sikh freedom fighter was being given recognition in a city where over 1.5 lakh Sikhs live, said Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, the general secretary of the Behala Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee. But now, with due respect to all, every community is being represented but not Sikhs. They should either not rename any station or name one station after Bhagat Singh.        
	Im glad that the authorities have decided not to rename Kalighat after Bhagat Singh. What was the logic and why must the station closest to Kalighat temple have a different name? demanded Dhruv Biswas, 32, who like many Calcuttans is opposed to the whole rename game.

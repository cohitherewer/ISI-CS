                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Detained ship crew quizzed
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Customs officials on Monday questioned the 15 Ukranian, Armenian and Romanian crew members of the cargo ship carrying military hardware for Pakistan that docked in the city on Sunday.        
	Representatives of Crystal Shipping, the ships clearing agent in the city, were also questioned about the consignments.         
	The representatives admitted that they had made a mistake by only declaring the details of the consignment meant for Nepal, which was to be offloaded at Calcutta port, said a customs source. According to rules, a clearing agent must declare all the consignments on a ship.        
	The Aegean Glory was detained at the Sandheads on its way to the city on Friday after customs officials found discrepancies in the declarations of the clearing agent and the captain of the ship.         
	We are still awaiting clearance from the movements control office of the United Nations in New York to scan the consignments. The clearance will come via the external affairs ministry, said a customs official.

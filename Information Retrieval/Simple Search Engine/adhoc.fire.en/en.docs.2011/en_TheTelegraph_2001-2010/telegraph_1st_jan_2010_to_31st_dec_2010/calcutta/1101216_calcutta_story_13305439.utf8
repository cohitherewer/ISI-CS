The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dismal fire safety at CU
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dismal fire safety at CU
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta Universitys College Street campus and Rajabazar Science College lack the most basic firefighting arrangements, a team of the fire services department has concluded after an inspection.        
	The team, which visited Rajabazar Science College on Tuesday and the other campus on Wednesday, will tour the remaining six campuses of the university over the next few weeks and draft a plan to overhaul the arrangements.         
	Rajabazar Science College, which has dozens of laboratories, does not have even the minimum fire-safety measures. Most of the laboratories do not even have fire extinguishers. Immediate steps should be taken by the university to install fire-safety devices to prevent a calamity, said a source who accompanied the team on Tuesday and Wednesday.        
	A blaze at Presidency University on October 29 had gutted two chemistry laboratories. Metro had visited the chemistry laboratories of several colleges and research institutes in and around the city and found they were not equipped to deal with a fire.        
	The record rooms, the controller of examination department, the Central Library, the manuscript library and the Asutosh museum are some of the sections on the College Street campus that were found to be vulnerable to flames, according to the source.        
	The team has urged the university to build alternative staircases in the Asutosh and Darbhanga buildings on the College Street premises and stressed the need to overhaul electrical wires and fittings.        
	We will recommend some short-term and a few long-term measures for fire safety. The university authorities have been very accommodating and have admitted to the lapses. We will send the recommendations within a fortnight and hope they will act on them, said D.P. Biswas, the additional director-general of fire services.         
	Anjan Dawn, the estate and trust officer of CU and the co-ordinating fire management officer of the institution, said: Our buildings are very old and we cannot deny that we need to equip them with modern firefighting arrangements.        
	We will seek funds from the government to install fire-safety measures after we get the report from the fire services department, added the official.

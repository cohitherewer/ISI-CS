	What would you like to do for your parents? actor Rahul Bose asked an auditorium full of students.         
	As brand ambassador of Design for Change School Contest 2010, he encouraged schoolchildren to get innovative and change society for the better.         
	The contest, an initiative of the Ahmedabad-based Riverside School, invites children to design solutions for various social problems, ranging from child marriage to traffic violation. They can also suggest ways of making the world greener.        
	The second edition of the contest was launched at Max Mueller Bhavan on August 5. This year, the organisers have planned to go international.         
	Twenty-two nations (including Japan, Finland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom) are slated to join in along with 15,000 schools from India.        
	Bose had some tips for the participants. You should trust your instinct while designing a solution, he said. To inspire them, the actor cited some successful campaigns last year. Students in Sikkim cleaned up neglected old-age homes. The kids took up the challenge and turned them into cheerful, habitable places, said Bose.         
	The children have to run their campaign or implement a change for a week and send video clippings of their effort to the organisers.         
	There are 100 prizes in various categories, including the boldest effort and the idea that is easiest to replicate. The idea that brings about maximum change will bag the Gandhi Prize. Schools can register for the contest till September 15. The deadline for implementing a project is October 2.

	New classrooms   
	Two hundred children of Hotar, in South 24 Parganas, can now breathe easy and study in well-lit classrooms. The Calcutta South Round Table No.17, along with Calcutta Central Ladies Circle No. 27 (part of Ladies Circle India) have funded four classrooms in a primary school. These classrooms were inaugurated on August 15.  
	 The spacious rooms will now enable students to study in a healthy environment. To mark the occasion, books, stationery and jute bags were distributed among the students and 20 saplings were planted.   
	 Round Table India and Ladies Circle India have been involved in building schools for underprivileged children throughout the country.  
	Quiz contest   
	Calcutta Public School, Baguiati hosted this year rsquo;s ASISC (West Bengal Chapter) Regional Quiz Competition. The programme began with a chant on unity from the Rig Veda. The welcome address was given by the founder of the school B. Jha. Calcutta Public School, Kalikapur, won the trophy from the senior level, while Central Modern School, Baranagar, were the winners from the junior level.  
	Independence Day   
	BD Memorial Institute celebrated Independence Day on August 15 on the school premises. The students started the programme with the pledge to follow the ideals that inspired the Freedom Struggle. A short skit about successful Indians who miss the motherland was much appreciated by the audience. The play included a dance performance to the song Yeh jo des hai tera from the film Swades. The elocution segment saw students recalling the plight of Indians under British rule.

  - Oldest IIM unveils jubilee plans to grow wider and bridge need gap          A STAFF REPORTER                          D. Purandeswari and Deepak Nayyar at Joka on Sunday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                        
	On the brink of its 50th birthday, the oldest Indian Institute of Management (IIM) in the country is poised to introduce three new courses in its quest to become an international institute of excellence by 2014.        
	Coming up at IIM Calcutta is a tie-up with the ESCP Europe campus in Paris to offer a two-year dual-degree course from the next academic year. We already have a presence in the Asia-Pacific region but we are now looking at setting our footprints on the global arena, said Sekhar Chaudhuri, director, IIM Calcutta, on the sidelines of Sundays inaugural function of the 1961 institutes golden jubilee celebrations.        
	Under the dual-degree programme, students usually get to study for one year in a foreign B-school after completing a year in India. The course structure, fees and all other details are still being worked out, said Chaudhuri, adding that the campus was also looking at other foreign collaborations and joint research initiatives.        
	To reach out to a larger number of management aspirants the institute is looking at launching an online general management certificate programme for those who are working or cannot pay the steep fees.        
	Chaudhuri also announced an advanced management teachers programme to cater to industry veterans looking at a teaching career or for teachers looking at refresher courses. There is a dearth of teachers in the management institutes and there are many people with adequate industry experience who can become teachers despite not having a PhD, with a little bit of training, said Chaudhuri.        
	D. Purandeswari, the chief guest at the inaugural event stressed the shortage of faculty and urged the IIMs to fill the gap. The minister of state for human resource development pointed out that the IIMs had not been able to deal with the rise in the demand for management education, by leaps and bounds.        
	She urged the IIMs to play a more catalytic role in upgrading education provided by private management schools that have mushroomed to fill the void left by the IIMs.        
	Deepak Nayyar, a professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, is the guest of honour at the two-day convention on Management Education in India.

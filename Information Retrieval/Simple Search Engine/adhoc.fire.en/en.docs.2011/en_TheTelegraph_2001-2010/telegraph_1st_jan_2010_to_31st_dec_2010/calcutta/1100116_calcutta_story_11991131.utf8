The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Break-in at jewellery shop
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Break-in at jewellery shop
  - Gang at Gariahat robs cash, ornaments worth Rs 20 lakh           A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	A gang broke into a jewellery store on Rashbehari Avenue early on Friday and fled with gold ornaments weighing 1.3kg and around Rs 70,000 in cash.        
	By a rough estimate, the store, spread across two floors to the east of the Gariahat crossing, has been left poorer by around Rs 20 lakh.        
	The theft was discovered when owner Balaram Basak and his two employees opened the shop around 10am on Friday. Most of the items in the showcases on both the ground and first floors were strewn around. The heavy gold ornaments were all stolen, said Basak.        
	The cash was kept in a drawer that was not locked. An insider might have passed on the information to the gang, said an officer investigating the case.        
	Police said the absence of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in the store was slowing down the probe.        
	We have repeatedly asked shops to install CCTV cameras. Several cases of burglaries have been cracked with the help of footage from such cameras, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department.        
	Basak refused comment when asked why he had not installed the spy cameras.        
	The shutter door on the second-floor roof and the locks on the collapsible gate at the stairs leading down to the store were found broken, prompting sleuths to suspect that the burglars had taken the terrace route into the shop.        
	The burglars had probably climbed a lamp post to get on the terrace of the two-storeyed building. They might also have used a ladder as a folded one was found lying near the shop, the officer said.        
	Whats baffling the cops, however, is that no one in the neighbourhood  including the owner of the building who lives just behind  had heard any sound of the iron shutter or the locks being broken.         
	A businessman in the area, a prime shopping zone, alleged that there were no police kiosks around. The closest one is around a kilometre away. Besides, I havent seen any night patrolling in the area, which makes the shops soft targets for robbers, he added.        
	The jewellery shop occupied only the ground floor when it was set up nine years ago. The first floor was added before Dhanteras 2009.        
	Officers at Lalbazar said this was one of the biggest shop heists in the recent past. In 2009, cellphones worth Rs 15 lakh were stolen from a Chandni Chowk shop.

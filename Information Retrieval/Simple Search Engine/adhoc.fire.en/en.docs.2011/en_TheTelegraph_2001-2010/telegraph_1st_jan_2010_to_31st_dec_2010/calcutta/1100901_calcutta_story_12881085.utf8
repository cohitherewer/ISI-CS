	China has donated Rs. 53.6 lakh to Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) for setting up a gallery titled Rabindranath and China in the Tagore Museum on its Jorasanko campus.        
	According to an agreement inked by Mao Siwei, the Chinese consul-general in the city, and Karuna Sindhu Das, the vice-chancellor of RBU, the gallery will display motifs from Chinese civilisation and of Lord Buddha. It will also liaise between the two countries. A part of the gallery will be opened in 2012.

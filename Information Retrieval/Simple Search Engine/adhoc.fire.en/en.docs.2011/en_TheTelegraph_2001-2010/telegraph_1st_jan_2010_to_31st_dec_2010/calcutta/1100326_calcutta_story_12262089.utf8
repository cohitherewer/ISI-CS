The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | It is Park Streets biggest slum
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      It is Park Streets biggest slum
          AMIT UKIL                          Those were the days: Nonagenarian Kamala Malhotra reminiscences how the European charm of Stephen Court slowly eroded. Picture by Aranya Sen				                                 
	I can still remember the tea trolleys rolling onto the terrace (on top of what is now Music World/Peter Cat) with liveried bearers serving the English residents, said 95-year-old Kamala Malhotra, the second oldest lady to have been rescued from Stephen Court during Tuesdays fire.         
	She and her husband, the late Chamanlal Malhotra, who passed away a few months before his 100th birthday on December 1 last year, were the first Indian family to move into the European-dominated Stephen Court.         
	That was in 1948. We came in from Lahore after Partition, the frail but feisty nonagenarian told Metro on Thursday.        
	They moved in as tenants of Flat 11 on the second floor of Block II (Lift No. 2), which was the most affected in the inferno. Everything was so prim and proper those days. I used to scold my son Lalit for playing marbles as the British family below had written to us once, complaining about the noise, the grand old lady said.         
	Her daughter-in-law Rama, who came to the household in 1963, also recalled there was a dedicated plumber, an electrician, sweepers and liftmen, who maintained both decorum and the building.         
	But this legacy of the Raj was eroded as the Europeans left one by one and the premises gave way to commercialisation, egged on by its prime location, Rama rued.        
	Over the 62 years that they have been inhabitants of the iconic-turned-infamous building, they have watched disconcertingly how basic living amenities and safety measures have been ignored.         
	There used to be sand buckets and fire extinguishers on every floor. But they disappeared in the mid-Sixties and never came back, the bahu of the house said.        
	But the worst tragedy was the building of two additional floors in 1984 there was noise, dust, workers and commotion everywhere. Two of our walls developed cracks and my father called in a structural engineer who recommended remedial measures. We had to put up wire meshes to reinforce the walls, said Kamalas granddaughter Rachita.        
	Then, after most of the fourth floor was converted into commercial establishments and the office-dominated fifth and sixth floors came up, the use of lift No. 2 increased.         
	A large number of air-conditioners, refrigerators and other high-voltage equipment were installed, and the supply lines were overloaded. The owners had to put up a high-power generator to cope with the frequent power cuts, said Lalit Malhotra.        
	Another major factor was the way Ram Shankar Singh, officially the pump operator and employee of Stephen Court Ltd, became the kingpin of several mafia-like activities, especially regarding the maintenance of the building.         
	His irresponsible activities led to a lot of inconvenience for the residents. The drains were clogged and the parking lot, sections of which had been converted to shops, was filthy and stinking. We were literally living in the biggest slum on Park Street, Rama said.         
	Her mother-in-law still wonders how she made it out of the flat through the verandah on Tuesday.         
	I have two artificial knees. When I saw they would tie a rope around me and take me down a ladder, I thought it was better to die than go down that way. I thank the brave youths who helped me and my family out of the flat, said Kamala Malhotra.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      First steps back home     - Path being cleared for return and reconstruction          OUR BUREAU                          A cop inspects a damaged portion of Stephen Court on Tuesday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                        
	The residents of the two unscathed blocks of Stephen Court are free to return home if they agree to fulfil some short-term conditions and sign a risk bond, while the civic body has agreed in principle to allow reconstruction of the fire-ravaged blocks I and II of the Park Street landmark.        
	The short-term conditions include getting the entire building rewired and electrical earthing installed in each apartment.        
	Representatives of the 80-odd families of the third and fourth blocks met a team comprising police, fire services, CESC and civic officials at the office of the deputy commissioner (south) on Tuesday morning.        
	Prima facie, most parts of the third and fourth blocks were unaffected by the fire. A joint team visited each flat in the two blocks and asked the residents to take some immediate measures. Once the measures are in place, the families can return by signing a risk bond. Those who lived in the first and second blocks will not be allowed to return for now, said Debasish Kar, the director-general (building) II of the CMC.        
	Block III resident Debasish Guha Neogi, however, said most families would rather wait till the civic body declares the building structurally safe than rush in after signing a risk bond.        
	We will abide by all the conditions but signing the bonds would only help the administration disown its responsibilities, said Guha Neogi. The Stephen Court Residents Association which had become defunct was revived on Tuesday as the residents agreed to take the responsibility of fulfilling the conditions.                           
	Sources in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation said it would take at least three months to complete all the formalities to declare the building safe.        
	The residents will have to set up a staircase for emergency exit, instal smoke and fire alarms in each block and enclose the elevator shaft.        
	Once the measures are undertaken, registered structural engineers will visit the building to ascertain its stability. Based on the report of the engineers, we will ask the residents to carry out necessary repairs. Only after the entire process is completed will we be in a position to declare the building safe, said Kar.        
	A CESC official said the residents would not be allowed to use the elevator and other power-guzzler gadgets such as air-conditioners, geysers and automatic generators, for the time being.        
	A number of commercial establishments in blocks III and IV, the official added, used to draw power illegally. There were several illegal sub-meters and the residents of a few flats had constructed rooms over false ceilings, the official said after inspecting the building.        
	The owners of commercial establishments will be allowed to reopen their premises after all the inspections are over and experts submit detailed reports.         
	Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters) said: The entire building, except for a few closed shutters, has been scanned. The CMC will dismantle the badly damaged parts on Wednesday.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said the reconstruction of the damaged parts could be allowed as there was nothing illegal with the structure. That was proved by documents accessed by The Telegraph on Sunday.        
	Director-general (building) G.C. Mondal, however, clarified that the civic body would not allow vertical expansion of the building in the name of reconstruction.        
	On Tuesday, the bodies of four more victims were identified at SSKM Hospital. The victims were Tapati Chakraborty, Amit Gupta, Richa Dutta and Bhagyashree Dhali. There are some legal problems over Bhagyashrees body. The other bodies have been handed over to family members, said an official.        
	Buddha seeks list        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Tuesday asked fire minister Pratim Chatterjee to submit at the earliest a comprehensive list of gadgets the fire department needs.        
	The chief minister wants the gadgets to be procured within six months, said a Writers official. Several experts have blamed the high death toll in the Stephen Court fire on the lack of preparedness of the department. Thats why the chief minister wanted to take stock of the situation.        
	Bhattacharjee is learnt to have made it clear to the minister that he wants an upgrade of the fire-fighting system.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | German docs heal scars, mend lives
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      German docs heal scars, mend lives
          RITH BASU                                    
	Four plastic surgeons and two specialist nurses from German hospitals spent 11 days at a camp in a Shibpur hospital recently, bringing a smile on the faces of over 60 people scarred congenitally or in mishaps.        
	Doctors Schwarz, Barensktter, Piry and Gunther Zabel and sisters Ute Sparenberg and Marianne Zabel conducted free surgeries between January 12 and 22. Shri Jain Hospital and Research Institute in Shibpur provided free beds and infrastructure.        
	The medical professionals belong to the German voluntary organisation, Interplast, which conducts such camps in different countries.        
	We conducted surgeries on post-burn contracture cases as well as corrective surgeries on lips and cleft palates. We also treated two children with congenital anomalies, said Gunther Zabel, from Lrrach State Hospital. Accompanying him was his wife Marianne, a nurse specialised to assist during plastic surgeries.        
	According to the doctors, 150 patients from Bengal and the neighbouring states came to the camp. After screening, 62 of them were selected for surgery.        
	Among those selected for treatment was 13-year-old Gudia Khatoon, whose fingers of both hands were conjoined from birth.         
	She had learnt to write with great difficulty and is a good student. But she would face problems during exams. Now, with the doctors separating the fingers on her right hand, life will be a lot easier for her, said her sister, Sultana Parveen.        
	Our father is a musician in a band. We could never have afforded this treatment, she added.        
	Gudias other hand will be operated upon next year, when Interplast is expected to send another team to the hospital.        
	Helmut Barensktter, who is a surgeon with Zentrum Ambulance, Surgery and Diagnostics, Freiburg, said that this was his sixth camp in his seven years as an Interplast member.         
	The doctors also operated upon Rupali Mitra, 21, of Kolaghat, who was burnt badly after her in-laws had allegedly set her ablaze two years ago. It was a difficult surgery. Poor post-burn care had resulted in her chin getting stuck to her chest. After restoring the face to its normal position, we took some good skin from her back and repaired the face, said Gunther Zabel.

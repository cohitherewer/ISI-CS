The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chai, cocktails amp; a lit fest
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Chai, cocktails amp; a lit fest
										      BOOK BAZAAR                        Senior citizens go on a tour of the city as part of the Apeejay Kolkata Literary Festival				                           
	The city hosted a literature festival from January 15 to 17 that unfortunately came to an abrupt end following the demise of Jyoti Basu.         
	The Apeejay Kolkata Literary Festival, held in Jit Pauls memory, could be attended to the accompaniment of chai and samosa at an open air heritage site or beer and cocktail snacks in a lounge bar.         
	The festival, which included 11 sessions, started with an adda on the lit-up lawns of St Johns Church to the accompaniment of organ music. Amit Chaudhuri, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Sujata Sen and Sam Miller had gathered to chat on Reading Kolkata  And the World. While Sunil reminisced about Coffee House, he was gently prodded by moderator Sujata Sen into recollecting his struggle with Krittibas, a poetry magazine he founded.         
	During the Sixties I started to teach for a living but all my money would go into Krittibas. I ran into debts and found myself dodging press managers but one caught up with me and advised me to write a novel to clear my debts. I wrote Aranyer Din Ratri, which was later turned into a film by Satyajit Ray. It helped clear all my debts, recounted the author.         
	Amit Chaudhuri, who thinks of himself as an outsider writing on the city, talked of the compelling decay and ugliness of the city, much like Allen Ginsberg writes on New York. He found Calcutta had contradictory, magical and revolting associations, a city that was a mixture of shabbiness and vibrancy.         
	The adda was wound up by writer-journalist Sam Miller. I had come to interview Satyajit Ray and asked him about the controversy of calling Calcutta a decaying city. Ray told me to ride the Metro to find out if it indeed was true.         
	So Miller went to the nearest Metro station and as a train was approaching, held the microphone of his recorder to capture the sound of the train. He found himself arrested on charges of trying to photograph the Metro station. He tried in vain to convince the policemen that he wasnt really shooting. As proof Miller replayed his interview with Ray. It was only after hearing Rays rich baritone that the police let him go but not before asking me how Ray was and when would he resume making films, narrated Miller.        
	The festival had started with a childrens event, Igniting Young Minds, at Anand Childrens Library at Apeejay School, where around 50 children from the slums around Park Street were entertained by Bickram Ghosh and his wife, dancer Jaya Seal, and dancer Arupa Lahiry.         
	More fun was in store for the kids in the afternoon, organised by Animal Magic with author Padmini Mongra and editor Anita Roy.         
	On the second day, graphic novelist Sarnath Banerjee highlighted the difference between a comic book and a graphic novel at the session Telling Stories: The Graphic Novel and Original Music. Accompanying him were animator Debjani Mukherjee and moderator Abhijit Gupta.         
	A graphic novel is a narrative piece of literature that generally deals with more mature and durable themes compared with comic books, suggesting a defined story-line with a beginning, middle and an end, said Banerjee.         
	At the same time a different venue hosted the session Sex and the City with authors Ruchir Joshi, Sonia Jabbar and Rimi B. Chatterjee, who was the only one aptly attired in an LBD with black stockings for the occasion.         
	On the final day, the Apeejay team took the inmates of Nabaneer, a home for the aged, for a short trip around the city in the festival tram. They returned to Oxford Bookstore where they were entertained by Baul musicians Paban Das Baul and Mimlu Sen. Percussioning with them was Sayantani Majumdar.       WITH INPUTS FROM ANVESHA SINHA

          Todays question: If you are inducted into the advisory committee of your local civic body what advice would you offer?                              Malfunctioning street lights are a nagging concern and (above) anti-mosquito drives a dire necessity for Calcutta, feel many Metro readers. Telegraph pictures				                                       Debasish Chatterjee,
  VIP Road					       
	If I am inducted into the advisory committee of our local civic body, I would suggest that major civic works be offered strictly on the basis of tenders, not favouritism. Road repair should be properly supervised so that patchwork jobs are eliminated.       
	The process of tax collection should be simplified and all assessees should get periodic statements.       
	Lorries carrying garbage should be covered with plastic sheets so that garbage is not strewn on the roads and the stench is kept to a minimum.                 ATIF AYAZ,
  Serampore, Hooghly								       
	Calcutta is more polluted than other metros. The civic body must adopt means to beautify each locality. As an adviser to the civic body, I would first target waterlogging.       
	Secondly, a regular system of garbage removal must be followed and the spread of diseases stopped. Thirdly, roads need to be repaired periodically.       
	Lastly, the civic body must keep tabs on the promoter raj in the city to curb illegal constructions.             
	J.K. BUBNA,       
	CR Avenue      
	First I would recommend a second layer of elevated roads for most of the roads in the city and the construction of parking lots in the basements built under parks.       
	The design of roadside drains should be changed to prevent garbage and plastic bags from falling through.       
	Property tax should be uniform throughout the city. The redevelopment of heritage buildings should be allowed only if the facade of the new structure resembles the original one.                M. Dokania, 
  Address not given									      
	Calcutta faces the twin problem of waterlogging and depleting underground water.      
	I suggest that rain water be allowed to go underground instead of being pumped out. The present drainage system has a cement layer that prevents water from seeping below the surface. Holes can be drilled (like those in a shower head) and water will find its own way down. Of course, electric and phone lines should not be damaged.      
	A.S.MEHTA,       
	New Alipore      
	I would advise the civic body to remove all hoardings nailed to trees and stop cutting off thick branches in the name of pruning.       
	I would also ask them to ensure that pavements are kept clear of eateries and roads and drains kept clean. Anti-mosquito drives are of utmost importance and piling of building materials on the road should be banned.             
	FAZAL HUSSAIN,       
	Jhowtala Lane      
	I would lay stress on hygiene. Gammexane should be sprayed on both sides of the pavements every morning. Civic officials should ensure sufficient number of dustbins are placed on roadsides. Street lights should be switched on punctually every evening, keeping in mind the safety of residents. The authorities should also ensure there is no waterlogging during monsoon.             
	P.B. SAHA,       
	Salt Lake      
	I would lay stress on uninterrupted supply of purified water, for which citizens have to pay water tax. Road repairs carried out in undue haste with poor quality materials is another major area of concern that I would look into.            
	SUBHANKAR MUKHERJEE,       
	Burdwan      
	I suggest withdrawal of the water tax as most houses in Burdwan draw water from tubewells. The 10,000 illegal autos pose another problem that needs to be dealt with.             
	AMRITA MALIK,       
	Salt Lake      
	A fair amount of street lights are required. Most of the lights are overshadowed by huge trees. The rest are either switched off or need repairs. Thirdly, the trees in Salt Lake require thorough trimming.  
	Next week  
	How should errant students be disciplined?

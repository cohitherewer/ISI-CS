The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rule flout charge against school
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rule flout charge against school
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The father of a 10-year-old boy detained in Class IV by a teacher, who was allegedly denied a laptop as bribe, has moved the high court accusing the school of violating the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009.        
	The fathers lawyer said the act prohibited schools from detaining students till Class VIII. The writ petition, likely to be heard this week, also charges the school with torture and extortion.        
	The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, state government and the principal and some teachers of the school have been made party to the case.        
	Weve filed a case of mental torture, extortion and violation of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act. Our stand does not contradict the ICSE rule that bans detaining students till Class IV, said the lawyer.        
	The secretary of the south Calcutta school refused to comment as the matter was sub judice. We have received the petition on Saturday.... We are looking into it and will make our submission in court, he said.        
	The boys detention in Class IV for two consecutive years had prompted his father to lodge an FIR with Shakespeare Sarani police station on April 2. The complaint stated that the class teacher had turned vindictive towards the boy after his father refused to gift him a laptop. I have text messages on my phone to prove that my sons class teacher demanded a laptop, the father had earlier told Metro.        
	On April 28, the school informed the boys family that he had been issued a transfer certificate which mentioned that he had been detained in Class IV.        
	What will I do with such a certificate? I want my son to start going to school again. I was demanding justice for my son which I did not get from the school, the father said.        
	The accused class teacher is absconding. We had gone to his home in Thakurpukur but he was not there, said an officer. The teachers bail plea has been rejected by the sessions court. He has moved an appeal in the high court, said the officer. The hearing is scheduled for Monday.

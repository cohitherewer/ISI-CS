The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Designs for tomorrow
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Designs for tomorrow
                          Vidyasagar Setu took 22 years to be built at a cost Rs 3.88 billion. It was opened to traffic on October 10, 1992. This cable-stayed bridge is one of Asia rsquo;s longest. The graceful structure stands on four pylons, and is supported by 121 wire cables. It was designed by Schlaich Bergermann amp; Partner of Germany, assisted by Freeman Fox and Partners, London.                          
	New things have a way of becoming old quite imperceptibly, without drawing much attention to the ageing process. Calcutta may be a young city, only 300 and a couple of years old, yet it looks bruised and battered, quite unlike some ancient cities in the West, which seem to be frozen in time. The priceless legacy of Calcuttas built heritage has been allowed to perish and developers seem to have been given a free hand to destroy and reconstruct grand old buildings in the name of restoration.         
	Some have been consumed by mysterious fires, the latest casualty being the Strand warehouse, while others, neglected for years, are ready for the attack of the demolition squad. The stately Standard Chartered building in BBD Bag tied up in a legal wrangle may soon join the league of Calcuttas Noble Dead Buildings.         
	Instead of looking back, Metro on Sunday looks at 10 likely candidates that can join the citys heritage list of the future. There is not much to choose from, as the new buildings are mostly concrete and glass cubes. The proposed list stresses environment in the city that enjoys the distinction of being one of the most polluted anywhere. Included are precincts and shops that hold up the citys tradition of cuisine and culture and even a green mode of transport being given the short shrift.         
	The 10 items/sites on our wish list obviously do not enjoy any legal protection now. The essence of what makes each site unique or special has to be identified first. Then one goes about figuring out how much is to be protected and how. There is no universal criterion for this. And this should not be on paper alone, as in the case of the so-called heritage buildings of today. Unless this is done fast, time will take its revenge.             Tata Centre        Our most visible and stylish highrise building stands out against the cluttered skyline hellip; after dark it looks scintillating. Designed by Ballardie, Thompson amp; Matthews, its foundation stone was laid in 1964. Nothing to match its form yet.                 Maidan    
	We owe what is known as the ldquo;lungs of the city rdquo; to Robert Clive who cleared the jungles of Gobindapur village to build Fort William. This parkland is the city rsquo;s last open space, but unless political parties are prevented from holding rallies there, it may become a thing of the past.  
	Already protected under the Ramsar Convention, this unique ecological system covering 300 waterbodies and agricultural tracts is spread over 12,500 hectares along the EM Bypass. It takes huge quantities of solid urban waste, liquid sewage and polluted air, and recycles them into clean air and fresh water, fresh fish and vegetables.

	This beleaguered waterbody in Beleghata is the only one of its kind in the north. Under threat from land sharks, it is used as a garbage dump and open-air toilet, and the two-lane road around it 
  has driven all the birds away. (Anindya Shankar Ray)
                        (From Top) Oxford Bookstore in Park Street and Dasgupta in College Street            
	The Oxford Bookstore is in Park Street and Dasgupta in College Street. The first has turned into a swank gallery where books are launched regularly. The second, ravaged by a fire, still caters to the intellectuals of our ldquo;boipara rdquo;. (Amit Datta)                         Mishtir dokan      
	K.C.Das, Girish Chandra Dey amp; Nakur Chandra Nandy and Bhim Chandra Nag, the three quintessential Bengali sweet shops are famous all over India for their rosogolla, sandesh and mishti doi. They have been there for over a century and they should continue their sweet ministrations forevermore. Without them Calcutta will never be the same again.              Dhakuria Lakes      
	Developed by the Calcutta Improvement Trust, the huge waterbody with an idyllic little island in its middle is popular among promenaders, lovers and oarsmen alike. The original lake covered 76 acres which was connected later to the extension. Surrounded by trees, it is indeed charming.                 Kumartuli        The birthplace of gods and goddesses in north Calcutta is a tiny village of clay artisans who have been working there for generations. Most of them are untrained, yet their creations travel not only all over the country but the world as well. One of our biggest tourist attractions.                  Tramways        This is the last bastion of streetcars in India and it hardly leaves any carbon footprint behind. Yet it is the least favoured mode of transport. Horse-drawn when introduced in mid-19th century, today the tramways network is spread all over the city. Artists and academicians from Melbourne had in 1991, 2001 and 2002 organised Tramjatra, the big public art event, that brought back the focus on trams.

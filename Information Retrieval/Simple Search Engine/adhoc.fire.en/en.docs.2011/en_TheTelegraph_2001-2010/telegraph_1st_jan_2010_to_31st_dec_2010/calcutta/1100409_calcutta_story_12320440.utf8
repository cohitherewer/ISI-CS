The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Six-screen plex fires price salvo
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Six-screen plex fires price salvo
          PRIYANKA ROY                                            
	The first shot in the multiplex ticket price war has been fired.        
	Bioscope, the citys first theme plex that will open its doors in Rajarhat on Poila Baisakh, announced its decision to price tickets at Rs 75. Any film, any day, any show.         
	The Bengali audience at a multiplex is a paltry two per cent. In the new year, we wanted to gift every Calcuttan the right and power to watch a film in a superior plex ambience, said Arijit Dutta, the managing director of Priya Entertainments Pvt. Ltd and the man behind single-screeners Priya and Star Theatre.        
	Housed at the Axis Mall in Rajarhat, Bioscopes promise of a plex experience at a price lower than that of a single screen comes at a time when the other plex players in the city have their ticket price points touching Rs 150-Rs 200 almost any given Friday.        
	There are so many people in this city who are passionate about cinema, but are unable to afford the high ticket rates at the plexes. Bioscope has been floated to fulfil that need, said Dutta, primarily targeting the middle-income-group in the New Town area to make good the Rs 17 crore investment.        
	At Bioscope, the emphasis will be on showcasing various art forms. Of the six audis spread over 43,000sq feet, three will be primarily for movie screenings, one will be a stage-cum-screen for films and plays, one is designed specifically for children, while the last one will function as a rehearsal centre for stage performances.         
	Though wary of the newest player on the plex block, other chains will wait and watch before reviewing their price points.        
	If a new player starts off with a lower price point, it doesnt mean that the other established players will follow suit. Our patrons are willing to pay double for the Gold Class experience at South City when they have the option to watch the same film in the Silver Class at a much lower price. At the end of the day, it is the customers experience that counts and we will continue to enhance that experience, rather than lowering our ticket prices, said Rishi Negi, the chief operating officer of Fame Cinemas.        
	Agreed Virendra Marya, the regional director of INOX: Each multiplex has its own pricing policy that is formulated keeping in mind the location, target group and the film being screened. Our ticket rates  especially at INOX Rajarhat which is in the same catchment area as Bioscope  are extremely competitive.        
	The ticket price range at Fame South City stretches from Rs 50 to 250, while at INOX Rajarhat its Rs 50 to 190.        
	Even the newer plex chains struggling for footfalls put up a brave front. Our audience knows which plex to go to for a superior movie experience and they do not mind spending a little extra, said Devang Sampat, the senior vice-president of Cinemax at Mani Square. The ticket price there ranges from around Rs 50 to Rs 150.        
	Big Cinemas at Sector V was the only one to admit being worried by Bioscopes entry price. We operate on such low prices ourselves that is it impossible to bring down the ticket rates further. We are looking to combat Bioscopes low ticket rates through an aggressive marketing blitz, stressed a Big Cinemas official. By low prices he meant the Rs 40-to-Rs 150 bracket.        
	Can the multiplex business afford a price war and is low pricing carrot enough for the consumer? As more and more players get into the market, the industry pie gets larger, contributing to greater revenue. The single-screen crowd will upgrade to the Rs 75-plex experience, but few plex loyalists from other parts of the city will switch to Bioscope because proximity plays a vital role, felt Mumbai-based industry expert Ranjan Singh.         
	But some like the National Award-winning film-maker Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury seemed buoyant about the Bioscope experience. Calcutta needs something new and after a hard days work, there will be many who will not think twice about driving down to catch a film at Bioscope. I know that I will.

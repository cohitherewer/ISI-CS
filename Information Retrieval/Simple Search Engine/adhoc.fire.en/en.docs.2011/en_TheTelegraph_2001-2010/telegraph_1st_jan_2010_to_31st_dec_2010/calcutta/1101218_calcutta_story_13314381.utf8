The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clash finger at partial police
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Clash finger at partial police
  - Questions on cop role at Asutosh College; last years unrest prompts district to change election rules         A STAFF REPORTER                          Policemen try to stop SFI supporters from marching to Mamata Banerjees Kalighat home on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Police could have prevented the clash outside Asutosh College on Thursday that left a student without vision in his left eye had they reacted in time and been impartial, believe senior officers, past and present.         
	Proximity of SFI supporters to those of the Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad, according to cops who have tackled similar situations, triggered the face-off.         
	Why did the police allow SFI supporters to come so close to the dais on Basanta Bose Road adjoining the college where Trinamul Chhatra Parishad activists were holding a meeting? What stopped the police from stopping the SFI? asked a retired police officer.         
	A senior officer who was deployed at the spot claimed: We could not anticipate that the SFI students would walk into the Trinamul gathering the way they did. And we reacted too late.         
	Witnesses said more than 100 SFI supporters had kept marching towards the Basanta Bose Road dais ignoring the pleadings of the officer-in-charge of the local Bhowanipore police station.        
	The best thing we could have done was to ask the SFI students to hold their rally elsewhere, said a senior IPS officer.         
	The police could not forcibly stop SFI students from approaching the dais since minutes ago, a Chhatra Parishad rally had taken the same route.         
	We had allowed the Chhatra Parishad rally to pass through Basanta Bose Road as the Congress and Trinamul are allies. When the SFI supporters too wanted to tread the same path and said it was their constitutional right, we had no ground to stop them, explained an officer.        
	Asked why only Trinamul supporters were arrested for the clash that followed, an officer said: Our priority was to restore peace. Arresting an SFI supporter after one of them was badly injured in the eye could have escalated the violence.        
	The Trinamul union had originally planned the meeting on Wednesday. Cops asked them to postpone the programme as the SFI was to hold a meeting at the same spot on the same day.        
	While the Trinamul wing postponed their plan by a day, the SFI, instead of holding their programme as scheduled, brought out a rally at a time when their rivals were holding a meeting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | One-way formula to ease tech hub traffic flow
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      One-way formula to ease tech hub traffic flow

	The Sector V administrative authority plans to make two key arteries one-way to ease traffic congestion in the tech hub.        
	According to a blueprint prepared by the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, vehicles will only ply from the Nicco Park intersection towards the SDF crossing and from the SDF intersection towards the Technopolis crossing.         
	Traffic plying in both directions on the double-lane roads is causing major congestion in Sector V. About 10,000 vehicles cross the 1.5km stretch between the SDF and the Technopolis crossings daily. The road was designed to bear the load of about 2,000 vehicles every day but the average peak-hour traffic is close to 1,000 vehicles per hour, said Badrinarayan Kar, an executive officer of Nabadiganta.        
	Since the road cannot be widened, the only option to reduce congestion is to make the road one-way, added Kar.         
	The aim is to ensure that the bulk of the traffic enters Sector V through the Nicco Park crossing, takes a left turn at the SDF intersection and exits the tech hub through the Technopolis crossing.        
	Vehicles headed for Sector V from New Town will not be allowed to turn left from the Technopolis crossing. They can take the Nabadiganta flyover to reach the Nicco Park crossing and then turn left into Sector V, said Kar.        
	The four narrow roads that connect the SDF-Technopolis stretch with the Salt Lake Bypass will remain two-way.        
	Vehicles coming from the direction of Rajarhat can take the four roads to reach SDF-Technopolis stretch but will not be allowed to take a right turn there and move towards the SDF crossing. We realise the system may initially cause problems, especially for those coming from New Town, but ultimately commuters will benefit, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of Nabadiganta.        
	The authorities want to implement the plan as soon as the underground sewage work, being carried out by the Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company, is completed.        
	The project is scheduled to be completed in the next 30 days and then we will implement the new traffic plan, added Ahmed.        
	Sources, however, said the sewage project could stretch one more month.        
	Apart from the high volume of traffic, illegal parking, slow-moving rickshaws and autorickshaw stands are responsible for the congestion on the narrow SDF-Technopolis road.        
	Once the road is made one-way, we will regularise the autorickshaw stands and take action against illegal parking. A multi-tier parking lot will come up shortly to ease the congestion, said Kar.        
	Sector V employees are uncertain about the efficacy of the plan.        
	The proposed plan may ease traffic congestion but people who work in Sector V will face problems in returning home from work as they will have to walk all the way to Technopolis to get Calcutta and Salt Lake-bound transport, said Shriya Banerjee, an employee of a firm in the IT hub.        
	She also felt it would be unsafe to walk to Technopolis and wait there for transport after dark.         
	We are also planning to introduce buses that will make the rounds of Sector V, ferrying people to a bus depot that will be set up on the EM Bypass crossing, off Salt Lake DL Block. Although the bus unions are opposing the plan, we are confident of executing it by the middle of the year, said the executive officer of Nabadiganta.

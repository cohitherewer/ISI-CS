The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Babys liver transplant a success
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Babys liver transplant a success

	Roshan Ali, suffering from a congenital liver disease and confined to bed, had almost no chance of survival a year ago.        
	A year after, the 19-month-old son of a mason from a Burdwan village runs around like any other child, thanks to the first and till now the only successful liver transplant in eastern India.        
	To save the babys life, father Rajab Ali had donated a part of his liver, for which he and his family have been disowned by his parents.        
	The operation was performed at the School of Digestive Medicine and Liver Disease at SSKM Hospital on April 24 last year.        
	In February this year, SSKM doctors had attempted the states first cadaver liver transplant on 46-year-old Jayanti Chatterjee. But the patient died a few hours after the surgery because of primary graft failure and rejection by her immune system.        
	Roshan had been diagnosed with extrahepatic biliary atresia  a rare condition in which the common bile duct in newborns is blocked or has not developed. In Roshans case, it hasnt developed.        
	Such patients dont live for more than 10 months. A liver transplant is the only hope of survival, said Abhijit Chowdhury, the director of the School of Digestive Medicine and Liver Disease, who led the team of doctors that operated on Roshan.        
	The toddler had been suffering from neonatal jaundice since his birth at Burdwan State General Hospital. As his condition deteriorated we took him to SSKM where doctors said my son needed a liver transplant, said Rajab Ali, who brought back his son to the hospital for a check-up last week.        
	Rajab decided to donate a part of his liver to save his sons life but funds were a major hindrance. The mason whose monthly income is less than Rs 3,000 could not have arranged for the Rs 6 lakh that the doctors said would be needed for the transplant.        
	But Roshan was fortunate as a number of organisations  including the Liver Foundation, West Bengal  and the state health department came forward and raised the funds.        
	A fortnight after the surgery, we knew for sure that Roshan was out of danger. He can lead a normal life though for sometime now he will be on immuno suppressive drugs, said Chowdhury.        
	The boys medicines, which cost Rs 5,000 a month, are being provided by Liver Foundation.        
	Rajab, who had donated 20 per cent of the liver, has recovered, too.        
	Liver regenerates and gets back to normal size on its own, said Chowdhury.        
	My parents and relatives had urged me not to donate a part of my liver as they thought both of us would die. But my wife and I were determined to save our sons life, said Rajab.        
	He has no regret about being disowned by his parents.         
	We had lost all hope. But after the surgery, he plays like any normal child, said Roshans mother Rabia Begam.

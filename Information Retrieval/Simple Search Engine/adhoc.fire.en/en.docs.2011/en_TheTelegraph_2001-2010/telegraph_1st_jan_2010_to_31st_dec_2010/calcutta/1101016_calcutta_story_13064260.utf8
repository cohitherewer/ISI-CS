                      A life of suffering and sacrifice                    Epics all over the world abound in women sinned against: Sita, Draupadi, Iphigenia, Antigone, and many more. Based on a little-known story from The Mahabharata, Nandikars Madhabi tells the tragic tale of a girl who is consciously used by various men as a pawn to serve their own ends. Madhabi represents womanhood, perpetually demeaned, desecrated, debauched and deflowered to fulfil the desires and ambitions of men. Her story is a tempestuous journey of a woman confronting a hierarchy that is steeped in moral pretence and demonic in its desperation for status and power. Expected to fulfil the impossible, both in duty and in love, she raises questions on faith, identity and on being used, abused and misused over and over again. Yet, the play offers more than merely a feminist manifesto. The trials of her life and her responses to them give us a chance to discover the boundless goodness endowed in each of our hearts. Drama: Bhisma Sahni. Adaptation, music and direction: Swatilekha Sengupta.             Event: Play in Bengali, Madhabi, produced by Nandikar When: Today; 3 pm amp; 6.30 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts

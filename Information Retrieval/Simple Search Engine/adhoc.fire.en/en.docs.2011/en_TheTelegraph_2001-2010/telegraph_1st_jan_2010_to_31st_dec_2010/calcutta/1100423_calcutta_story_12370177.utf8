The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Woman dies in lift mystery
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Woman dies in lift mystery
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sreejata Talukdar                                   
	A 25-year-old beautician with an MBA degree was found fatally injured at the base of the lift shaft of a five-storeyed Howrah building on Thursday moments after she stepped out of her parents top-floor flat.        
	How Sreejata Talukdar landed at the bottom of the cavity with the lift cage above her is something that has perplexed police as well as her family.        
	Her husband of six months, 30-year-old Subhinder Singh, was with her parents Swarup and Mita Talukdar when the mishap occurred around 11.30am. The couple used to live in another flat on the same floor.        
	We heard a thud from near the lift within a minute of my wife leaving my in-laws flat. We ran out and called Sreejata on her cellphone but it kept ringing, said Subhinder, who runs a family business.        
	Neighbours in the building at Jetiabagan, in Bally, brought out Sreejata after prising open the lifts ground-floor collapsible gate. She was taken to Uttarpara State General Hospital, where doctors declared her dead.        
	We are clueless how her body reached the base of the lift. We have requisitioned the services of forensic experts to crack the mystery, said an officer of Bally police station.         
	An elevator engineer said that had the lift cage been on the top floor, Sreejatas fatal fall could have been put down to a faulty gate. In that case, it would have been possible that she opened a defective collapsible gate on one of the lower floors and stepped into empty space without realising it.        
	Father Swarup, 56, confirmed that the lift cage was on the ground floor. One of us pressed the lift button and the cage made its way up, revealing Sreejata lying below, he said.        
	Sreejata had completed her MBA from a private institute in Pune a year ago and worked with HCL in Calcutta but quit the job a month before her marriage. She later joined her mothers beauty parlour on GT Road.

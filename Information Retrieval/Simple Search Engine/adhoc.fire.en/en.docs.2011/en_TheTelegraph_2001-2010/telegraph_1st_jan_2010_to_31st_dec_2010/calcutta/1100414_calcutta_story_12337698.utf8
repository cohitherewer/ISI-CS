The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Death sparks pent-up rage
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Death sparks pent-up rage
          ZEESHAN JAWED AND SUBHAJOY ROY                                            
	Netai Dey was one of the angry faces in the mob of hundreds that ransacked Peerless Hospital for close to three hours on Tuesday morning.        
	The 21-year-old, who was on his way to work at a small eatery in Jadavpur, had to forgo his daily wage of Rs 100. But for Netai, it was a good days work, away from work.        
	The hospital has done nothing for the local people.All they want is money. We wanted to teach them a lesson, said Dey, tending to his right hand, injured in the desperate bid to smash the glass pane at the registration counter of the hospital with a brick.        
	The eldest of seven children of a rickshaw-puller claimed that he had hardly picked a fight with anyone ever since he dropped out of a local school 10 years ago.        
	Tuesday morning was different. My blood boiled when I saw the body of the boy outside the hospital. An innocent life lost because his family could not shell out Rs 40,000.Tomorrow this could happen to me. I had to teach the hospital a lesson, said Dey, shaking with anger.        
	Standing guard at the main gate of the hospital around noon, so that no doctor can leave, the frail youth recounted how he had called up some friends from his cellphone to spread the word.        
	The word spread like wildfire through an area off the Bypass where wetlands  though not under the designated no-development zone  are being rapidly replaced by housing estates and hospitals.        
	By 7.30am all roads paved by rage from the neighbouring areas of Shahid Smriti, Shanti Park, Mukundapur and Katabon led to Peerless Hospital. In no time, the narrow stretch in front of the hospital was swarming with hundreds of angry youths armed with brick, axe and bamboo stick.        
	Netai chose to keep his assault weapons simple  two bricks to smash glass windows and panes  as the hospital premises turned into a battleground and the mob smashed everything that stood in its way. Police were too late, too few and too ill-equipped.        
	Unlike most other recent cases of mob violence at city hospitals, no one carrying out the assault even knew who the victims of the Bypass accident were.        
	Almost all of them were from the neighbouring locality who were harbouring some grudge or the other against the hospital. They had nothing to do with the accident victims, a police officer later said.        
	But why did Netai and hundreds of others go on the rampage without bothering to find out what exactly had happened or without sparing a thought for the hundreds of patients being treated in the largest hospital in the area?        
	According to some of the attackers, the hospitals policy of turning away the underprivileged and treating only the affluent had caused a deep-rooted resentment that was waiting for a spark to explode. Tuesday mornings buzz that a boy had died after being denied treatment was enough to provide that spark.        
	Netais partner-in-vandalism Bikash Samaddar delved into the recent past to justify Tuesdays mayhem: Last month a garage mechanic tried to commit suicide by drinking acid. The Peerless Hospital authorities first asked the family to deposit a large amount of money. The man died on the way to MR Bangur hospital.        
	Some elders in the area held a section of politicians and their false promises responsible for the collective frustration that had festered like a wound.        
	When this hospital was coming up, CPM leader Kanti Ganguly would tell us at every meeting that 50 beds would be reserved for the local people to be treated free. But not a single person from the adjoining areas has benefited from this. The local anger stems from there, said one.        
	But one look at the fear on the faces of patients at Peerless was enough to underline that nothing can justify the mobocracy unleashed by the likes of Netai Dey.

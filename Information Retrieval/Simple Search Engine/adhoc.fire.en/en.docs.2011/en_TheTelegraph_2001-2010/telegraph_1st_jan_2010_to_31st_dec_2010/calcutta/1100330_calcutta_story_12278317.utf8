	The body of a passenger was found inside one of the toilets of the Down Darjeeling Mail on Monday. According to GRP officials, Samrat Dutta Ray, 40, had possibly suffered a cardiac arrest.        
	The Chinsurah resident was found in the toilet of an AC three-tier coach during routine maintenance work in Sealdah on Monday afternoon, said an official of Eastern Railway.        
	Dutta Ray worked as a creative arts coordinator with a private firm and was returning from a business trip in Siliguri, said family sources.         
	According to the railway official, the AC three-tier coach, 99124, was detached from the train and taken to the yard for maintenance. Around 2pm, the workers noticed one of the toilets was locked from inside. They broke open the door and found Dutta Rays body inside, said the official.         
	GRP officials said the body, which bore no external injury marks, had been sent for post-mortem. Dutta Rays family had been frantically searching for him since Sunday morning after his cellphone went unanswered.        
	He had boarded the train on Saturday night without a confirmed ticket. He requested the ticket examiner to allow him to travel since he was not feeling well, the railway official said. The ticket examiner offered Dutta Ray his own berth but he reportedly did not sleep.        
	Later in the night, after the train pulled out of Kishanganj station, coach attendant Vijay Lal had spotted Dutta Rays laptop and mobile phone lying unattended on the berth.         
	On Sunday morning, when there was still no trace of the passenger, Lal handed over the belongings to the ticker examiner. Railway officials retrieved the last number dialled from the cellphone and spoke to Anup Dutta, a friend of Dutta Rays. Dutta identified the belongings and informed the family.        
	Dutta Ray is survived by his wife, two children and parents. He was my only child. He had no history of ailments, said father Supriyo Dutta Ray.

                      Jewels from Jaipur                    A favourite lifestyle and couture destination in the city, 85 Lansdowne is ready to display its festive collection of jewellery, with a special showing at the store from faraway Jaipur. Presented by Gem Plaza, Jaipur, this promises to be one of a kind for the season. Over the last four decades, Gem Plaza has been synonymous with quality, trust and beauty. Its tradition of excellence and uncompromising pursuit of perfection has established it as a creative design house for jewellery and artifacts. Known for its fine gemstone and intricate jewellery craftsmanship since 1727, the era of Sawai Jaisingh, Jaipur has seen the emergence of this art and has achieved global acceptance. Gem Plaza has absorbed the essence of this heritage and acclaimed appreciation for its finely crafted Jadau, Kundan and gemstone jewellery from its clientele spread all over India, UK, USA and other parts of Europe. And now, they bring this exquisite collection to the city with a dazzling collection of festive pieces at surprisingly affordable ranges. While the magical craftsmanship in perfectly-cut diamonds and fine-coloured gemstones speaks of sleek modernity, the traditional pieces in Kundan and Jadau depict royal heritage. This private showing at 85 Lansdowne promises to be a unique experience of the vivid culture of Jaipur.

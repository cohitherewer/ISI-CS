The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | State hospitals turn away two-year-old gasping for breath
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      State hospitals turn away two-year-old gasping for breath
          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	A two-year-old boy struggling for each breath with a one-rupee coin stuck in his respiratory tube was turned away at three state-run hospitals on Friday.        
	The child, Siddhartha Majumdar, was nearly unconscious by the time he was taken to a private hospital, where he was operated upon.        
	The boy from Habra in North 24-Parganas swallowed the coin while playing with it around 11am on Friday. I saw that my son was trying to vomit and asked him what was wrong. He then told me what had happened, said Sikha Majumdar.         
	He was first taken to Habra State General Hospital where officials refused him admission since no ENT surgeon was available.         
	Siddharthas parents then rushed him to RG Kar hospital. Doctors in the emergency department conducted an X-ray and said my son needed surgery immediately, recounted Sikha.        
	When we went to the ENT department around 1.30pm, the doctors there said the surgery could not be scheduled before Saturday morning. They claimed that since Siddhartha had eaten in the morning, the operation could not be started immediately and surgeries were not performed in the hospital after 2pm, added the mother.        
	By then, Siddhartha was gasping for breath. The X-ray showed that the coin was stuck in the trachea, the respiratory tube connecting the voice box with the bronchial parts of the lungs.        
	With our son sinking, we begged and pleaded with the doctors to perform the surgery on Friday but they did not pay any heed, alleged Siddharthas father Manik, a teacher in a primary school in North 24-Parganas.         
	After an hour of futile requests to doctors and officials, Siddharthas parents took him to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.        
	The doctors at the ENT department said there was no bed and so there was no question of removing the coin that night. When we told them that our sons condition was critical, they asked us to go elsewhere, said Manik.        
	In his arms, Siddhartha was then coughing and suffering extreme respiratory distress. The ambulance ferrying them then sped to Peerless Hospital on the EM Bypass.        
	The child was drowsy, barely conscious and his lung function was diminishing, said Sudipto Mitra, the medical superintendent of the hospital.        
	Doctors said the carbon dioxide level in the boys lung had increased because of lack of oxygen supply.        
	The coin was taken out with the help of an endoscope in the evening. The operation took around 30 minutes.        
	The child has recovered completely and was discharged on Saturday, added Mitra.        
	A foreign body in the respiratory tract is extremely dangerous. The patient can suffer acute respiratory arrest, which can lead to death within minutes, said city-based ENT surgeon Dulal Basu.         
	The coin was stuck in a manner that allowed the passage of small amounts of air into the lungs. It could have easily moved and choked the respiratory tract, added Basu.        
	L.K. Vaid, the medical superintendent of RG Kar, admitted that it was an emergency case and the surgery should have been performed. I will find out why the patient was turned away.        
	Health secretary M.N. Roy said: I wont say anything till I find out whether anything like this actually took place.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Shyamal Roy, the treasurer of the BJPs Tripura unit, died after falling off a crowded local train between Bally and Belur stations on Monday afternoon.        
	The 48-year-old arrived at the airport from Agartala, along with 10 party colleagues, at 11.30am. They were to catch the Bhopal Express that was scheduled to leave Howrah Station at 1.15pm. To beat the city traffic, the group went to Bally Halt by taxi. From there they boarded the Burdwan local to reach Howrah.        
	Roy was standing near the gate. Witnesses said one of the two bags he was holding hit an electricity pole by the tracks, causing him to fall. He was pulled under the wheels. Roy is survived by his wife and son.

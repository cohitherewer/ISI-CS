                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Basu battles illness amp; rumour
  - ALL ROADS  AND TALK  LEAD TO SALT LAKE HOSPITAL          OUR BUREAU                                    Jyoti Basus son Chandan and daughter-in-law Rakhi leaving AMRI Hospitals in Salt Lake at 1pm on Wednesday; (above) Mamata Banerjee appears pensive after her visit to the ICU ward of AMRI at 4.50pm.

	Jyotibabu achhen toh (Is Jyoti Basu still with us)?        
	Calcutta was left pondering this question throughout Wednesday as rumours swirled in the real and virtual worlds about the ailing Communist icons death until the evening medical bulletin clarified that he was critically ill but battling on.        
	Amra kichhu bujhtey parchhi na Jyotibabu kemon achhen (We have no clue how Jyoti Babu is doing), said Sreelekha Majumdar, a 58-year-old forest department employee standing outside AMRI Hospitals in Salt Lake.         
	She had gone to the hospital during her lunch break, around an hour after the first medical bulletin at 11.30am said that the 95-year-old former Bengal chief minister  admitted on January 1 with severe pneumonia  had been put on the ventilator.        
	Ora bolchhen condition stable kintu oder body language khub ekta bhalo lagchhe na (They are saying that he is stable but their body language doesnt seem convincing), Sreelekha said, jostling for space in the crowd that swelled by the minute.        
	The arrival of one VIP after the other, including Mamata Banerjee later in the day, fuelled the death rumour.        
	It seems the worst has happened. Why else would so many top leaders come in all of a sudden? wondered a teary-eyed Bikash Mondol, a member of the CPMs Salt Lake committee.            
	Around 2pm, Netizens were already saying RIP, Comrade Basu on blogs and networking sites like Twitter and Facebook, apparently going by unconfirmed breaking news on various sites.        
	Writer-columnist Shobhaa De was among the first to tweet about it, saying Jyoti Babus death is worth mourning. She jumped the gun  or rather the keyboard  and wrote: I remember our last meeting at the Bengal Club vividly. Intellectual giant and idealist. Rare today. RIP.        
	By 3pm, Jyoti Basu was the hottest search on Google in India, with 58 per cent of the queries coming from Calcutta. Blogs with headlines like Jyoti Basu Dead: Long Live Comrade Jyoti Basu topped the Internet hit-list, while some sites came up with Death of Jyoti Basu is a Rumour!!!.        
	For the CPM faithful anxious about their leaders health to Writers Buildings employees curious to know whether they would get the mourning holiday on Thursday or Friday, it all added up to more confusion.        
	We are perturbed by the calls from our party leaders in the districts, who are confused over reports on Basus condition. They are asking us whether they should bring out mourning processions, said a senior CPM leader.         
	Basus personal assistant Joy Krishna Ghosh decided enough was enough and at 3.05pm faced the TV cameras to issue a statement.        
	Nothing has happened to Jyotibabu. Please help in stopping the spread of these baseless rumours. He is critical but under medication, said Basus constant companion, the strain visible on his face.        
	But the rumours refused to die down.         
	Tributes  and some criticism, too  were flowing thick and fast from the Twitteratti till around 6pm. Jyoti Basu is the only great Living Marxist on earth...He defined Marxism in South Asia and Buddhadeb-Prakash Karat distorted it, wrote Sayan.         
	At one point, Jyoti Basu was among the 10 trending topics showing on the Twitter page, a rare phenomenon for an Indian, let alone a Calcuttan. Jyoti Basu was born b4 computers, he was against computers, and now hes a trending topic on Twitter. Funny how life works, tweeted Sunny Sodday from Delhi, a tad irreverently.        
	Left Front chairman Biman Bose lashed out at all the baseless rumours and claimed that the false news of Basus death was being spread to cause pain to his near and dear ones.        
	Around 6pm, the second medical bulletin from AMRI  stating that Basu was critical but showing some positive signs  finally muzzled the death talk.        
	Maybe till the next bulletin.

	Two young men died and three others were seriously injured when a car in which a group of friends was returning home after a day trip smashed into a tree on Canning Road on Sunday night.         
	Kaushik Das, a 27-year-old sales executive at a stock trading firm, and his childhood friend Amit Dhal, 25, died soon after the car hit the tree sideways at Ramdhari near Baruipur around 11pm. Both were sitting at the back.        
	Suman Dey, 22, Sayan Chakraborty, 21, and driver Bhaskar Sardar, 25, were injured. Kaushik was Sayans colleague, while Suman is in the same profession.        
	Police said Sayans father had recently bought the car. The four had been planning the trip to Bhaskars village in Canning since then.         
	According to cops, the five were drunk at the time of the crash and Sayan, who did not have a driving licence, had taken over the steering from Bhaskar.        
	We learnt that Sayan was driving recklessly. The impact of the crash killed Kaushik, who was seated on the left, and Amit, who was in the middle. Both sustained severe head injuries. Suman was vomiting blood after the accident, said Arnab Biswas, the sub-divisional police officer of Baruipur.        
	Kaushik was a resident of Nilachal near Baghajatin and Amit of Narendrapur. Sayan stays at Selimpur and Suman at East Rajapur near Baghajatin.        
	After the accident, the five were rushed to Baruipur Sub-divisional Hospital, where Kaushik and Amit were declared dead. Sayan, Suman and Bhaskar were later shifted to private hospitals in the city. Doctors said the three were stable.        
	Kaushiks family members blamed lack of policing on Canning Road and Sayan for the accident.        
	My son left home in a hurry around noon. I last spoke to him around 9pm. He had said he would return in an hour and have dinner at home, said Kaushiks mother Meera while waiting for the post-mortem to be completed.

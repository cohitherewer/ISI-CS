The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crater mans Calcutta craving   Back where he belonged

  - Geoscientist laments educational mediocrity in favourite city          UDDALAK MUKHERJEE                          Sankar Chatterjee at his south Calcutta home. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                        
	One would have thought Sankar Chatterjee would be familiar with craters, given the number of depressions on the citys roads, although none to quite rival the Calcutta-born geoscientists discovery, Shiva.        
	Shiva being the crater the curator of palaeontology at Texas Tech University recently discovered in the Deccan Traps. Caused by a massive explosion when an asteroid collided with the earth, destroying most life forms on the planet, including the dinosaurs, it is 110 miles in diameter.        
	But the 66-year-old  whose Shiva is even bigger than Mexicos Chicxulub  remembers growing up in a smaller, cleaner city with wide boulevards, smooth roads and tree-lined avenues. And with an education system capable of producing brilliant students across diverse fields.        
	The dismal decline in educational institutions in Calcutta has not escaped the notice of Chatterjee, who is indebted to his teachers (led by his geology teacher, Subir Kumar Ghosh, in Jadavpur University) and the education system of the past. The inability to recognise merit, the spawning of a culture of mediocrity along with the brutal politicisation of education have all contributed to the fall in standard, he says.        
	Chatterjee is also pained by the unnecessary intrusion of the bureaucracy in education, as well as by the active discouragement to free thought and enterprise. Indias premier scientific centres, be it the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad or the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, are few, and they are no more to be found in his own city.        
	He spends much of his time teaching and researching in some of the best educational institutes abroad but, each year, Chatterjee makes it a point to visit Calcutta.        
	Chatterjees family  his parents, five brothers and two sisters  comprised quixotic but talented people. Younger brother Gautam was the founding member of Mohiner Ghoraguli, that pioneered modern Bengali music and lyrics.        
	Gautam used music as a tool to protest against the inequities of the day, reminisced the geoscientist about his musician brother who died young, 10 years ago.                          
	Their father, Prafulla Kumar Chatterjee, had declined an offer from a British company to work for Bengal Chemicals for a paltry pay, on ideological grounds. He was a brilliant student in science, and Chatterjee remembers him gifting facial creams and toothpaste  the fruits of his experiments at home  to relatives during Vijaya Dashami. Chatterjee was his fathers assistant; he remembers holding the spatula or adding the chemicals into a bubbling pot.        
	But Prafullas choice in employment also brought with it a fair bit of hardship. The family had to move from Belgharia to Behala, a shift that kindled in the young Chatterjee an interest in his city and its myriadness.        
	On his comeback trips to Calcutta, Chatterjee indulges in his twin interests: reading and music. One special day is set aside to meet old friends, many of whom are retired academics. His other occupation is to stroll across to Lake Market, a favourite haunt.        
	This time, Chatterjee has been pleasantly surprised by a change: a fall in the level of air pollution.         
	It will soon be time to board a long flight out. And while waiting for the winged machine to take off, Chatterjee would feel a heaviness descend. He knows this feeling too well. It is a strange mixture of pain and longing that can only be dissipated by returning to his favourite city again.

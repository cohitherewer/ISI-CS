The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Critical patient left on floor
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Critical patient left on floor
          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	A 48-year-old man with a critical head injury was left untreated on the floor of SSKM Hospital for 36 hours, forcing his family to shift him to a private hospital where he continues to fight for his life a fortnight later.        
	Prakash Dutta, a resident of Shantipur, Nadia, met with an accident on May 13 while riding his two-wheeler and was taken to Ranaghat Sub-Divisional hospital, from where he was referred to Calcutta.        
	Dutta was admitted to SSKM Hospital around 1.30am on May 14 but kept on the floor of the New Casualty Block, said Ashish Dutta, Prakashs uncle.        
	The Duttas alleged that doctors did not do anything apart from performing a CT scan of Prakashs brain.        
	The scan showed a large clot on the right side of the brain that had paralysed the left side of his body.        
	He lay unconscious on the floor of the ward throughout the day but nobody did anything, said Ashish. In the evening, one of the senior doctors had said unless the patient was immediately shifted to an intensive care unit, he had no chance of survival.         
	We ran from pillar to post but there was no bed available in the ICU. After the authorities said it in writing, we had no option but to shift Prakash, said the uncle.         
	The family members then tried to get Prakash admitted to other state-run hospitals but there were no ICU beds vacant. With time running out, the relatives were forced to shift him to Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) on May 15 afternoon.        
	He was put on ventilator support and is yet to gain consciousness. According to CMRI doctors, Duttas chances of survival would have increased if he had been properly treated at SSKM.        
	The standard norm is to put such patients on ventilator support so that the pressure created on brain by the clot can be controlled to some extent, said a senior city-based critical-care expert.        
	The family is finding it difficult to meet the expenses at the private hospital. The bill has already crossed Rs 1.5 lakh and I had to sell my jewellery to pay up. If the bill continues to mount, I have to think of selling the house too, said Prakashs wife Champa. The familys average monthly income is around Rs 4,000.        
	A surgery was performed to drain out the clot and medicines are being administered to control the pressure exerted by it, said Tapas Chatterjee, the neuro-surgeon at CMRI treating Dutta.         
	However, it is difficult to gauge the chances of his recovery at this stage, he added.        
	The pressure of patients on the state-run hospitals is tremendous. Its next to impossible to get a vacant bed in ICUs. We are planning to increase the number of beds in all state-run hospitals, said a senior health department official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Varsity shadow on Presidency freshers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Varsity shadow on Presidency freshers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Autonomy wait: Presidency College might have to admit undergraduate students as a CU affiliate                                  
	Presidency College will have to admit its first-year undergraduate students this year as a Calcutta University affiliate though a bill granting it the status of a university was passed by the Assembly more than two months ago.        
	Insiders, however, said a move was afoot to ensure that the freshers were finally registered as students of Presidency University.        
	State higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri failed to clarify whether undergraduate courses of Presidency University would start from the coming academic year. As of now, Presidency will admit its first-year students following the existing system, the minister said.        
	Officials said the government would need at least another couple of months to complete all formalities and grant the unitary university status to the College Street institution.        
	Admission to first-year undergraduate courses of CU affiliates, however, will start as early as June 21.        
	Several teachers and students of the college have requested the government to find a way so that the freshers can pursue their undergraduate courses in the new university despite taking admission to a CU affiliate.        
	CU usually registers first-year undergraduate students between August and September. By then, hopefully, the procedure to grant the university status to Presidency will be through. We will urge the government to allow the first-year students of Presidency to register themselves with Presidency University, said a teacher of the college who refused to be named.        
	Presidency principal Sanjib Ghosh welcomed the proposal but said only the government could take the final decision.        
	The Presidency University Bill, after it was approved by the Assembly in March, was referred to Governor M.K. Narayanan for his consent. An official in the higher education department said the governor had referred the bill to the government for making certain additions and alterations.        
	Narayanan is likely to put his seal on the bill after the state government sends it back to him. Once the bill is cleared by the governor, the government will have to issue a gazette notification allowing the college to run itself as a unitary university. The college can start operating as a university at least 15 days after the notification is issued.        
	There are many ifs and buts involved in the process. The government should resolve the issues at the earliest and help Presidency start functioning as a university from this year, said a student who has passed the ISC exam and is waiting to seek admission in Presidency.

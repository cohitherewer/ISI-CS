The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Exam blues in the time of T20 fever
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Exam blues in the time of T20 fever

	IPL 3 is knocking on the door but so are the board exams.        
	Schools across the city are having a testing time counselling their students to keep an eye on their books rather than on the ball.        
	The dates of several T20 matches, including those to be played in Calcutta, are clashing with the exam schedules. As many as seven matches in IPL 3, which starts on March 12, will be hosted at the Eden Gardens between March 14 and April 19.        
	The ICSE, ISC (written) and CBSE (Class X and XII) exams start on March 3, while the Higher Secondary begins on March 17.        
	We understand that most students will find it difficult to rein in their excitement and concentrate on studies during the IPL season. Since the exam dates cannot be changed, we are counselling the students not to get too distracted by the action on the field, said Terence Ireland, the principal of St James School.        
	I cant miss the March 16 match between the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Chennai Super Kings at the Eden, though my accounts exam is on the next day, said Arijit Banerjee, an ISC examinee from Calcutta Boys School and a regular in the Under-19 Bengal cricket team.        
	Missing matches is just impossible, pronounced Varun Maheswari, who will sit for the CBSE Class XII test from Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. I wont be able to join my cousins at the Eden but will definitely catch the action moments on TV.        
	Gauging the T20 mood, schools such as St James, South Point, Patha Bhavan, Birla High for Boys, Don Bosco and Apeejay are giving the students tips to cope with both cricket fever and exam blues.        
	We have told the students to have self-control and not watch entire matches. They can always catch the most interesting moments between their studies, said Mukta Nain, the principal of Birla High School for Boys.        
	Apeejay has urged its students to avoid watching matches live. We have told them to watch the recording. If they are desperate, they should watch the live action only when their favourite players are batting or bowling, said Rita Chatterjee, the principal of The Apeejay School.        
	Teachers of some institutions stressed the need for parental guidance to help students switch from cricket to studies.

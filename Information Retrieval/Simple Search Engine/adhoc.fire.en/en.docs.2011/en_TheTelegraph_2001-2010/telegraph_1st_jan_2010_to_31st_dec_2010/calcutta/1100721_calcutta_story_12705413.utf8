The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sex workers plead for right
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sex workers plead for right
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          A still from Chameli, in which Kareena Kapoor plays a sex worker                                  
	An organisation of sex workers has moved a petition in the high court seeking an order that would grant them the right to carry on their trade without being harassed by police and allow them to take care of their families.        
	The petition filed by the Durbar Mahila Samanway Committee, a registered society engaged in the economic and social uplift of sex workers, challenges some provisions of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act that it claims are unconstitutional.        
	This is the first time that a public interest petition has been filed challenging the validity of some provisions of the ITPA. The case will be heard soon, said Arunava Ghosh, who is representing the committee.        
	The petitioner organisation has pointed out that Article 14 of the Constitution grants the citizen the freedom to pursue any profession for livelihood. Prostitution is a profession and no law should prevent a person from joining or pursuing a profession, the petition states.        
	Sub-section (1) of section 4 of the act states that an adult (above 18 years of age) knowingly living on the earnings of a sex worker shall be imprisoned and/or fined.        
	The petitioner claims the provision is preventing sex workers children from pursuing higher education. The section also bars sex workers from taking care of their aged or ailing relatives.        
	Article 14 of the Constitution guarantees the citizens right to settle down in any part of the country. But the act prevents sex workers from carrying on their business within 200 meters of a religious place, educational institution, hospital or any other public place notified by police or magistrate. This part of the act is also ultra vires the Constitution, the petition claimed.        
	Section 20 of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act makes soliciting clients for prostitution a punishable offence. The section helps the police harass prostitutes... the petitioner claims.        
	Eighteen other sex workers from various parts of the city have become party to the case to support the organisations stand.

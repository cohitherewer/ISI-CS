	In 1941, on the brink of death and in the midst of World War II, Rabindranath Tagore painted a gloomy picture of humanity in his lecture, Shabhyatar Shankat (Crisis in Civilisation).        
	In the 150th year of his birth, five distinguished intellectuals revisited Tagores vision in the context of the conflicts, terrorism and greed afflicting the world today.        
	The panel discussion, The Crisis of Civilisations, presented by the Bengal Club in collaboration with Happenings and in association with The Telegraph, saw scores of Calcuttans braving inclement weather on Thursday evening.        
	The session, chaired by Swapan Chakraborty, the director of the National Library, was flagged off by scientist Partha Ghose, followed by a rousing keynote address by Martha Nussbaum, Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago.         
	A regular visitor to the country for over 20 years, Nussbaum has worked with Nobel laureate Amartya Sen and economist Jean Drze on development models in India. Referring to Tagores The Religion of Man, Nussbaum expressed the fear that history has come to a stage when, once again, the moral man is giving way to the commercial or limited man.        
	Extending her argument to the present state of education the world over, she spoke scathingly on the current policy among greedy politicians in the West to cut down on funding for the humanities. Eager for profit, nations are heedlessly discarding the skills that are needed to keep democracy alive, she said.         
	A countrys development index is determined not by its gross domestic product alone. A human development paradigm, focusing on the improvement of the quality of life, must be factored into any inclusive notion of progress, Nussbaum explained. To this end, she advocated the Tagorean model of school education that enabled individuals to think critically, as citizens of the world, and feel concern for the lives of others. This reformed approach, Nussbaum said, is the only way out of the present morass.        
	Historian Rudrangshu Mukherjee began on a dark note as well, calling Tagores speech a statement of disillusionment. He also closely compared the English translation of Tagores lecture with the Bengali original. The omissions, alterations and distortions to the English text that he brought to light were baffling, if not disturbing, for any admirer of Tagore. For scholars, such revelations should open up new areas of enquiry.         
	The concluding speaker of the evening, historian Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, spoke of a different crisis that Tagore faced while composing his famous oration  the crisis in his own intellectual life. Shabhyatar Shankat, Bhattacharya explained, is like the last proposition of a syllogism Tagore worked through in the course of his life.        
	He also recommended that the essay be read in relation to the ideas propagated by thinkers such as MK Gandhi and Bankimchandra Chatterjee.

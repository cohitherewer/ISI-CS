The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Varsity voter list under scan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Varsity voter list under scan
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Former students contesting the Jadavpur University court council elections have accused the authorities of unfair practices.        
	The court council, which elects members to the universitys highest decision-making body, the executive council, is composed of teachers, students, non-teaching employees and ex-students.        
	Most ex-students do not actively participate in the elections but this year a group of us decided to throw our hats into the ring. That is when we realised that a lot of the practices are unfair, said Ritam Dutta, one of the candidates.        
	He is part of a group of 10 candidates contesting under the Save Education, Save Democracy banner in an attempt to break the stranglehold of the CPM-backed candidates.        
	CPM-backed candidates hold the teaching and non-teaching posts in the court council. Hence, the victory of a CPM-backed candidate from the registered graduate constituency would mean a pro-CPM executive council.        
	The allegations of the candidates under the banner include discrepancies in names and addresses of registered graduates.        
	The printed list has residential addresses of the ex-students but not their contact addresses. The contact addresses are only available to CPM-backed candidates, alleged Dutta.        
	While scrutinising the published list of around 2,700 voters, the candidates found 32 voters had the same permanent address, allegedly belonging to a peon in the Sanskrit department.        
	We cant do anything if the voters who have filled up the form give the same address. We will look into the complaint regarding contact addresses, said Siddhartha Dutta, the pro vice-chancellor of the university.

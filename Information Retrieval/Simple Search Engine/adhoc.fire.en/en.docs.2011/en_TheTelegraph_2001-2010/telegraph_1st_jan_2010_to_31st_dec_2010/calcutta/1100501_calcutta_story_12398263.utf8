The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Monitor mask in tout amp; flout
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Monitor mask in tout amp; flout
          ZEESHAN JAWED                          Thursdays Metro report on farcical driving tests                                   
	One motor vehicles inspector for every two lakh-odd registered vehicles is the excuse for the farcical licence tests in Calcutta where all you have to do is back-seat driving.        
	So acute is the shortage of motor vehicles inspectors that we are forced to go through the motions. You cant expect one inspector to sit beside 200 applicants in a single afternoon and assess their driving skills, declared a senior public vehicles department official following the Metro expose on a Penn Road driving test earlier this week.        
	Motor vehicle inspectors come in two categories: technical and non-technical. The technical inspectors are assigned the duty of assessing the roadworthiness of vehicles, while their non-technical counterparts are responsible for driving tests and vigilance against violators like polluting commercial vehicles and pool cars without permits.        
	The Beltala PVD office, with 14 lakh vehicles under its jurisdiction, has six inspectors who handle everything from driving to vehicle-fitness tests.         
	So how do they manage? Enter, motor training schools and touts. A source said the manpower shortage had not only become an excuse to reduce the driving licence test to a farce but also opened the door for corruption through motor training schools eager to share the spoils with the inspectors.        
	The ratio between inspectors and registered vehicles is skewed in all the regional transport offices, including the one in Alipore that conducts a sham of a driving test on Penn Road once every week with trainers at the wheel, candidates in the back seat and the inspector out of sight.         
	Sources said each regional transport office was currently operating with not more than four inspectors each. The first casualty of this manpower crunch that nobody wants to address is the driving test that determines whether a learner is skilled enough to drive safely.        
	A 2008 initiative to set up a separate inspection and maintenance department is yet to see the light of day. An EM Bypass plot was identified for the purpose but recruitment never took place.

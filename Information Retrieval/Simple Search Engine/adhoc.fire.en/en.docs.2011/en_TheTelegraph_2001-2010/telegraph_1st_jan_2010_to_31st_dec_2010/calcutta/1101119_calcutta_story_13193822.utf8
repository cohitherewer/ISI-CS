                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Student unrest across city
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Student unrest rocked several campuses across the city on Thursday.        
	Trouble started around 1pm at Jaipuria College when some Trinamul Chhatra Parishad representatives went to meet principal Ashok Mukherjee to voice their demands.         
	As they came out of the principals room, a clash ensued with some members of the SFI, which controls the students union of the college.        
	A student of Jaipuria College, Dhiraj Sonkar (BCom, second year), was arrested for rioting and outraging the modesty of a girl, said Jawed Shamim, joint commissioner of police, headquarters.        
	The clash at the Sovabazar college, during which window panes were shattered and tubelights smashed, spread in an hour to Manindra Chandra College in Shyambazar.        
	The police had to chase away some students to control the situation.        
	Leaders of the Trinamul Chhatra Parishad, which controls the union at Manindra Chandra College, alleged that some of them were injured in police excesses.        
	Around the same time, a 30-strong Trinamul Chhatra Parishad delegation got involved in a scuffle with guards on the College Street campus of Calcutta University.        
	The delegation had gone to the university to meet vice-chancellor Suranjan Das, who was abroad.        
	The students picked a fight with guards when they were stopped. They later squatted in front of the locked room of the vice-chancellor, with some kicking the door, said a university official who did not want to be named.        
	The team finally submitted its charter of demands to registrar Basab Chaudhuri. We will look into the demands. The whole thing could have been peaceful.        
	The Jadavpur University campus, too, was tense, with engineering students in the first, second and third years sticking to their stand to boycott the semester exams beginning Friday. The students were demanding withdrawal of the FIR against those who had allegedly clashed with the police on November 9.        
	Pro VC Siddhartha Dutta said: The examination will be held according to schedule. The students have not submitted any demand in writing.

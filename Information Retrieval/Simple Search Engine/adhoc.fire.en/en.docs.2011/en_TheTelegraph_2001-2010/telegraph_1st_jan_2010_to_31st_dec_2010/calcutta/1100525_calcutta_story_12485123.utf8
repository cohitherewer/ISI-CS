The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic alarm on poll eve
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Civic alarm on poll eve
  - Report bursts Bypass bubble					 					      JAYANTA BASU                                                
	A World Bank report has revealed what the manifestos have missed  civic disasters triggered by climate change are set to scar some showpiece zones of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees new-look Calcutta and Mamata Banerjees new London.         
	The study, the first of its kind in India, not only establishes a link between climate change and civic disasters but also identifies the citys development hotspots on either side of the EM Bypass as the most vulnerable wards based on location, infrastructure and range of natural calamities.        
	Seven of the top 10 wards in the danger zone are on the eastern fringes of the city. The 10 wards  57, 58, 59, 63, 65, 66, 74, 80, 108 and 109  include parts of Park Street, Camac Street, Beleghata and the entire length of the Bypass dotted with some of the citys biggest residential complexes.        
	The greater vulnerability of these wards is probably explained by the inadequate infrastructure, unplanned land use, and poor socio-economic and environmental conditions, it states.        
	According to the report, recently submitted to the state government, the lack of drainage would be east Calcuttas undoing.        
	East Calcutta has seen largescale real estate activity over the past couple of decades  a lot of it illegal  with the support of political parties. Several wetlands have been illegally filled up along the Bypass and beyond.        
	Chief secretary Ardhendu Sen, who chaired the meeting where the draft report was presented to the government, admitted that the findings were an eye-opener. The state government has already taken certain steps to combat climate change but this report shows that we still have a long way to go, he said.        
	Manila, Ho Chi Minh City and Bangkok are the other cities where similar studies have been taken up.         
	The report points out that Calcutta and Mumbai in India (are) among the top 10 cities that have high exposure to flooding under the current climate change forecasts.        
	It also forecasts a 1.2 to 1.8 degrees Centigrade rise in temperatures in Calcutta by 2050 along with a fractional increase in rainfall. According to estimates, floods would drain out around Rs 10,880 crore from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in the next four decades.         
	Some experts have since raised questions about why wards in north Calcutta dont figure in the list of most vulnerable wards despite being contiguous to the Hooghly. A few others feel that the rise in sea and river levels in the Sunderbans should be highlighted while calculating the citys vulnerability quotient.        
	A few suggestions might be included in the final report, said chief environment officer Debal Roy, the nodal person for the project.

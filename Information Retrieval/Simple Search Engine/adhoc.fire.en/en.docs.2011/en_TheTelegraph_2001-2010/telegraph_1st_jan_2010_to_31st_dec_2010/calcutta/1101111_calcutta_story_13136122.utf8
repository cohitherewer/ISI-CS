The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Harley vroom for city
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Harley vroom for city
  - Hogs on course for 2011 debut          ANASUYA BASU                          Arnold Schwarzenegger on a Harley-Davidson in a scene from Terminator 2: Judgement Day                                        
	Strap on your helmets, the Hogs are headed for Calcutta.        
	Harley-Davidson India plans to open its first showroom in the city next year, making the 750cc-plus heavyweights from Milwaukee in Wisconsin, US, available to enthusiasts in eastern India.        
	The line-up of the Hogs, as the Harleys are lovingly called in their parent country, includes the Softail Fat Boy that Arnold Schwarzenegger rode in Terminator 2.        
	We have started the process of selecting a dealer. Given the usual timeline of the selection process, we hope to open the doors of our dealership in Calcutta by next year, said Sanjay Tripathi, the marketing director of Harley-Davidson, India.        
	The company is banking on the tremendous biking culture in the city where motorbike races used to be held in the 1950s and 60s in the Behala airfield, said Tripathi. We have received several queries from the city about the bikes. There was tremendous response when we invited applications for dealerships.         
	For the Rs 6 lakh-plus bikes (the price can go up to Rs 35 lakh), Calcuttans are ready to beg, steal and borrow, felt Debarshi Sadhan Bose, who owns a number of vintage bikes. There is a large fan following of Harleys in Calcutta, he said.        
	Supriyo Roy, another bike enthusiast who has ridden his 350cc Bullet to Nepal and Rajasthan, is counting days to buy a Harley. I have been saving for a 750cc touring bike, said the restaurateur.         
	Harley-Davidson recently announced that it would assemble motorcycles for the Indian market from component kits supplied by its US plants. The assembly facility will start operating from the first half of 2011 and the company will announce a new price list in January, said Tripathi.        
	The company has dealerships in New Delhi, Mumbai, Chandigarh and Hyderabad. The dealership in Bangalore is scheduled to open in end-November.        
	The Harley dealership will be in a prime location and showcase the 12 models across the five Hog families.        
	The dealership will also be the venue of Harley Rock Riders, an annual platform that will bring together motorcycling and music.        
	Harley-Davidson has historically been associated with rock amp; roll. In its first year in India, it has organised a five-city Rock Riders tour featuring Split with guest performances by Them Clones, Thermal and a Quarter, Menwhopause, Native Tongue and Indus Creed. The concerts are being held in the four cities with dealerships and Bangalore.

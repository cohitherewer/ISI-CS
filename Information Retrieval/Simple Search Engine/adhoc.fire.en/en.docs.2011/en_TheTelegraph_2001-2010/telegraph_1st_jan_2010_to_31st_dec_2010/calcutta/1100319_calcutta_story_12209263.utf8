The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Writer shortage hampers blind students 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Writer shortage hampers blind students 
          SUBHAJOY ROY                               
	Kanu Debnath is writing his Higher Secondary (HS) examination this year. The visually challenged teenager spent most of the past two weeks not revising his lessons but worrying about whether he would find a writer or not.         
	We, the blind students, are always tense about getting a quality writer. Most writers are not good enough and make many mistakes while writing. But there is hardly a choice, said the student of Sundiya Uchcha Vidyalaya in Jagaddal of North 24-Parganas who found a writer four days before the HS started.         
	Officials of schools for the blind in the city also said the problems of finding a writer are many. We started looking for writers in January. Only on March 11, five days before the HS began, could we ensure the services of writers for our HS students, said Shyamal Mondal, the teacher-in-charge of Behala Blind School.         
	Thirteen students of the school will write their Class XII board exams and 12 will appear for their Class XI exams this year.         
	The rulebook states that anyone who has appeared for Madhyamik can be chosen as a writer for a blind student appearing in his Class XI or Class XII exams.         
	But few guardians allow their wards to be writers for blind students. The level of awareness among the common people is very low. Most guardians dont want their wards to be writers for blind students, said Sunil Baran Pattanaik, a retired principal of Ramakrishna Mission Blind Boys Academy, Narendrapur.         
	We dont have the option of choosing the best from a list of writers. Whoever volunteers to appear as writer is chosen. If the writer is poor in academics, the results of the visually challenged candidate is affected, added Pattanaik.        
	Science students suffer the most if their writers are not good enough.        
	If the writer is not acquainted with the terms of biology, physics and chemistry, he or she is bound to get the spellings wrong, said Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, the president of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education.        
	Many students go on vacation after Madhyamik narrowing down the choice further. Madhyamik ended on March 8. Since the HS started more than a week later, several left for vacations by then, added a teacher.         
	Officials of academies meant for the blind say the problem exists at all levels, from Madhyamik to postgraduate exams.        
	Twenty-one students from our school appeared in Madhyamik this year. We started looking for writers in November but received all the confirmations only four days before the examination, said a teacher of Lighthouse for the Blind.         
	Our students face much difficulty in finding writers for school service commission (SSC) exams. The rule is that any first-year undergraduate student can be chosen as a writer. Often the college annual exams clash with SSC test and it becomes difficult to find writers, said Jharna Sur, the principal of Welfare Society for the Blind.         
	Lack of incentive is a deterrent. Currently, students who serve as writers are not paid. Two decades ago, writers used to get Rs 5 for writing a paper, said Pattanaik.        
	There should be some incentive to encourage students who volunteer as writers. I will look into the matter, said Adhikari.

	When I got to know that The Telegraph was not going to carry the usual board exam toppers list, I was both relieved and happy.        
	As a reader, a parent and an educator, and on behalf of many like me who believe that we have all, of late, gone over the top about toppers, I thought it necessary to record my appreciation.        
	Often, this has an adverse effect on the topper himself. He finds his name, percentage and family photograph in every newspaper and on every TV channel. He is inundated with questions ranging from how many hours he studied to what he ate for breakfast and which tutorials he attended. Many an innocent teenager has celebrity status thrust on him overnight. Therein lies the danger.                     Be happy: Girls in a central Calcutta school check their results on Wednesday afternoon. Picture by Amit Datta				     
	As a schoolteacher through the 80s and 90s, I observed many an extrovert topper becoming over-confident, even arrogant, after winning the child prodigy tag. I also watched many an introvert topper succumbing to the pressure of the high expectations that the genius tag carried with it.        
	Not for a moment am I suggesting that those who excel in board examinations, or any examinations for that matter, should be taken for granted. Of course, their special effort must be recognised and applauded. The question is how and how much.        
	Till about when I was in school, a warm handshake, a big hug, tears of joy, a treat on Park Street, a letter from Mum to relatives abroad, a special certificate on prize day and Dad bursting with pride at the office telling his boss and buddies, was all that happened; and that ALL was more than enough!        
	The other problem I have about going overboard with topper headlines is that marks, percentages and decimal points gain ground and become the central focus.        
	I have overheard parents say, My eldest son topped his school with 95.7, but my younger boy is not so good. I dont think hell get more than 93 per cent.         
	I have overheard principals say, That newspaper has a problem with my school. It didnt mention my toppers name. She got 96.4.        
	This, when boards, schools, educators and governments are shouting from the rooftops while replacing marks with grades.        
	Of course, excelling in academics matters; but, what matters more is performing to YOUR potential.        
	Our swimming coach often told us, Give your best timing! Swim against the clock, not against your opponents. This seemingly innocuous piece of advice, from a semi-literate man who never finished school, is certainly a mantra worth following.         
	So, lets encourage each child to be the best she can be. Swim against the clock. Reach the top of her potential. Now, that could be a more appropriate definition of a topper.                          
	To reach the top of your own ability and talent; to do the best under the circumstances you are in and the challenges you are up against.         
	The Telegraph Education Foundation honours true toppers every year at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence. It honoured Ashok Maity who passed the Madhyamik with a third division. Ashok lived with his tabla-repairer father in the heart of a red-light area and was the first ever to pass the exam from his locality. He was certainly a topper.        
	Then there was Gopal Haldar. Why did we grant him toppers status when he scored only 48 per cent! Surely, there were others who had scored more than he had. Of course, there were. Some had even scored double. But the ones who did, gripped their pens between their fingers, while Gopal gripped his between his teeth, controlling it with his mouth and tongue. He had lost both his arms in an accident.        
	To Ashok and Gopal, and all of you who have swum against the clock and played at the top of your game, we applaud your efforts. Celebrate, enjoy the moment, keep your feet on the ground and raise the bar higher.         
	To The Telegraph I say thank you for showing the way; I am sure in the days ahead your columns will tell the stories of toppers in academics, sports and co-curricular activities  toppers who perform at the top of their potential; toppers who make us parents and teachers feel on top of the world.

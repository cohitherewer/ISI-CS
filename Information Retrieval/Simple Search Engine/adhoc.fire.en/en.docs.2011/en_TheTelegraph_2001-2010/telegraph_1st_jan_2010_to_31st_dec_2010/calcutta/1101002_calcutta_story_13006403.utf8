The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Marks hike in high court
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Marks hike in high court
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta University (CU) on Friday admitted in the high court that a student had scored more in a practical paper than she had got, two months after claiming that the paper could not be reviewed.         
	Panchali Sarkar, a student of Lady Brabourne College who had appeared for BSc (statistics) Part III exams this year, approached the university for a review of the computer practical paper after the results were declared in July.         
	When CU refused, she moved the high court in August. The next month, the CU lawyer told Justice Aniruddha Basu that the answer scripts of practical papers could not be reviewed. But Panchalis lawyer convinced the court that a review of the paper was possible. Justice Basu directed the vice-chancellor to get the paper reviewed. On Friday, the CU lawyer said a new marksheet would be issued to Panchali.        
	The judge directed the vice-chancellor to ensure that Panchali, who narrowly missed a masters seat at CU, be admitted to the course.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court reprieve for students
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court reprieve for students
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Tuesday directed West Bengal State University to allow 37 students of Sree Chaitanya College in Habra to appear for the pre-final test for next years BA, BSc and BCom Part I exams.        
	Justice Aniruddha Basu also asked the college authorities to take all steps so that 130 students, including the 37 petitioners, could be registered with the university before the exams.        
	Supporters of the Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad had on Friday gheraoed the 52-year-old principal of the North 24-Parganas college for 12 hours following the universitys announcement that it would not register the 130 students. Principal Indramahal Mondal, who suffers from a cardiac condition, collapsed during the agitation.        
	Appearing for the petitioners, advocate Billwadal Bhattacharya said the college had admitted more students than it could accommodate.        
	After admission, the college told my clients that their names would be registered after they sorted out a technical problem, Bhattacharya submitted.        
	The students started attending classes banking on the promise of the college authorities.        
	But early this month, the college said it could not allow at least 130 students to take the pre-final test, scheduled from January 17, as the university had not registered their names yet.        
	A student cannot appear for the finals without clearing the test.        
	Bhattacharya claimed that the college had adopted a pick-and-choose policy while sending the names of the students to the university for registration. My clients support the Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad and the managing committee of the college is controlled by the CPM. Hence, the discrimination, the lawyer said.        
	The lawyer appearing for the Barasat-based university submitted that the college authorities were to blame for admitting excess students.         
	The university has fixed the student strength of each college. Sree Chaitanya College admitted 130 students more than its sanctioned strength.        
	After hearing both sides, the judge observed: Its a question about the future of the students. The court cannot sit idle. The college should take all possible measures so that the student do not lose a year.

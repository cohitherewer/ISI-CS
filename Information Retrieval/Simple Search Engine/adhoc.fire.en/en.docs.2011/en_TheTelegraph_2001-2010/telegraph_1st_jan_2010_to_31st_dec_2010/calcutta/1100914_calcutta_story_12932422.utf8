          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Normality returned to Jadavpur University after several days on Monday but the spectre of another showdown looms large with students and the authorities hardening their stand regarding proposed security measures.        
	While the authorities are firm on installing closed-circuit television cameras and making identity cards mandatory on campus, students are busy mobilising support against the moves.        
	Two days after students lifted a 52-hour gherao of the 15 executive council members of the university, student leaders of all three faculties held meetings to discuss the course of action.        
	We are happy that the authorities have said that they would speak with us before setting up the security cameras. But we want to create awareness among students so that if push comes to shove we can stand our ground, said a leader of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu).        
	Vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh ruled out any major change in the security plan. We will install the CCTV cameras. We will add more students and teachers to the review committee and we will see what they have to say. But we will put the cameras wherever necessary, said Ghosh.        
	The JU authorities have mentioned the main administrative building, the libraries and the university gates as sensitive areas.        
	Leaders of Fetsu, the Science Faculty Students Union and the Forum for Arts Students are campaigning in classrooms and distributing leaflets stating their stand on the security issue.

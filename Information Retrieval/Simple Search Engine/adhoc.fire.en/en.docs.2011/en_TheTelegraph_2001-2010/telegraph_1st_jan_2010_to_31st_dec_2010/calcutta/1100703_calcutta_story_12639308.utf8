	Private airlines will stay away from the city airport for 12 hours from 6am on July 5 because of the strike against the fuel price hike. All private airlines have agreed not to operate flights to avoid passengers inconvenience, said Vijay Matta of the Airlines Operators Committee.         
	Court: Chief Justice J.N. Patel of the high court refused to hear a case moved by green activist Subhas Dutta, saying he did not on principle hear cases argued by petitioners. Dutta fights all his cases himself. The case will be shifted to another bench.

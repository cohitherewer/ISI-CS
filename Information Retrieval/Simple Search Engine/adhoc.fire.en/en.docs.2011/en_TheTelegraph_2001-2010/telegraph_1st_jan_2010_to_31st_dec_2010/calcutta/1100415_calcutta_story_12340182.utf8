	Peerless Hospital limped back towards normality on Wednesday even as its employees apprehended another mob attack.        
	The outpatients department, which bore the brunt of the mobs ire on Tuesday along with the emergency department, remained closed. No patient was admitted on Wednesday but surgeries deferred on Tuesday were performed.        
	Signs of the ransacking were evident all over the premises: smashed flowerpots lay on the driveway and broken shards of glass in the lobby. Bloodspots and stains were prominent on the floor and on doors of the emergency department.        
	There are 163 patients admitted to our hospital After yesterdays rampage, 47 patients were discharged. More patients are supposed to be discharged this evening, said Sudipto Mitra, the medical superintendent of the hospital.         
	He claimed that doctors and nurses had faced resistance from local residents while entering hospital, as a result of which the planned surgeries were delayed.         
	One of the hospital employees, Tanushree Ali, said residents of the area had passed lewd comments at her after she got off a bus near Hiland Park on her way to work.        
	The hospital authorities alleged medicine vendors are staying away from the premises fearing an attack by local residents, said an official. The hospitals supply of medicine would not last more than a week.        
	Around 50 residents blocked the EM Bypass for more than an hour from 8.30am to protest the arrest of 13 people in connection with the mob violence at Peerless Hospital.        
	The group later demonstrated outside Jadavpur (East) police station, where the arrested were kept.         
	The 13 were produced at the chief judicial magistrates court in Alipore and granted bail.        
	Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said in the evening the police had filed a report on the mob violence. The home department will take action. The health department will review the role of the hospital based on the report.        
	At Writers Buildings, the chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti said: If it is found that the hospital had demanded money for admitting emergency patients, then its licence may be cancelled.         
	Chakrabarti also said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee met home secretary Ardhendu Sen and the director-general of police, Bhupinder Singh, to find ways to curb regular accidents on the EM Bypass and on the highway.

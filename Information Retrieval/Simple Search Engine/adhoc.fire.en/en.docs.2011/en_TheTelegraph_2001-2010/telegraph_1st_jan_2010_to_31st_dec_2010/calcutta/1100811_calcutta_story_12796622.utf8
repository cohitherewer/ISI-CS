          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 52-year-old bank employee was murdered in his Shibpur home on Tuesday morning around the time he usually left for office. Swapan Pal was last heard arguing with his elder sister Chaitali, 58, and her 35-year-old son Samrat.         
	Swapans younger sister Lisa Sadhukhan found him lying on his bed with blood gushing out of a wound in his head. The woman in her 30s, who lives in the house with her seven-year-old son, told police that she had just returned after dropping the boy at school. Swapans two sisters and his nephew were detained for questioning.        
	According to the police, Chaitali had not returned to Swapan money that she had borrowed for her husbands treatment. Samrat ran a tuition centre in his uncles house.         
	Chaitali and Samrat, who live nearby, visited Swapan at 6.30am. Neighbours heard the three quarrelling.        
	Animesh Mukherjee, who lives next door, said: I could hear a heated exchange between Swapan, Chaitali and Samrat early in the morning. Then suddenly there was silence. Lisa returned home around 7.30am.         
	An investigator said: The man was hit with a heavy iron chain on the right side of his head, causing a deep wound in his skull. He might also have been strangled with the chain.        
	Swapans wife Chumki lives with their daughter in Salkia.

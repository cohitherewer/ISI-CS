          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	An employee scorned had masterminded Wednesdays daylight robbery in Asim Kumar and Rupali Mukherjees Prince Anwar Shah Road house, revealed police after arresting the duo who executed the crime and recovering the booty from them.        
	The detective department arrested Bapi Singh and Suraj Singh, who had posed as couriers carrying a gift meant for Asim to gain access to the two-storeyed house behind Dhaka Kalibari, after piecing together information provided by an associate of the absconding mastermind, Jayanta Mondal.        
	Jayanta is the son of the familys cook, Anjali Mondal. He used to work as a peon in the private company Mukherjee is associated with, but wasnt happy with his salary of Rs 1,700 a month. He quit in 2009 after working for two years but held a grouse against Mukherjee for not helping him get a raise, said an officer.        
	The polices first clue was the manner in which the robbery was executed. Bapi and Suraj had entered the house from the back but left from the front, suggesting they either knew the layout or were helped by someone who did, the officer explained.         
	An investigation revealed that Jayanta hadnt returned home since the robbery, which led the police to interrogate his associate Munna, a kerosene dealer in Biswaspara, off Prince Anwar Shah Road.        
	 Munna led them to Bapi and Suraj, both local toughs.         
	We traced the duo, both in their 20s, to a locality near Tollygunge and recovered the stolen jewellery along with Rs 40,000 in cash. We also seized a gun from them. The cumulative worth of the booty is more than the initial Rs 3.6 lakh estimate, an investigator said.        
	The robbers had entered the first floor of the sprawling house through the service staircase at the rear of the building around 12.10pm on Wednesday.        
	The households teenaged domestic help, Biswajit Majhi, had barely opened the grille door when one of the robbers took out a gun and hit him repeatedly on the forehead.        
	The duo then tied up Rupali Mukherjee, 60, and ransacked the house.

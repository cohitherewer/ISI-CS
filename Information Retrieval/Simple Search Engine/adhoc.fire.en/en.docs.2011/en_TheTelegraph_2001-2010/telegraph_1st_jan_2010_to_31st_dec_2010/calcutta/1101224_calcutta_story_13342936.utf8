The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Festive scan on tipple and steer
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Festive scan on tipple and steer
          KINSUK BASU                                                  
	Police plan to keep a close watch on the city roads to ensure that drink driving and speeding do not spoil the fun of partying during the Christmas and New Year weekends.        
	For the first time, the men in uniform will keep drivers on standby to take those who fail the breathalyser test to the police station.         
	Those who fail the breathalyser test are obviously not in a position to drive. Our men will drive them to the nearest police station, said a senior traffic police officer.        
	A medical test is mandatory after a breathalyser test. We usually take several violators to the nearest hospital together. Until then, they wait at the police station, added the officer.        
	While party zone Park Street will remain under the scanner, dedicated teams will be stationed at 12 locations, including the Park Circus seven-point crossing, EM Bypass, Bowbazar, Hazra, Rashbehari, Gariahat and Kankurgachhi, to keep tabs on drink driving.         
	According to the plan, about 1,200 constables will be out on the street, stopping anyone fit for scanning and asking them to take the breathalyser test.         
	The traffic police have three breathalyser kits. Each of the five divisions of the city police has a kit each.         
	We will ask the divisions to hand over their breathalysers so that a dedicated cell of the traffic department can carry out tests in greater numbers, said an officer.        
	The police bosses have also decided to tweak the shift timings so that traffic policing and monitoring extend well beyond 10pm.        
	Those driving over the speed limit will also be on the police radar this festive season.        
	Officers with speed guns will be deployed on key arteries, including the EM Bypass, Narkeldanga Main Road, Red Road and BT Road, to book vehicles travelling too fast.        
	The cops have 10 speed guns at their disposal. A speed gun captures the speed of a vehicle while clicking its picture.        
	We have put up signboards on key roads specifying the speed limit for different types of vehicles so that motorists cannot claim that they were unaware, said a senior officer. The limit is 60kmph on the Bypass and 50kmph on Red Road for cars.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Date with style to browse amp; buy   More than just an exhibition
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Date with style to browse amp; buy     - Annual winter exhibition of fashion and art, powered by personal effort          SHRADHA AGARWAL                          Preeti Goenka and Sumedha Saraogi after announcing Stylefile 2010 on Thursday. (Pabitra Das)                                        
	Stylefile  responsible for giving the city an early taste of the good life  is back.        
	The winter shopping date to browse and buy fashion and art at the premier lifestyle exhibition, held in association with t2, is November 26 (4pm to 11pm).        
	Back in October 2002, when Preeti Goenka and Sumedha Saraogi launched the extravaganza, fashion fatigue was a distant drumbeat. Many of us saw our first fashion show on October 5 at The Oberoi Grand. Many of us made our debut designer purchase there.        
	After passing the seven-year-itch last winter with flying colours, this is Stylefiles eighth edition in town. Four years ago, the event moved from five-star banquets to a quaint address at the Old Bungalow, 7/6 Burdwan Road, with a night bazaar format. Since then, the bungalow has been a vital part of the charm of Stylefile.        
	The USP of the event is our personal effort. Intense research, studio visits and portfolio sifting go into putting together each edition. The idea is to make sure that there is something for everyone, explain Preeti and Sumedha.        
	The resultant designer list for Stylefile 2010 is a happy mix of labels, both established and upcoming, from the worlds of art and fashion, the lines between the two slowly but steadily blurring.        
	The three big names from the city are Anamika Khanna, Kiran Uttam Ghosh (who will be bringing a gift range) and Shantanu Goenka. Delhi designers are represented by the likes of Namrata Joshipura and Stylefile regular Vivek Narang.                          
	The GeNext gang includes Pankaj and Nidhi Ahuja, Nachiket Barve and Rahul Misra.        
	The traditional touch at this edition of Stylefile will be provided by Benarasi weaves from Snna and Roliana, along with a selection of saris by Tikaaya.         
	The accessories department will see precious jewellery by Alpana Gujral and Vistaara, fun accessories by Crimzon, Bea and Joolz, designer cards by Avarna Jain and art merchandise by the Ganges Art Gallery.         
	There will be nine artists in this edition of Stylefile (including biggies like Paresh Maity, Sunil Padwal, Vinod Daroze and Yusuf Aeakkal) who will showcase their works on canvas as well as on products.        
	We wanted to make art more accessible so along with serious art (read canvases), artists as always will take their art beyond, says Preeti.         
	Designer Anamika Khanna, who has been around since its inception, is among those for whom Stylefile is more than just another exhibition.        
	Stylefile holds a special place in my heart. I think the plan works really well. The people who are part of Stylefile are meticulously selected and I feel privileged to be part of the line-up, she says.        
	Shantanu Goenka, who joined the Stylefile family five years ago, says the USP lies in the Q-factor.        
	Stylefile is all about quality. From the list of participants to the ambience to the footfall, everything is classy.

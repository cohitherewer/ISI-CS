                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Patient, nurse bitten by cats
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Stray cats roaming the wards of TL Jaiswal Hospital in Bally bit a patient and a nurse over the weekend, a hospital source said on Monday.         
	The attacks have spread panic among patients and employees of the Howrah hospital, prompting the superintendent to seek advice from the chief medical officer of health on tackling the feline menace.         
	Hospital sources said Jyotsna Nayek, 50, was admitted to the female surgical unit with a fractured left hand on Saturday morning. While she was having lunch that afternoon, a cat tried to snatch a piece of fish from her plate. When Jyotsna tried to shoo it away, it bit her right hand.         
	She was bleeding profusely from the wound, said a ward employee. The next day, nurse Nandita Ganguli, 35, was scratched and bitten on the hand by a cat.         
	I dont have the courage to chase away the cats anymore. I would rather go without food in the hospital, said a visibly shaken Jyotsna.        
	A nurse said on condition of anonymity that the hospital was teeming with cats. They survive on food snatched from patients plates and breed in the wards. Since the authorities have never bothered to drive them away, their number has increased alarmingly.         
	Aparesh Bandopadhyay, the superintendent of the hospital, admitted that cats had attacked a patient and a nurse. There are a number of cats on the premises and they are creating panic among patients, he said.

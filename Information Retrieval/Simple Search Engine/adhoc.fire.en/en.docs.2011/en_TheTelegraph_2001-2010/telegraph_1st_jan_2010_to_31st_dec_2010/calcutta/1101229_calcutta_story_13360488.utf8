The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Robbery at petrol pump 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Robbery at petrol pump 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An armed gang of three took away Rs 3 lakh and three cellphones from a petrol pump in Madhyamgram early on Tuesday.        
	The men drove a Maruti Omni into Gianis Petrol Pump at Michaelnagar on Jessore Road around 4.10am. As employees approached the car to refill its tank, the trio sprang out and made a dash for the office.         
	The key to the cash box had been hanging from the lock, so the men found it easy to take out the notes. When one of the employees tried to resist the trio, he was hit on his hand with the butt of a pistol, said an officer of the airport police station.         
	Before leaving, the three snapped the landline connection of the petrol pump and snatched the cellphones of the employees so that they could not immediately contact anyone for help.        
	The men ran back to the car with the cash and the phones and sped away.         
	At least one of the robbers was carrying a firearm, added the officer.        
	Preliminary investigation revealed that over the past several days, a number of residents of the area had seen the Maruti Omni parked outside the petrol pump        
	The complaint lodged by the manager of the petrol pump, Mohan Kumar Sau, states that Rs 3 lakh and three cellphones were taken away from the petrol pump. We are investigating the case, said Dhrubajyoti De, the additional superintendent of police (Barrackpore) of North 24-Parganas.

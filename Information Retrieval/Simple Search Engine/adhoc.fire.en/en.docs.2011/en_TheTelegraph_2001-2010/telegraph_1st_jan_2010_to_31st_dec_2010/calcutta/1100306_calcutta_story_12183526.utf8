          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Institute of Neurosciences, Calcutta, plans to set up a postgraduate institute modelled on the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (Nimhans), Bangalore.        
	We will set up a postgraduate education and research institute in neurosciences, like Nimhans, and a postgraduate nursing institute in Calcutta, R.P. Sengupta, the chairman and managing director of the city institute, said on Friday.        
	The first phase of the superspeciality hospital at Mullickbazar  housing neurology, neurosurgery, neuro-psychiatry and neuro-rehabilitation departments  started functioning on Friday with 50 beds. There will be 150 beds once the entire hospital, a public-private project, becomes operational.        
	The centre will create more facilities for healthcare in our city, said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who was present at the inauguration. In our state, 70 per cent people depend on state-run hospitals. But now we are encouraging PPP projects and the institute is a unique model.        
	An agreement signed by Neurosciences Foundation Bengal (the private party in the project), the health department and the civic body state that 20 per cent of the beds have been reserved for poor patients who would be treated free. The treatment for underprivileged patients on another 30 per cent beds would be subsidised.        
	The institute will have clinics for patients suffering from stroke, epilepsy and neurogenetic diseases and a sleep laboratory for those suffering from sleep disorders.

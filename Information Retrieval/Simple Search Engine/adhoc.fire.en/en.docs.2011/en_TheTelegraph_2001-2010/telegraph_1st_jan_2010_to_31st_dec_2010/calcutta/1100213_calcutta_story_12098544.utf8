	A teenaged cyclist and his friend riding pillion fell in front of a road roller while moving alongside it and were crushed under the wheels near BT College on Jessore Road on Friday morning.         
	Suvo Sinha, son of a rickshaw-puller, was a dropout while Somnath Sarkar, son of a van rickshaw-puller, studied in Class IX in a local school. They were going to a playground in the area for football practice.         
	The driver of the road roller fled after the accident. We are looking for him, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.         
	The boys were hit by another vehicle and fell in front of the road roller. The driver applied brakes but by the time the vehicle stopped it was too late, said a witness.        
	Suvo died on the spot. Somnath died on the way to Barasat district hospital.

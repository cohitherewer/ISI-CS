	The state pollution control board has fined the company that runs the cafeteria inside the Shibpur botanical garden Rs 25,000 for violating the plastic ban while hosting a marriage party on the premises.        
	The garden and 40 other ecologically sensitive spots were declared no-plastic zones in 2004. Metro had reported how the wedding reception of a Howrah trader with alleged political links on January 24 had damaged the greens.        
	Food had been illegally cooked in the open and invitees littered the lawns. Liquor bottles and plastic cutlery and packets were found strewn on the greens later.        
	The fine, to be paid by KM Trading Company to the garden authorities within seven days, will be used to clean the premises under the boards supervision.        
	The order, passed by the boards chief law officer Biswajit Mukherjee on Wednesday, criticised the garden authorities for their miserable failure to stop the violations.         
	The garden authorities had not lodged a police complaint against the trader who had organised the reception, pointed out the order, issued on the basis of submissions by the garden and the company.         
	Sukdev Ghosh of KM Trading denied that the company had violated environmental norms.

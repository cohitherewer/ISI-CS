The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Out of jail, painting on lips
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Out of jail, painting on lips
          A STAFF REPORTER                            Sajal after his release on Tuesday and (top) being taken to jail in 1997                                
	Sajal Barui, the teenager jailed for killing his father, stepmother and stepbrother in cold blood 17 years ago, stepped out of prison on Tuesday as a dapper young man in a baseball cap, white full-sleeved shirt and khaki trousers.         
	He held in his hand a diary as he walked into his lawyers car outside Alipore Central jail. Hounded by reporters, the life term convict rolled down his window. I started painting while in prison. Id soon hold an exhibition, he said unhurriedly. Im going to meet my mother (in North 24-Parganass Jagaddal).        
	The high court had granted him bail on June 30 to offer him a chance to reform himself. In 1993, 16-year-old Sajals apparent lack of remorse had stunned many. The Barasat court had sentenced him to death. After the high court reduced the sentence to life five years later, Sajal moved the Supreme Court. He was given bail because a 2006 law allows the benefit.         
	It took over a month to release him after that because of some paperwork.        
	The stepmothers ill-treatment and exhortations by friends to make sure he inherited his fathers property had prompted Sajal to hatch the plot.        
	He had fled custody from NRS hospital in 2001. He identified himself as Sheikh Raju after his recapture two years later in connection with a petty theft in Jamboni, West Midnapore. Only after he had spent a month in the Midnapore jail did the police realise they had got Sajal.        
	Jail sources said the diary in his hand on Tuesday had letters he had received and some of his paintings.         
	Sajal had allegedly not been an obedient prisoner. He would refuse to do any work and spend his time painting. He tried to impress jail officials by painting their portraits, said a warden of Cell No. 4, where he stayed for six years.

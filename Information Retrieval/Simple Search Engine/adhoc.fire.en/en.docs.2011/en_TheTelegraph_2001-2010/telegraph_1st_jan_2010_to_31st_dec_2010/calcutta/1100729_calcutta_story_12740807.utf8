The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | I jumped off amp; rolled over
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      I jumped off amp; rolled over
                            
	Sayantee Majumdars leap of faith from a speeding shuttle car to escape the clutches of a rogue driver on Tuesday night was as much an act of courage as of desperation. The 23-year-old MBA student, who works as an intern with a Taratala firm, was lucky to escape with some scratches but the incident did leave her scarred. The Salt Lake braveheart recounts her horror ride to Metro.              
	I usually take a bus from Gariahat to Salt Lake on the way back home. But the buses were very crowded on Tuesday evening, which is why I opted for a shuttle cab.        
	My first thought on spotting a white Ambassador on Bijon Setu around 8.20pm was, however, to give it a miss. The reason for my hesitation was that the driver wasnt saying where he was headed. He only nodded when I asked him whether the car would go to Salt Lake. I finally decided to get into the backseat after noticing that an elderly person was already seated there.        
	The car sped down the EM Bypass and we reached Karunamoyee within an hour. My co-passenger and I were paying the fare when the driver, in his 30s, asked me which block I was going to. When I answered tank number eight, he claimed to be headed that way. He opened the front door and gestured for me to sit. I got in without giving it a thought but became nervous once it dawned on me that I was the only passenger.        
	My heart was beating fast by the time the car reached the ICICI Bank branch in BJ Block and I asked the driver to stop. He took a U-turn and slammed the brakes but the door wouldnt open. I looked at the driver, expecting him to help open it. But he didnt respond. As I stared at him, he pulled me by my right hand. I screamed.        
	The driver panicked and revved up again, by which time some bystanders were running after the vehicle. As the car gathered speed, I kept pulling at the door handle. I even tried jumping out of the window. Then the door suddenly opened and I got my chance. I jumped off and rolled over on the road, ending up with cuts and scratches even as my tormentor sped away.        
	Some residents helped me to my feet, after which I called my mother to come and help me lodge an FIR. It was important for me to file a police complaint because incidents like these shouldnt go unnoticed, though I must clarify that I was attacked, not molested.        
	My family now has only one piece of advice: Dont ever get into a shuttle cab.        
	As told to Jhinuk Mazumdar

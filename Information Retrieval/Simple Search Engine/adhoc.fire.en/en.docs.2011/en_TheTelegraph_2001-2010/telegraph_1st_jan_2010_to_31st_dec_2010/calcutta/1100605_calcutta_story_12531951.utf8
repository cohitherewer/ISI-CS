  - Young painter defies hearing disability          NANDINI SARAF                                  Anant Manot (top) and one of his works               
	Anant Manot does not let hearing impairment get in the way of his love for painting.         
	The ex-student of St Xaviers Senior Secondary School, Jaipur, has been painting ever since he picked up a brush at the age of eight to paint the popular soft drink mascot Fido Dido on a T-shirt.         
	Mythology, landscapes and still life are the predominant subjects of the 27-year-old, who is equally comfortable in acrylic, charcoal and poster colours.         
	I also love drawing masks. To me, it is a reminder that we all wear masks to hide our real selves from the world, says Anant, who can read lips and observe facial expressions to grasp what is being said.         
	Anant has turned his disability into his strength. He can work in a busy room, as he is unaffected by the noise. His concentration levels are far higher, says mother Suman, who has always been Anants mainstay. Anant also loves to take photographs and to dance the salsa.         
	After the response at his first solo exhibition at Gallery Eye on Art on Pretoria Street from May 11 to May 20, Anant is planning to participate in exhibitions in Delhi and Mumbai. Seven of his paintings have already sold for prices ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 20,000.

	National Library is ready with a slew of initiatives to modernise the 150-year-old institution. While a new website will allow readers to access the library from home, new rules of photocopying and photographing material will make the library more reader-friendly.        
	We want to make our collection more accessible to our readers, both from home and the library, said K.K. Banerjee, the director of National Library.        
	Readers had for long rued the librarys photocopying rules, which restricted photocopying to a maximum of 75 pages per book if it did not exceed one-third of the total number of pages. That too after a two-hour wait.        
	The new rules will allow readers to photocopy up to two-thirds of four books allotted to a reader daily. But permission from the authorities is a must.        
	Any competent authority can permit photocopying of more than one-third of a book. The director of the library can also permit photocopying of an entire book on the basis of a written application, said Banerjee.        
	Library members will also be able to collect pre-paid photocopy requisitions and submit photocopy requests on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.         
	Readers can use their personal digital camera to take digital photos of a maximum of 75 pages from two books daily. Readers will need permission and the photography has to be done without flash and under supervision, said Banerjee.        
	Readers will be able to access the digitised catalogue of the library from home and request a book online by filling up the details on the website.         
	The website will allow users to download 9,141 books digitised by the library, including some of its rare tomes.         
	At the request of readers, online journals of leading publications like Sage, Cambridge and Oxford are now available in the library, said Banerjee.

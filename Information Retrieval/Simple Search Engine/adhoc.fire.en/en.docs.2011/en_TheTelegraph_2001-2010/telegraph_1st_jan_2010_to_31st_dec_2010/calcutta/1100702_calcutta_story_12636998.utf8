                      When the twain met                    Einstein once said, One cannot help but be in awe when one contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvellous structure of reality. This immediately reminds us of Tagores hymn Mahabishwe mahakashey mahakalo majhe/ Aami manaba ekaki bhrami bishmaye bhrami bishmaye .... The summer of 1930 occasioned a meeting of two extraordinary minds  Rabindranath Tagore and Albert Einstein  who met through a common friend, Dr Mendel. Tagore visited Einstein at his residence at Kaputh near Berlin on July 14, 1930 and Einstein returned the call and visited Tagore at the Mendel home. Their interaction further reinforced the similarity of thought of the two great men. Einstein remarked, A spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe  a spirit vastly superior to that of man and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble. He added that this is how the pursuit of science has a religious feeling of a special sort which he termed cosmic religion. Tagore also wrote along the same lines, Ekoko akhanda brahmandorajye poromo- Eko shei rajo rajendro raje, bishmito nimesho hoto bishwo charane binoto lakshyasata bhaktachita bakyohara... In this evenings programme, Mahabishwe Mahakashey, Sudeshna Basu will present Tagore songs interspersed with readings from Einsteins writings by Barun Chanda, to uncover and explain the kindred philosophical thoughts of the poet and the scientist. Concept and script: Sudeshna Basu.                  Event: A programme of Tagore songs by Sudeshna Basu and readings from Einstein by Barun Chanda based on the shared philosophy of the two masters When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Crossword, Elgin Road

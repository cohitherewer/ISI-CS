                      Of images and imagery                    Geometric abstraction is a form of abstract art based on the use of geometric forms sometimes, though not always, placed in non-illusionistic space and combined into non-objective (non-representational) compositions. Throughout the 20th century art historical discourse, critics and artists working within the reductive or pure strains of abstraction have often suggested that geometric abstraction represents the height of a non-objective art practice, which necessarily stresses or calls attention to the root plasticity and two-dimensionality of painting as an artistic medium. Ritendra Roy (b.1972) did his post-graduation in art from Santiniketan. His close affinity to nature while there did much to turn him into a quintessential landscape painter which he has remained even after re-locating to Calcutta as a professional artist. His forte is cityscape, but what distinguishes his works from the run-of-the mill descriptive city landscape paintings is his intrinsic interest in geometric abstract art. Roys concern with form and composition appears secondary to his latent, and more potent concern with configuration of images into imagery.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Swelter scores over rain relief
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Swelter scores over rain relief
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The stop-start-stop thundershower that brought some relief on sultry Sunday was neither a Norwester nor the Celsius-dipper that the city needed for a cool start to the week, warns the weatherman.        
	The shower was expected after the swelter but it didnt do enough to leave a mark on the weather except a slight Celsius drop from the days high of 38.7 degrees Celsius (three notches above normal), said an official of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	Sources in the India Meteorological Department (IMD), however, held out hope for more thunderstorm activity in the next two days.        
	A low-pressure trough from east Madhya Pradesh to Assam, and passing through north Gangetic Bengal with an embedded cyclonic circulation over Bangladesh, will favour the formation of thunderclouds over the city, said an IMD official.        
	But what if the clouds flatter to deceive like they have all season?         
	Unless there is heavy rain over the next couple of days, maximum temperatures could rise by two to three degrees again, warned the official.

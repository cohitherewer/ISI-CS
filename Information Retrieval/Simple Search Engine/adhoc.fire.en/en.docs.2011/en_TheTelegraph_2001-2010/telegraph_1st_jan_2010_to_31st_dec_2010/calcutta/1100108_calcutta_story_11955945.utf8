The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU panel divided on exam rules
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CU panel divided on exam rules
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A 10-member Calcutta University committee on Thursday failed to agree on the ground rules for the no-detention policy in the Part I and Part II undergraduate exams. The policy is set to be introduced in the next academic session.        
	The panel members were unanimous that no student should be detained in Part I and Part II and everyone should be allowed multiple attempts to clear elective papers. They also agreed that a general course student must obtain at least 30 per cent marks in at least one elective paper in a subject in Part I and Part II to sit for the following years Part II and Part III.        
	A general course student studies Paper I of an elective subject in Part I, papers II and III in Part II and Paper IV in Part III.        
	According to sources, the bone of contention was the qualifying marks for the two elective papers in Part II. Some panel members want to set the bar at 30 per cent for each paper. The others feel an aggregate of 30 per cent in a subject should suffice.        
	If the recommendations of the first group are accepted, a student would have to score 30 per cent in each of the four elective papers to clear the subject. If the other set of recommendations is accepted, the student can pass the subject even after scoring less than 30 per cent in one of the Part II papers, provided his aggregate percentage at the end of the third year is over 30.        
	We were supposed to finalise the rules today. There was a long debate over certain issues but we failed to arrive at a conclusion. We will have to hold another meeting soon to draft the methodology for implementing the no-detention policy in Part I and Part II under the 1+1+1 pattern, said a member of the committee after the meeting on Thursday.         
	The panel was unanimous that honours students should obtain at least 35 per cent in Part I and Part II to sit for the subsequent honours exams. But the overall honours aggregate has to be over 40 per cent at the end of the Part III exams.        
	Under the proposed system, students will get three years after Part III to clear the backlog of papers, if any, and become graduates.         
	The recommendations will be placed before the undergraduate council for approval. The rules will then have to be ratified by the syndicate.

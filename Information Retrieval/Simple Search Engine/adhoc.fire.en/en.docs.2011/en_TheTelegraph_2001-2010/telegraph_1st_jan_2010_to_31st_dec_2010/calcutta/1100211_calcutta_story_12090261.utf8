The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hospital patient missing
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hospital patient missing
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 50-year-old patient admitted to the radiotherapy department of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute went missing on Tuesday. Sambhu Debnath, a bidi seller, could not be traced till Wednesday evening, prompting his relatives to accuse the hospital of negligence.         
	Debnath, who lives in Joynagar, South 24-Parganas, was admitted on February 5 with cancer of the laryngopharynx and underwent tracheostomy, where a tube was attached to his windpipe to aid breathing.         
	Debnath was last seen going out of the ward around 10.30am by another patient. We searched the premises but could not locate him and lodged a missing diary with Bhowanipore police station at 12.20pm, said Jaydip Biswas, the director of the institute.        
	Biswas added that Debnath, who lives with wife Minati and teenaged son Baburam, was initially reluctant to undergo the procedure but later gave his consent.        
	A doctor said that the operated portion could get infected or the tube could come off if not handled carefully.        
	Debnaths relatives were left fuming and accused the hospital staff of laxity in discharging their duties.         
	We are feeling so helpless. We visited Sambhu on Monday night and he was fine. We cant understand why he would run away from hospital, said relative Ashok Nath.        
	Nath said when they asked the nurse on duty about Debnath on Tuesday afternoon, she was very curt. She simply said that she did not know where Sambhu was. We then went to the ward master, who directed us to the police station. Nath said.        
	But the cops told the family that the hospital had already lodged a missing diary.         
	Terming the incident as unfortunate, Biswas said Debnath would have been cured had he continued with the treatment. The hospital is now mulling a dress code for patients to avoid a repeat, said an insider.

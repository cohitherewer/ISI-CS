The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kidnap bid at   Salt Lake school
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Kidnap bid at   Salt Lake school
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Hariyana Vidya Mandir in Salt Lake lodged a police complaint on Tuesday alleging that a woman had tried to lure one of its students away with an apple on Monday morning.        
	According to the complaint, a woman approached the Class V student around 6.45am on Monday and gave her an apple and some candies.        
	The woman, said to be in a burqa, also allegedly showed the girl a knife and asked her to eat the apple and come with her. The girl at that point raised an alarm and the woman fled.        
	We alerted police based on the childs complaint and also tightened security in and around the school. It is, however, strange that none of our guards or guardians saw all this happening outside the gate. All that the child has said may not be true but we are treating the complaint seriously, said principal Nandini Sen.        
	The police have started a probe based on the childs description of the woman.        
	We are questioning the people who could have been in the area before the school started at 7.15am, said a senior officer of Bidhannagar (North) police station.        
	The principal said the student claimed that the woman had first asked her to leave her bag in the class and come back.        
	When the girl returned to the school gate, the woman gave her the apple and the candies and pointing a knife at her, asked her to eat the fruit. The girl then started crying.        
	One of her classmates, Sovan Dasgupta, was apparently a witness to her encounter with the woman. The childrens parents could not be reached for comment.        
	We questioned the girl but she seemed very tensed. We discussed our worries with the principal and she has agreed to install closed-circuit television cameras and deploy more guards on the premises, said Pranab Kar, the secretary of the school guardians forum.

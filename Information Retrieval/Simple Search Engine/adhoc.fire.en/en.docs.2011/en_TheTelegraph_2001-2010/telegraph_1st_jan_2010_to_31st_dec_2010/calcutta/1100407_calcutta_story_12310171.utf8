The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power plague on swelter day
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Power plague on swelter day

	Salt Lake and the other city fringes went without power for up to six hours on Tuesday as electricity generation by the state utility plummeted because of insufficient supply of coal.        
	The shortfall also left those within city limits struggling to cope with the summer swelter, but for shorter periods, as the maximum temperature soared to 38.2 degrees Celsius.        
	The authorities blamed it all on coal, alleging a problem at the supply end. Till the coal supply normalises, the state utility cannot generate anywhere close to capacity. Its difficult to say when the situation will improve, said a power department official.        
	Weve had power cuts for over four hours from late afternoon for several days now. Gone are the days when Salt Lake used to be a power cut-free zone, said CA Block resident Pramit Mukherjee, an income tax lawyer.        
	Across town in Garia, trader Avinash Dugar voiced a similar complaint. We have had phased power cuts for four to six hours for the past three days, he said.        
	The power cuts are the result of shortfall of over 650MW in areas served by the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, which include parts beyond Garia bridge and Budge Budge and some pockets like Kestopur in between.        
	Even the citys central business district was shrouded in darkness around 6pm on Tuesday. Canning Street, Rabindra Sarani, Jamnalal Bajaj Street and portions of NS Road were the worst affected.        
	For the past four days, we have had power cuts every evening and for up to three hours, said Bhola Shankar, a transporter who has an office on Jamnalal Bajaj Street.        
	The peak-hour traffic on Brabourne Road went haywire as shoppers preferred to be on the road rather than inside shops to escape the suffocating heat. We are struggling to control the traffic because of the number of people on the carriageway, said a sergeant outside the Headquarter Traffic Guard on Brabourne Road.        
	By 8pm, almost every neighbourhood in north, central and south Calcutta had suffered power cuts of varying duration. An elderly couple in my neighbourhood fell ill because of the power cut in this heat, said Vivekananda Road resident Arpita Sinha, an employee of a private bank.        
	At Jadavpur, homemaker Suparna Ganguly, said: Power cuts for two hours or more have made the heat unbearable. The invertor is struggling to cope.        
	During peak demand, CESC generated 1,237MW at full capacity and sent out 1,146MW. Imports were restricted to 236MW with the state utility unable to bridge the gap when the total demand was 1,582MW. The result was loadshedding of 200MW, resulting in around two hours of power cuts in CESC areas.

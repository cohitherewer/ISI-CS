The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Appetite lost on food street
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Appetite lost on food street
  - TINDERBOX TRAGEDY SHUTS POPULAR STOPS          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Some came to gape and click on Wednesday. (Amit Datta)                                        
	The day after the inferno, Calcuttas capital corridor of food and fun lay limp and listless. Yet, no one was counting losses.        
	The sheer scale of the tragedy makes business totally irrelevant at this juncture, Nitin Kothari, the owner of Peter Cat, housed in the tinderbox building, told Metro on Wednesday. This is the first time that the popular restaurant has downed shutters for reasons other than a bandh. Kothari, who also owns Mocambo across the road on Free School Street, doesnt know when he can reopen his 160-cover restaurant which serves around 600 people a day.        
	Its not in my hands really, but once the clearances come from the authorities, we should be able to welcome diners in 24 hours, said Kothari, the vice-president of the Hotel amp; Restaurant Association of Eastern India.        
	The landmark Flurys tea-room and Swiss confectionery of 1926 vintage where Satyajit Ray had a credit account, is also housed in the same building and the management in the Apeejay Surrendra Group was not hazarding a guess about when normal services would be restored.        
	Also in Stephen Court is MusicWorld, Indias best-performing music retail outlet, grossing sales of nearly a crore a month. The day after the blaze, the shutters were down and the vibrant storefront wore a despondent look. We could go into our second-floor office briefly to check on things and found the ceiling dripping water. We had to remove some of the computers to a drier perch, said Chetan Arora, the business head (east) of MusicWorld Retail Ltd.        
	Rajiv Kothari, the owner of the One Step Up restaurant, also housed in Stephen Court, and Bar B-Q across the road, had to evacuate the building with his family on Tuesday, once the fire started spreading. We live on the third floor of Stephen Court and my office is one floor below. We moved out and shifted to the safety of Saturday Club on Tuesday and I dont know really when we can return home, he said.        
	Lunch footfall was very thin at the eateries that had opened on Park Street the day after. The F amp;B trade hopes business will limp back to normal on a street that has lost some its lustre as a food destination. Park Street has an amazing streak of resilience and will bounce back from this tragedy as well, felt Sunny Puri of Trincas.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bike chase nets phone thieves
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A youth took on two cellphone lifters, one of them armed with a 9mm pistol, and pinned them down on a Behala road on Monday afternoon till others joined in and handed them over to police.        
	Haridas Naskar, 25, who works in a shop off Roy Bahadur Road, was returning home to Buroshibtala Main Road when a youth on a motorcycle snatched his cellphone. Another youth was riding pillion.        
	I thought it to be a prank by one of my friends. But when I saw the duo on the bike speed off, I raised an alarm and started running after them, recalled Naskar. Seeing him run, a friend picked up Naskar on his motorcycle and chased the lifters.        
	We caught up with them several times over the next 15 minutes and tried to push them off their bike but they always managed to speed off, recalled Naskar.        
	Near Sree Sangha Club, the snatchers bike came almost in the way of a bus coming from the opposite direction. They managed to dodge the bus but lost balance and fell on the road after hitting another two-wheeler.        
	Naskar immediately got off his friends bike, sprinted towards the duo and put one of his hands into the snatchers trousers pocket in an attempt to retrieve the phone. What came out, instead, was a loaded 9mm pistol. I was numb for a second but then I hit him on the head with the pistol butt, he said.        
	Naskar then pinned down the duo on the road till witnesses, who had by then alerted police, rushed to the spot and caught hold of them.        
	A team of officers came soon after and arrested the two. The snatcher has been identified as Ramakrishna Dey. The pistol had one bullet inside. The phone has been recovered, said an officer.

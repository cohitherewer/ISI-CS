	Apropos London Dreams, May 30, Calcutta can never turn into London because it will always have a distinct identity of its own. We should be proud of our city and try to turn it into a better place that the whole world will look up to.             
	Oishimaya Sen, Tollygunge                     
	lLondon dreams was a very interesting read. Hope it was read by didi and all those who make empty promises of Utopia to Calcuttans. In a city where garbage-ridden roads, water-logged streets and grafitti-laden walls used as public urinals are the most frequent sights, becoming London is indeed a distant dream.

	The article Punish peeves, March 14, aptly described the changing student-teacher relationship with a clip from Panther Panchali where Apu was being punished in public by the village teacher-cum-grocer. In the past students didnt really mind if they were punished. They obeyed and respected their teachers like their fathers. But now the student-teacher relationship has become friendlier. Students dont hesitate to ask their teachers for a cigarette. With teachers being told to go easy on students, it has become very difficult to discipline them. If the teachers act tough, the students may commit suicide. Thus they are very cautious. But this is a very dangerous trend as students are being allowed to get away with anything.

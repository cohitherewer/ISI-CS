                      Of David and Goliath                    T his is not Theatre is a hilarious interaction between a renowned theatre personality and a maverick television presenter. The premise being the promotion of the theatre festival, the theatre personality is subjected to utter embarrassment by the presenter on his chat show with inane questions about what theatre means to the commoner. The theatre director, much to his vain, tries very hard to explain the eternal appeal of theatre. On the other hand, the chat show host, through raw humour, points out how theatre activists have actually become hypocrites and have abandoned their platforms. What follows is a complete laughathon dramatised by Mir and Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee. Ably assisted by musicians backing a chat show, this presentation attempts to highlight the plight of theatre workers in the highly commercial world of television and cinema. Produced by Bandage and directed by Mir, This is not Theatre is part of the ongoing Vodafone Odeon 2010 theatre festival in association with t2.            Event: This Is Not Theatre at Vodafones Odeon 2010 in association with t2 When: Today at 8 pm Where: Main lawns, Tollygunge Club

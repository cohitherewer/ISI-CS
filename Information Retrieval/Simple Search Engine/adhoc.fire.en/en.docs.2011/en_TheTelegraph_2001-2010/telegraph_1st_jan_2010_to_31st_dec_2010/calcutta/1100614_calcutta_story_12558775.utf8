                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Survivors suffer train phobia
  - Jnaneswari aftermath          SANJAY MANDAL                The Jnaneswari Express after it jumped rails       Survivors of the Jnaneswari Express derailment and its collision with a goods train two weeks ago have refused to travel by   train to Kharagpur to retrieve their luggage.  ldquo;We had requested several passengers, who were injured   and have now recovered, to take a train to Kharagpur and identify their luggage. A number of them refused, saying they had   developed a phobia about trains. They requested us to take   them to Kharagpur by road, rdquo; said a senior official of South   Eastern Railway.  ldquo;Railway officials had offered to take me to Kharagpur by   train to get my luggage but I cannot even think of boarding a   train again, rdquo; said 42-year-old Sushmita Guha, who runs a consultancy firm in Delhi, where she had recently shifted from   Mumbai. Sushmita was going to Mumbai with her brother Subhashis for shifting some belongings to Delhi. She was in coach   S5 and her brother in S4 when the Jnaneswari Express jumped   rails near Jhargram and was hit by the goods train coming   from the opposite direction.  Sushmita was thrown against a wall of her coach and suffered multiple injuries. She crawled under the engine of the   goods train and stayed there till she was rescued several hours   later. She is now recovering in her Jadavpur home. ldquo;I saw bodies scattered everywhere. The scenes are haunting me constantly. I am petrified of boarding a train again, rdquo; she added.  Mala Sen, 48, who was in coach S3, is grappling with similar   fears. She, her husband Suvro and their 15-year-old son   Saurabh and 22-year-old daughter Sreya had come to Calcutta   to attend a relative rsquo;s wedding. Sreya rsquo;s right arm had to be amputated. She is admitted to AMRI Hospitals, Dhakuria.  ldquo;If we even try to go near a train, the horrifying memories   of the night would rush back, rdquo; said Mala.   Psychiatrists and psychologists said it could take the survivors years to overcome their phobia.  ldquo;They are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Its   effect can be felt a few days after an incident. The sight of so   many bodies has resulted in severe shock. Some survivors   might become severely depressed, rdquo; said city-based psychiatrist   Ranadip Ghosh Roy. According to him, post-traumatic stress   disorder generally lasts from six months to a year but for some,   it can last a lifetime. ldquo;In such cases, counselling is needed. rdquo;  Psychologist Tapashi Mitra felt the near-death experience   had left scars on the survivors rsquo; minds. ldquo;Being stuck in a coach   among bodies, uncertain whether one would be rescued or not,   added to the shock, rdquo; she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Road rogues attack family
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Road rogues attack family
          PRONAB MONDAL                          Rohit Dafadar on Tuesday. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                   
	Two brothers were beaten up and their mother abused and almost kicked in front of their central Calcutta home on Monday afternoon for asking some youths chatting on the road to make way for their car.        
	The brazen assault less than 24 hours after a homemaker was allegedly molested in Salt Lake by a Trinamul councillors son and two friends has raised the red flag over the rule of the rogue on city roads and prompted many to ask  what has Calcutta come to?        
	Our family has been living here (off Amherst Street) for almost five decades with dignity. Who would have thought that one day my sons would be beaten up and I would be subjected to such lewd remarks right in front of our home? We are scared to live here now, schoolteacher Pratima Dafadar, 50, told Metro sitting in her familys ground-floor apartment.        
	Rohit Dafadar, the younger of Pratima and Sanjay Dafadars two sons, said he was returning home with his elder brother Rahul and sister-in-law Sumita in their black Santro around 12.30pm on Monday when they were forced to stop as some youths were chatting in the middle of Baithakhana Road.        
	Our driver honked but they wouldnt budge. Two of them walked towards us menacingly and demanded to know why the driver was honking, recounted Rohit, a second-year BSc student.        
	Rohit, who then got off the vehicle to request them to move to the side, took the first punch. There was no provocation. I had merely asked them not to use foul language when one of the boys taunted me by asking: Eta ki tor baba-r rasta (Does this road belong to your father)? It was humiliating, he said.        
	When Rohits elder brother got off the car to protect his sibling, the assailants targeted him. As they pounced on my brother, I started running towards our house, around 75 yards away. Two of the boys chased me on a motorbike and assaulted me again at our doorstep, said Rohit.        
	Mother Pratima, who had come out on hearing the commotion, wasnt spared either. I will never forget the sight of my mother being forced to lean against the wall beside the entrance to our building while the duo hurled abuses at her, punctuated by lewd gestures, recalled Rohit.        
	Pratima said she couldnt bring herself to utter the words that the assailants used. You wont be able to print those in your newspaper. One of the youths would have kicked me in the abdomen had my husband not come out of the house in the nick of time, she narrated.        
	As Rohit entered the house to escape a repeat assault, the youths almost followed him inside. Dhor s****, ghar theke tene ber kore aan (Catch him, drag him out of the room), Pratima quoted one of them as shouting.        
	The assailants left only after Pratimas husband Sanjay, a trader, told them that his family had been residing in the para for 47 years.        
	The Dafadars later went to Amherst Street police station, where officers made an entry in the general diary instead of accepting an FIR. The nature of the incident is non-cognisable, so an FIR cant be lodged, claimed an officer.        
	This was despite the family identifying the main accused as Laltu and Babua and mentioning their names in the complaint. No police team had visited the area to investigate the incident till late on Tuesday, residents said.        
	According to a senior officer in Lalbazar, there was no reason why the assault couldnt have been treated as a cognisable offence. The officer on duty should have registered an FIR and started a case under Section 341 of the IPC (wrongful restraint).        
	The Dafadars next-door neighbour, Kunal Sanyal, said many residents had witnessed the brothers being assaulted. They are decent people, very well-behaved. You cant imagine the way they were assaulted and abused. We didnt dare protest, he added.

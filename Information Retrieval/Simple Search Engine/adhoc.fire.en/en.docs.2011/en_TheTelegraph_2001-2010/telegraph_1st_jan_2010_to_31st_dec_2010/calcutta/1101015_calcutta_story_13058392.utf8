The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Saptami suffers triple blow
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Saptami suffers triple blow
          OUR BUREAU                          People queue up in the rain at Md Ali Park pandal on Central Avenue on Thursday afternoon. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                  
	Showers, snarls and Metro snags conspired against the Calcuttan on Saptami, turning Thursday into the worst possible start to Puja.        
	If heavy rain prevented many from stepping out in their Saptami best, traffic snarls throughout town ensured that those who did beat the weather spent more time on the road than in the pandals. The unkindest cut was the unreliability of the citys transport lifeline with malfunctioning doors and train delays being the order of the day.        
	So inconvenienced were commuters that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was forced to ask police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti to speak to the Metro Railway authorities to rectify the glitches in the next 24 hours.        
	Metros performance is a matter of concern. They should inform people about their plans. The chief minister has instructed the police commissioner to talk to the authorities, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said.         
	Even if Mamata Banerjees Metro gets back on track by Ashtami afternoon, the bad news is that the rain and the road chaos are here to stay, at least till Navami.                
	The city and its neighbourhood are set to receive spells of moderate to heavy rain till the second half of Navami. There was a semblance of hope till last evening of better weather from Ashtami afternoon but the cloud-filled skies now tell a different story, warned Ashish Kumar Sen, a senior official of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	Traffic trouble on the thoroughfares is also unlikely to be sorted out overnight with Lalbazar failing to deploy enough manpower to cope with the festive footfall, which officers claim has increased manifold over last year.        
	Central Avenue, Bidhan Sarani and BT Road witnessed snarls that refused to clear even after a 15,000-strong police contingent was deployed on the streets. In the south, traffic was bumper to bumper on stretches of Prince Anwar Shah Road, Durgapur Bridge, Gariahat Road and the Rashbehari connector through the day.        
	Siddhartha Datta, the pro vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University, was one of those who bore the brunt of the traffic mess. It was 2.25pm when I took the turn towards Gariahat at the Ruby rotary. Now it is 4pm and I have only reached Bijon Setu, he told Metro.         
	And then, it started raining. At 4.15pm, the crowd scampered for cover and organisers of the Lake Gardens Peoples Association puja were soon staring at an empty pandal. By the time the shower eased, the park where the puja is being held was a bowl of slush. We have never had an empty pandal on a Saptami afternoon in the past 10 years, quot; rued Sanjoy Sengupta, from the organising committee.         
	Piyali Sarkar, a resident of Prince Anwar Shah Road, quickly changed her plans of covering as many pujas as possible by late evening. Badamtala Ashar Sangha is the farthest we are going today. It might rain again. Why ruin a new sari? she said, husband and son by her side.        
	Those who tried to escape the rain and the road chaos by exercising the rail option quickly discovered that the Metro was worse.        
	Metro Railway officials, however, remained in denial about the technical and logistical problems plaguing the citys only rapid transit system.        
	One senior officer has been deployed in each station to ensure that services are smooth during the peak hours. If they see that the rush is getting beyond control, they can seek additional rakes, said Amar Nath, general manager, Metro Railway. He claimed that Metro was already running more trains this Puja.

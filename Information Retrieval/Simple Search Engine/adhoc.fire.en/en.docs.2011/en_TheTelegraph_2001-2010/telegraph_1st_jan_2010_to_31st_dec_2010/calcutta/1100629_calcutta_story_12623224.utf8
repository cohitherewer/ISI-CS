The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traffic-stop rallies rise as Celsius dips
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Traffic-stop rallies rise as Celsius dips
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A dip in the Celsius has raised the protest pitch in the city with political parties and their affiliates hitting the street with traffic-stopping gusto.        
	If Monday was bad  three major rallies and one minor protest in the heart of the city clogged several arteries across town  brace for worse (see box).        
	Five organisations have sought permission to hold rallies in the Metro Channel-Rani Rashmoni Avenue-Shahid Minar zone in the next three days. The number of applicants for rallies usually goes up around this time when there is a drop in the temperature, said an officer at Lalbazar looking after bookings for protest shows.        
	So, if the waterlogging doesnt get you this week, the protests in the central business district will.        
	In the past fortnight, while the swelter was still having its sway, Calcuttas most popular protest sites saw only three small gatherings.        
	On Monday, the 1sq km area in and around the Esplanade crossing played host to four public meetings, with traffic going haywire between 12.30pm and 4.30pm.        
	Playing traffic demons were the West Bengal National Voluntary Force Members Association, All Bengal NVF Members Kalyan Samity and the Bandi Mukti Committee. Plus, women supporters of the BJP held a meeting near the CESC headquarters.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta was among the speakers at the rally of the West Bengal National Voluntary Force Members Association. Before holding forth on his favourite topic  perils of market economy  the minister thanked the participants for turning up in such huge numbers.        
	Around 2,000 people had turned up and blocked more than half of Metro Channel, forcing traffic to crawl through a small opening.        
	North Bengal is being lashed by rain and storm. Despite that you have come. I thank you all on behalf of the Left Front government, Dasgupta said.        
	Two of the rallies began around 2pm and another half an hour later but protesters started marching to the sites at least one-and-a-half hours in advance.        
	The supporters of the Bandi Mukti Committee  they were joined by a few other groups, such as the Lalgarh Mancha and the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights  started their march from College Square around 2.30pm and converged near the Esplanade bus terminus around 3.30pm.        
	The processions brought traffic to a halt on College Street, CR Avenue, APC Roy Road, SN Banerjee Road, Lenin Sarani, Ganesh Chandra Avenue and parts of JL Nehru Road.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Suchitra tax plea in high court
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Suchitra tax plea in high court
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Monday admitted a petition by Suchitra Sen seeking a revision of her wealth tax and asked her to make an interim payment of Rs 5 lakh to the civic body.        
	Justice Soumitra Pal also barred the reclusive screen legend from selling her flats without the courts consent.        
	Later in the day, a lawyer representing Sen requested the judge to reduce the amount to be submitted to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation as the outstanding wealth tax was only Rs 1.90 lakh. The judge asked the lawyer to file an application and send a copy to the CMC lawyer.        
	Sen had entered into an agreement with a developer on her Ballygunge Circular Road house.         
	Case records reveal that of the nine flats in the reconstructed building, Sen had sold six and kept the rest for herself.        
	On March 30, 2006, the CMC had sent a notification to Sen saying the valuation of the three flats was Rs 97 lakh and Rs 1.90 lakh was due as wealth tax.        
	The notification was challenged in the high court, where Sens lawyer said the three flats comprised one unit as they were linked to one another and the valuation was Rs 67 lakh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stephen still without basics
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stephen still without basics
          POULOMI BANERJEE                          Stephen Court on fire on March 23. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The arrest of Sanjay Bagaria has meant little to residents of Stephen Court for whom basic amenities remain as elusive as when they first moved back to the Park Street address after the March 23 fire.         
	The director of Stephen Court Ltd was arrested in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, on August 24. On Tuesday, he was remanded in police custody till September 3. For the residents, the arrest raises only one question  will it help solve the problems plaguing the building?        
	Many tenants, like Patience Traub of Block III, feel the main problem is that they do not know who is responsible for what. There are just too many people involved. I cant figure out which are the things I should take care of and what is the landlords responsibility, she said.        
	According to tenants, their interaction with Bagaria had been minimal. He and his partners suddenly became important after the fire because residents needed Stephen Court Ltd to put things back on track.        
	Water supply is a problem. The electricity connection to the pump is in the name of Stephen Court Ltd. So everyone is making individual arrangements, said Sanjiv Dua, who has an office at Stephen Court. He has been running a small pump using the office electricity connection to draw water from the underground reservoir.        
	The dysfunctional lifts are keeping many away. Nimmi Johar, a resident of Block IV, had moved back briefly before shifting again because she would not have been able to leave the building even in an emergency without the lift.

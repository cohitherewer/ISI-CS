The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trader missing for two weeks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Trader missing for two weeks
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Cops have not been able to track down a vice-president of a share-trading firm who went missing under mysterious circumstances more than a week ago.        
	Family members of Arun Kumar Mishra have denied receiving any threat or ransom call. The cellphone of the trader, in his mid-30s, has remained switched off.        
	Mishra disappeared after leaving his NS Road office in BBD Bag on November 27.        
	He left his flat in Sherwood Estate, Narendrapur, and reached his office as usual on that day. He has not been seen since starting for home in the evening, said an officer of Hare Street police station, where the traders family members lodged a missing complaint.        
	The anti-rowdy squad of the detective department has joined the hunt.        
	The incident does not appear to be a case of abduction for ransom. If a gang had done it for money, its members would have contacted the family, said Sukumar Mitra, the officer-in-charge of the police station.        
	An officer of the detective department, however, said professional kidnappers sometimes took time to get in touch with a victims family members to put them under pressure.        
	But 13 days is a long time. Abductors never keep a victim for such a long period, said a sleuth.        
	The investigation so far has failed to unearth any evidence of business rivalry that could have led to Mishras kidnapping. The trader apparently did not owe anyone a large sum of money.        
	Call records of Sharmas cellphone did not provide any lead. We spoke to everyone he had a conversation with on the day he disappeared, added the detective.

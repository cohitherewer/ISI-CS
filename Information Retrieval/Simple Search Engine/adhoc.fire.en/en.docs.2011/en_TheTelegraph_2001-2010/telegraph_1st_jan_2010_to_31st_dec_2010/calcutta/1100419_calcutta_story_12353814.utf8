The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mystery of the missing storm
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mystery of the missing storm
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A satellite image shows a cloudless sky over the city on Sunday afternoon                                  
	Norwesters continued to elude the city on Sunday despite conducive conditions, baffling weathermen.        
	Norwesters had been forecast through most of last week but the city has not seen any so far this season.        
	Calcutta should have had at least five Norwesters from the beginning of March. Conditions have been favourable for a storm for quite a few days now, said a scientist at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting.        
	Norwesters are the primary source of relief from heat at this time of the year. A single Norwester can keep the mercury in check for two to three days.        
	Instead of Bihar and adjoining Bengal, most low-pressure troughs are forming over Sikkim, sub-Himalayan Bengal and the Northeast. As a result, the focus of the thunderstorm activity has also shifted north-east, said an independent meteorologist.        
	The troughs need to form to the west of Calcutta for Norwesters to reach the city and its outskirts.        
	The absence of Norwesters was the main reason behind the intense heat that south Bengal had to cope with till a week back, said the weatherman.        
	The maximum temperature on Sunday was normal at 36.1 degrees Celsius.The minimum temperature, however, was four degrees above normal at 26.5 degrees Celsius, which meant that the average daytime temperature remained higher than usual. The humidity peaked at 95 per cent.        
	The high humidity is making the weather sultry, but it is a prerequisite for Norwesters, said an official of the India Meteorological Department said.        
	Monday, said the weatherman, would be humid and uncomfortable, with the possibility of development of thunderclouds towards afternoon or evening.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday ordered an estranged couple to stay together for at least five days and try to resolve their differences. The division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice R.N. Roy passed the order after talking to Mausumi Chakrabarty and Surojit Banerjee in a closed courtroom.         
	The couples lawyers said the judges had advised their clients to stay together at Surojits Behala flat from February 20 to February 24. On February 25, the bench will again speak to the couple and take a decision, said one of the lawyers.        
	This was not the first time the court has played marriage counsellor. The high court had adopted the same method a number of times in the past and in 90 per cent of the cases, the couples returned to the court to say that they wanted to live together again, public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami pointed out.         
	Mausumi, a resident of Ghatal in East Midnapore, had married Surojit, a lawyer, in January 2009. My husband and his family members are Vaishnavs. After marriage, they started forcing me to take diksha from their guru. When I refused, they started torturing me. Unable to bear my husbands regular torture, I went back to my parents home in end-2009, Mausumi, 26, who has a doctorate, said.        
	In January 2010, Mausumi lodged an FIR alleging torture by Surojit and his family and Surojit moved an anticipatory bail plea before the high court.

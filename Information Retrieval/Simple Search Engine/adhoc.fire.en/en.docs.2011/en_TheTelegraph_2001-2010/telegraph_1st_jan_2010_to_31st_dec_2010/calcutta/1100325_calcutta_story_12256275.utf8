                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Scars on street of dine amp; party, dance amp; date
                            The imprints will linger on the scorched walls and ledges and windows of Stephen Court. But what about the street below? Picture by Pabitra Das				                           
	Bertie Da Silva teaches English at St Xaviers College, browses at MusicWorld, meets friends over Viennese Coffee at Flurys and plays an occasional gig at Someplace Else. He pens a piece for Metro              
	1.45pm: Tuesday afternoon. I get the news that a fire has broken out somewhere on Park Street. Its a busy afternoon in the office and I only vaguely register the information. Fires break out all the time, big ones and small ones. It can get as callous and impersonal as that. The mind briefly registers the event but nothing of its import.        
	2.30pm: I get a call from a friend whos been watching the fire on TV. He is evidently worked up by what hes been watching and needs to talk about it. He tells me about people leaping to their death, and people running up and down on fifth floor ledges, and that at least six people are dead and hundreds are trapped inside the raging inferno.         
	I get a call from home. Same information delivered in the same tone. The details register again but the mind remains untouched.         
	3pm: More frantic calls and I really cant understand what the fuss is all about. I am on Park Street, too. Perhaps my proximity to the disaster has prompted these many calls.        
	By now I know that the fire is in Stephen Court. I briefly wonder about whats going on: has MusicWorld been affected; has the fire spread; are the restaurants closed; but it is all still too distant, and yet its barely half a kilometre from where I work.        
	Then I hear the wail of sirens tearing down Park Street. The event becomes a little more real. I take a walk. Park Street is almost empty of traffic. There is an uncanny quiet in the air. Small groups of plainclothes policemen walk past briskly heading in the direction of Flurys.        
	4.30pm: Im home. I switch on TV and only then does it actually hit me. The visuals tear at something inside. I am a vicarious witness to scenes of horror and terror, and to acts of heroism and generosity and bravery and even political one-upmanship. The box makes it all so real.        
	I switch from channel to channel. And then I get a visual of teeming crowds that seem to be swelling by the minute. They stretch from the junction of Free School Street and Park Street in two directions. Where do they come from? And in such numbers? What is it about disasters that they exert such irresistible fascination? It is evident that the crowds cannot tear themselves away. I watch some policemen desperately trying to clear people away but many more are waiting to take their place.        
	Then it strikes me. It is like watching a tragedy. The fire is a performance, the milling crowds an audience responding as an audience would to terrible events taking place upon a stage. It may even appear to be scripted in acts, the action rising to climax, building up in suspense and then followed by a brief interlude before the next scene can begin. The tragic ending will provide even a catharsis of sorts. And it is all free.        
	Of course the spectators are not passive onlookers. They are present as witnesses for the same reasons that spectators pay money to witness a tragic play. There is something irresistible about watching others suffer and die or suffer and be saved. And all this happening for real.        
	10pm: The crowds have gone home. Park Street is abysmally quiet. The lights that have been rigged up throw strange shadows down this so familiar street. The restaurants are closed. The kiosk at the Middleton Street corner has its shutters down. Even the ubiquitous beggar children have disappeared.        
	Park Street is where we dine and party and dance and date. The tinsel never seems to lose its burnish here. But today the bright neon bubble burst. Our pleasures are so flimsy and unreal.        
	Yes, the lights will be switched on tomorrow. The bars will be back to noisy business. Bar-B-Q will overflow at dinner time. And in a week the fire will be forgotten. The tinsel will be strung up again like bunting. The neon bubble will glow the brighter as we return to dine and party and dance and date.        
	But those who died leave behind those who will mourn. Those who survived the fire will perhaps be changed forever. But will Park Street really ever be the same again? The scars on Stephen Court will remain until that part of the building is pulled down or even perhaps rebuilt.        
	But Park Street is more than a street or a place. It is an idea, a notion. And when we dine and party and dance and date we make that idea real for ourselves.        
	Perhaps todays fire might teach us that that idea is only an illusion for Park Street is a street in the mind stretched across our inadequate imaginations. But the real street can never be the same again.        
	The imprints of todays events will linger on the scorched walls and ledges and windows. Events, like people, leave a memory and an impression on their surroundings. On the street below we will return to leap inside the bubble and dine and party and dance and date.        
	It is just like that sad and terrible poem by Auden, Musee des Beaux Arts, where he recounts the work of the old masters who, he says, were never wrong about suffering. Christ might die on the cross but even that dreadful martyrdom will run its course while children skate on the edge of a pond or the dogs go on with their doggy life.        
	So we might briefly have stopped to watch and we might even have been briefly moved but we have things to do and our own stories to live.        
	And so the crowds have gone home now. And tomorrow the bands will play again at Someplace Else.              
	What does Park Street mean to you and how have you been scarred by the blaze? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com

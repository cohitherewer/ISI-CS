The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plan lack blamed for Metro ticket mess
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Plan lack blamed for Metro ticket mess
          SANJAY MANDAL                          A file picture of a queue at a Metro Railway counter                                  
	Metro Railway is facing a ticketing crisis which a section of insiders has attributed to a lack of planning by the authorities.        
	A severe shortage of magnetic tickets is forcing the authorities to sell paper tickets  the ones issued for suburban trains  at all stations from 7am to 9am. There has been a delay in the tendering process for procuring magnetic ticket reels from abroad. We have bought some reels on an emergency basis to ensure the ticketing system does not collapse, a Metro Railway official said.        
	Since the automatic turnstile gates are only compatible to magnetic tickets, the entry to the platforms is manned by checking assistants during the period when paper tickets are issued. Issuing paper tickets is time consuming compared with selling the magnetic ones. Long queues are formed in front of most counters from 7am to 9am, said a source.        
	We have procured 5,000 reels of magnetic tickets through a single tender. These have arrived in our Noapara store. Also, an order for another 30,000 reels has been placed. Once the consignment arrives, most likely in April, the crisis will be resolved, a Metro Railway official said. The reels, each containing 450 tickets, are imported from Korea. Metro needs on an average around 80 reels daily.        
	Officials said the crisis was caused by a delay in the tendering process and confusion over the overhauling of the ticketing system by the Centre for Railway Information System (CRIS).        
	The overhauling of the system was supposed to be complete a year ago. We didnt place any order for magnetic ticket reels thinking those might not be compatible with the new system. But the original tender of the CRIS had to be cancelled because of some problems and a fresh one was floated, causing the delay, the official pointed out.        
	In the first week of February, the officials had pressed the panic button and old tickets used before 1995 were brought from Metros Kalighat store and distributed to various stations.         
	But the tickets, which the authorities had decided to issue on Sundays, had to be withdrawn following protests by passengers over the low price printed on them.        
	Metro Railway had printed 29 lakh paper tickets when the extended section between Tollygunge and Garia Bazar was inaugurated last August.        
	We had initially thought the magnetic tickets would not be compatible with the gates in the new stations. But there was no such problem and the tickets were not used. If required, we can use those tickets, too, said the official.

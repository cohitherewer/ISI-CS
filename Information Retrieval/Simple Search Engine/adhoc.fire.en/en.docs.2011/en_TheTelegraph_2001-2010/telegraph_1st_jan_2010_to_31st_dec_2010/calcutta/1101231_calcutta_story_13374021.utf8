The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | GET IT RIGHT ON BIG NIGHT
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      GET IT RIGHT ON BIG NIGHT
                                          
	Youve just danced away the night on Christmas Eve and its already time for the biggest party of them all. Metro tells you how to make it count              
	What to wear        
	If a sexy cocktail dress is a must on this special night, so is a warm wrap. After all the dancing, when you feel the chill, thisll come in handy, says designer Kallol Datta. Trousers have made a comeback on the runway and should be on your must-wear list too. You can try a pair of tailored trousers, says Kallol. Dump those boot-cuts though. Camel and purple are the colours to don. Make a statement with your accessories, like a chunky neckpiece.         
	For men, polished shoes and a good watch are Kallols picks. Toy watches are popular. Youngsters can go for pop hues like fluorescent green or bright yellow.                         
	Top it up         
	Make-up artist Abhijit Chanda suggests a goth look for the bold and the beautiful ). Smudge a gel-based eyeliner, top it off with eyegloss, he suggests. Tousled hair complements this look. If you want to play it safe, warm gold hues on the eyes is a good bet, says Abhijit. Skip the kohl, try the clotted-mascara look instead. Wear your hair open or put it up in a bun.        
	Colour-blocking is big. You can match green eye-shadow with pink lips or blue eye-shadow with peach lips, says Abhijit.        
	Men, set up a date at the salon, please. The wet look is out for the winters, warns Abhijit.              
	Destination        
	Usher in the New Year at the social clubs or cool pubs across town, all powered by The Telegraph and t2, or enjoy the pirates party at Swabhumi.              
	Sip and bite        
	Come New Year and the formal Christmas sit-down dinner makes way for quick bites and ladles of tomato and Mulligatawny soup. European and Anglo-Indian nibbles like Beer Batter Fried Baby Corn with Salsa Ranchera, Chilli Beef and Barbecued Chicken Sausages are some pop picks along with the Indian Massaledar Machhli Kasundi and Bhatti Ka Murg. Fish Cordon Bleu, Fried Fish and Roast Pork make up the mains with Chinese mushroom and corn specials.                    
	Theres nothing like celebrating with bubblies! says Subhasis Ganguli, the president of Calcutta Wine Club. Its cool, classy and always in vogue. So pick up that bottle of Moets or raise a toast with Duc de Varenne and Henkell Trocken. Or go red hot with a Sauvignon blanc like a New Zealand Saint Claire or Australian Cloudy Bay.               
	Hosting a house party        
	Planning to order in some food, pick up some single malt, play your favourite CDs and pass it off as a New Years Eve party? Forget it. A few tips to make your house party high and happening.        
	 Decor: A theme party is good fun but dont overdo it. Put a centrepiece on the dinner table that goes with the theme, says PR expert Rita Bhimani. Place aromatic candles around the house for a cosy feel. Limit the number of guests.        
	 F amp;B: Ensure a constant supply of finger food and drinks. Keep glasses and ice cubes piled and toothpicks and napkins handy. A buffet dinner goes best with all that drinking and dancing. Try making simple canapes with crackers and yummy relishes and purees to go with the drinks.         
	 Music: Play tracks both popular and personal. Though I gotta feeling (Black Eyed Peas) might be the perfect midnight moment song, do also keep the Munnis and Sheilas handy. The playlist must be ready. Song dedications and requests will lend an intimate touch to your party.        
	 Midnight moment: Turn down the music, uncork the bubbly and chant 10, 9, 8 followed by hugs and kisses galore.               
	If you want to have NOTHING to do with the 31st madness...                        
	Book to curl up with: Youve watched the film and fallen in love with Julia Roberts all over again, now read Eat Pray Love and join Elizabeth Gilbert on her journey of self-discovery.        
	DVD to watch: Hopeless romantic? When Harry Met Sally. Loner? The Social Network. Bolly junkie? Dabangg.        
	Music to listen to: You grrr at gatherings and just want the world to let you be? Amake amar moto thakte dao from Autograph.    
	HAPPY NEW YEAR!					
	   Priyanka Chopra, who whizzed through town 
  last week, passed on some DIY tips for Metro readers to step into 2011 in style...            Wardrobe must-haves
  Jeans mdash; one dark blue, one light blue
  A well-fitted white shirt 
  A nice black jacket
  A little black dress
  A fantastic sari   Hair and make-up tricks
  Freshly washed hair, well-styled, of course
  Make-up, the fresher the better. I like light lipstick and light eye shadows or just dark eyes with kohl and no lips. Or just a lipgloss.
  Smelling nice is very important. Your hair smelling nice. And you smelling nice.   And the attitude? 
  Just confidence. There shouldn rsquo;t be an attitude, there should be a sort of natural ease.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Scorsese eyes a city film
  - Hollywood guru keen to restore Uday Shankars Kalpana          MOHUA DAS                                    GOODFELLAS: Uday Shankar and Martin Scorsese                                        
	Calcutta is calling Martin Scorsese. The Hollywood guru has been in touch with Mamata Shankar over email because he is very keen to help revise and restore Uday Shankars film, Kalpana.        
	The offer came from Martin himself and we are delighted that a film-maker like him is willing to take up the restoration of my fathers film, Mamata told Metro.        
	How did the Scorsese-Shankar connection happen? Martin is a friend of my kaka (uncle) Ravi Shankar. He saw Kalpana (made in 1948) and liked it very much. Kaka called me to tell me about Martins interest in the film and in restoring it after which Martin and I have been exchanging emails, said Uday Shankars daughter.        
	Kalpana is the only film made by Uday Shankar. Both he and his wife Amala Shankar had acted and danced in the film, which was based on the theme of dance and shot in the Gemini Studios of (then) Madras. Kalpana was much ahead of its time. If it is released now, people will still relate to it, said Mamata, adding that mother Amala would have the final say in the restoration matter.        
	The maker of landmark films from Taxi Driver and Raging Bull to Casino and The Departed is also the co-founder of the World Cinema Foundation, working on the preservation of neglected films from around the world since 2007.        
	Scorsese already has a Calcutta connection, being a follower and promoter of Satyajit Ray films ever since he watched Pather Panchali in high school. He was at the forefront of Rays nomination for the Oscar and he hailed him as one of the greatest film-makers in his recent film preservation speech at the Golden Globe Awards.        
	Time to visit the city of Ray and Shankar, Goodfella?

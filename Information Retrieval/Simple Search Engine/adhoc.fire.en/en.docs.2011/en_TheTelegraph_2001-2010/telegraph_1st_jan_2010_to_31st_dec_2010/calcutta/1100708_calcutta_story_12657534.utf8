          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	The cargo ship carrying military hardware for Pakistan that had docked in the city after being detained near the Sunderbans set sail for Karachi on Wednesday evening.        
	Aegean Glory was allowed to leave the city following clearance from the ministry of external affairs on behalf of the UN.         
	Customs officials had found discrepancies in the declarations of the ships clearing agent in Calcutta, Crystal Shipping, and its captain regarding the consignment on board.         
	Aegean Glory was to go to Karachi after offloading military hardware meant for Nepal in the city.        
	The ministry informed the Customs on Wednesday that the ship was carrying UN goods after getting in touch with the world bodys movement control office in New York. Customs officials were awaiting the confirmation from the UN since the ship was detained on June 25.         
	We cleared the ships movement after Customs officials told us they had confirmed that the ship was indeed carrying military hardware from the UN mission in Liberia, said a port official.         
	Sources said the ship off- loaded the hardware meant for the Nepal army before leaving for Karachi. Crew members waved to the crowd that had gathered at the dock to watch the ship sail off.         
	According to the Customs and intelligence agencies, the ship had set sail from Liberia on May 17 and reached Chittagong in Bangladesh on June 15. The captain is Greek. The rest of the crew are from Armenia, Romania and Ukraine.         
	The military hardware for Pakistan and Nepal armies were being used by the UN peacekeeping force in Liberia. The 551-tonne military cargo, including smoke bombs, anti-aircraft guns and rocket-launchers, were loaded in the Monrovia port.

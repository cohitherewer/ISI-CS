The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cup nights go Waka Waka
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cup nights go Waka Waka
  - Shakiras hip-swinging anthem floors city party crowd          POULOMI BANERJEE                                                  
	Waka Waka  this time for Shakira and Kaka and Maradona! The citys party people have taken the sexy singers do it chant to heart  so what if its in Swahili  as World Cup 2010s official song rules the floors.        
	Its very popular and we are playing it loud at the club, said DJ Girish D of Shisha. Agreed DJ Sumit of Roxy: Waka Waka is the most popular track right now.        
	The song was launched a month before the World Cup kick-off, but it only caught on once the Messis and Ronaldos began juggling the Jabulani. We played it once before June 11 and people didnt seem to identify with it. But now, I get requests for it all the time, said DJ Vishal of Tantra. It is also on the must-play list of foreigners at nightclubs, many of whom have home teams to support in South Africa. I get constant requests for Waka Waka from foreigners, confirmed Vishal.        
	And Waka Waka, feel the console keepers, could play long after the Cup is won and lost on July 11, as the rhythm has really got the Calcuttan.        
	Maybe not just on the dance floor either, given its popularity at malls and department stores. I was shopping at the Kankurgachhi Pantaloons on Sunday and they were playing Waka Waka. Its infectious, smiled 33-year-old Piyali Mukherjee.        
	So, what has worked for Waka Waka? It is a beautiful track and Shakira is always a hit, but the song has also been marketed very well. People tend to get hooked when they hear a song so much, said Girish.        
	Many who are dancing their nights away to Waka Waka do not even associate the song with the soccer extravaganza. Ankur Chakraborty, 21, listens to Waka Waka everyday, not for the Cup but for Shakira.        
	And this is one thing about the Cup that the girls dont mind their guys being hooked to. I get requests for Waka Waka from the women all the time. It is a good, groovy track for the women, with a lot of Latin American elements. Actually it is a universal favourite and popular with both men and women of all age groups, said Girish, who waits for a packed floor before turning it on.        
	Sumit usually plays two versions of the song every evening. People start requesting the number the moment the party starts, but I try to hold on as long as I can, said the DJ who plays the original Shakira number before midnight and then a remixed version which is slightly faster later in the night.              
	DO        
	Shake your hips like Shakira. Contract abdomen muscles on the left side to lift left hip. Push hip to the left. Bring back to position. Repeat with right hip.        
	Just do your own thing and enjoy the music.               
	DONT        
	Try to coordinate with partner         
	Do use favourite Bhangra steps

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Winter sign in sunny sky
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Winter sign in sunny sky
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The temperature might not have dropped to the wintry level yet but the Maidan came alive on Sunday morning with one of the most-watched events of the season  the Military Tattoo programme, organised as part of the Vijay Diwas celebration. (Amit Datta)                                  
	A sunny weekend after a rainy week has raised the weathermans hopes that winter will finally set in this week.        
	The mercury may start plunging as the cloud cover gives way to bright sunshine, a prerequisite for a chilly evening and night.        
	However, though Saturday and Sunday afternoons were sunny, the evenings or nights were not that cold.        
	It takes some time for the process to set in, reasoned Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The conditions have just returned to normal. The forecast about the onset of winter in the next two-three days is still valid. The mercury should climb down from Monday.         
	The weakening of the low-pressure area off the Andhra coast and the dissipation of the cyclonic circulation over the north Bay of Bengal have cleared the way for North Wind, which drags down the temperature.        
	The flow of moisture from the Bay into south Bengal, which continued for most of the past week, stopped in the early hours of Saturday following the weakening of the two systems.        
	As the moisture content has declined, there is no scope for cloud formation or rain. The afternoons are likely to be dry and sunny  which they are expected to be during this time of the year  leading to cold evenings and nights, said a Met department official.        
	The cold Northerlies and Northwesterlies was not active over the weekend. Once they gather pace, likely to happen anytime soon, the temperature will start falling, said an official of the India Meteorological Department.        
	Winter, which usually sets in around December 7, has been arriving late for the past three years. Meteorologists are attributing the trend to the increasing number of atmospheric formations over the Bay till the first week of December.        
	The transitional phase between the monsoon and winter, which used to end by mid-November, has been stretching to the first week of December.        
	The atmospheric formations over the Bay reduce in frequency with the passing of the transitional phase. But the phase is now active till the first week of December and so are the formations, resulting in delayed entry of winter, said a weather scientist.

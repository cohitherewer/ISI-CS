                Nine passengers of Air India Expresss Calcutta-Dhaka flight on Saturday evening missed the plane allegedly because the flight information display system of the international terminal was displaying the wrong time. An Air India official said the passengers had reported late, only five minutes before the scheduled departure at 6.10pm. The passengers later lodged a complaint with the airport authorities.     Sushanta Poddar, who worked for promoters in New Town, was arrested on Sunday in connection with the suicide of 79-year-old Prankrishna Mondal on June 23 after he was duped of land. Police said Poddar, who is in his 30s, was arrested in Barasat and charged with abetting suicide.     A 22-year-old criminal who was arrested on Saturday night tried to flee from Howrah District Hospital where he was taken for mandatory medical check-up before court production. Sheikh Rahmat was caught by some residents who were playing cards near the hospital.     Shankar Hazra, 40, was found hanging in his two-storeyed house in Uttam Ghosh Lane in Howrah on Sunday. Hazras sister Krishna Acharjee, 45, also tried to commit suicide but escaped unhurt as the knot on her neck was not tied properly. Police said the two had planned to commit suicide because of health and financial problems.    The body of Forward Bloc activist Sabir Ali, 21, who had gone missing on June 19, was found in a drain close to his house in Nawabpur, New Town, early on Sunday. There was a deep cut mark on the throat and the head was almost decapitated.    The lunar eclipse on June 26 was a partial eclipse and not a total one as mentioned in Metro on that day. The error is regretted.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A father of three girls who had burnt his wife to death for being pregnant with a fourth girl child was sentenced to life term in jail by a city court on Monday following a testimony by his eldest daughter.        
	Mohammad Taslim, a trader living in Kashaibagan Lane in Karaya, had set his wife Shabnam Parveen ablaze on June 28, 2003.        
	Their eldest daughter, who is now 12, and 22 other witnesses testified against Taslim in the Alipore court. The girl was five years old when she had seen her mother in flames and her father bolting the door to ensure Shabnam did not escape.        
	The child, too, might have died if neighbours did not rescue her and her cousin, who was also in the room at the time. Shabnam was in an advanced state of pregnancy then. Taslim had learnt that she was carrying a girl child, said a police officer.        
	The court also fined Taslim Rs 10,000.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Paul vs poet in puja play of lights
  - Oracle octopus for funky look, Tagore for the traditional pandals          POULOMI BANERJEE                         Octopus Paul glitters in a Chandernagore workshop; (below) an illumination depicting Tagore. (Pranab Kr Biswas)				                                             
	Paul the octopus is rivalling Tagore the poet in the popularity stakes this Puja.        
	Illumination artists of Chandernagore are working overtime to meet the demand for a piece of oracle Paul, whose uncanny predictions of World Cup match winners have made him an unlikely challenger to the bard on his 150th birth anniversary.         
	Such is the buzz about Paul that he cant be ignored, said artist Babu Paul, who is creating two sets of octopus lights for the Sreebhumi and 95 Pally pandals.        
	The artist has created Paul  tentacles and all  out of white and yellow lights with two red bulbs for eyes. Paul is shown crawling on rails with his back towards a box marked Netherlands before perching himself on the second box marked Spain.        
	The whole thing is being mounted on a platform. The World Cup theme song Waka Waka will play in the background, explained Babu, who has refused a few more Paul orders.        
	Brothers Ganesh and Kashinath Das of Das Electric have also chosen Paul as their light mascot for the College Square pandal. Octopus Paul is as bizarre as it gets but hes been big news since the Cup. So he is in our pandal, said an organiser.         
	If Paul is the face of funkiness, Tagore represents the traditional. Almost every barowari puja in town wants Tagore this year, said Kashinath of Das Electric.         
	At Sreebhumi, artist Babu is creating a lifesize likeness of Rabindranath in lights, along with scenes from some of his writings. College Square will also present scenes from the bards works like Chhotonadi, Haat, Chhuti and Falguni. Sreedhar Dass theme shows Tagore in various moods and surroundings.        
	For Ekdalia Evergreen, artist Asim Kumar Dey has created a 24-foot Tagore. In Howrah, he is trying to recreate the bards many expressions with a theme titled Rabindranath Lekhak, Rabindranath Sahityik, Rabindranath Kabbik.         
	Mother Teresa will also grace some pandals in her birth centenary year, the blue border of her sari aglow in LED and a red cross pinned to her pallu.

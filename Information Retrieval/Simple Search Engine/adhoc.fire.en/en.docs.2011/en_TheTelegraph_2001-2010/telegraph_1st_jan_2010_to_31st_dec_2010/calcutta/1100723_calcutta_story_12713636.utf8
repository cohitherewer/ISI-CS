                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mamata mix for crowd fix     Pole position to dank dump
                                                      
	Bamboo pole, noun: Piece of dried bamboo used in everything from a scaffold to a stage; last seen holding aloft a piece of history in front of Victoria House        
	Poles apart  thats been my existence before and after Mamata Banerjees massive roadshow on Wednesday.                  
	Today, as I stand here (in picture below by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya) disrobed, drenched and waiting to be lugged back to my life of desolation in some distant warehouse, I cant help but reflect on that momentous rally where I was the bulwark beneath a few hundred feet.        
	It was around a week ago that I came to know that I was to head for Victoria House to be a part of a Trinamul victory parade to beat all parades. Once I reached the venue, the enthusiasm all around was hard to miss. Didi, they said, was planning to make the rally a milestone in the march to Writers Buildings. Hmmmso I was going to be a part of not just a rally but history in the making? So far so good.        
	But Monday brought with it tragic news of 62 people dying in a train mishap at Sainthia. As the day wore on, the views around me ranged from the rally will surely be called off now to surely they cant call off the rally now? By evening, word was out that railway minister Mamata had decided to brave the criticism and go ahead with the rally as a martyrs day programme, if not a victory day.         
	Wednesday was unlike anything I had seen before. As I peeped through the scaffold clothed in green and white, it seemed the world was there  people with clenched fists, people standing on the asbestos roofs of the shops on the pavements, people chanting slogans, people chorusing We shall overcome.        
	I couldnt help wondering how much power this sari-clad woman in her 50s standing on the stage and railing against the rival CPM wielded. As I stood tall and firm, and she ranted and she rhymed, I could also feel the tremors coursing through Left Front territory. Change, I knew, was here. I felt it in my, er, bones.         
	The lakhs who witnessed this massive show of might are now gone. In a few minutes, I will be put on that Matador parked a few feet away and dumped in a dank warehouse near Hedua Park, where I will stay till the next big rally. But it wont be anything like the one I was part of on Wednesday. It cant be.        
	I feel hollow inside.                    AS TOLD TO SUBHAJOY ROY

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Empty roads andjalebi jubilation
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Empty roads and jalebi jubilation
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Deserted streets, stranded visitors and muscle power on the loose  Tuesdays shutdown showed why the bandh brigade loves Calcutta         
	Railway stations         
	The railways were outside the purview of the strike but the real test was finding transport outside the stations.         
	There are women in their 60s and 80s travelling with me. What will we do? wondered Kumar Pravesh, a tourist from Mumbai who reached Howrah from Siliguri. The handful of cabbies at the taxi stand refused to budge. Later in the day, Citu leaders were seen celebrating their success with hot jalebis and wide grins at Howrah station.        
	Airport        
	Taxis did the vanishing act outside the airport too. I just arrived from Greece and am on my way to Shillong. However, the earliest flight to Guwahati is on Wednesday. I dont know whether I can reach a hotel or have to spend the night in the airport, said Catherine Karouzakise, a Greek national.         
	A group of visitors from the UK hired an ambulance to reach AJC Bose Road. Citu supporters tried to block the entrance to the domestic terminal with banners and flags in the morning but were removed by the CISF.        
	Of the 24 flights that took off from the city, Air India operated 22, including those to Bangkok, Dhaka, London and New York, with 80 per cent passenger load.         
	Seventeen flights touched down till Tuesday evening. Airport sources said 82 take-offs and 90 arrivals were cancelled.        
	Metro rail        
	Metro ran its trains without any disruption. The bandh supporters, for once, made no attempt to block entry to stations. But footfall was a fraction of the normal weekday count, said a Metro official.         
	Writers Buildings        
	Empty corridors and ghostly rooms told the attendance story at the state secretariat on Tuesday.         
	Around 60 of the 7,000-odd employees came to work along with three IPS officers, three IAS officers and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	Bhattacharjee was the only minister to show up. Chief secretary Ardhendu Sen and home secretary Samar Ghosh, who usually attend work during strikes, are out of town.        
	The low turnout was expected. Tuesdays attendance was better than the July 5 strike, when only 17 people showed up, said a home department official.        
	Around 12.30pm, 38 Trinamul Youth Congress activists were arrested for protesting against the strike at the central gate.        
	Puja preparations        
	Work on pandals and decorations at many pujas suffered on Tuesday as workers failed to turn up. Our workers come from Barasat and Mukundapur mainly. None was able to make it and work was stalled for an entire day, rued Amitava Mukherjee of Kalighat Shree Sangha.         
	It was the same story at Milan Sangha in Mamata Banerjees backyard. Our karigars come from as far as Canning, said puja committee member Bijon Karmakar.         
	New Market        
	New Market came to life only after 6pm on Tuesday with Id shoppers converging at the hub for last-minute buys. Biggest buzz: at churi bazaar behind the CMC premises.        
	Malls and plexes         
	All major malls and multiplexes of the city barring South City Mall and the Fame multiplex within it were closed on Tuesday.        
	Mani Square opened after 6pm but the footfall was low, said a mall official.

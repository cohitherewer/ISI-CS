The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Suicide bid glare on safety net
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Suicide bid glare on safety net
          SANJAY MANDAL                          Glass barriers at a Singapore MRT station                                  
	Metro Railway foiled a second suicide attempt in a week on Sunday  this time by a 65-year-old retired schoolteacher under financial strain  even as the authorities rued the lack of a foolproof mechanism to prevent people from jumping on tracks.        
	Purnendu Dutta, a 65-year-old resident of Baguiati, jumped on a track at Belgachhia station around 6.20pm but was lifted to safety by Railway Protection Force personnel and other employees before a train came by.        
	A Metro Railway official said Dutta, who was carrying a suicide note in his pocket, was lucky to come out of it unscathed. He told us that he wanted to end his life to escape financial problems. He has two sons and a daughter.        
	As many as 186 people have attempted suicide at Metro stations since 1988, out of whom 86 have died.         
	But so many deaths later, Metro Railway authorities are still grappling with the problem of how to prevent people from attempting a fatal jump. East West Metro, being set up by the Kolkata Metro Railway Corporation, intends erecting glass walls with doors at all its stations to prevent suicides.        
	But according to officials, such a solution wouldnt be feasible for the existing Metro network. We have spoken to several agencies on how to prevent suicides. Setting up glass doors is not feasible as it requires integration of the trains, signalling system and screen doors, said Amar Nath, the general manager of Metro Railway.         
	Given the hurdles, the Metro Rail authorities are considering three other proposals, one of which is to erect barriers at both ends of the platforms.        
	It has been observed that people attempting suicide at Metro stations usually jump on the tracks from either of the two ends. We have gates there, but more restrictive measures might be helpful, said Nath.         
	The second suggestion is to set up cameras on both sides of the white line. The third one is to install an automatic alarm system. If anyone crosses the white line, the alarm would go off, said an official.        
	But experts have raised questions about the effectiveness of these suggestions. There will be little time for the staff to react even if the alarm rings. Glass-screen doors are the most effective, said an expert.        
	Last Tuesday, a driver had saved the life of a 27-year-old woman by slamming the brakes and alerting the control room to snap power supply within a second of spotting her jump on a track at Tollygunge station. The woman, who police said was depressed, had landed in the drain between the rails and was barely a metre from the front wheels when the train came to a halt.

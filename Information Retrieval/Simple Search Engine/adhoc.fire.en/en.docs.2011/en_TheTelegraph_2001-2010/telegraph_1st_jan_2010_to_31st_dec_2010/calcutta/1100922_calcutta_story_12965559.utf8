                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      AIMA rolls out B-test beyond campus
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sanjiv Goenka on the eve of the AIMA convention. (Kishor Roychowdhury)                                  
	After you bell the CAT, scale the MAST.        
	Those coming out of B-school may soon be able to take the Management Aptitude amp; Skill Test (MAST) to expose themselves to a wider selection of companies than during campus placements.         
	The All India Management Association (AIMA) on Tuesday announced its plans to introduce MAST in February 2011 to create a level-playing field among business school pass-outs.        
	AIMA is holding its 37th national management convention in the city on Wednesday and Thursday, with The Telegraph as partner.        
	The two-day meet, to be inaugurated by President Pratibha Patil, is back in Calcutta after three years.        
	Sanjiv Goenka, the president of the association, said the test would be a win-win for corporates as well as students.        
	There are hundreds of business schools in India but most companies do not know much about them except the IIMs, ISB and some others. MAST can be a standard for judging the quality of these pass-outs. I hope MAST becomes a must for students and corporates, said Goenka.        
	Association members said B-school pass-outs can take the annual test online after paying Rs 1,500.        
	Roopen Roy, the managing director of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the knowledge partner of the convention, said the test would create a level-playing field among job-seekers. Companies like ours may not visit most of the B-schools. but if talented students from any B-school rank well in MAST, we may look at them, Roy said.        
	The test is being designed based on the feedback from various corporate houses. MAST has already received endorsement from 100 companies and another 100 are expected to join.        
	Rekha Sethi, the director-general of AIMA, said the test could be taken more than once if there was demand for it.        
	At the AIMA convention, corporate leaders, politicians and bureaucrats will brainstorm Managing India: Opportunities amp; Challenges.        
	About 800 delegates will take part, and speakers include Union road and transport minister Kamal Nath, Unique Identification Authority of India chairman Nandan Nilekani, B. Muthuraman, the vice-chairman of Tata Steel, Deepak Parekh, the chairman of HDFC, and Gautam Thapar, the chairman of Avantha Group, who will take over as the chairman of AIMA.        
	At the session with the President on Wednesday, governor M.K. Narayanan will be the guest of honour.

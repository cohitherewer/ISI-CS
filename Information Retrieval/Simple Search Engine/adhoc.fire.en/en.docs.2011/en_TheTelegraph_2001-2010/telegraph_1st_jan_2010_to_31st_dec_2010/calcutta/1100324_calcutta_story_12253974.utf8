The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Concern, cables save day
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Concern, cables save day
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Quick thinking and men in uniform saved many residents and workers who were trapped inside Stephen Court on Tuesday.        
	One of the few who found their way out of the burning building was 30-year-old Pinki Biswas, an employee of a job consultancy firm on the fourth floor, above Peter Cat.        
	She and her seven colleagues walked around 100 metres, from Block I to Block II of Stephen Court, down a 2.5ft wide ledge with only cable television wires to hold onto.         
	Around 2pm, the lights suddenly went out in our office. We were waiting for power supply to be restored when suddenly one of my colleagues noticed the toilet was full of smoke. We looked out through the windows and saw the flames, recounted Pinki.         
	In complete darkness, she and her seven colleagues could not open the collapsible gate leading to the staircase. With no other escape route available and breathing becoming difficult in the smoke-filled passage, the group slipped out through a window on to the ledge.         
	After walking for five minutes, we reached Block II. We were making our way in by smashing a window pane when we saw a man jump from our floor to the roof of Peter Cat, said Pinki. She later learnt that their office was gutted soon after they left.         
	Walking down the ledge was not an option for 74-year-old Lalit Malhotra, his wife Rama, 68, and his paralytic mother Kamala, 95. The three were taking a nap when smoke filled their fourth-floor flat.         
	By the time Lalit, a retired executive, came out of the flat and gathered that their home for 30 years was on fire, the fourth floor was almost empty.         
	The couple decided not to walk away abandoning the nonagenarian. But breathing became more difficult with every passing minute and soon the main gate of the flat was on fire. The couple had barely managed to douse the fire by splashing water with buckets when firemen reached the family. Cops helped the three down a ladder. Kamala, who was gasping for breath, was immediately taken to SSKM Hospital.        
	Sayr Devi, 62, and her daughter-in-law Rajashri, in her 30s, also decided not to abandon 98-year-old matriarch Ganeshri Devi in their flat on the fourth floor. Cops later rescued Rajashri and Ganeshri but Sayr could not be traced till late on Tuesday.

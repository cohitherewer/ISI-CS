          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An armed gang of six-seven men barged into a house near the airport and looted Rs 1,50,000 and jewelley worth Rs 2,50,000 on Monday night.        
	Before fleeing, they locked all seven residents in a room.        
	High court lawyer Uttam Kumar Saha, who owns the Motilal Colony house, lives on the first floor with his wife, son and mother-in-law. Sahas sister-in-law lives on the ground floor with her two children.        
	Police said the gang had probably entered the building by breaking the lock of the terrace door.         
	While holding the residents at gunpoint, the robbers forced them to part with the cash and jewellery.        
	It seems a local gang was involved, said an officer of Dum Dum police station.

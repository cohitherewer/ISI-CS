                      Beauty and innocence of nature                                    In Return to Eden, the ongoing solo exhibition of his recent photographs, Prabir Purkayastha showcases visually stunning images of a time before it existed. Culled from his recent travels to the rainforests in far-flung Indo-China, it is a visual story of hope, regeneration of life and all that is beautiful in nature. His works reveal expanses of virgin forests, waterfalls arcing out in dark rainbows to form streams in the midst of deep woods, trees reaching out to the skies and around the massive trunks, and vines coiling like serpents. Birds take flight, carrying rays of the sun on their outstretched wings and in the verdant wilderness there is a sense of serene tranquility. In his work, one often comes across images dedicated to the vanishing tribes of Assam, who have eked out their living as boat-people and as fishermen; or pictures of the jungles of Laos with images of clear pools where leafs float as if some heavenly hand has painted their shapes in the water. The poetry, music and visual choreography in Purkayasthas vision of Eden stun the viewer, and the retina retains the impression of a world of eternal love and tranquility long after the moment has passed.

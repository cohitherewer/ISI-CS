	A packed train is stuck for 35 minutes before panic-stricken passengers, many of them gasping for breath, are made to walk through the tunnel to reach Sovabazar station. A mob ransacks ticket counters, CCTV cameras and turnstiles at the station.

	One of the two AC trains in the Metro fleet reaches Tollygunge about 50 minutes behind schedule with a door open for most of the journey. Officials try evacuating the train at Chandni Chowk but commuters refuse to get off. Rush-hour schedule goes haywire.

	Metro suddenly starts a dry run of the extended Birji-New Garia route, triggering an average five to 10-minute delay for each train without warning commuters about the schedule going haywire.

	Trains do not ply south of Tollygunge because of maintenance, the first time Metro doesnt run on a stretch through the day.        
	September 1        
	A Garia Bazar-bound train is stranded at Kudghat after the motor that draws power goes on the blink. Serial delays follow and passengers continue to be harassed till late into the night with personnel manning ticket counters telling commuters they had no clue when the next train would arrive.

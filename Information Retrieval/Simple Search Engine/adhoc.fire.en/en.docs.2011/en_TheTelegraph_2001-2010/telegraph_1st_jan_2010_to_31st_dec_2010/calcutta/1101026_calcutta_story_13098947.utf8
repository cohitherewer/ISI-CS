The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Airline apology
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Airline apology
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Jet Airways officials met the protocol officer of Calcutta High Court on Monday and apologised for striking off a judges name from its passengers list on Sunday.        
	Ajay Banerjee, the protocol officer, had lodged an FIR against the airline and one of its duty officers after Justice Saumitra Pal and his family were denied boarding passes for a Jet Airways Calcutta-Chennai flight on Sunday.        
	The airline officials apologised to us and assured us that such things would not happen again. But Banerjee said he would write to the highest authorities of Jet Airways, seeking action, a high court official said.        
	Banerjee said he would not initiate legal action.        
	In a statement on Monday, Jet Airways regretted the incident. As per the air transport circular of the directorate general of civil aviation, all airlines are required to close the doors of a flight 15 minutes prior to departure and hence check-in counters are closed 45 minutes before departure, a Jet Airways spokesperson said on Monday.         
	Yesterday, a guest reported at 9.50am for the 10.30am flight. Jet Airways had no prior information about the travel plans of the guest, who later agreed to travel today, the spokesperson said on Monday.

          RITH BASU                                    
	Two FIRs by a 73-year-old Bhowanipore resident who was allegedly duped by the local councillors promoter husband has failed to make the cops act.        
	Metro had reported the plight of Sanjit Dey and his ailing wife Shila, 63, who have been living in two incomplete rooms in their partially rebuilt house in Chakraberia for the past three years (Home horror for old couple, March 20). Sanjits four elderly sisters, who used to live with the couple, had to rent a place in Behala, straining the familys meagre resources.        
	Trinamul Congress councillor Manila Chowdhury had asked me engage her husband Piyush Sarkars firm to demolish and rebuild my house. He didnt complete the work. The police so far have not done anything, said Sanjit.        
	He lodged the first FIR with Ballygunge police station on March 6 and the second on Thursday, when he also lodged a complaint with the deputy commissioner (detective department). We are checking the documents, was all the local police would say.        
	Sanjit was called to the police station once last month. He went there to find Chowdhury and Sarkar waiting for him there and came away intimidated.        
	We have not received any complaint, said a Trinamul Congress general secretary. A week ago, he had promised to look into the matter.        
	In mid-February, I had faxed a complaint to Mamata Banerjees Delhi office and delivered a copy to her Kalighat house. Trinamul men had acknowledged having received the complaint, said Sanjit.        
	Sarkar refused comment.

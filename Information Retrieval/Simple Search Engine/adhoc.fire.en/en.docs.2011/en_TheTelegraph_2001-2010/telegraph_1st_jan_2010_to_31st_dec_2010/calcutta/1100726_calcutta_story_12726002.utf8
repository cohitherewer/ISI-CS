He was taken to Panihati General Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.    Akash Singh, a Class XI student, drowned in the Hooghly on Sunday afternoon. Singh, a Shibpur resident, went to bathe at the Shibpur ghat with friends as large areas in Howrah have been facing acute water shortage for the past few days.    Kamalesh Prasad, 48, a resident of Bilaspur in Chhattisgarh, was found hanging inside a toilet of the S-9 coach of the Down Jnaneswari Express on Sunday afternoon.

A 35-year-old Trinamul Congress activist was shot dead by three unidentified youths near New Barrackpore station on Saturday night.

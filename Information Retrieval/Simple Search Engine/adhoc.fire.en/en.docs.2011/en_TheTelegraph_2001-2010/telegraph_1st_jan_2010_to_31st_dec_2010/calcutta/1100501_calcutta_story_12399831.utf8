Picture by Rashbehari Das                                  
	Nondon Bagchi, musician and food writer, is stuck on Park Street. He returned to Flurys on Friday afternoon within minutes of it reopening after 38 days.        
	Flurys reopened today, April 30, at about 1 pm. Not exactly breakfast time, unless your body clock is like that of so many generations of musicians who have played out their lives on the magical little stretch of Park Street of which Flurys is such an intrinsic part. And, I daresay, many of the said musicians must have reported at Flurys at about that very hour to have a strong black coffee and, well, breakfast.        
	They are back in business in earnest and from Saturday they will open at the traditional hour of about 7am and hopefully, it will be breakfast as usual  regulars thronging to their chosen adda to start the day on the right note.        
	When I walked in, the table approximately in the middle was occupied by three gentlemen in their 60s. Croissants, rum balls, patties, tea and coffee. Behaving as if the place had never closed and oblivious to the world around them. If three youngsters sporting ear studs and tattoos had taken the next table, they wouldnt have batted an eyelid.                  FIRST FLUSH: A Flurys loyalist on Friday. (Rashbehari Das)      
	In that way, Flurys is quintessentially Park Street itself. Large of heart, and with a sense of philosophy that takes into account the variety of life itself.        
	Ever since my first visit some 40-plus years ago, one thing that has always struck me about Flurys is that once you are in, time seems to stand still. There is a sense of lazy elegance about the place. You will see someone sitting near the large glass panels that afford such a good view of life passing by, sipping tea or coffee and eating a sandwich or an omelette as leisurely as possible, in no hurry whatsoever, glancing through the glass occasionally, and afterwards, in the days before Mr Ramadoss, enjoying a smoke and opening a newspaper, most likely on the page with the cryptic crossword.                          
	The menu has grown and developed with time and while there have been many add-ons, the basic personality of the cuisine is still there  Flurys means confectionery and breakfast/brunchish food.        
	About 40 items are really old  they are marked with an H for heritage and date back to the 1920s through to the 60s.        
	You can even have a very simple lunch or supper now; they have a small, one-page menu of Continental options.        
	Outside the doors is Park Street  epicentre of entertainment, romance, life in the fast lane and the essence of Calcuttas cosmopolitan character.        
	People of that very ilk will enter and will leave anything hectic behind. And be embraced by Fluryss own time zone.        
	Sure, time changes all things, but this basic feel is still the same.        
	Dark disasters and tragedies can never be forgotten, but the coming back to life of places like Flurys is testimony to the character of places like Park Street.

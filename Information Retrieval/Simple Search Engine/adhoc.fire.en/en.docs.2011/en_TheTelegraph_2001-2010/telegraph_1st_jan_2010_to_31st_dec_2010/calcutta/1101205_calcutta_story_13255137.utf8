The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gains from translation
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Gains from translation
          Bengali works are being translated increasingly into English. But does it raise their readership significantly, asks Anasuya Basu                             SPOT THE DIFFERENCE: The covers of a Tintin title and Gosain Bagan                     
	Translation is the trendy new thing in publishing. Even the Calcutta franchisee of Starmark has jumped on to the bandwagon with Shirshendu Mukhopadhyays Gosain Baganer Bhoot (The Ghost of Gosain Bagan), which is also a graphic novel, another trendy thing.         
	The cover is strongly reminiscent of Tintin comics, though. And Ram Kavirajs prescription to get Burun, his grandson, back  the words Burun tumi onke tero (Burun, you scored 13 in maths)  is translated in the third person, as Burun got 13 in maths, which takes away from its magic. After the dismal score Burun had run away from home and met Nidhiram, a ghost who would give his right arm, or for that matter any other limb, to impress anyone.         
	But does Buruns delightful fantasy  much of Mukhopadhyays fiction is popular with translators; his Manojder Adbhut Bari is also in the pipeline  get a significantly wider readership after its translation into English? The answer reveals an interesting feature about the Bengali readership.         
	It seems Bengalis, in Bengal and elsewhere, enjoy reading translations of Bengali literature the most. While nationwide translations from Bengali sell the most in eastern India, within Bengal, translations sell more in Calcutta than anywhere else, says a sales representative of a publishing house.         
	An increasing number of Bengalis read only English books. Shreya Basu, a 23-year-old bio-chemist has read Satyajit Ray, translated into English by Gopa Majumdar.         
	I have never lived in Calcutta during my student life and so never studied Bengali, says Shreya. Eeshan Singh Basu is an 11-year-old in Pune whose mother started looking for Feluda translations after he finished The Adventures of Feluda comic series. Shreya and Eeshans tribe is growing as more and more Bengali families leave the city. Then there is the reader like Keya Banerjee, who in her Sixties and a great fan of Buddhadeb Basu, bought It Rained All Night (Ratbhor Brishti) as she had read the original when it was first published and then banned for obscenity.         
	There is a vast non-Bengali readership in Calcutta, too, who are aware of the renowned authors in Bengali.         
	The recent translations from Bengali may not have made the authors global names, though the translated Gitanjali had brought Tagore world renown. But publishers are feeling encouraged to go beyond Tagore, Sarat Chandra and Satyajit Ray. A publishing firm such as Anushtup, traditionally into non-mainstream Bengali writing, has also started translations.         
	HarperCollins started its Bengali to English translation list just a couple of years ago. Saugata Mukherjee of HarperCollins said he has started commissioning translations of authors such as Nabarun Bhattacharya, who is difficult to translate.         
	Oxford University Press (OUP) has the prestigious the Oxford India Tagore series (2000 onwards) with professor Sukanta Chaudhuri as its general editor. Penguin specialises in publishing contemporary authors, starting from Sunil Gangopadhyay to Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay and Dibyendu Palit. It has also translated Sarat Chandras Devdas and Parineeta and Tagores Chokher Bali, each book carrying a still from the films made from the novels.         
	Says Arunabha Sinha, translator of Sankars Chowringhee, which went on to sell over 7,000 copies: Publishers are constantly looking for new books to publish. With translations of reputed authors they are assured of the quality. Chowringhees success, he feels, has encouraged a lot of Bengali-to-English translation.         
	The authors feel that translations are widening their appeal. Translations may not have made me a global author but I definitely have a lot of readers in India who have read my novels in translation, says Sunil Gangopadhyay, whose Arjun was the first book on the contemporary authors list to be translated by Penguin.         
	Gangopadhyay, who beat Malayali author M.T. Vasudevan Nair by a few votes to become the president of Sahitya Akademi, said that when he asked how he could beat Nair, a good friend, he was told that he (Gangopadhyay) was a household name in Kerala and got more votes from Keralites than Nair could get from Bengal. In Kerala, English translations of Gangopadhyays novels are retranslated into Malayali and run in Malayali papers serially.         
	Says Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay: I did a book reading in Delhi of Funny and Funnier (a collection of his stories translated into English) and found the response very encouraging. The next day another person read one of my stories to a full house. I think translations do help in bringing my stories to a muchwider audience.

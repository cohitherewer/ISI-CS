The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Smart buses hit New Town road
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Smart buses hit New Town road

	The poor public transport in New Town has received a boost with 20 buses hitting the road and more set to roll out.        
	The West Bengal Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) has bought buses under the JNNURM scheme and started operating them in the Rajarhat township.        
	Twenty buses rolled out two weeks ago and we are in the process of acquiring 10 air-conditioned buses that will hit the road soon, housing minister and Hidco chairman Gautam Deb told Metro.        
	The buses, originating from various points in New Town, ply to southern destinations  such as Garia and Jadavpur  as well as Howrah, Park Circus and Esplanade. Earlier, there were only around 10 bus routes through New Town.        
	Public transport has long been on the long list of amenities the township lacks, forcing many house-owners to rent accommodation elsewhere. The near-absence of public transport has also prompted many people who have bought flats in the township to defer moving in.        
	Local transport operators have shunned the township, citing non-viability. Residents as well as those who frequent New Town for work say its difficult to get a taxi even during daytime.        
	Hardly any operator is interested in the township as very few people have moved in. Recently, Volvo has put New Town on its map but more public transport options are required, said a transport department official.        
	The new buses will partly fill the gap, said an official of Hidco, the implementing agency of New Town.        
	Prodyut Biswas, the managing director of Hidco, said the agency had plans to connect New Town with various locations  such as the airport, Park Circus, Ultadanga, Howrah and the central business district  and also the southern extremes of the city.

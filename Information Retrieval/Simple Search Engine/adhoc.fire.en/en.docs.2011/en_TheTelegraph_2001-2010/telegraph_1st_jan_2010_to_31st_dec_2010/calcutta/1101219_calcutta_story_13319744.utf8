The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Break point
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Break point
          Smart pay packets and top jobs do not always protect women from domestic violence. They still take very long to walk out of an abusive marriage, says Chandreyee Ghose                                            
	They were classmates at an MBA institute in Orissa. She came from Gujarat, he from Bengal. She was the more talented one, he the more domineering.         
	When Ankita and Arnab decided to get married, little did she realise that years of trauma lay ahead of her. It had nothing to do with their different communities. For more than a decade, Ankita has been a victim of domestic violence.         
	She was abused physically and mentally from the first year of marriage, but for years this 37-year-old marketing executive chose to bear it all quietly and save the marriage. She knew the law, had money in the bank, but social pressure and her own mindset forced her to drag on the harmful relationship.         
	Ankita is not the only one. Many women like her  educated, economically independent and professionally successful  are victims of domestic violence, no less than women who havent had access to education or a job. Sometimes professional success  and this is a growing concern as more women join the workforce every day  is the very reason why women are abused.         
	The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act was passed in 2005 to safeguard women from such violence. But activists and lawyers claim that even the most liberated women are either unaware of what constitutes abuse in the eyes of law or they approach authorities only as the last resort.         
	For every reported case there are several unreported ones. They are just the tip of the iceberg, says Anuradha Kapoor, director of Swayam, a womens rights organisation. The reported number indicates the magnitude of the crime and the fact that it is rising. Activists stress that domestic violence is on the rise.         
	The statistics from Bengal are particularly dreary. The state, though reputed to be fairer than some others in its treatment of the fairer sex, reported 13,663 domestic violence cases, the highest in the country, in 2008, according to the National Crime Records Bureau records. The report added that torture cases in the country had increased by 7.1 per cent over the previous years 75,930 cases.         
	Of the cases recorded, only 15 per cent are complaints from women who are economically independent, says Malini Bhattacharya, chairperson of the state womens commission. The bulk of the victims are those who have no monetary support. But since the incidence of domestic violence has increased sharply in the last three years, the number of professionals alleging torture from their spouse is also on the rise, she said.         
	Even if she is educated and empowered, living in a city, it takes a long time for a woman to walk out of the marriage. According to the social welfare department, around 2,930 cases of domestic violence have been reported under the Act. Calcutta, North and South 24-Parganas and East and West Midnapore have seen a spurt in such cases since 2008.        
	You can have an MBA degree and you can be raised in a liberal background, but you dont run to the police at the first sign of violence, says Ankita. She was concerned about spoiling her brothers choices in the marriage market in case she got a divorce.         
	But one day he punched me in the eye in front of my daughter. Thats when I decided that if I dont leave my husband now, my daughter will consider violence as a normal thing between a couple, says Ankita, who now lives separately with her daughter in a rented apartment.        
	An earning woman remains a problem. As it was for Nandita Saha, who had married her colleague. Nandita, 35, now working in an advertising agency, says she liked it secretly when her husband, then her boyfriend, would be possessive about her.         
	But after marriage, he turned violent. His behaviour seemed psychotic in a way defined by films.         
	He would give me flowers and cry over my shoulder in repentance after each violent spell, says Nandita. She was not even allowed to meet her parents or friends. Even at work she could talk to her colleagues only with the assent of her husband, who was still her colleague. I had to take up another job that paid me half of what I was getting, as it did not entail long hours. Whenever I protested, my husband would beat me, says Nandita. She finally walked out the day her husband almost broke her spinal cord.         
	It usually takes a woman years to rise above the dilemma in her mind. After each spell of violence, when he would give me flowers, take me out and say how sorry he was for losing his temper, I would feel confused. I felt then that maybe I was imagining the horror. Maybe these were just problems of the early years of a marriage, says Nandita.         
	Activists, in fact, feel that middle-class and upper middle-class women feel more inhibited to turn to help. Their shame is greater.         
	Professionals and upwardly mobile women seldom approach an organisation for help. They prefer dealing with it themselves. Approaching us is always the last resort, says Kapoor of Swayam.         
	We often get phone calls from working women who speak of abuse, but few of them make it through our doors. Even though they have monetary support, most never walk out on a bad relationship. In fact sometimes they get thrown out by the spouse, she adds.         
	An MNC executive had approached the organisation. She earned much more than her husband. Yet it took her years to identify that what she was going through at home amounted to abuse. The womans husband had slowly isolated her from all her friends. He monitored her movements. She was hardly permitted to meet her own parents. She even faced sexual abuse. But at the end, the husband always convinced her to stay in the relationship.         
	The woman is still fighting the demons in her mind and dragging her marriage, though it is costing her her career, health and family, says Kapoor.         
	A social activist, who was a victim of violence herself, says complex motives hold the woman back deliberately from recognising what is happening to her. Most of the abusing men cannot accept the fact that their women are not under their wings. If she earns, she should also be the wife, the submissive partner.         
	However strong we are at our workplace, sometimes we are programmed to be submissive at home. We feel guilty when we do not meet our husbands requirements, however unjust they are. Society tells us to make compromises and we do it often not knowing we are being manipulated, says the activist.        
	Abuse is thought of as a relationship issue, something that can be resolved, presumably, with patience on the womans part. Successful women are also held back by the how could this happen to me factor.         
	The need of the hour is emotional empowerment. The law is there to help women. But there should be emotional empowerment too to help women charge an abuser. That is missing even among urban women, says womens commission chairperson Bhattacharya.         
	Marital rape is a major area of concern, she adds. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act is the only law that enables a woman to complain against her husband on the grounds of marital rape. One of the first cases that we took up dealt with sexual violence. Again many educated women undergo marital rape for years, thinking thats their fate, says Bhattacharya.        
	Women need much more help from their families, from the society.         
	According to Bhattacharya, who stresses that economically independent women constitute only a small part of the victims, since 2008, more and more women have approached the womens commission claiming domestic violence. But at the end, many fail to charge their abuser.         
	Most women are emotionally dependent on their abusers. The men may be aggressive in phases, but suing them is not on the womens mind, she adds.         
	The social welfare department says that around 409 survivors of violence are availing legal aid from the government.         
	Bank employee Sahana Chatterjee, 37, is also seeking legal help. She is filing for divorce after having been asked for years to adjust to the demands of her marriage by her mother, a social worker herself.         
	My husband would squander his money in nightclubs and parties. He would come home drunk and beat me up. My salary would run the house, yet I was abused for not doing any housework, says Sahana.         
	When I protested, my husband and in-laws would say women should never be so educated and headstrong. I started believing that maybe the fault lay with me, she adds.         
	And 30-year-old doctor Ananya Vaidya still hopes for the future. Her husband of a year alternates between ignoring her totally and ridiculing her in public for being too thin and dark. She hints at physical violence too. But she believes that she is only going through relationship crisis that will get better with time.        
	(Some names have been changed on request)            
	To create awareness about domestic violence, 22 NGOs under the Bengal chapter of Aman, an international network of 70 NGOs that work with survivors of domestic violence, participated in a campaign from November 25 to December 10. Their aim was to sensitise the community and make the government more responsive towards survivors of domestic violence. Besides organising seminars and cultural programmes, the NGOs readied a charter of demands to keep domestic violence in check   
	The demands include:        
	 Requesting Calcutta police to open a 24-hour, toll-free helpline for women, children and senior citizens facing harassment at home, preferably with the number 103, which is the helpline number in Mumbai. The Calcutta Police already have a general helpline at 1090, but few know about it         
	 Formation of domestic violence prevention committees in every ward or village in the state to provide support to abused women        
	 Providing social security, such as employment, to survivors of domestic violence        
	 The number of protection officers should be increased to one each in every block and borough. At present, there are 20 protection officers, 68 service providers and 43 shelter homes in the state. Calcutta has only two protection officers        
	 Provisions must be made to display the names and contact details of protection officers in each police station        
	 A state level co-ordinating committee must be instituted         
	 The government should begin a public awareness campaign against domestic violence and on the domestic violence prevention act

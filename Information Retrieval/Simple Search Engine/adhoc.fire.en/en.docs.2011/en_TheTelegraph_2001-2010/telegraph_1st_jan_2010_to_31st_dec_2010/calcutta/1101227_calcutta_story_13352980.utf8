The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mess-up slur on garden
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mess-up slur on garden

	Environment activists have blamed the mismanagement of the Indian Botanic Garden for the Christmas afternoon fire.        
	The fire, which raged for two hours, is said to have originated in a heap of dry leaves and branches behind the closed cafeteria.        
	The dry leaves and branches lie scattered across the garden though there is a marked place for dumping them. The Saturday fire was the third in the garden in recent memory but the authorities are yet to wake up, green activist Subhas Dutta said.        
	Dutta, who visited the garden on Saturday evening and Sunday morning, said: According to our estimate, 28 tall trees, eight smaller trees and 10 banana trees have been fully or partially burnt, said Dutta.        
	S.S. Hamid, a scientist at the garden, however, dubbed the fire a freak incident. Hardly six trees were affected. Hamid cited lack of enough guards when asked about the firemens allegation that the garden staff did not help them in dousing the blaze. There are only 16 guards for the 270-acre garden, which was once manned by 121 guards, said the scientist.        
	The fire has also brought into focus the rampant violation of the smoking ban in the garden. Witnesses said some visitors were smoking at the spot where the fire broke out, a few minutes before the flames were spotted.

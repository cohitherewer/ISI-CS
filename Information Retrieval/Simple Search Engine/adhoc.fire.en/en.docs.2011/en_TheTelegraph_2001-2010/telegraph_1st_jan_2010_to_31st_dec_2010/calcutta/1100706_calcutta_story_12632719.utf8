The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Merc zooms past 100-car target
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Merc zooms past 100-car target
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mercedes Benz MD and CEO Wilfried Aulbur at the launch of the E-Class Coupe at the new Interkrafts dealership outlet at Topsia                                  
	A 100 per cent growth in sales of Mercedes in the city has prompted the dealer to graduate from a one-car show window in Alipore to a 6,700sq ft showroom at Topsia.        
	Interkrafts, the sole Mercedes dealership in the city, has also launched the Rs 65lakh E-class Coupe at the Topsia outlet.        
	The Merc has registered the three-digit growth in Calcutta in the first six months of 2010 over the same period last year. However, the Interkrafts figure comprises only four to five per cent of the national sales figure.         
	This might seem a small percentage but the east is a growth market for us, clarified Dr Wilfried Aulbur, the Mercedes Benz MD and CEO.         
	The city now has three German luxury cars  Mercedes, BMW and Audi  operating through their company-approved retail showrooms.        
	While Mercedes and BMW had a neck-and-neck fight last year, with Merc losing by only 20-odd cars. This year, Audi has joined the fray with its showroom on AJC Bose Road.        
	The overall luxury car market will expand, adding to the competition, said Hiteshwar Singh, CEO, Interkrafts.        
	Interkrafts, which had sold 103 Mercedes in 2009, has retailed 86 units till date this year and is aiming to cross the 150-mark by the end of 2010.         
	From doing 18 cars a year in 2003, when we had opened our show window in Alipore, today we are doing the same number in a month, said Singh.        
	We are very bullish about the east and particularly the Tier II and III cities which are pushing our growth, added Aulbur.        
	The company is adding new dealerships in its bid to increase the Mercedes footprint in these cities.         
	Interkrafts will inaugurate a dealership in Bhubaneswar by early next year. The city is serviced by the Calcutta dealership and contributes to about 20 per cent of its sales, said Aulbur.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Samaritans bid to save life

	The driver, conductor and passengers of a minibus went off route to rush a lecturer who had suffered a heart attack on board to hospital, in a situation where apathy is often the norm.         
	The concerted effort of about 20 people on Sunday afternoon, however, could not save the life of the 54-year-old, who was declared brought dead.         
	Santanu Ghosh, the vice-principal and sociology teacher of Dinabandhu College in Howrah, boarded the Botanical Garden-Esplanade minibus near the campus around 2pm. The Salt Lake resident, who was returning home after taking classes of Netaji Subhas Open University at the college, started gasping for breath soon after and was offered a seat by one of the passengers.         
	We could make out that he was seriously ill. The conductor got a bottle of water for him from the drivers cabin but he had slumped in his seat, said Bholanath Shaw, a Shalimar resident who was on the bus.        
	When splashes of water on Ghoshs face did not revive him, driver Dilip Mondal and conductor Monotosh Das, afraid that the passenger had died, decided to stop at Shibpur police station, a three-minute drive down GT Road on the buss route to Howrah Maidan.         
	When cops said Ghosh should be taken to hospital, Mondal and Das decided to do so themselves. I asked the passengers who were in a hurry to get off the bus because we had to take a right turn from Howrah Maidan, instead of proceeding to Bankim Setu, to take the teacher to Howrah District Hospital. Five-six people got off but most decided to accompany us, said Mondal.         
	As soon as the bus stopped outside the hospitals emergency gate about 10 minutes later, passengers ran and got a stretcher on which Ghosh was carried inside. Doctors pronounced him dead.         
	A former student of the college who was visiting her ailing mother at the hospital identified her erstwhile teacher while he was lying in the emergency ward and alerted his family members.        
	Ghoshs wife Ranjana said he had not complained of any physical discomfort lately but was depressed over some problems at work. The lecturer leaves behind a son, who studies in Class V of a Salt Lake school.         
	Police said a post-mortem would be conducted.

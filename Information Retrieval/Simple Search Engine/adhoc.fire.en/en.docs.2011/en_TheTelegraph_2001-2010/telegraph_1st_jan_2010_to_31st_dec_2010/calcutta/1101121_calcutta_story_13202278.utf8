										      calcutta revisited                        St Pauls Cathedral is said to have a wedding cake texture on its exterior. Picture by Pradip Sanyal				                           
	Theres a little nook at St Pauls Cathedral that I was immediately drawn to when I went visiting recently, propelled by numerous newspaper reports on the Archbishop of Canterburys visit to Calcutta. At the back of the church is a little portico, its arched walls held up by simple, fluted columns. Beyond the portico is a small black door, tucked away behind a short flight of steps. If you sit on the steps, your eyes rest on sweet green grass. The small door, the mini-portico and the quiet afternoon seemed straight out of Alice in Wonderland. As I sat on the steps, I almost expected a harried hare to hurry past me, muttering to himself and checking his pocket-watch as he vanished into a rabbit hole.         
	I had arrived at the cathedral gate, next to Birla Planetarium, around 2.30pm and was told by the guard that the church was closed between noon and 3pm. I hardly heard him, so busy was I gaping at the structure in front of me.         
	The largeness  and whiteness  of the cathedral building can take your breath away. As I circled the 170-year-old Indo-Gothic structure, I wondered what message its makers had wanted to convey. Historians say Bishop Daneil Wilson was compelled to build St Pauls to accommodate the increasing number of churchgoers in Calcutta, for whom St Johns Church  opposite Raj Bhavan  was proving too small. Also, by 1839, the British were acutely feeling the need for a stunning cathedral as a mark of the Empires ecclesiastical might in its capital city in India.         
	But looking up at the gigantic building, I couldnt help wonder if the church-makers also wanted to send a message to the Englishmen, women and children of the city that in this alien land, the cathedral would stand strong and tall, bringing them faith, comfort and hope  and bit of home.                  Statue of Bishop Heber inside the cathedral       
	And the cathedral sure stands tall, with its central tower towering 175ft above the bustle of Chowringhee. The original structure didnt have a tower at all. It had a 200ft tall spire but it toppled during an earthquake in 1897 and its replacement was damaged in natural calamities in the 1930s. The present tower, modelled on the Bell Harry tower of Canterbury Cathedral in the UK, was built in 1938. A huge clock with a black dial is mounted on the tower. Sadly, or maybe quite aptly, the hands of time stood still when I looked up.         
	Inside the church, the silence is striking. And theres so much to see. As you enter, on your right is a huge marble statue of Bishop Heber in a kneeling position, crafted by Sir Francis Chantry. It is said that finding an appropriate home for this fine piece of statuary in Calcutta was one of reasons behind the commissioning of St Pauls.         
	The main chapel is a little way ahead. Again, the sheer size surprises and impresses. Theres a lot of sunlight inside, softened by coloured and stained glass windows. Behind the altar, incidents from the Life of St Paul is depicted in coloured mosaic. Above are stained glass windows. There are beautiful murals and etchings on the walls beside the altar too. But visitors arent allowed near them, which is a pity. There are two smaller chapels, called Memorial Chapel and The Chapel of the Holy Name.         
	There are numerous monuments and tablets on the walls and in almost every corner of the cathedral, mostly memorials to British military and bureaucratic personnel and their families. Its the abundance of such memorials that sets apart churches in the sub-continent from the ones in Europe, which house more works of art and memorials to church heads.         
	But many of the tablets at the cathedral are works of art in themselves. Particularly striking is a memorial near the library dedicated to Sir William Hay MacNaughton, Governor of Bombay, who was assassinated in Kabul in 1841. It shows MacNaughton seated on a pedestal supported by two figures holding crouching lions on a leash. Across the room, a tablet erected to the memory of one Adela Emma, who died in 1866 aged 18 years, eight months and 26 days, is a study in contrast. This tablet has a woman in mourning carved in marble jutting out of the wall.         
	At the pews inside the main chapel, an elderly woman sat alone, teardrops rolling down her cheeks. A bearded man sat some distance away, lost in his own world. In one corner sat a young couple, holding hands like they would never let go.         
	St Pauls disappoints in the evening. The cathedral is open till 6pm and I hung around to experience the premises after sundown. But there is very little illumination in and around the cathedral and the gleaming white structure is lost in semi-darkness. I am now waiting for a full moon night to witness what the city has denied this majestic structure  a fitting evening gown.

	Fact file         
	 A cathedral is the main church of a district, under the care of a bishop. The present bishop is Reverend Ashoke Biswas         
	 The building of St Pauls Cathedral started in 1839 under Bishop Daniel Wilson. It was consecrated or started being officially used for religious purposes in 1847        
	 It was designed by military engineer Major William Nairn Forbes, who also designed the Calcutta Mint. Mackintosh Burn Ltd was the builder        
	 The cathedral was planned way back in 1819 but the financial and manpower drain of the First Burmese War of 1824-26 delayed its building. Then, the plans drawn up in 1826 got lost and the foundation stone laid in 1839 was stolen. The original spire was damaged twice and was finally replaced by the present tower in 1938        
	St Pauls  Calcuttas first purpose-built church  served as the Metropolitan and Mother Church of the Anglican Province of the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon till the inauguration of the Church of North India on November 29, 1970       SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI

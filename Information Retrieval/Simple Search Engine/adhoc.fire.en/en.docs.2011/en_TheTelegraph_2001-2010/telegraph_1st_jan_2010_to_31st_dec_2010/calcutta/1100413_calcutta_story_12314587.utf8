          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 100-bed super-speciality cancer unit was recently inaugurated at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals on the EM Bypass.         
	The unit, named Apollo Gleneagles Cancer Hospital and located in a 80,000sq ft block in the compound, offers diagnostic, therapeutic, palliative and support services to patients.        
	The Novalis Tx machine with brainLAB, which locates tumours using built-in CT scan and administers radiation without damaging healthy tissues in the area, has been acquired by the unit.         
	Not only is the machine accurate but it can also adapt to tumours of all sizes. The entire process takes about two minutes, instead of 30-35 minutes needed earlier, said Prathap C. Reddy, the chairman of the Apollo Hospitals Group. Apollo is the only hospital in eastern India that has the machine, he added.        
	Using the machine, doctors can merge a PET-CT image with an MRI and ensure that the entire affected area receives radiation. The machine also allows doctors to administer different types of radiations like IMRT, IGRT, and 3DRT in specific dozes, said Arundhati Chakraborty, the head of the radiology department of the hospital.         
	Citing the example of breast cancer  which accounts for 30 per cent of all female cancer patients  Chakraborty said if radiation was provided through Novalis Tx, there was hardly any cosmetic change to the breast.        
	After the lump is removed the area does not become hard. The heart and lungs are not affected because of the treatment, added Chakraborty.        
	More than 10 lakh to 12 lakh cancer cases are detected in India every year, according to the World Health Organisation. Of these, 80,000 are detected in West Bengal.

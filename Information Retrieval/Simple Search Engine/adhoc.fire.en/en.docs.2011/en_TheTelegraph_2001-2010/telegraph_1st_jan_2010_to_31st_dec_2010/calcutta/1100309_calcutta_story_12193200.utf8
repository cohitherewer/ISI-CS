                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      6hr train delay sparks anger
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Passengers of the Howrah-Delhi Up Poorva Express gathered in front of the station masters office on Monday afternoon to protest a six-hour delay in the trains departure. The protesters forced station manager Samir Kumar Banerjee out of his office and demanded an explanation for the delay. The train finally left Howrah station at 2.30pm.         
	The train usually leaves at 8.05am but on Monday the departure was deferred to 1.05pm. Unaware of the change, most passengers arrived at the station in the morning. After waiting for an hour, they marched to Banerjees office and demanded an explanation for the delay, said a GRP officer.         
	The station manager informed the passengers that the train would depart at 1.05pm.         
	Samir Kumar Goswami, a senior public relation officer of Eastern Railway, told Metro that the arrival of the Dn Poorva Express was delayed on Sunday, prompting Mondays departure to be pushed back to 1.05pm. The change was communicated to the media and some TV channels even carried the message in news tickers. What more can we do? he said.         
	But the train failed to reach the platform even after 1pm, further angering the passengers. Many elderly passengers said they were feeling unwell and children started crying.         
	Once the station manager said that the train was running late because of a security check, later he said two bogies were being repaired, complained Manabendra Guha, a passenger.        
	Asked why the train left Howrah at 2.30pm, Goswami cited some emergency maintenance work.         
	The Howrah and Sealdah-bound Rajdhani expresses were delayed by around four hours each because of track maintenance work on various sections of the routes.

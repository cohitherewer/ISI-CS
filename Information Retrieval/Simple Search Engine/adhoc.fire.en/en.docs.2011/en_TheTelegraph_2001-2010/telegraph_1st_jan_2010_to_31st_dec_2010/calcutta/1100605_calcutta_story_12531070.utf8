          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A woman in her sixties who was injured when four crude bombs exploded inside a roadside shop on Strand Bank Road on Thursday died on Friday afternoon.         
	Gitarani Jana succumbed to her abdomen injuries at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. The condition of five other persons admitted to the hospital after they were injured in the explosions is critical. The other four injured were treated and discharged.        
	Explosives were packed into three small tin boxes and a tiffin box on Thursday. When Gitarani tried to prise the tiffin box open with an iron rod, it exploded. The other three bombs went off almost simultaneously, said a senior officer of North Port police station.        
	A six-year-old girl chanced upon the boxes on the banks of the Hooghly, near Mullickghat flower market, and took them to her parents, who run the shop near the Howrah bridge approach. Gitarani, the girls grandmother, was in the shop at the time. The girls father and eight others in the shop were injured in the explosions that followed.        
	Some criminals had made the bombs for the civic elections and later dumped them by the river, said the officer.

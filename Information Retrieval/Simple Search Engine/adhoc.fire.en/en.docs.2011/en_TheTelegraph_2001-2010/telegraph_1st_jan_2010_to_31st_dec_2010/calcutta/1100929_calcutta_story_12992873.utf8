The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro signal error triggers crash scare
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Metro signal error triggers crash scare
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An empty Metro Railway train on the way to New Garia on Monday night was shown the green light at Briji even when the previous train had not changed tracks, a human error that might have led to a fatal crash.        
	Power supply to the third rail  the source of power for Metro trains  was snapped immediately after the authorities at Briji station realised the signalling mistake around 9.45pm. Sources said the two trains were then around a kilometre apart.        
	An inquiry has been ordered, said a Metro spokesperson. According to sources, the station master at Briji was responsible for operating signal switches.        
	None of the trains was carrying passengers because Briji and New Garia stations are yet to become operational. After passengers get off at Gariabazar (Kavi Nazrul), empty rakes travel till New Garia to switch tracks before starting their journey for Dum Dum.        
	Had there been a crash, the lives of at least two railway employees  the driver of one of the trains and the guard of another  would have been in danger, said Dilip Mukherjee of the Metro Railwaymens Union.        
	The manual signalling system in Metro Railway has often been blamed for the poor running of trains but this was the first time it had triggered a crash scare.        
	Smoke in coach: A fire scare gripped Metro passengers who saw sparks, followed by a coach getting filled with smoke, between Dum Dum and Belgachhia, around 12.30pm on Tuesday. The train was evacuated after it reached Belgachhia station.        
	Officials blamed a snag in the braking system for the sparks and the smoke. Trains were stalled for around 10 minutes. After a couple of weeks of punctual running with 16 rakes, Metro returned to working with 15 on Tuesday.

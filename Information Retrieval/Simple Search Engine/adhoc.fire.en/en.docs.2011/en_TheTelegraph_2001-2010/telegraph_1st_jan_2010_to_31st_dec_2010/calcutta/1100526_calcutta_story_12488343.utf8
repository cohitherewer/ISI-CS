                Calcutta police arrested a 40-year-old man at his home in Patna on Tuesday for allegedly cheating a city trader and then trying to label him a Pakistan-based drug smuggler on the Internet.  ccording to police, Keyur Majnudar, a resident of Bhowanipore, met Kanishka Sinha in Delhi a year back. Sinha, who claimed to be a scientist, allegedly took Rs 80,000 from Majnudar as payment for the right to distribute an engine that runs without fuel. When Sinha failed to supply such an engine, Majnudar started pressuring him to return the money. Sinha then created a website that he labelled the official portal of the ministry of narcotics control in India. On the site, he uploaded two photographs of Majnudar, describing him as Gul Rehman, a Pakistan-based drug smuggler, said an investigator.

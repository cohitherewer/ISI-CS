  - Court orders probe to identify lawyers and agencies          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                              
	The high court on Friday ordered a probe into the irregularities in bankruptcy declarations and the role of individuals and agencies involved in the process.        
	Justice Sanjib Banerjees order followed a report by a special officer who conducted a preliminary probe into 1,018 insolvency declarations since April 1, 2008.        
	Five private banks had submitted in the court that some lawyers and touts were running a racket to help people get insolvency certificates that would exempt them from repaying dues. Records confirm a spurt in the number of bankruptcy applications submitted and cleared over the past three years (see box).        
	The judge asked the banks to provide contact numbers, cellphone and landline, of the persons and agencies assuring people they would settle outstanding loans and credit card dues. The joint commissioner of police will conduct an inquiry and submit a report, said additional government pleader Sandip Srimani.        
	The order stated that the police would send the report to advocate-general Balai Ray, who would submit it to the court in a sealed cover.        
	The judge also asked the petitioner banks to send the list of lawyers, whose names figured in advertisements offering help in filing insolvency declarations, to the state bar council for necessary action. According to bar council norms, lawyers cannot publish advertisements offering help to the public.        
	The order stated that the individuals declared insolvent since April 1, 2008, would have to attend the next hearing on Friday, in person or through representatives. The registrar of insolvency and the official assignee have to file affidavits stating why they had declared them insolvent.        
	The court had on Monday asked the registrar and the official assignee not to accept insolvency applications till further orders.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Truth about terminal? Its sick
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Truth about terminal? Its sick
										      Aargh! Airport - TT for City      SANJAY MANDAL                                                 (Above) Rafiqul Islam waits with his uncles coffin in a van outside Calcutta airport on the night of November 7. The schoolteacher from Dhaka learnt the tragic way how  inhuman a place the Calcutta airport can be.  (Top) Amid a sea of yellow cabs, a mother and daughter wait for their taxi at Calcutta airport. With her daughter Tiyasha, Sumita Bhowmick saw another ugly face of our city on November 7. Her husband had to get the token from the pre-paid taxi booth thrice because the first cab could not be traced and the second cabbie said hed go only if he was allowed to take more passengers in front. Not a cop or an official was in sight amid an army of touts as the Bhowmicks ordeal went on for an hour.         
	A Bangladeshi schoolteacher spent two hours looking for a wheelchair to seat his ailing uncle and then nine hours for a trolley to provide his dead uncle a place to rest.        
	A doctor to certify the death came four hours after Rafiqul Islams 80-year-old uncle died on November 6.        
	At Calcutta airport, basic facilities arent basic  getting them takes a lot of running around and some greasing of palms.        
	Metro probes why Rafiqul had to spend a sleepless night sobbing by the side of his uncles body with little help from the airport authorities, and why this could happen to any of us.        
	Wheelchair         
	You can request for a wheelchair while booking a ticket.         
	A wheelchair can also be availed of after arriving at the airport. Contact the airport manager or airline customer service counters. For low-cost flights like Air India Express, a caution deposit is to be made.        
	These are the rules. Rafiqul is the reality.         
	He had to wait for two hours after depositing the Rs 450 caution money at the Air India Express counter and pay another Rs 100 to a tout who brought the wheelchair.        
	Airport officials confirmed that the Bangladeshis plight was not an exception. In Calcutta, passengers have to wait for at least half an hour after arriving at the departure terminal to get a wheelchair, even if they have booked it days in advance, said an official.        
	Passengers alleged that airline offices, which can be called from the entrance for wheelchair and other requests, do not attend calls.        
	An airline official blamed outsourcing of certain operations for Rafiquls plight. Such complaints (of delay) are common, he added.         
	The airport director washed his hands of the problem. Providing wheelchairs is the airlines responsibility, said R. Srinivasan.        
	Trolley        
	The airport doesnt have a trolley to carry a critically-ill passenger or the dead.        
	There are a couple of stretchers, but airport officials said they were for those feeling unwell.        
	All Rafiqul had pleaded for on November 6-7 was some dignity to be shown to the dear and departed. His uncle was denied that. The body, covered in a flimsy white cloth, remained seated next to an immigration counter amid scores of other passengers who reacted with shock.        
	Not so easy to shock our airport authorities. In the absence of a trolley, we have no other way to keep a body, said a senior official.        
	For a stretcher, one has to contact the airport manager. But getting one isnt easy, especially at night. It might take nearly an hour to get one, said a senior airport official. The ground staff of the airlines or the airports own Group D employees may be officially on duty, but they are nowhere to be found. And they are supposed to ensure that a passengers needs are taken care of! At times, the airport manager is the only person running around, he added.        
	Doctor         
	The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has its doctors but, like the airport, its health unit is ailing. Against six sanctioned posts, there are only three doctors at the moment.         
	Each airline has a medical officer. One of them had confirmed the death of Rafiquls uncle after being alerted by the Calcutta-Dhaka Air India Express planes crew.        
	But a doctor under the Union health ministry has to certify an airport death. That doctor took nearly four hours to arrive in Rafiquls case.        
	An airport official said there are only three doctors in the AHO (airport health office, which is under the Union health ministry and not civil aviation, like the AAI unit), for the seven posts.        
	The manpower crunch is made worse by gaps in communication between the airlines and the airport authorities. The passengers suffer, said an airport official.         
	If a passenger is taken ill on board, the pilot gets in touch with the airlines ground base and also the airport for emergency help.        
	If a passenger falls ill inside the terminal, the airline/airport manager are to be contacted.        
	But why the doctor crunch? Airport health officer P.C. Mondal said: We have been clamouring for more doctors but the higher authorities are yet to give the sanction.        
	Death certificate        
	Only the AHO doctors can issue death certificates, but they follow their own routine.         
	In Rafiquls case, the doctor supposed to be on duty at night was actually at his home in Madhyamgram, 9km away from the airport.        
	According to rules, the formalities inside the airport should be completed within an hour and then police should take the body away for post-mortem, said an airport doctor.         
	Rules also say it is the responsibility of the doctors and airport officials to issue the death certificate and the passengers accompanying the dead need not do any running around.        
	Rafiqul had to go from one desk to the other, requesting indifferent officials to speed up the process so that he could take his uncles body home the next day. That was not to be.        
	He had to wait on a van with his uncles coffin outside the airport through the night after the post-mortem and other related formalities were completed.         
	Last nail        
	Rafiqul would not have been harassed as much as he was had the airport had a facility for his uncles coffin.         
	We dont allow bodies inside the terminal as they can cause infection to other passengers, said airport director Srinivasan.        
	To transport a body, the dead persons co-passenger has to get an embalmed certificate after the body is handed over by the police.        
	If a passenger dies while travelling alone, the embalming and transporting is the airlines responsibility.

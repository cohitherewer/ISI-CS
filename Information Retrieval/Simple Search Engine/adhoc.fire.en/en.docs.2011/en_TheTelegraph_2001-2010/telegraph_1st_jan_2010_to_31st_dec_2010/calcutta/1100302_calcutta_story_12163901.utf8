	A family outing on a festive night turned into horror as cops allegedly assaulted the women and the men for daring to shout at an autorickshaw driver who had hit two of them.        
	Shaheen Ahmed, 45, had to be administered three stitches on her left hand while daughter Sana, 22, and son-in-law Irfanur Rahman, 26, suffered bruises as the cops allegedly rained blows on them at the Lenin Sarani-CR Avenue crossing late on Sunday.        
	Police, however, said Irfanur had bashed up the auto driver and then assaulted two constables. We are trying to trace the auto driver. Cases have been registered against both Irfanur and the cops, said an officer of New Market police station.        
	It was around 11pm when the family members were returning home to BB Ganguly Street in central Calcutta after dinner at a Lord Sinha Road restaurant. Irfan was riding a motorcycle, his parents-in-law were on a scooter while his wife and brother-in-law were returning in a taxi.        
	The scooter and the taxi were trailing me but I lost track of them near Chandni Chowk Metro station. I returned to the Lenin Sarani crossing only to see my in-laws lying on the road. My wife pointed at an auto standing nearby and said it had hit the scooter. I lost my cool and started shouting at the auto driver, recalled Irfan.        
	A couple of plainclothesmen standing outside a bar came to the spot and allegedly started abusing the family members for shouting at the auto driver.         
	We had no clue that they were cops, so we asked them to mind their own business. As soon as we said that the duo started assaulting us. They were soon joined by six more plainclothesmen armed with lathis. At no point did they reveal their identity, said Irfan.        
	When I asked them why they were beating us, one of the cops shot back: Eto raate mahilader sathe keno ghurchho (Why are you moving around with women so late at night)? said Irfanurs father-in-law Mohammed Ahmed.        
	The assault allegedly continued for 20 minutes, till cops in uniform turned up. An officer persuaded the cops to leave. We later lodged a complaint with New Market police station and with deputy commissioner (central) R. Tripurari, said a family member. Tripurari could not be contacted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop steps for rush of immersions
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cop steps for rush of immersions
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The city police have made special arrangements to tackle the rush at the 14 ghats in Calcutta on Monday, the last day of the 72-hour Kali idol immersion window.         
	Over 1,900 puja committees, including those that did not have the necessary clearances, immersed their idols on Saturday and Sunday.         
	Almost all the big pujas will immerse their idols on Monday and we are expecting a rush at the ghats, said joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim. Action will be taken against committees that fail to meet the immersion deadline, he added.         
	A senior traffic cop told Metro that vehicle movement on roads leading to the ghats would be restricted after 5pm on Monday. Only immersion processions will be allowed on Kingsway, Strand Road, Beadon Street, Auckland Road and some other roads in the evening, added a cop.         
	About 1,975 committees organised Kali Puja after seeking permission from the city police, fire services and the civic body. Estimates suggest at least 600 to 800 puja committees did not seek clearances.         
	The ghats have been illuminated and public address systems installed for hitch-free immersion. Plainclothesmen are being deployed to prevent drunken brawls and use of banned firecrackers.        
	Immersing idols becomes difficult during low tide and the entire process is held up. So we request puja organisers to bring their idols for immersion at the prescribed times, said Shamim.        
	Following the guidelines of the state pollution control board, the civic body has erected small enclosures in each of the ghats where non-biodegradable materials can be thrown.        
	We are preparing to remove about three tonnes of waste from the ghats, said mayoral council member (conservancy) Debabrata Majumdar.

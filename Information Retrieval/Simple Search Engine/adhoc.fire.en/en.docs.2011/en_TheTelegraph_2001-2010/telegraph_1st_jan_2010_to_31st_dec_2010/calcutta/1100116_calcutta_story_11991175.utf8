                      Actions speak louder than words                     The magic of theatre has its effect upon the actors, and not only its audience. The actor becomes a god-like figure on the stage  larger than life. The result of this is that the actors confidence in himself and his work grows with every performance. For a deaf actor, the growth of such confidence is all the more an empowering experience. In fact, it begins to reflect in other spheres of life as well. Since 1974, The Action Players, Indias only theatre group of hearing-impaired adults, have been performing regularly in the city. Its members, who primarily come from the Oral School for Deaf Children in Calcutta, have, over the years, moved on to build independent lives in diverse careers, clearly vindicating the basic aim of setting up such a troupe. This evening, the group presents The Pebble and the Taal Tree and more stories by Bonophool. Presented through mime, sign-language, English narration, music and dance, it promises to be a unique experience that appeals to audiences of all ages. In it, seven evocative and poetic stories by Bonophool, some of which are rib-tickling, have been adapted for the stage. As the layered, deeply-moving stories unfold, audiences will laugh heartily or cry softly: Meni the cat outdoes Parul and Binode; in the pond, the water-creatures go on a strike!; a boy falls in love with a child-bride as she leaves home with her husband; and a crow cannot be silenced by the aged Jagattarini. Dramatised by Zarin Chaudhuri. Media partner: t2.                  Event: Play, The Pebble and the Taal Tree, produced by The Action Players When: Today at 7 pm Where: Gyan Manch

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Incomplete poser in CBSE math paper
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Incomplete poser in CBSE math paper
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CBSE examinees at a city centre. A Telegraph picture                                  
	An incomplete question of six marks in the CBSE Class XII mathematics paper left examinees baffled on Monday.        
	There were also complaints against the Higher Secondary nutrition and physics papers.        
	Teachers of CBSE schools who were on examination duty said a crucial part of a question in Group C, carrying six marks, was missing.        
	Students could answer only 94 marks because of the incomplete question, which was a must item. The board should have been more careful, said a teacher of a CBSE school in south Calcutta.        
	Though there was no instruction from the Delhi-based authorities, most schools advised the examinees not to waste time on the incomplete question.        
	Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, said: It seems to be a printing error. We asked the students not to worry as the board would surely do the needful to ensure that the students are compensated.        
	Several examinees expressed the fear that the boards goof-up might mar their chances of securing admission in reputable colleges. The marks in the Class XII exams often form the basis of admission in degree courses. Missing out six marks is not a joke, said an examinee.        
	In the Higher Secondary nutrition paper, examinees alleged, a question was wrongly set from the Class XI syllabus.        
	Following the bifurcation of the HS course in 2008, questions from Class XI topics are not supposed to be set in the Class XII exams, said an examinee in a north Calcutta centre.        
	A section of the students who took the physics test complained that some questions were set following the pattern in the old syllabus.        
	Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, the president of the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education, said the authorities would discuss the matter with subject experts, though he had not received any complaint.

	Ogo Bodhu Sundari will not release on August 27 as was scheduled.         
	The makers of the new film have moved an appeal before the division bench of Chief Justice J.N. Patel and Justice B. Bhattacharya challenging the validity of an order passed by Justice Sanjib Banerjee of the same court directing them to delete three songs they had taken from the 1981 Ogo Bodhu Sundari and also change the logo.        
	The division bench heard the appeal for more than two hours on Thursday. The hearing will continue on Friday.         
	On Monday, Kamal Bansal, son of RD Bansal who had produced the 1981 Uttam Kumar hit, had moved court accusing director Sunando Mitra of copying three songs and the logo of his fathers film.         
	Mitras lawyer Vipul Kundalia told the court on Thursday that his clients film, starring Babul Supriyo, was not a scene-by-scene copy of the Uttam Kumar movie.         
	Moving the appeal on behalf of the new films makers  producers Rose Valley Network and DSilva and Company and Inreco Records, the company from which Mitra had taken permission to use the three songs  advocate R.K. Kapoor said RDB Films (that made the old film) had no claim to the rights of the songs used in the new film.        
	RDB Films had asked Inreco Records to market the songs used in the old film. It is the discretion of the music company to decide whether it would allow any other company to use the songs, Kapoor said.        
	RDB Filmss counsel R. Bachawat said: My client had given the music company the right to make records of the songs in the old Ogo Bodhu Sundari. That does not mean the company can transfer the right to another company.        
	The cancellation of the August 27 release has hit Mitra hard. I will suffer huge losses. I had booked 75 halls for Fridays release, besides all the posters are up and the promos are on, said Mitra.

                The Bengal Taxi Association has asked state transport minister Ranjit Kundu to explore the option of installing sirens in cabs that can be sounded by the driver and passengers in an emergency. The association feels that the step could stop taxis from being used for abduction. A New Town employee was recently kidnapped in a taxi. Kundu has asked the association to submit the proposal in writing.    The urban development department has submitted detailed project reports to the Centre for the revamp of city drains for Rs 62.59 crore and development of water supply and sewage systems in Sector V for Rs 7.87 crore, said minister Asok Bhattacharya on Monday. The work would start as soon as the funds are sanctioned. The department is also preparing detailed project reports for a Rs 180-crore flyover at Kestopur and widening of the Barrackpore-Kalyani and Barrackpore-Dum Dum Expressway, to cost Rs 400 crore. Bhattacharya said reports for the projects would be submitted this month.     An unidentified pedestrian died and a 59-year-old man sustained leg injuries when a private bus on route 24A/1 hit them at the Old Court House Street-Mango Lane crossing on Monday evening. The unidentified man was taken to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead. The bus driver was arrested.    A 40-year-old trader committed suicide by consuming poison in his Rabindra Sarani flat late on Sunday. Sheikh Samad, a resident of Bagnan in Howrah, used to run an electrical goods business from the flat. A suicide note stated that he could not bear the pain in his waist.     A new traffic signal system would be installed at 36 islands and zebra crossings and road markers would be placed at major crossings in Salt Lake to facilitate pedestrian movement, Bidhannagar police and Bidhannagar Municipality announced on Monday.     A 15-year-old girl was rescued on Sunday night from the Ekbalpore house she worked in after her mother accused her employers of torturing her regularly. Hannan Momin and his wife, who had employed the girl, used to beat her up and deny her a salary, said police. The couple are absconding.     Members of the Progressive Technical Teachers Staff Association blocked SN Banerjee Road for 20 minutes on Monday morning, disrupting traffic. They were demanding that vacant posts be filled up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Phone, Net down 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Phone, Net down 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Landline and Internet connections have been disrupted in and around Salt Lake since Thursday afternoon following damage to BSNLs underground cables because of East-West Metro work.        
	Around 5,700 customers, including 4,000 households and 500 leased lines in parts of Salt Lake, New Town and Sector V, have been affected. There has been no Internet connection in my house since yesterday afternoon, said Chhandak Pradhan of Salt Lakes FD block on Friday. DL block-resident Sreya Sen was upset as she would not be able to Skype with her husband, who is in the US.        
	BSNL officials said restoration work had been started. They are saying that our line will be restored on Monday but that means there would be no Net connection over the weekend, the only time we get to talk, complained Sen.        
	City Centre and Mani Square are on the affected list. We are not being able to swipe cards, hence sales have taken a hit, said a City Centre official.        
	Connections to companies in Sector V have also been snapped but there was no disruption in work as most have back-up connections.        
	We met the BSNL authorities and will be more careful in future, said a senior East-West Metro official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Price pinch on the plate
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Price pinch on the plate
  - Crop damage, exports raise cost of vegetables          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                              
	Green premium  Item Dec 2009 Dec 2010
  Garlic Rs 30 Rs 200
  Onion Rs 20 Rs 45
  Peas Rs 25 Rs 50
  Spinach Rs 8 Rs 15 
  Carrot Rs 10 Rs 20      
	Calcutta is surviving a hard winter, not because the mercury has dipped too low but because the price of vegetables has hit a high.         
	The price pinch is all the more difficult to digest because winter is regarded as the season of vegetables just like summer is the season of fruits and monsoon the season of fish.        
	Usually, prices of potato, onion, bean, spring onion, tomato, peas, garlic, brinjal, spinach and ginger remain low from November to the first week of March. But mid-December 2010 has been an exception, said Subrata Bose of the State Agri-Horticulture Corporation.        
	Prices of mustard oil, refined oil and vanaspati have also gone up over the past seven days. Refined oil, which used to cost Rs 95 a litre, now costs Rs 140. The prices of mustard oil and vanaspati have increased by Rs 10 a litre. Even sugar is dearer by Rs 3 a kg.         
	A stroll through the retail markets at Sealdah, Gariahat and New Market reveals the price of garlic has shot up the most  to more than Rs 200 a kg.        
	I have never seen garlic being sold at such a high price in the past 10 years. It was Rs 150 about 10 days ago, said Randhir Gupta, a trader at New Market.         
	Onion, which was Rs 30 a kg last week, is now Rs 45. Only ginger has fallen from Rs 80 a kg to Rs 50 over the past seven days.        
	The prices of tomato, brinjal, spinach, bean, carrot and capsicum have remained stagnant at a level much higher than the usual winter prices.         
	Retailers and wholesalers have no explanation to offer except that they are procuring the vegetables at high prices.         
	Onions come from Nasik, where the crop was damaged this year because of unseasonal rain. Later, high humidity damaged the stored onion, causing shortage in supply, said Biswanath Agarwal of Posta Bazar Market Association.        
	According to some traders at Posta and Koley markets, export of garlic to China, which had a bad crop this season, is the root cause of the skyrocketing price in the domestic market.        
	China is the world leader in garlic production, followed by India, said Bose of the Agri-Horticulture Corporation.        
	Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Bihar are main suppliers of garlic in India.         
	The extended hot and humid season and delayed rain are the two main factors behind high prices of winter vegetables. I hope the prices will dip by the first week of January, said Murtaza Hussain, the agricultural marketing minister of Bengal.        
	According to an assistant director of the agricultural marketing department, the city is largely dependent on Maharashtra for onion and Uttar Pradesh for garlic.        
	The onion which the city is consuming now had been grown in April-May. Because of rain about one third of the crop was damaged in the field and during storage. The next onion harvest has started in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The price of onion is expected to fall when the fresh crop reaches the market.        
	Garlic, in comparison, is harvested once a year. Crop loss because of delayed rain and additional export seems to have pushed up its price.        
	Shortage of garlic in the international market this year allowed Indian traders to export in more than the usual quantities. To prevent excessive export, the central government fixed a high export price for onion. But no such rate has been announced for garlic by the central government.

  - Cops turn down hotel plea          A STAFF REPORTER                          Nightclubs will follow the prevalent curfew time during Puja and Diwali. A Telegraph picture                                         
	The liquor deadline is likely to limit the festive high this Puja and Diwali with police turning down a request by hotel and bar owners to ease restrictions.        
	According to police sources, hotel and bar owners had recently sought permission from senior officers to keep their outlets open beyond the deadline on the festive days. The plea was turned down.         
	We are the custodians of the law. We will follow the norms mentioned in the liquor licence, said the joint commissioner of police, headquarters, Jawed Shamim.        
	The law allows consumption of liquor in star hotels till 2am on four days a week and till midnight on the other three days. Other liquor outlets have to shut shop by midnight throughout the week.         
	Earlier, liquor used to be served till 4am in five-star hotels on four days a week and till 2am on the other days.        
	We told the hotel and bar authorities that allowing them to keep their outlets open beyond the deadline would not be possible. We can allow them to do so only after the government changes the rule. We suggested that they approach the government, said a senior police officer.        
	The new liquor deadline was imposed in June after the police asked the government to put more stringent norms in place.        
	We did it because of a surge in the number of drink-driving and other law and order problems at night, added the officer.        
	Shamim stressed that the liquor licences of the establishments that violate the deadline would be suspended or revoked and their owners prosecuted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Firemen bank on sky-lifts
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Firemen bank on sky-lifts
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The sky-lifts will be ready to tackle any emergency this Diwali, the fire department has promised.        
	The three of the four sky-lifts, which can rise between 30 and 54 metres, will be stationed at the departments headquarters on Free School Street.        
	The fourth, which can rescue a victim from a height of 70 metres, will be kept at Ultadanga. The idea is to intervene at the earliest, Debapriya Biswas, the additional director-general in the fire department, said on Thursday.        
	The sky-lifts  though each takes up to 25 minutes to get going  are essential tools to battle a blaze in or rescue victims from a high-rise.        
	Biswas said the entire force of his department would be on duty from 4pm on Friday.        
	Wednesdays blaze at the 15-storeyed City High has prompted the fire department to review the safety preparedness in high-rises.        
	Cable ducts in high-rises should be sealed on alternate floors so a fire doesnt spread quickly, said an officer.        
	The department has urged housing societies to earmark a place for lighting fireworks and store adequate water. In an attempt to minimise the intervention time, the department has set up temporary stations at Tollygunge, Topsia, Shyampukur, Lake Town, Behala and Bidhannagar.

                      Restoring a treasure                    Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), in collaboration with Goethe-Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan, India will unveil the completely restored painting Last Supper (oil on canvas, 244 x 160 cm) by Johann Zoffany. The painting is one of the most prominent works by the German neoclassical painter, who was born in Frankfurt am Main and gained renown as a portrait painter of the British royal family, before he came to Calcutta in 1783. It was here in 1787, that he was commissioned to paint a depiction of Christs last supper to adorn St Johns Church which was then newly founded by Warren Hastings. The restoration project evolved out of a long collaboration between INTACH, Calcutta Regional Chapter and Goethe-Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan Calcutta. Its aim was to upgrade the skills of restorers and increase their awareness of the preservation of cultural heritage. Furthermore, the intention was to provide motivation for further training. The work was restored by INTACH conservators and professionally supervised by German restorer Renate Kant. Besides the unveiling of the painting, there will be a programme of chamber music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Joseph Haydn presented by members of the Calcutta School of Music and the Kolkata Music Academy.

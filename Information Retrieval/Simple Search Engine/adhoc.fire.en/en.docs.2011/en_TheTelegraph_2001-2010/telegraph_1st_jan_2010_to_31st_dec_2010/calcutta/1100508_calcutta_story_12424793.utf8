	Mamata Banerjee will start her partys campaign for the May 30 civic elections with a rally at the Shyambazar crossing on Wednesday.         
	This will be followed by another rally at the Hazra crossing on May 14.        
	We shall start our campaign in north Calcutta and then take it to south Calcutta and other parts of Bengal, Mamata said after a meeting of the Trinamul Congress core committee at the Topsia Road party headquarters.         
	Flanked by former Congress stalwarts Somen Mitra and Subrata Mukherjee, the Trinamul chief announced the two would oversee the civic poll campaign.        
	Later, she took Mukherjee to artist Shuvaprasannas Salt Lake home, where the leader was introduced to the Trinamul culture clan.         
	Party sources said Mamata wanted Mukherjee to steer Trinamuls campaign in Calcutta and Salt Lake because of his good performance as the city mayor.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two youths on a motorcycle allegedly hurled bombs at the Congress candidate for ward 64, Sammi Jahan, outside her home on CIT Road, in Puddapukur, on Thursday evening.        
	Jahan escaped unhurt. According to her, one of the bombs exploded after ricocheting off her body while the other one did not burst.        
	Detractors said Jahan staged the attack after former cricketer and Congress MP Md Azharuddin did not show up to campaign for her at a rally scheduled in the evening. Her supporters had blared microphones in the area from the morning saying that he would be present at the rally.        
	Jahan alleged that her opponents were behind the attack. Criminals had been threatening her for the past few days, she said.        
	Javed Khan of the Trinamul Congress and Farzana Chowdhury of the CPI are contesting in the ward.        
	Residents of the area said they had heard an explosion. But they denied having seen anyone hurl a bomb, said an officer of Beniapukur police station.        
	Around 6.25pm, Jahan and her son Sarfraz, in his early-20s, left their flat to go to the rally venue. But as her car developed a snag, she decided to take a taxi.        
	Something hit my back as I was boarding a cab. I turned around and saw another object falling in front of me. Within a second, there was a loud explosion, Jahan recounted. Sarfraz said they fell to the ground as the bomb exploded. I did not know what to do and carried my mother upstairs to the flat, he said.        
	We saw Jahan lying on the ground with her son Sarfraz but did not see anybody hurl bombs, said a grocery shop owner.

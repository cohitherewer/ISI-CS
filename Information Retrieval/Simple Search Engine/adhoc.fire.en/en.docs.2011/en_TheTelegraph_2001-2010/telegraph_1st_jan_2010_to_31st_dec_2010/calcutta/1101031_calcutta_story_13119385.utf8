The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Novel idea: 17 superheroes and a trailer
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Novel idea: 17 superheroes and a trailer

	Samit Basu has started what is known as book trailers, much in the line of film trailers  a five to seven-minute audio-visual that gives a feel of the book. Quite novel, actually.         
	At the launch of his latest book, Turbulence, at Oxford Bookstore last week, some very insignificant faces staring out of the screen desultorily mouthed what presumably were dialogues from the book, published by Hachette India. We then finally got down to some book-reading, peppered with conversations with Jadavpur University teacher Abhijit Gupta.        
	Samit said he had started to write a serious, literary novel but ended up with a superhero book. Known for his fantasy novels in the Games Trilogy, it is little wonder that his latest book has 17 superheroes. I was writing about the inner turmoil of a group of 20 to 30-somethings as they tried to find their place in the world. As I dealt with realities like IPL, war, radical political parties, Bollywood, the inner turbulence of this motley group became muted. So I thought lets turn up the volume a bit, he said.        
	The result was a group of young people onboard a British Airways flight from London to Delhi who discover they have superpowers. Armed with the powers, they go about fighting the worlds real villains, faceless amorphous corporations, corrupt government officials and religious fanatics to... heal the planet, of course.         
	Love and Maoists                   
	He is an engineer from IIT with a masters in literature who is now a publishing professional running a textbooks list for Oxford University Press. He also dabbles in art and has contributed to many of OUPs book covers. But Ranjan Kaul (picture alongside) wears other hats too.         
	The Kashmiri Pandit, who has been living in Delhi for over 20 years, and has the Calcutta communist-intellectual Jolly Kaul for his uncle, recently turned novelist.         
	Through the Forest, Darkly, published by Hachette India, was released in Calcutta last month. It is Kauls first novel but he has written short stories earlier. Being a publisher you always aspire to write one day. I had written short stories earlier and I had been working on this novel for the past five years, said the author.         
	Introducing the book, journalist Sunanda K. Dutta Ray, a friend of the family, alluded to the title being taken from the Corinthians, adding that the book cover done in various shades of forest green and black was the handiwork of another Kashmiri Pandit.        
	The story is about ideals and love, with a Maoist commander and a sympathiser along with a former Naxalite. It is the Maoist and the Naxalite connection that brought the author to the city for a separate launch.        
	Present state of affairs        
	Two hacks file an application under the Right to Information Act and find that the Centre sent Rs 5,800 crore to 182 insurgency-affected districts in 2006-07 but Rs 3,000 crore was sent back. This set the duo off to travel 40,000km in four years to the troubled districts of India. The result was The Absent State: Insurgency as an excuse for Misgovernance by Neelesh Mishra and Rahul Pandita, published by Hachette India as the Non-Fiction Book of the Year.         
	Neelesh and Rahul were in the city at Oxford Bookstore last month, where the book launch kicked off with a recital by Shilpa Rao, a Bollywood singer of Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi fame.         
	Written in a lucid style, the book raises questions about accountability, justice and ineffective administration.                    ANASUYA BASU

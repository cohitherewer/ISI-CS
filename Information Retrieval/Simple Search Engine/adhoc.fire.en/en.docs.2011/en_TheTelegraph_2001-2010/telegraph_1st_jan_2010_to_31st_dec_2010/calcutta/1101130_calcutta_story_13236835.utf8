	A Reserve Bank of India officials wife, who was absolutely normal on Sunday night, was found dead the following morning, prompting her father to suspect foul play and police to order a post-mortem.        
	Residents of the Reserve Bank of India Staff Quarters in Dover Lane saw an unconscious Mita Dey, 49, being taken out of her first-floor apartment by her husband and son. Minutes later, they heard she was dead.        
	Her family members told police that she was absolutely normal when she ate dinner around 11pm on Sunday. She used to take sleeping pills but Im not sure about the dose. I dont know whether an overdose of the medicine caused her death, husband Prasanta, an accounts official with the central bank, told the police.        
	Doctors at a nursing home where Mita was taken first told her husband that she had died before being wheeled into the hospital. They suggested that Prasanta approach a government hospital for the death certificate.        
	Prasanta and son Kushal, an MBA student, then took Mitas body to SSKM Hospital, where doctors called the police.        
	Mitas father Shyam Sundar Singha told the police that he suspected some foul play behind the death and asked for a probe.        
	We are shocked. She was absolutely okay. There could be foul play. Cops should probe the death, the Sovabazar resident, in his late 70s, said after meeting the officer-in-charge of Gariahat police station, Dulal Chandra Ghosh.        
	Ghosh said the probe would proceed according to the findings of the post-mortem. If the report points at any foul play, we will interrogate all suspects.        
	The cops refused to say what had prompted Mitas father to suspect foul play. There were no injury marks on the body. Police sources said strips of sleeping pills and medicines to control blood pressure were lying on the table beside her bed.        
	Prasanta told the police that Mita was sleeping when he and his son woke up around 6am. I called her around 7am but she did not respond. We repeatedly tried to wake her up but realised that she was unconscious. Sensing something wrong, we took her to a private healthcare unit where doctors declared her dead.        
	The guard at the officers block of the RBI employees housing estate remembered Mita as a jovial woman.

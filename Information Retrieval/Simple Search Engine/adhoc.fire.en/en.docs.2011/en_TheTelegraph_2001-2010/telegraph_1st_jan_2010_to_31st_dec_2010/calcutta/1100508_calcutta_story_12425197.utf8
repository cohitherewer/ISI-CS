The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Held for fraud
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Held for fraud
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police arrested a 35-year-old man on Friday for duping a family in Taltala of Rs 1.37 lakh by promising to make contestants in a reality show.        
	An officer said Debasish Mukherjee had called Dipak Khanchandani, a trader, on his cellphone and told him that he, his wife and their 18-year-old daughter would feature in a reality show if he paid Rs 2,700 for each.        
	Khanchandani paid the amount through three bearer cheques. Also, as asked by Mukherjee, he did not write the amount in words, said an officer investigating the case.        
	Mukherjee allegedly tampered with the figures on the cheques and got them encashed. Thereafter, the family lost all contact with Mukherjee.        
	Khanchandani mentioned in his complaint that Mukherjee had introduced himself as a representative of a company scouting for participants for reality shows on private television channels.

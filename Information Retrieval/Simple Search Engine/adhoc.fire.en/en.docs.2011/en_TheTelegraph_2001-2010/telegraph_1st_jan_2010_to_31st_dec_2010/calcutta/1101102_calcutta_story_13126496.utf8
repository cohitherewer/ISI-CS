The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | An evening to spread the joy and salute good work
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      An evening to spread the joy and salute good work
          MALINI BANERJEE AND MADHURIMA CHATTERJEE                                      Residents of Jal Vayu Vihar celebrate their Festival of Joy Model Apartment Puja award at Vidya Mandir on Sunday      
	Puja may well be over but the festive fun continued for residents of 38 building complexes on Sunday at The Telegraph and Nerolac Eco Clean presents Festival of Joy awards night in association with CESC.        
	Out of the 100 buildings that participated in the Festival of Joy, 20 were adjudged two-star pujas, 10 won the three-star tag, 5 were awarded four stars, two were crowned five-star pujas and one housing complex became the Model Apartment puja.        
	The star ratings also meant big bucks: while the Model Apartment puja was awarded Rs 50,000, five-star pujas won Rs 15,000, and the four-star, three-star and two-star pujas won Rs 10,000, Rs 7,500 and Rs 5,000 respectively.                  Little Abhijan Lahiri, of Greenwood Park, all of two-and-a-half-years-old, danced with   abandon to Mirs music. Too shy to talk to strangers, his mother spoke on his behalf: He loves dancing and came third in the dhaker naach competition for kids. He thinks its Puja again.

	Excited residents turned up in their Sunday best at Vidya Mandir and were greeted by the sound of dhak and kanshor. As members of the 38 chosen apartments came to collect their prizes and mementoes for celebrating Durga Puja with a heart, the mood and message was universal: joy at winning and happiness at being given an opportunity to enjoy a safe, responsible and inclusive Puja.         
	The awards ceremony for the first edition of Festival of Joy also marked another first for many  the opportunity to witness funnyman Mir as singer. O Ma, Mir gaan gaaye? squealed a silver-haired lady who had come to collect her complexs laurels with the young guns. Mir and his band Bandage kept the crowd hooked as much with their antaras as their antics as they belted out a mix of Hindi hits and Bengali favourites.        
	Comments like There are two emergency exits to the side and two to the rear, in case you cannot bear me, feel free to run had the audience in splits. Uttarayan resident Ashish Bhattacharya, the zonal manager of a pharmaceutical company, was seen breaking into a jig as Mir mingled with the crowd.         
	This is terrific, laughed Bhattacharya. I love Mir I cant believe I got to dance with him on an evening like this. What a great conclusion to the Puja festivities! he gushed.         
	Next came Shubhendu Biswass horbola act. Biswas left the crowd awestruck with his authentic reproduction of car, tram, bird and animal sounds. Talking about the fast-disappearing folk art, he said: We are a rare breed now. Our people were given the name horbola by Rabindranath Tagore. I was so happy to be invited to perform today.        
	On stage, the residents were thrilled to receive their awards from star guest Mimi Chakraborty (Pupe of Gaaner Opare fame). Durga Puja is and will always be big for Bengalis. I am glad I got to be a part of this celebration that encourages people to share and care, said Mimi, looking pretty in a beige and red sari.        
	Amid the fun and frolic, building complex residents spared a thought for others too. A resident of Jal Vayu Vihar, the winner of Model Apartment puja, had a simple message: This prize is for everyone as we all did our bit to make the puja safe, secure and enjoyable.         
	For others, the win has only whetted their appetite for more good work. We will use the prize money to do something for underprivileged children in our area. We feel we havent done enough, said Chandra Banerjee of Golf Tower, which won four stars.

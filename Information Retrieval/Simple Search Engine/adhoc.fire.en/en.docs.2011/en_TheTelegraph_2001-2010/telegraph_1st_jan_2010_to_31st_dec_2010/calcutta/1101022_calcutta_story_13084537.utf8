The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | UGC delay hits college teachers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      UGC delay hits college teachers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Successful candidates of the 2009 state eligibility tests (SET) are unhappy with the delay in filling up of lecturer posts in 400-odd state-aided colleges in the state.         
	Nearly 3,000 lecturer posts in the state are likely to remain vacant for an indefinite period though the SET results were declared by the West Bengal College Service Commission nearly a fortnight ago.         
	According to members, the commission will not recruit teachers till the University Grants Commission (UGC) issues a gazette notification on the revised pay scales and minimum qualification requirements for college and university teachers across the country announced in June.         
	A gazette notification by the UGC is necessary before we can appoint teachers on the basis of the revised regulations, said Himangshu Ghosh, the chairman of the state commission. We cannot apply the old appointment rules as the UGC has already fixed the revised criteria for appointments, he added.        
	Ghosh said since the commission cannot approach the UGC directly, he had asked the state government to urge the central body to issue the notification quickly.

                      Meditative masterstrokes                    A painter with a rooted but unique vision, veteran artist S. H. Raza has a style that is simultaneously flexible and spiritual. In his current phase of late creativity, he appears to be revisiting his defining themes as also the accompanying poetics of evocation and exploration. A characteristic exuberance and fury of colours, meticulous geometry of forms and shapes and subdued gestural idioms, that all get woven into works which are extremely reticent to state much for long, are all evident in the ongoing show. His works remain, in the best self-sustained tradition of the painter, understatements; statements which, while being both formal and philosophical, do not overburden the viewers with some conceptual load. They are meditations in colour about the origins and the essence of life as it appears to an Indian artist who has lived in the West. The resonances are built into a luminous architecture of an imagination, which remains both free and rooted. Razas mindscapes pulsate with rhythm; as if they are notations of an unending symphony in which earth, sky, fire, water and wind are evoked and quietly weave a non-narrative but mythical tale, or perhaps a visual myth of being. His art responds to the call of the unseen, the intangible and the unutterable. Fury melts into silence; intensity into tranquil acceptance; imagination rises to a cosmos in which the artist and the viewer both could be ennobled and raised.

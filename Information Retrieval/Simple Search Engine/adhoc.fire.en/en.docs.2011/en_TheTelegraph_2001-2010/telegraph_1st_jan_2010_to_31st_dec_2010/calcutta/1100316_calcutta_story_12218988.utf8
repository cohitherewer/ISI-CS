The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SOS from SRK, Sourav   Slanging match over gallery
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      SOS from SRK, Sourav             OUR BUREAU                              
	An FIR against the Cricket Association of Bengal and a slanging match over the Rs 32,000-a-seat temporary deck at Eden Gardens forced Shah Rukh Khan and Sourav Ganguly to pad up for some crisis management on Monday.        
	The fire services department lodged a complaint with Maidan police station against CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey and KKR venue manager Abhishek Singh for the alleged violation of fire-safety norms while setting up the stand beside gate No. 3 from where Shah Rukh Khan and Co. had watched Sundays match.        
	The PWD had apparently granted provisional permission to set up the IPL Club Lounge deck for only the first two matches on the ground that the organisers would take responsibility for any untoward incident.        
	Sources said Shah Rukh met PWD secretary Ajit Ranjan Bardhan on Monday to resolve the matter while skipper Sourav Ganguly and civil aviation minister Praful Patels daughter Poorna, associated with the IPL, called PWD minister Kshiti Goswami to request him to find a way to settle the issue.        
	I told Sourav he should have been more alert when it comes to his favourite Eden Gardens, said Goswami.        
	CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya issued a statement in the evening washing his hands of the stand-off. We are shocked to learn that certain quarters are trying to blame the CAB for the structure set up by KKR for their super hospitality area, he said.        
	Sumit Sur, the officer-in-charge of the fire departments headquarters division, said the superstructure was built in violation of seven norms ranging from lack of access to fire tenders to absence of in-built fire-safety measures.        
	Sources in Lalbazar said the FIR, lodged under Section 11C of the West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services Act, was unlikely to have a bearing on the 32K gallery for Tuesdays match between KKR and the Chennai Super Kings.        
	The FIR doesnt mention evacuation, and its not the polices job to demolish a structure or evacuate without a specific order. We will bar access to the structure only if the PWD withdraws permission, which isnt the case so far, said a senior police officer.        
	Joint police commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim said the allegations in the FIR would be probed and necessary action taken in the interest of spectator safety.        
	Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee was all fired up, saying it was shocking to see the PWD and the police clearing an allegedly unsafe structure. He threatened to resign if pressured to fall in line.        
	Chatterjee later came on STAR Ananda to take on CAB joint secretary Dey and state Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee  ostensibly batting for cricket  in a no-holds-barred debate.        
	I think you are angry because you didnt receive complimentary tickets, taunted Mukherjee.        
	I have money to buy a ticket if I want tobut its a shame that a marattok bipojjonok (extremely dangerous) stand has been built where each seat costs Rs 32,000, shot back minister Chatterjee.        
	Tuesdays match being a fully floodlit affair  starting 8pm  special additional commissioner Debasish Roy met officials of the agencies engaged in maintaining the light towers at Eden Gardens to take stock of the arrangements.

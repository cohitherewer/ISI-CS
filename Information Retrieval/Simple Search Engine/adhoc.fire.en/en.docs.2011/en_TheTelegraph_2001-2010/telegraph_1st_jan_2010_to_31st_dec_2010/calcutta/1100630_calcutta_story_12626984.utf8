          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The death of a 20-year-old homemaker, who neighbours said was tortured by her in-laws, led to a clash between police and the residents of Kodia Alampur in Bagnan, Howrah, on Tuesday. Ten policemen, including the officer-in-charge and a sub-inspector of Bagnan police station, were injured, and three residents arrested.        
	Soon after Masura Begums body was found on the bank of a canal, residents surrounded her in-laws house and alerted police. They alleged that cops came two-and-a-half hours after being called. They prevented policemen from taking away the body, prompting a lathicharge. The crowd then turned violent and threw stones at cops.

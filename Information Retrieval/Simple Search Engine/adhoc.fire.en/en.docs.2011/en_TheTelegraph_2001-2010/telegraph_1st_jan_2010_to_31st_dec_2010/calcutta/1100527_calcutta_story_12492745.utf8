                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City plays catch-up with towns 
  - Class X girls close in on boys        OUR BUREAU                          Students of Shri Shikshayatan School exchange high-fives after the announcement of the Madhyamik results on Wednesday. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	Girls narrowed the performance gap but Calcutta failed to outperform the districts in the Madhyamik results declared on Wednesday that saw the pass percentage hit a plateau after the record jump last year.        
	The state-wide pass percentage of 81.78 was only 0.04 points higher over last years 81.74 per cent, but it seemed to exceed the expectations of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education.        
	The buzz in education circles over the past couple of weeks was that the board was allegedly under pressure to maintain, if not improve on, last years showing to avoid any impact on the May 30 civic elections.        
	I am extremely happy that the Madhyamik pass percentage has remained almost the same as last year. What makes me happier is the improvement in the performance of girl students across Bengal, board president Mamata Ray said.        
	Male candidates finished with an overall pass percentage of 86.05, lower than last years 86.82, but girls improved theirs to 77.43 from 76.32 per cent last year. In Calcutta, the improvement by girls was even sharper  from 78.40 per cent in 2009 to 83.40 per cent this year.        
	Calcutta finished sixth in the pecking order, moving a notch up the ladder with a marginally increased pass percentage of 83.75 over last years 80.48 per cent that had fetched it the seventh position. Neighbouring Howrah, Hooghly, North 24-Parganas and South 24-Parganas all performed better than the city, taking positions two to four in the success stakes. East Midnapore retained pole position with 90.73 per cent.        
	The board president said the pass percentage remaining much the same was a reflection of the boards success in maintaining academic standards in Madhyamik institutions across the rural belt.        
	The district-wise performance of state-aided schools seemed to support Rays statement. As opposed to students of Calcutta schools, who performed well mainly in science and math, successful examinees in the districts did uniformly well in all subjects.         
	The results prove that students in the rural belt are giving equal attention to all subjects. Their counterparts in Calcutta are doing well in science and math primarily because there are coaching centres all over for these subjects. Students in the city are performing below average in language and social science, said an official of the examination department.         
	Apart from the overall pass percentage being maintained, a feature of Madhyamik 2010 was the lowest-ever number of withheld results. We have also managed to eliminate the problem of incomplete results, an official said.        
	Some of the more heart-warming stories of success came from correctional homes. Four women inmates of the Alipore correctional home  Bhagabati Sadhukan, 52, Nilima Burman, 26, Papiya Dolui, 20, and Sujata Sarkar, 24  cleared the examination. Apart from Papia, the rest are serving life terms.        
	Two inmates of Alipore jail, 35-year-old Sambhu Murmu and 23-year-old Manjuar Mondal, also passed the exam. We are very happy about their success. We were able to buy books and stationery items for them, thanks to the West Bengal Prisoner Welfare Fund to which the prisoners themselves contribute, B.D. Sharma, the inspector-general of correctional services, told Metro.        
	Ray admitted that the board was apprehending a dip in the pass percentage because a record number of 9.4 lakh candidates  nearly one lakh more than in 2009  had written Madhyamik in February. The majority of the examinees are from the rural belt, and mostly from economically underprivileged families. A sizeable number of these students are also first-generation learners. So we would not have been surprised had the pass percentage dipped.

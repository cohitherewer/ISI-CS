The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Purr amp; grrr in festive week
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Purr amp; grrr in festive week
  - Licence to live it up all night long        PRONAB MONDAL AND SAIONEE CHAKRABORTY                                                  
	Lalbazar is set to lift the five-month-old Cinderella code for the festive week starting Christmas Eve, spreading cheer among the curfew-curtailed party crowd raring to go Hic, hic, hooray!        
	Special permission will be given to hotel, nightclub and bar owners for the last week of this month, which is a time for festive partying. The restriction on serving liquor beyond regular hours will consequently be eased, Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), confirmed to Metro.        
	For the past few months, the citys party people have had to down their last drink and dance their last dance by 11.45pm on four days of the week and by 1.45am on the remaining three.        
	The police are yet to decide on the festive deadline, but a senior excise department official said most establishments might be allowed to serve liquor through the night on Christmas Eve and New Years Eve, probably till 4am.        
	Special permission for late closure of bars would be given separately for three more nights of the festive week. Hotels, bars and nightclubs need to mention the particular days in their applications. We will allow them to serve liquor till 2am, added an excise official, hinting that other days may also be considered.        
	The reason for the cash-strapped state government to allow the extension has less to do with playing Santa Claus this Christmas week and more to do with raking it in. A late bar licence comes with a tag of Rs 2,000 (per night, per bar) to be paid to the excise department and Rs 1,460 (per night, per bar) to be paid to Lalbazar.        
	The rules for rooftop parties will, however, be different. We will give permission only after checking the venue and the neighbourhood. If we receive a complaint about loudspeakers being used after 10pm or any other nuisance, we will shut down the party, warned Shamim.        
	The decision to extend the liquor deadline is, of course, music to the ears of not only those planning to party all night but also hotels, nightclubs and bars.        
	There are a lot of people who go back home from work pretty late, change and come out to party. So by the time they come in, it is 11pm. They want to party till late, at least till 2-2.30am. That is the main business period for us, said Sovan Mukherjee of Nocturne, the latest lounge in town.        
	Ekta Puri of Plush, the party place at The Astor, admitted that weekends werent the same since the 2am curfew was clamped though the footfall was still high. With the city being so used to late nights, the deadline did affect the party crowd. They basically couldnt come to terms with the fact that they would have to finish their last drink early.        
	The liquor restrictions had been imposed in July following a series of incidents  accidents, bar brawls and even a shooting  allegedly triggered by late-night drinking. Late-night parties were creating a law-and-order problem, said a police officer.

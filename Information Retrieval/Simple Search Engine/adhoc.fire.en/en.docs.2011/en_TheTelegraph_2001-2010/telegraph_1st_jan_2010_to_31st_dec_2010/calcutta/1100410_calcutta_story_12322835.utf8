                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Report cites causes for blaze spread
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A report by the director-general of fire services, Jogesh Chatterjee, states that the Stephen Court blaze spread rapidly because of old wiring, wooden staircases and inadequate firefighting arrangements in the building, said a source at Writers Buildings.        
	Chatterjees report has been submitted to home secretary Ardhendu Sen.        
	The director-general could not be reached for comment but the Writers source said the report had cited the lapses that led to the rapid spread of the blaze, resulting in the death of 43 people.        
	The report would be handed over to the 12-member committee  headed by former chief secretary Sourin Roy probing the Park Street blaze.        
	Postal cell: The postal department on Friday set up a special cell at Middleton Row post office to hand over undelivered mail addressed to people who worked or lived at Stephen Court.        
	Metro had on Thursday published a report highlighting how the fire-ravaged building had ceased to be a postal address.        
	Victims picture: Family members of Jayatree Roy Chowdhury, a Stephen Court blaze victim, handed over her photograph to police on Friday in an attempt to identify her body through skull superimposition.        
	Samples collected from four of the charred bodies could not generate the DNA profile required for identification.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tata Tea shrinks in city, exits heritage HQ
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tata Tea shrinks in city, exits heritage HQ
          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Tata Tea is ready to bid bye to 1 Bishop Lefroy Road, the registered office of the groups beverage business for over three decades  and neighbour to Satyajit Ray.        
	After slashing headcount in Calcutta, the company plans to leave the landmark address  a heritage building constructed by the Armenian businessman JC Galstaun  for a smaller office this year, within 24 months of the Nano leaving Bengal for Gujarat.        
	We dont need such a large space anymore as most of the employees have been relocated to Bangalore and other places, said a Tata Tea official, on the condition of anonymity.        
	A new office address is yet to be identified, but Tata Centre on Chowringhee is not an option.        
	There is just no place there, clarified the official.        
	The company shifted to Bishop Lefroy Road from Dalhousie Square in 1977, a year after Tata Finlay, as it was called then, took over the tea production and marketing operations of James Finlay of the UK. Tata Tea Limited was born in 1983 when Tata bought out Finlay from the venture.        
	The company re-organised operations last year sending the senior management, including managing director Percy Siganporia, to London. Later, the marketing team was shifted out to Bangalore, leaving only the blending and buying team here.        
	TTL has been in the process of integrating and consolidating its operations at its regional centre in Bangalore since last year. Henceforth, the entire marketing and commercial teams will be based out of this regional centre. However, (the) TTL buying and blending facility will continue to be headquartered in Calcutta along with a registered HQ. The move is in keeping with the larger integration exercise aimed at bringing efficiencies in the business, read the official statement from Tata Tea when asked about the office shift.        
	The G+2 structure on Bishop Lefroy Road is spread over 39,000sq ft. The building is owned by Property Co Ltd. Raiomond Irani, the director of the company, said Tata Tea had not officially announced its departure yet.        
	It is occupying the building for over three decades. The company has taken great care of the property, Irani said.        
	The building entered the heritage list in 2009 for its architectural features.        
	Irani said the property was built by JC Galstaun (see box) in 1923-24. Galstaun, an Armenian who came to Calcutta in the second part of 19th century, was a leading builder and the arch rival of Arathoon Stephen (of Stephen Court fame).        
	The initial occupiers of 1 Bishop Lefroy Road were the McDonnel sisters who used the building as a boarding house for English officers. After Independence, they left the property. In 1956, the address was occupied by the USSR (former Soviet Union) Trade Office before Tata Finlay entered in 1977.        
	Irani said it was one of the better maintained old buildings in Calcutta. There are three heritage buildings on Bishop Lefroy Road. But sadly, the pavements are encroached, spoiling the beauty of the magnificent properties here, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dream-kit makers drum up a storm
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dream-kit makers drum up a storm
          ARKA DAS                            Mahadev Chakraborty at his store Bapy Music; (right) Gautam Das at Gautam Drums. (Arka Das)                                
	A bylane off Sitaram Ghosh Street would generally be considered a bookworms haunt. A typical north Calcutta neighbourhood close to the College Street book hub, the para exudes old-world, with its narrow alleys, buildings conjoined like Siamese twins and a million different publishing and printing factories. Not exactly a rocknroll environment.         
	The milieu, however, doesnt deter Gautam Das, 43, from building one drumkit after another, tirelessly working in his tiny 12ftx10ft factory-workshop at the end of a blind lane, with just three assistants.        
	Hes been at it for the past 15 years. In all this while, the expansion has meant moving the store to a similar-sized room atop the main workshop. And, in a little over a decade, Gautam Drums, as his brand of instruments is better known, has become one of the first-call choices for budding drummers in the city, without burning a deep hole in the pocket.         
	Dass store is not the only address in town for the drumming greenhorn looking for that budget kit. Over the past four decades, two shops in yet another bustling central city district, a stones throw from Lalbazar, have been the hub of locally manufactured drums.        
	Bapy Music, on Sunayat Sen Street across Rabindra Sarani, started it in 1971, building the first locally made drumkit. BCM Music Palace followed in a few years, specialising in fibreglass sets that became a rage in the mid-80s and early 90s.        
	In the US, independent drum-makers like this trio would be respected artisan-entrepreneurs, with adequate government support to help their businesses flourish. Custom drum-builders like Pork Pie Percussion, Dunette amp; Lang and Jeff Ocheltree are known the world over. All of them started in backyard garages.        
	The picture isnt that rosy in this city, but our local heroes shine on. The reasons are simple: you can get stuff custom-made, not to mention the price. A decent imported drumkit comes for Rs 20,000, but the hardware may be rickety. And then theres always the issue of after-sales services, accessories and repair.         
	In contrast, kits from our local drum-makers range from as little as Rs 2,500 to over Rs 15,000 for a full-blown, six or seven-piece set.        
	Mahadev Chakraborty, the owner of Bapy Music, started off with a gramophone retail and repair shop at the Sunyat Sen Street address in the late 50s. I was always interested in how drums are made. A Goanese drummer named Victor who often visited my gramophone store taught me what drumset design is all about, says Chakraborty.        
	Dass knowhow didnt come from a very different source: he assisted a music instrument maker and was a master at operating the lathe machine. Once he knew the way drum hardware was built, switching to making drums was smooth. Setting up his own store was the next, natural step.        
	Bapy Music started rolling out the first locally-made drums in 1971: the first ones to be manufactured in Calcutta. Everything except the hardware  which Chakraborty imported  was built at his Lalbazar address.         
	Bapy Musics drums caught on immediately, so much so that by the late 70s, Chakraborty started sending out kits to Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai. By the mid-80s, he expanded his workshop. I started off with two assistants. Today, there are over 30 workers in our company, smiles a proud Chakraborty.        
	BCM Music Palace on Rabindra Sarani was founded in the 50s by Bhimchandra Mondal  thus the name BCM. Grandson Tapas now mans the Lalbazar store, while his father Ashoke, 55, visits the stores Howrah factory every working day.        
	BCM started manufacturing its sets from the early 80s. We had been in the music instruments business for over two decades before we started manufacturing our drums. We did enough research to find out what sort of materials we would need in order to make quality drumkits, says Ashoke. In the turn of the decade, the companys fibreglass shell model became an instant hit with city drummers.        
	Then Chiradeep Lahiri, former drummer for Krosswindz, Span and Bickram Ghoshs fusion outfit Rhythmscape started off playing the drums in the mid-80s.        
	The very first kit I owned was a second-hand BCM make, which lasted me a long time. Gautams drums came in the early 90s, and they were very decent kits, recalls Lahiri.        
	Monojit Kochu Datta of the Orient Express recalls playing BCM and Bapy Music drums for almost a decade before actually laying his hands on an imported drumkit. Even then, Datta still gets most of his stuff custom-made from Dass store.        
	Ditto for Ritoban Das, drummer for Cassinis Division and Debapratim Bakshi, drummer with Span and the Saturday Night Blues Band. Hip Pocket drummer and t2 columnist Nondon Bagchi  who owns a vintage Ludwig drumset that dates back to the 70s  relies on Dass shop for hardware-related problems and his drum cases.

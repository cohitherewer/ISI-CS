  - ROYALTY IN CITY OF RAJ          AMIT ROY IN LONDON                                              PRINCE OF COMMERCE: Prince Andrew, who will be in Calcutta on March 11-12 on a business mission, says: We (the royal family) are still trusted, as it were, above and beyond governments. I have no political will or desire. My desire is to serve the United Kingdom to the best of my ability and to get the best for the United Kingdom.		              PRINCESS OF COMPASSION: This royal visit comes 18 years after Princess Diana was here on February 15, 1992. The Princess of Wales had won Calcuttas heart by spending most of her time in homes run by the Missionaries of Charity		    
	Royalty is coming to Calcutta.        
	Prince Andrew, the Queens second son, will be in the city on March 11-12, flying the Union flag for UK Plc.        
	The Duke of Yorks time will be packed with business meetings. He will talk, among other things, about banking and low carbon energy in discussions set up jointly by British diplomats and the CII.        
	But someone should put Andrew into a car  may be an Ambassador taxi  and give him a whirlwind tour of Calcutta. After all, he may not have quite grasped this was once the capital of British India until Lord Curzon saw fit to move it to Delhi.        
	Look, that is the Victoria Memorial and this, your Royal Highness, is the statue of Queen Victoria  not so different from the one outside your office, his guide, preferably a pretty Bengali girl, should point out his great-great-great grandmother.        
	[Beatrice, after all, wants the best single dad in the world to find love again. It would be nice for him not to be single, says the elder daughter of Andrew and Sarah Fergie Ferguson.]        
	The prince who turned 50 on February 19 lives in Buckingham Palace where he has an office that overlooks the Victoria Monument, with a statue of Queen Victoria, almost as imposing as the one in Calcutta.        
	So what should Calcutta make of Andrew? First, a bottle of beer or a glass of wine should not be pushed into his hands. The man drinks only water at room temperature, no ice, thank you.        
	Second, though he may well be preceded by his reputation as a playboy prince, he ought to be taken seriously. For the past 10 years he has been an ambassador for British industry. He travels to between 15 and 20 countries a year and is out of the UK for 100-120 days annually.         
	In 2001, after serving 22 years with the Royal Navy as a helicopter pilot  he saw action in the 1982 Falklands war against Argentina  he became special representative for UK International Trade amp; Investment (UKTI).        
	According to the Financial Times, Andrews position, part ambassador, part travelling salesman, has no obvious parallels elsewhere in business or government. It is the application of royal patronage to the business community, explains Andrew.        
	In this capacity, he has been twice in India, in 2006 and 2008, visiting Delhi and Mumbai. He reflects the government view that the key Indian professions of the law, accountancy and banking should be opened up to outsiders  which is where Calcutta could possibly leapfrog ahead of Mumbai and Delhi.        
	Andrew is coming to Calcutta because the British government and especially the UKTI have decided it is in Britains interest to do so. It should be stressed that Calcutta has slipped so far down the pecking order that it is no longer linked to London by direct flights.         
	Before he sets out for India, the prince will be briefed by the Foreign Office in London and by British captains of industry. His office is littered with thick briefing papers and on the floor is an inflatable beach ball with a map of the world. As he acknowledges, he does not sign deals but clears the way for business leaders.        
	After having served for 22 years in the navy, Andrew is said to be less stuffy than other royals. The word is that he can do his own packing and look after himself on his trips abroad in marked contrast to others who travel with valets and dressers.        
	Also, Andrew is excellent at golf, so someone should really find a hole in his otherwise packed diary and give him a break at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club. After all, though he gets his expenses, the prince is not even paid for the job he does so well.          
	Andrew was born in Buckingham Palace on February 19, 1960.  
	Marked his 50th birthday with a weekend skiing trip to Switzerland with his ex-wife, Sarah, known universally as ldquo;Fergie rdquo; (picture right), and their two daughters, princesses Beatrice, 21, and Eugenie, 19.  
	 ldquo;Fergie rdquo; was Sarah Ferguson, a modern, bouncy redhead whom Andrew married in Westminster Abbey on July 23, 1986. The couple separated in 1992 and were divorced in 1996.  
	Beatrice is in the final year of a three-year degree course in history and history of ideas at Goldsmiths College, London. Eugenie started last year at Newcastle University on a BA in English Literature, history of art and politics.

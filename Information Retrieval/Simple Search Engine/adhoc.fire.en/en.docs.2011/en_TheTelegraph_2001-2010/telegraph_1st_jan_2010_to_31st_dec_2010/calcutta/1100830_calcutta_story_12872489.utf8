                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Salute the spirit of learning     Twin profiles of courage
          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                       Abir Adhikary receives the Surrendra Paul Memorial Award for Courage from Jeyapriya Gopal, who saved three lives by donating her husband rsquo;s organs after he was declared brain dead, at the Science City auditorium on Saturday. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                
	Accident victim Abir Adhikary learnt to write with his left hand within a year of losing his right arm and passed ISC with 70.5 per cent.        
	Chronically allergic Tousif Alam, 18, chose to endure acute renal pain rather than take painkillers and risk yet another bout of rash that could have ruined his preparations for Madhyamik.        
	The two bravehearts were jointly honoured with the Surrendra Paul Memorial Award for Courage at the 14th edition of The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence on Saturday.        
	Tousif, who passed Madhyamik with 73 per cent this year, also received The Telegraph Education Foundation scholarship while Abir was conferred the Keshav Rathi Memorial scholarship.        
	For 20-year-old Abir, a first-year BCom student at Jaipuria College, life took a cruel turn on February 24, 2009, when his right elbow was crushed under the wheels of a bus barely seven days before his first ISC paper.        
	I was returning home on my bicycle when the accident occurred. Lying in hospital under anaesthesia, I had no idea that my right arm was gone....Then, my world came crashing down, he told Metro.        
	So how and when did Abir find the courage to fight back? I picked up a pen barely a month after the accident, knowing that the sooner I started practising the faster I would get over the loss of an arm, he recalled.                   Tousif Alam, who was the joint winner of the Surrendra Paul Memorial Award for Courage, at his home in Tiljala Road, off Park Circus. (Bishwarup Dutta)      
	It wasnt easy learning to write all over again in Class XII but he kept trying. In a few weeks, the boy from Tobin Road could write slowly but legibly. Mother Rachna was his pillar of strength. She would constantly remind me that success never came from giving up, smiled Abir.        
	If an accident changed Abirs life, a bout of tonsillitis when he was 14 brought Tousif face to face with a medical condition nobody knew he had  idiopathic allergy with exfoliative cheilitis.        
	A drug called Levofloxacin for my tonsil problem triggered such an allergic reaction that I needed five steroids a day for a year. When that didnt cure me of the rashes all over my body, I was given an antigen that made matters worse, recalled Tousif, a student of Class XI at Salt Lake Collegiate School.        
	At one point, Tousif was so prone to allergies that even rice, wheat, milk and chicken would make him sick. His lips would swell to thrice their normal size, said father M. Alam, a police officer.         
	Around one-and-a-half years back, Tousif was diagnosed with kidney stones that would cause pain and bleeding. I was prescribed another drug for the stones but I pleaded with my doctor to allow me to write Madhyamik without any medication because I didnt want any complication to spoil my preparations, said Tousif.         
	Illness, though, has robbed Tousif of his first love: sport. I used to race and play cricket but the doctors have advised me against it, so I have now started creative writing.

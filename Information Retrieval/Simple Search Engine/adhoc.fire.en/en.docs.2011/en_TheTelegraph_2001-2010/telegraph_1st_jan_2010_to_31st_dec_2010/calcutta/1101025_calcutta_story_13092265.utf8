The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Banner ban in CU poll code
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Banner ban in CU poll code
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Calcutta University is aiming to clamp a ban on banners, festoons and wall graffiti for college elections as part of a poll code meant to prevent the campus from turning into a political cauldron.        
	University officials are hoping that the syndicate, the institutions highest policy-making body, will pass the draft code before the next round of college elections, scheduled between November 2010 and January 2011.        
	With Assembly elections round the corner, student union polls are going to be more volatile than ever. The only way to insulate the campus from the heat of the political battle outside is to change the way union polls are held, said a teacher of a south Calcutta college.        
	The CPM-backed Students Federation of India calls the shots in over 80 per cent of the 102 colleges affiliated to Calcutta University, but the Trinamul Chhatra Parishad has emerged as a potent threat since the Lok Sabha polls last year.         
	The draft code not only recommends a ban on poll publicity through banners and wall graffiti but also slogan-shouting during college hours. The only way a candidate can campaign is by personal interaction and display of posters in fixed zones. The posters would need to be removed after the polls.        
	That is a drastic change from the long-prevalent system of using the campus walls to write graffiti that isnt erased until the next round of elections, said a senior official.        
	But will student unions fall in line in a state where they routinely hold the authorities to ransom?         
	The university did not feel the need to revise the rules as long as the SFI was winning polls uncontested for years. The emergence of a strong rival has changed the campus situation, necessitating radical changes. We need to see this (the poll code) through, come what may, said a member of the university think tank.        
	While candidates in college elections could be barred from campaigning like their political counterparts, the draft code has borrowed the concept of electoral rolls from the mainstream elections.        
	The new rules, based on a draft document drawn up by the West Bengal Council of Higher Education, suggest that each college compile a voters list to ensure electoral fairness. Till the last elections, students only needed to display their identity cards to enter the booths.         
	There could also be restrictions on the number of class representatives in a union. The proposal is to have the same number of representatives from classes with an equal number of students, irrespective of the institution. For instance, there will be one representative for a class of 50 or less. A class with 51 to 100 students will have two representatives and one with 101 to 200 students will have three. The larger the class, the more its representatives, said a university official.        
	Under the old system, colleges were at liberty to fix the number of representatives from each class.        
	The code also aims to empower the university to intervene in the electoral process whenever peace on the campus is at stake. Earlier, the university could intervene in poll-related matters only if a particular college sought its intervention or there was a serious law-and-order problem.        
	Subimal Sen, the chairman of the higher education council, said Calcutta University was free to modify the draft of the regulations depending on its requirements. The university is an autonomous body and has the freedom to modify some of the guidelines. But there is no escaping the need to introduce a new set of rules for the conduct of college elections and the functioning of student unions, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stephen Court forces FIR on fire-prone four
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stephen Court forces FIR on fire-prone four
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Nandram may have only opened the fire departments eyes but Stephen Court has forced its hand, prompting preventive FIRs to be filed for the first time against four tinderbox markets in the citys business district.        
	Burrabazar police station registered four FIRs this week against the owners and occupiers of Raja Katra, Sadasukh Katra, City Centre (Synagogue Street) and Ganesh Market after an inspection revealed that they had failed to implement the fire-safety recommendations made after the Nandram blaze in 2008.        
	The FIRs were registered under Section 285 of the IPC, which deals with negligible conduct relating to fire or combustible material, and sections 11J and L of the West Bengal Fire Services Act, said an official of the police station.         
	The inspection was jointly conducted by the fire department, police, CESC and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.         
	Officials said the FIRs were a big step forward, though how the authorities intend fixing responsibility on the owners and occupiers as a whole is a grey area. As the hunt for the Stephen Court culprits proves, it is difficult to find out where the buck stops, said a police officer.        
	Banibrata Basu, the special additional commissioner of police (II), said a probe was underway to find out the real owners of these buildings. The pattern of ownership of buildings in Burrabazar is very complex, he added.        
	The caretakers of the fire-prone buildings were apparently handed a list of safety suggestions in 2008 and asked to implement those within six months. A follow-up inspection was never carried out until 43 people died in the Stephen Court blaze on March 23.        
	On paper, the FIRs mean that the caretakers of the buildings where safety recommendations have been ignored are liable for arrest. The maximum punishment under Section 285 of the IPC is six months imprisonment or a fine of Rs 1,000, or both.        
	At Sadasukh Katra on MG Road, the inspection team found the state of the electricity wiring worse than it was in 2008. Raja Katra was no better, with no safety measure in place except dated extinguishers.        
	The City Centre building on Synagogue Street was also found to have fire extinguishers well past the expiry date. Apart from regular refilling of extinguishers, we had recommended a protective device for the transformer during the 2008 inspection. None of these suggestions has been implemented, said an official.        
	Ganesh Market was found to be the worst of the lot. The occupants have done nothing to improve the wiring. They dont even have a fire extinguisher near the meter board, said Soumen Chatterjee, manager (central) of CESC.        
	On Friday, the joint inspection team visited three other commercial buildings in Burrabazar  Bothra Market, Kajaria Market and Pinjrapol Market  and found all of them to be far from fireproof.        
	The eight-storeyed Bothra Market on Old China Bazaar Street has a single staircase and no lifts. The buildings electricity network is a maze of loose wires, said an official.         
	At Kajaria Market on Amratola Street, which has 22 co-owners, the inspection team found fire extinguishers past their expiry date. The width of the ground floor corridor is not even a metre. The ground floor alone has around 100 shops. Its scary thinking what might happen if there is a fire, the official added.        
	Pinjrapol Market, on Armenian Street, is so dilapidated that it might crumble if there is a fire even half as big as the one that ravaged Stephen Court. The building hasnt seen repairs in a long time. The narrow staircases will surely cause a stampede if a fire breaks out, said a police officer.

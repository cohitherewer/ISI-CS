The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Summer set to blaze heat trail   A cut in power cut
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Summer set to blaze heat trail     - Weatherman warns of swelter, CESC promises fewer power cuts          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                                                  
	Summer 2010 is set to be more uncomfortable than last years, one of the hottest in the citys recorded meteorological history, warn independent weather agencies.        
	The only source of comfort for Calcuttans bracing for a blazing summer is the assurance that there would be fewer power cuts this time with CESC much better placed than last year to meet the increased electricity demand.        
	The India Meteorological Department does not issue long-term forecasts but private agencies have issued warnings of an unusually hot April and May. The maximum temperature will stay two or three degrees above normal on most days over the next two months, said O.P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of one such private agency.        
	March is showing the way with the maximum temperature remaining at least three degrees above normal so far. On Tuesday, the mercury was barely three notches short of the 40-degree mark. The Alipore Met office attributed the unusually hot weather to high humidity and warm winds blowing in from central India.        
	Even June, when the city cools down with the rains, could be hot and sultry this year unless a strong monsoon flow is activated by the end of the first week. A third month of intense heat is likely and that could make this summer hotter than last year, said Sharma.        
	The National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida, does not foresee record-breaking heat but expects the long-period average temperature to be higher than in summer 2009.                                
	CESC is banking on the recently commissioned 250MW generation unit at Budge Budge and a 330KV transmission line from Budge Budge to the East Calcutta substation near Science City to meet the additional requirement.        
	During peak demand, CESC can now generate and supply over 1,250MW of power on its own, against around 975MW or less last summer. The highest demand last summer was around 1,600MW. We will have to import less power this summer to meet peak demand and so chances of power cuts have dipped, said a spokesperson for CESC.

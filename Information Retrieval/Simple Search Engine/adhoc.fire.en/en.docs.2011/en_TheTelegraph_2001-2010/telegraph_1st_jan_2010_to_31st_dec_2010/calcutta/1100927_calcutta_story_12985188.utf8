                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Man on cellphone mowed to death
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Lakshman Singh, a 32-year-old house painter, was mowed down by a Sealdah-bound train when he was crossing the tracks in Dum Dum on Sunday afternoon, apparently while listening to music on his cellphone.        
	We spotted Singh lying beside the tracks with a pair of earphones plugged to his ears, said Raju Porel, a witness. According to him, Singh failed to see or hear the approaching train and was hit by the cowcatcher.        
	He was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital where he was declared brought dead.        
	Dum Dum railway police said Singh, a Baranagar resident, was returning home after collecting his card for induction into the Youth Congress.        
	Two college girls trudging along the railway tracks with one of them talking on a cellphone were knocked down by a local train between Birati and New Barrackpore stations last week. A schoolgirl talking on a cellphone was run over the week before near Dum Dum Cantonment station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Landfill in fire zone
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Landfill in fire zone

	An alleged attempt to fill a pond on Topsia Road (South) has united residents in the area in a bid to save it. Water from this pond has helped douse many a fire in Topsia.         
	The pond is the only surviving water body in the locality, said Mohammad Ilyas, a resident who believes that preventing the landfill is imperative since the area is thickly populated and has several rubber and chemical products factories.        
	There are over 70 factories dealing in inflammable products in the area, claimed Ilyas.         
	Officers of the fire services department said most factories in Topsia do not have basic firefighting arrangements. Almost every month, there is a fire in Topsia. A pond proves very useful in fighting a blaze in such a situation, said a fireman.         
	Located just beside Joramazhar on Topsia Main Road (South), the pond has shrunk drastically over the years to just over a bigha, said residents. According to them, land sharks have been dumping waste on the banks to fill up the pond.         
	At present, most of the pond surface is covered in a layer of green scum. Mounds of garbage have been dumped on the bank facing Topsia Road (South).        
	Some residents erected a bamboo fence to restrain people from throwing waste in or around the pond. The attempt, however, proved abortive.        
	You cannot stop people from throwing garbage in the pond. They see that it is never cleaned and so dump their refuse in it readily, said a youth who works in a rubber factory in the area.         
	Despite repeated appeals by residents, the civic authorities have never cleaned the pond.        
	We wrote to local councillor Snehanshu Roy. We also requested Javed Khan, who is the councillor of an adjacent ward, to take necessary action. But nothing has been done so far, said a resident on condition of anonymity.        
	The pond is in the constituency of Hashim Abdul Halim, the Speaker of the state legislative Assembly.         
	Residents recounted at least three occasions when water from the pond was used, both by residents and firefighters, to douse flames in surrounding factories.        
	When a devastating fire broke out at Bani Tyres, a rubber factory, a year and a half ago, water was drawn from the pond to douse the flames, said Mohammad Jaffar, a resident.         
	He cited the instance of another fire, at Kohinoor Rubber on February 6, that was doused with water from the pond.         
	Councillor Roy admitted that there have been attempts to fill up the pond. The pond belongs to a private owner. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) often gets embroiled in legal hassles when it tries to clean up private property, said Roy.         
	The dirty water poses a heath hazard to those living in the vicinity.        
	The water is stagnant. Hence, mosquitoes breed easily in the pond, said Jaffar.         
	The apathy of the civic authorities forced residents to try and clean up the pond several times.        
	We have cleaned the water body several times. But we have not been able to do a good job, said Jaffar.         
	Because of prolonged neglect, the pond used to be covered in hyacinths but we managed to remove the plants, added Jaffar.

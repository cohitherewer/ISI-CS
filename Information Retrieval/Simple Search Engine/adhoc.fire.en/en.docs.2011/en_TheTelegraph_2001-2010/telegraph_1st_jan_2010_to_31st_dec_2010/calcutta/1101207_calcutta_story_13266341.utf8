The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Suicide disrupts Metro
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Suicide disrupts Metro
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Metro services were disrupted for over an hour on Monday afternoon after a man in his 40s committed suicide by jumping in front of a south-bound train at Sovabazar station.        
	Truncated services were run between New Garia (Kavi Subhash) and Central for one-and-a-half-hours since the suicide at 3.38pm. The worst affected were people coming from north. No train left Dum Dum till normal services were restored at 4.53pm, said a Metro official.        
	Commuters from the north had to travel in overcrowded buses that crawled through roads left clogged by rallies.        
	If there isnt a snag, a suicide will disrupt Metro, said a woman in her 20s, who had to get off a train at Shyambazar after the services came to a halt and travel to her office in BBD Bag on a packed minibus.        
	Police said the body had been mutilated beyond recognition. It will be tough to identify the man, said an officer.        
	This was the 22nd suicide on the Metro tracks in 2010.        
	RPF personnel on the platforms are supposed to keep watch on passengers and ensure that no one moves close to the tracks while a train enters a station. The RPF personnel could not stop this man as he moved at the last moment, said an official.

	There is nothing new in the race for political gains among leaders of both the ruling and Opposition parties to win over the fire victims in Tangra (Fire fuels race for political gains, January 22). A similar picture came to light after the No. 4 Basanti Colony in Ultadanga was gutted on January 12.           
	But I wonder how many of these promises are actually fulfilled. The politicians should remember that people need prompt help and proper rehabilitation, not just words.           
	The residents of Basanti Colony had said that their slum had been gutted in 2001 too. Although the affected residents were flooded with promises, nothing happened. Given the situation, hopefully this time the victims will get some relief as the 2011 Assembly polls are drawing near.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee,Behala               Go green: The Shibpur botanical garden. A Telegraph picture               
	Apropos Feast blot on botanic garden January 25, it is a matter of great concern that the world-famous garden is being destroyed by corrupt officials and greedy politicians. In the present case, a real estate player with close links with the CPM organised a wedding reception at the Shibpur greens. Over 2,000 guests were fed, thereby destroying the greenery of the garden. It appears that the only way to protect the garden is to hand over its administration to the army.             
	A.S. Mehta,New Alipore                     
	How the greenery of our city is being blatantly destroyed became clear with the authorities turning a blind eye to a wedding reception held at the Shibpur garden. Open-air chulhas and use of plastic damaged the greens, which include exotic, rare and valuable plants and trees. Those guilty should be brought to book and penalised appropriately for damaging and dirtying Indias most important botanical garden.           
	B.N. Bose, Dum Dum Park                               
	With reference to the report Army sees red over green, February 11, I totally agree with the armys stand of not accepting a littered and mauled Maidan from the CPM, which held a rally on the greens on February 7. I crossed the Maidan the morning after the rally and was appalled to see the sea of plastic and paper strewn all over. In fact, the greens were hardly visible. I feel the army should take a stricter stand and not allow any rallies by any political party on the Maidan. These political parties have scant regard for the law and act only for their own gains. I feel that we, the citizens of this country, have failed in our duties and are wholly responsible for the way politicians are allowed to flout laws.

	Apropos City to host women writers meet, January 21, I was delighted to read that women authors of several Asian countries met in Calcutta for a cultural and intellectual debate. I think such interaction among authors will help unravel unknown facts about our neighbouring countries. I also believe that women authors can play a pivotal role in spreading the message of peace and harmony in the world.

	Apropos the report Reunite my parents, little girl tells judge, January 29, it is amazing to learn that a girl merely nine years old has come to the conclusion that she needs both her parents to live happily. The father filed for divorce and moved criminal cases against the mother while the mother alleged that she was tortured by her husband and in-laws for not bearing a boy. According to a high court order, it is a mothers right to keep her children aged below 14 with her in case of a divorce. Also, it is shameful for a nation that thousands of women are still being tormented by their husbands and in-laws for giving birth to girls. Why dont these people realise that their daughters might one day become scientists, doctors or leaders of states?             
	Sukumar Ghosh,Mukundapur                               
	Apropos the report From Man Friday to most wanted, January 23, it is natural that Joy Krishna Ghosh, the confidante and assistant of Jyoti Basu, struggled to manage time for the numerous condolence meetings he was invited to, to speak on Basu.             
	Jyoti Basu was a statesman whom people not only respected, but also loved. So, after the demise of Basu, people wanted to know more about him. And Ghosh, the shadow of Basu for many years, is the right choice. I would like to request Ghosh to write a book on Jyoti Basu.           
	Sourish Misra, Salt Lake                               
	Apropos Time stands still at station, January 26, we hope the 1926-made big clock at Howrah station has become operational. The historic twin clocks have told the correct time to passengers for so long and witnessed the rendezvous of numerous couples at the station. If the clock could speak, it would tell us memorable anecdotes from the years gone by, tales that are known only to the twin dials.             
	Prahlad Agarwala,Majdia, Nadia                                   
	Apropos Old? Theyre 90 years young, January 15, I would like to mention my father-in-law, Hiron Kumar Mukherjee. A resident of Kalimohan Banerjee Lane, he will complete 93 this month. Hiron Kumar is active, social and full of life. He lives alone in a portion of his ancestral home in south Calcutta after his wife passed away five years back. Staring with milk and a light breakfast in the morning, he takes a lunch of rice, dal, curry, fish and chutney. He loves samosas for his evening snack and parathas at night. The young man of 93 enjoys group tours, social functions and a sumptuous spread.             
	Hiron Kumar take a stroll daily and can even climb stairs. He watches TV and reads newspapers and books. He has braved several surgeries and suffered severe ailments, but recovered from them promptly. He has travelled a lot throughout his life and is always eager for his next trip, even now. His ability to overcome worries and mental shock easily is one of the reasons for his long and active life.

	My grandfather Mohini Mohan Roy is aged 99. He has led an active life throughout till a double fracture on his thigh compromised his mobility recently. His health is otherwise absolutely fine.

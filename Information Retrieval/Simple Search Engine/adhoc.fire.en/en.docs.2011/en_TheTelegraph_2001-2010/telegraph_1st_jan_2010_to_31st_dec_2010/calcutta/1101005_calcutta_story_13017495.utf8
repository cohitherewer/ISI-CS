                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bomb scan on Boeing baggage
  - Passengers of Moscow-Singapore flight grounded in city for 18 hours           A STAFF REPORTER                          A mother and child return to the airport on Monday to board the flight to Singapore after the bomb alert was called off. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                        
	The mid-flight bomb alert that grounded a Moscow-Singapore flight in Calcutta late on Sunday was found to be a false alarm after a bomb squad spent the entire night combing 1,200-plus pieces of luggage.        
	For the 226 passengers of the Singapore Airlines Boeing 777, the unscheduled stopover meant a sleepless night spent in the airport lounge before being shifted to hotels from where they werent allowed to step out.        
	None of the passengers had visas for India, so they were given temporary landing permits. But they were barred from stepping out of the hotels where they had been put up for the night, said an immigration official.        
	The flight, which had landed at the city airport at 11.50pm on Sunday, was grounded for 18 hours before finally getting security clearance to take off for Singapore at 6.46pm on Monday. Four large containers in the aircrafts luggage hold were detained for further scrutiny. They are being kept in the cooling pit as a precautionary measure. They will be observed for 24 hours before being ferried to Singapore, said a senior security official.        
	The aircraft had been moved to the isolation bay and cordoned off by Central Industrial Security Force, police and other security agencies shortly after it landed.         
	The passengers were asked to alight around midnight and escorted to the lounge after manual frisking. Around 4.30am, after all the hand baggage had been scanned , they were taken to various hotels in the city. The scanning continued till around 6.30am. There were around 700 pieces of registered luggage and 500-odd cabin bags, each of which was carefully checked, said an official.                          
	American Dan Wilson, headed for Singapore on business, said he didnt mind the stopover but found the weather very humid.         
	Co-passenger J. Tweedy from Texas said the announcement that the plane would make an emergency landing did create a flutter but nobody pressed the panic button.        
	The Boeing, which received the bomb alert barely one-and-a-half hours after taking off from Moscow, was to have made the emergency landing in Delhi but officials routed it to Calcutta citing security reasons.        
	The crew and the passengers checked into three city hotels early on Monday. Most of the crew stayed at Hyatt Regency. The passengers were put up at the Oberoi Grand and Taj Bengal.

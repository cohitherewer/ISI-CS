The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mayor jigsaw with tactical moves
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mayor jigsaw with tactical moves
                                Sovan Chatterjee                Rafat Javed              Bobby Hakim              Sashi Panja    
	Who will be the next mayor of Calcutta?        
	The mayor will be picked from among the workers in the party, was the only clue dropped by the only person with an answer to the question on Wednesday.        
	When the city went to the polls on Sunday, there were three front-runners in the fray  Sudhangshu Seal for the CPM and Javed Khan and Sovan Chatterjee for the Trinamul Congress.        
	At high noon on Wednesday, two men bit the dust  Seal because of his partys debacle and Khan because of his personal defeat.        
	Last man standing? Sovan Chatterjee, the councillor from 131. But this is no spaghetti western and Mamata Banerjee is hardly known to go by scripts written by others.        
	So who could be Mamatas chosen one?        
	Metro pieced together a list of probables/probabilities with inputs from those close enough to Mamata to hazard a guess  no more  of what she might spring in the next few days.              
	Sovan Chatterjee        
	Who is he? Councillor from ward 131 in Behala. Five-time councillor from ward 132, since the merger of Behala with Calcutta Municipal Corporation in 1984. Also, chairman of Borough XIV. Was mayoral council member (water supply) in the Trinamul-BJP board in 2000-05, that earned him the moniker Jol Sovan.        
	Why him? Mamata loyalist. Knows the corporation. Articulate. Will be a boost for the added areas.        
	Why not him? Resistance to a mayor from added areas. A section of Trinamul in the civic body will be opposed to him. His plan to tax the user for water in Calcutta ran into trouble and was aborted after Mamatas intervention.              
	Bobby Hakim        
	Who is he? Councillor of ward 82 since 2000. An MLA from the Chetla belt. Owns a plastic factory. His community Kali puja at Chetla is big.        
	Why him? Mamata loyalist (oversees disbursement of her MPLAD fund). A borough chairman. A popular figure with no blot on his reputation. May help boost minority votes in Assembly elections.        
	Why not him? The city has not had a Muslim mayor, post-Independence and so there will be opposition. Has never been a mayoral council member. Politically naive. Several Trinamul councillors may object to his elevation.        
	The woman card        
	What is that? With 68 out of 141 wards voting women to power, who could object to the city getting its first woman mayor(ess)?        
	Who could be mayor then? Sashi Panja, the physician daughter-in-law of the late Ajit Panja, is a favourite. Rafat Javed, the wife of Javed Khan and councillor of Ward 66 Topsia, is the dark horse.                
	The team game        
	What is that? Mamata may decide to form a high-powered committee to steer the civic body. It could be called the city development committee and star the likes of Subrata Mukherjee, Partha Chatterjee, Subrata Bakshi, Anup Chatterjee, Javed Khan and others.        
	Who could be mayor then? Anyone non-controversial. Just a de jure figure who is approved (and then run) by the committee.                    BARUN GHOSH AND DEEPANKAR GANGULY

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops to cuff defiant tinderbox owners
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops to cuff defiant tinderbox owners

	Police are a step away from pressing non-bailable charges on the co-owners of two tinderbox buildings in the citys central business district.         
	Mehta Building on Canning Street and 7A Kiran Shankar Roy Road in BBD Bag have been blacklisted after a repeat inspection revealed no effort to implement the safety recommendations made in April by a special team of the police, fire services, CESC and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	Banibrata Basu, the special commissioner of police heading the team that was formed following the Stephen Court tragedy, told Metro that these were the only two among 32 markets and 14 residential-cum-commercial complexes to have completely ignored previous notices.         
	The co-owners are liable for arrest under Section 11C of the West Bengal Fire Services Act of 1950 if they ignore the final notice, to be issued by the fire services department in a day or two. The penalties under Section 11C are imprisonment for up to five years and a fine of up to Rs 50,000.         
	The days of lax vigilance and zero enforcement are over. People need to know that flouting fire norms is a cognisable and non-bailable offence, said an officer at Lalbazar.        
	The list of violations at Mehta Building and 7A Kiran Shankar Roy Road runs long. From labyrinthine interiors with electrical wiring hanging loose to staircases stacked with inflammable goods, danger lurks in every corner of the two buildings.        
	Dipak Sarkar, the deputy director of fire services, said repeated warnings had failed to move the caretakers of the twin tinderboxes. They have not paid any heed to our instructions. Now its our turn to initiate action, he added.        
	But who would the authorities showcause given the complex ownership? Anybody who has a stake in the buildings is responsible and liable for action, an officer said.        
	Preventive FIRs had been filed against the owners and occupiers of Raja Katra, Sadasukh Katra, City Centre (Synagogue Street) and Ganesh Market in the central business district in mid-April for failing to implement the safety recommendations made after the Nandram blaze in 2008.        
	A recent inspection, however, showed that all four markets had since initiated steps to minimise the risk of fire, the police said.

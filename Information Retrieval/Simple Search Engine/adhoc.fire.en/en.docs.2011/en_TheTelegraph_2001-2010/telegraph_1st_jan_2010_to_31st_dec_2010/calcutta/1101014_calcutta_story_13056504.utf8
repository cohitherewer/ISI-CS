The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Happy to be here with Ma Durga   A different face, a different energy
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Happy to be here with Ma Durga                                             
	Sujoy Ghosh had offered me Kahaani two years back. But its finally happening now. Now when Ma Durga is in town. When I first realised that, I was ecstatic.         
	Durga Puja and I have had a strange connection. I did a commercial with Soumitra Chatterjee and Madhabi Mukherjee in Calcutta which had Puja as the backdrop. The ad is very special to me because I always consider it as the closest I got to working with (Satyajit) Ray, because Soumitrada and Madhabidi were his favourite actors.        
	Then I shot for the Durga Puja sequence in Parineeta which had Sanjay Dutt dancing with the dhunuchi. That too was a set, a recreation of Durga Puja.        
	So, even though I have been part of Durga Puja settings and sequences, I have never been actually here during Puja. Naturally, I am very excited that Kahaani is happening during this festive time.         
	In fact, we started our shooting at Kumartuli. That was wonderful! I had heard of Kumartuli from Sujoy and I had also seen pictures. But to actually be there and see so many Durga thakurs all placed one after the other it was breathtaking!                    
	So many colours, so many shapes the way they were getting the maati ready and the way they were beautifully carving those faces. It was stunning!        
	I think Calcutta lends itself to a lot of texture but the city takes on a different face altogether during Puja. Even the people in the city have a different energy about them. Just to give you an example, there is this really small Bengali girl in our unit and the way she has been commanding the traffic the last few days bah! You just feel like Ma Durga is actually out on the streets!        
	But I have had very little time for myself. I havent even visited Kalighat yet, which I love doing the moment I step into Calcutta. I just hope that we dont shoot too much on the Puja days and those days turn out to be lighter.        
	Then I am also worried about the traffic on the streets. After shooting at actual locations in the city, I have realised that the crowds are unmanageable. Its wonderful to experience that kind of love and warmth but there are so many people!        
	Calcutta is very, very affectionate towards me but I hope they let me go and experience Durga Puja.        
	(As told to Pratim D. Gupta)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rally blues for Xmas mood
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rally blues for Xmas mood
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Santa Claus may yet beat the snow in Europe but he sure will struggle to get past the rally raj in the heart of Calcutta.        
	Christmas shopping was the casualty for the third successive day with rush-hour traffic from north to south on Wednesday caught in the swirl of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees salute to CPM-affiliated primary schoolteachers for defeating Trinamul in the district council elections.        
	As if the rally at Metro Channel with barely 48 hours to go for Christmas Eve werent disruptive enough, a DYFI procession from Joka to Metro Bhavan on Park Street defeated those who dared to step out for some festive buying in and around New Market.        
	Chinese restaurant owner Chang, 83, couldnt help harking back to a more cultured era when politicians would spare at least the festive season.         
	The political leadership, irrespective of which party they belong to, must sit down and take a decision not to hold rallies in the run-up to festivals. So many people are being inconvenienced, dont they realise that? demanded the octogenarian, who has been visiting New Market ahead of Christmas for years.        
	Ironically, a conference on tourism, heritage and hospitality was being inaugurated at the Oberoi Grand by governor M.K. Narayanan even as chief minister Bhattacharjees dais for disruption was being built at Metro Channel in the morning.        
	Most speakers at the conference harped on the need to promote Bengal as a tourist destination with a special session being dedicated to tourism opportunities along the citys riverfront.         
	But would tourists visit a city now more infamous for rallies than famous for its hospitality and heritage? There is a perception among outsiders that Calcutta is a city of rallies and roadblocks. They do ask such questions before coming to Calcutta, admitted Rajeev Singh, the director general of the Indian Chamber of Commerce, the organisers of the conference.        
	Though tourist traffic has not been affected, we could have done better without such weekday rallies, added Singh.         
	Try telling that to Mamata Banerjee, who is set to address a Trinamul Youth Congress rally at Metro Channel from 1pm on Thursday.         
	On Wednesday, every road leading to New Market was choked through the afternoon. Cars stood bumper to bumper along Bertram Street and Lindsay Street, hoping to hit Free School Street to avoid getting stranded on Chowringhee Road, only to be caught in worse snarls.         
	Sister Shanti, who works with Daughters of the Cross in Kidderpore, said she had come to New Market despite the chaos because its Christmas. There is so much of joy and vibrancy inside New Market at this time of the year. Its a pity that the scene outside is the opposite with loudspeakers blaring and drivers of stranded vehicles honking, she added.        
	With even fringe groups like the Jharkhand Disam Party lining up rallies  Metro Channel and Rani Rashmoni Avenue are booked till at least December 29  traffic disruption could get worse over the next few days, warn police.        
	Only 150 people managed to cripple traffic today by blocking an entire flank of JL Nehru Road near Metro Bhavan, said an officer of the DYFI procession.        
	While Metro Channel was shut between noon and 5pm for the left Front rally starring the chief minister, the DYFI march that had started at the 3A bus stand in Thakurpukur reached the city centre just as the meeting was winding up.        
	The blocked flank could be thrown open to traffic only at 5.45pm. It was a tough day for us and tomorrow could be worse, the police officer said.

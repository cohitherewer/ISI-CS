	Mark your midweek. A fashion feast featuring Bollywoods favourite designer Manish Malhotra and Calcuttas landmark label Monapali is set to storm the city.        
	The date: August 12. The event: KKN Group of Companies presents Marriage n Vogue at The Telegraph Weddings 2010 in association with Seagrams Blenders Pride. The venue: The Pala at ITC The Sonar. The time: 8.30pm-plus.        
	What makes the show special is the wedding theme but what makes the show doubly special is the designers Calcutta connection. I love Calcutta. And I am very happy to be a part of the show, Manish Malhotra told Metro, on the eve of his second stint with Marriage n Vogue.        
	Designer duo Mona and Pali, with their signature address on Loudon Street, echoed the sentiment: It feels great to be part of The Telegraph Marriage n Vogue, more so because it is Calcutta, our home, our base.        
	Both will showcase their latest bridal look on Thursday night.                          
	Manish plays on his signature tradition-meets-trend mood board, while Monapali return to nature. My line is for the bride of 2010. She knows her mind, she knows her colours and she knows her style, elaborates Manish, who had last come to town in May for a host of t2 events.        
	The Monapali collection is all organic and ethnic. It pays an ode to craftsmanship in India, they say.                        CITY LIGHTS: Mona and Pali with showstopper Minissha Lamba at Kolkata Fashion Week last year

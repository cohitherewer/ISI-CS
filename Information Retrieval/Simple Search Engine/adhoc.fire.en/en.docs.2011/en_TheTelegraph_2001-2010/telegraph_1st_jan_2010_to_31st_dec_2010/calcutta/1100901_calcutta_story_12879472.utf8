                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Lawyers strike to protest arrest
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	High court lawyers struck work on Tuesday to protest the unlawful arrest of a murder accused from the Beleghata premises of a colleague.        
	Rahima Bibi, a 39-year-old who was wanted in connection with a clash at Canning in South 24-Parganas that killed four persons, was picked up from the waiting area outside Sekhar Basus chamber on Sura East Road around 8pm on Monday.        
	The woman was arrested when she came to consult me about her anticipatory bail plea. According to a Supreme Court ruling, women cannot be arrested after sunset and women cops must be present in a team arresting a woman. Both rules were violated, said Basu on Tuesday.         
	Some Calcutta High Court Bar Association members met on Tuesday morning and decided on the ceasework to protest the manner of the arrest. According to them, the police do not have the right to arrest an accused while he is visiting a lawyer.         
	Cases were not heard in the high court on Tuesday because of the strike. In 1995, the apex court had banned strikes or ceasework by lawyers.        
	Among the 18 accused in the case, only Rahima was absconding. She is a proclaimed offender. On Monday, we got a tip-off that she was going to meet a lawyer in Calcutta. Our team was waiting outside Sekhar Basus chamber, said a senior officer of South 24-Parganas police. We arrested her after she came out of the building, added the officer.        
	Basus junior Rajdeep Majumdar had lodged a complaint with Beleghata police station about the incident on Monday night. Bar association general secretary Rana Mukherjee said: We will move a case against the police on Thursday.        
	A section of high court lawyers condemned the police action and the ceasework. It would have been better had the lawyers requested the chief justice to take up the matter (of unlawful arrest). Many of us are against ceasework in court, said public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami.

  - Lawyers cease work, police claim hands-free eviction          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                    
	Courtroom paralysis preceded the transport strike with 202 courts across the state caught up in protest over 30 lawyers of Calcutta High Court being forcibly evicted from a room on Thursday.        
	Around 26,000 lawyers observed ceasework on Friday and the Bar Association of Calcutta High Court declared in the afternoon that it would continue its court boycott if Chief Justice M.S. Shah and registrar general M.P. Srivastava were not removed from their posts.        
	Coincidentally, within an hour of the threat, the Supreme Courts order transferring the chief justice to Bombay High Court arrived. The transfer was fixed earlier and it just happened to arrive on Friday, clarified a senior officer of the high court.        
	Following the chief justices transfer  which the lawyers claimed as a partial victory  the protesters trained their guns on the courts registrar general who had called in the cops on Thursday. Until he is removed from the post, our agitation will continue, said Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, the associations vice-president.        
	The police clarified on Friday that they had received a faxed letter from registrar general Srivastava seeking help to evict the agitating lawyers if required by force.        
	The police force was sent under direction from the high court and no force was used in the eviction process, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police, headquarters. We have video-graphed the proceedings.        
	On Thursday, about 30 young lawyers including 12 women occupied a room on the second floor of the high court building that the authorities had decided to turn into the office for assistant registrars. The lawyers refused to vacate the room till they were given a room to sit in. Late on Thursday, the police were called in to enter the room and evict the protesters.        
	This was the first time in the history of Calcutta High Court that the police were used to remove lawyers from a courtroom, said Uttam Majumdar, a former president of the association.        
	On Friday, the lawyers raised slogans, smashed a glass pane, ransacked a courtroom and heckled city police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, forcing him to retreat into a room adjacent to the chief justices chamber.         
	Trinamul Congress MLA and leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee was in the thick of Fridays protests.

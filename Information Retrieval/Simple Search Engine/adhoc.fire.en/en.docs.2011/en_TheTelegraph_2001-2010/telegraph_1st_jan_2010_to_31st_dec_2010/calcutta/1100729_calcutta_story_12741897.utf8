The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Arrest order for civic head
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Arrest order for civic head
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday ordered the arrest of the Barrackpore municipality chairman after he failed to appear in a case related to alleged illegal construction within a housing complex.        
	Justice Debasish Kargupta asked the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police to produce Uttam Das before him on August 11. This was the second time Das ignored the courts order to appear in the hearing of the case.        
	Das became chairman after the Trinamul Congress wrested the municipality from the Left Front in the May 30 polls. Ill tell the court that I was not involved in the construction, which happened during the tenure of the previous board, Das later told Metro.        
	Justice Karguptas order followed a petition by 12 residents of Anandapali, a housing complex in Barrackpore, accusing developer R.C. Patel of setting up illegal structures on their premises with backing from the municipality.        
	The petitioners lawyer said the developer had built shops and other structures in violation of the sanctioned building plan that was handed over to the residents. The promoter claimed that the structures had been allowed in the revised plan, which the residents were apparently unaware of.        
	Following their petition, the judge had asked the chairman to appear with all documents on July 14. But he did not turn up, prompting the judge to issue another order, asking Das to appear on Wednesday.

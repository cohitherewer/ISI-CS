	Seven persons were arrested with illegal arms and ammunition in pre-civic poll raids in the city since Sunday night.        
	In Metiabruz, a man was killed and two others were injured while making bombs, which, police suspect, would have been used during the May 30 civic elections.        
	We will continue the drive to ensure peaceful elections. Our aim will be to seize arms and ammunition as much as possible and arrest culprits, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	Five of the arrested were held in an early morning swoop.        
	Sanjay Yadav was picked up from his Rupnarayan Nandan Lane residence. A firearm was found on him. Yadav had been arrested earlier too, said an officer.        
	Another team arrested Mriganka Das and Dipak Das from their Pottery Road house and seized some arms and ammunition.        
	At Tangra, arms and ammunition were found in the houses of Shantanu Makal and Manoj Lal, who were arrested.        
	Raja and Aslam were arrested in Narkeldanga and four pipe guns, a revolver and several rounds of cartridges were found on them.        
	Altogether, seven firearms and 34 cartridges were seized in the raids.        
	At Dewan Bagan, Mohammed Ataullah, 28, and two others were injured when a bomb they were making exploded.        
	They were taken to SSKM Hospital, where Ataullah was declared dead and the other two were admitted in a critical condition.

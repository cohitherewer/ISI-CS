  - After London, Ananda Utsav off to Hollywood in September          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          Beth A. Payne with Usha Uthup at the unveiling of the Los Angeles Ananda Utsav on Friday. (Rashbehari Das)                                        
	After the ilish surfaced in the Thames this spring, Hollywood will get to squeeze the rosogolla this autumn. After conquering London in March, the Ananda Utsav bandwagon takes Bangaliana to Los Angeles in September.        
	The details of the Anandabazar Patrika presents KKN Los Angeles Ananda Utsav 2010 were unveiled on Friday afternoon with US consul general Beth A. Payne as chief guest. The City of Joy will come to the City of Angels, smiled Payne, adding that not just the Bengalis in the US, the festival should attract a lot of Americans, those who are fascinated about Bengali culture, arts and food.        
	Come September 4, the Pasadena Convention Center, nine miles north-east of downtown Los Angeles, will host the three-day Bengali festivities. It was at the Civic Auditorium here that Michael Jackson had first performed the moonwalk in public to his chartbuster Billie Jean! The 55,000sq ft Exhibit Hall with 4,000 seats will be the venue for the Los Angeles Ananda Utsav.                          
	As far as the performances go, the festival will feature a mix of the best from Bengal  from both sides of the border  and the rest of India, from Usha Uthup and Anjan Dutt, Rezwana Choudhury Bannya and Ayub Bachchu, to Ustad Amjad Ali Khan and his sons Amaan and Ayaan.        
	Sharmila Tagore and daughter Soha Ali Khan will reprise their Robi O Radha act (an adaptation of Rabindranath Tagores Bhanushingher Padabali) while Sunidhi Chauhan and Hariharan will be the Bolly biggies. Gautam Halder will stage Michael Madhusudan Dutts Meghnadbadh Kabya and Sohag Sen will put up Mahesh Elkunchwars Sonata. Mir and Churni Ganguly will be hosting the three-day festivities.        
	As we saw in London, an event like this always stirs up nostalgia among the local Bengalis, said Usha. Anjan added: A place like Los Angeles is much more up to date; you cannot just sing Bela Bose and Ranjana and get away. When I performed there, I found the city to be culturally more stimulating than most other venues in America.        
	Los Angeles has around 2,000 of the 30,000 Bengali and Bangladeshi families living in the US. Apart from the performances, there will be an exhibition with shopping opportunities plus Bengali food stalls. Season tickets and day tickets can be bought through www.usanandautsav.com.        
	The response has been very good with one-third of the tickets already sold out... We expect things to get bigger and busier from here on, said Kausshik Kumar Nath, the managing director of KKN Group of Companies, the title sponsor. Tower Group and Techno India Group are the associate sponsors.

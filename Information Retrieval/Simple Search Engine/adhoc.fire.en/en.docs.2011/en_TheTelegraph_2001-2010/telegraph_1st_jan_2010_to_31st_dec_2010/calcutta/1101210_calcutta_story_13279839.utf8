The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plexes in court to buck levy
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Plexes in court to buck levy
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The six multiplex operators in the state moved the high court on Thursday, challenging the Eastern India Motion Pictures Associations (EIMPA) decision to pocket a yearly levy of Rs 25,000 per screen from them.        
	The petitioners said the decision was discriminatory because the annual levy for a standalone hall was Rs 5,000.        
	The court asked the multiplex owners to abide by the associations decision till further orders. The association can spend 25 per cent of the money you are paying. The rest will have to be kept aside till the disposal of the case, said Justice S. Banerjee.        
	Hours after the order was passed, the plex owners moved an appeal before a division bench, which upheld the order with a slight modification. The plexes will have the liberty not to pay the levy but EIMPA will also have the right to take action against the defaulters, the bench ruled.        
	Justice Banerjee will hear the case again after 15 days.        
	There are 10 multiplexes in the city and six more in the districts. Of the 655 single-screen halls in the state, more than 350 have closed down. We moved court because we wanted EIMPA to justify its decision, said a plex official.        
	EIMPA lawyer Kallol Guhathakurta said the plexes were charged a higher levy because they earned more than standalone halls.        
	The lawyer said the voting rights of the plex owners during the EIMPA election could be curbed if they refused to pay the enhanced levy. Moreover, films can now be shown in halls only with EIMPAs approval. If EIMPA blacklists a hall, how will it screen films?

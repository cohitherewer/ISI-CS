                      An inner journey                     Tagore had a restless creative energy, experimenting theatrically at all times. As part of Vodafones Odeon 2010, in association with t2, Jadavpur University Department of English (JUDE) will stage Tagores Arup Ratan (Formless Jewel) this evening. In order to retain the inventive spirit in the production, director Professor Ananda Lal deliberately avoided the usual Rabindrik style. Instead, he chose the final performance text for Arup Ratan, convinced that it came closest to Tagores goal  his last version of the Buddhist legend of Raja that preoccupied him from 1910 to 1935. It is a spiritual allegory that Lal has interpreted for the contemporary sceptical audiences. Although it shows a womans journey from the exterior to the interior, because it is so totally unlike modern drama, ordinary theatregoers may find its symbolism and manner strange and difficult to comprehend. But that is the challenge Tagore throws out to all: life itself is difficult to comprehend, so why should art be any different? The production is multilingual, mainly in Bengali, but also using English and some dialogues in other languages. The production is dedicated to Professor P. Lal, who passed away recently.                   Event: Arup Ratan  a multi-lingual play When: Today at 7.30 pm Where: Gyan Manch

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Abode of books braces for assault
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Abode of books braces for assault
  - Jail workers ready to invade, library director in the dark about politics          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          A banner announcing the convention at National Library. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                        
	National Library is set to become a prisoner of politics barely three months after earning freedom from the election army.        
	Jail employees from across the state will converge on the abode of books on February 20 for the 18th convention of the Paschim Banga Kararakshi Samity, affiliated to the Revolutionary Socialist Party.        
	Pressure from the Left Front allegedly forced the authorities to grant permission for the assault on the Alipore premises that was ravaged by the Election Commission last year despite a campaign launched by readers and Metro.        
	Director K.K. Banerjee said the organisers of the conference did seek his permission to use the auditorium at National Library, the countrys largest, but didnt tell him it would be a political programme. I didnt know it would be a political programmeWe wont allow the programme to be held if it inconveniences readers, he told Metro on Sunday.        
	Over 300 jail employees from 54 jails are scheduled to attend the convention from 9am till 6pm. The programme will surely inconvenience readers because Bhasha Bhawan, where the auditorium is located, also houses the reading room, said a library official.         
	The library, which stands on a 30-acre plot with manicured lawns and flower beds, attracts around 400 readers a day. Regulars at the reading room said the two ministers scheduled to attend the convention needed to learn from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who had apologised for attending a business meet on the premises in 2005.        
	Jail minister Bishwanath Chowdhury claimed to be unaware that the convention would be held on the National Library premises. So would he attend the conference? Yes, I will. But I need to find out about the venue first, he said.        
	Its unfair that a trade union affiliated to a Left Front constituent has organised a convention in the librarys auditorium despite knowing that it will affect readers. The library is meant for academic activities, not for nonsense like this, said teacher Bimal Sarkar Nanda, who has been a regular visitor for three decades.        
	National Library is not Brigade Parade Ground, added Saibal Chakraborty, the general secretary of the librarys staff association.

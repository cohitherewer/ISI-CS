                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Family comes home in hearses
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          Neighbours pay their respects to the Mukherjees at a park in Bijoygarh on Friday. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	Two rope swings hung desolately on the second-floor balcony of Joydeep Mukherjees home as four hearses containing the bodies of his entire family reached the three-storeyed building on Bijoygarh Road on Friday afternoon.         
	Only yesterday I saw him (Joydeep) sitting on that swing with his three-year-old daughter on his lap, sobbed neighbour Shelly Majumder.         
	Joydeep, fondly called Babua, died in a road accident in Bagnan, Howrah, on Thursday evening along with three members of his family and two others.         
	Mukherjees brand new blue Maruti 800 was crushed under a trailer, killing him, his wife Monima, sister Joyita, daughter Arogna (Sonama), domestic help Kalpana Nayek and driver Tarak Sarkar.         
	On Friday afternoon, almost the entire locality gathered at Netaji Sishu Udyan in Bijoygarh, where the bodies of the family and the driver were kept before being taken for cremation. Kalpanas body was sent to her home in East Midnapore.         
	Neighbours and friends spoke of Joydeep as a fun-loving and helpful person. He was crazy about cricket. He played quite well too. He set off for Digha on Thursday after failing to get tickets for the Kolkata Knight Riders match at the Eden Gardens. Had he got the tickets, he would not have left for the trip, said Samar Sarkar, Joydeeps friend.        
	He had already purchased tickets for Sundays KKR match against Kings XI Punjab, Samar added. Joydeep ran a grille manufacturing unit on the ground floor of the building and had bought the car just a week back.         
	Joydeeps uncle Manabendra Mukherjee accused police of failing to save Joydeeps daughter. We have learnt that Arogna was still alive after the accident but while the crane was pulling the car from under the trailer, the chain loosened and the car crashed to the ground, killing the little girl, Manabendra said.

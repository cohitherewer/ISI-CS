The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wrong U-turn topples Seth car
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wrong U-turn topples Seth car
  - CPM strongman escapes injury, his driver spared arrest on Red Road          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Scorpio involved in the mishap. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                        
	A speeding Scorpio carrying CPM strongman Lakshman Seth and trying to take a forbidden U-turn on Red Road came in the way of a bus and landed on its side during the Monday morning rush hour.        
	Police rescued Seth, who was rattled but unhurt, along with two of his aides and the injured driver from the grey-and-silver SUV within minutes of the accident in front of Fort William at 10.45am. They then put them in another Scorpio that was following the CPM leader, witnesses said.        
	The mishap could have been far more serious had the driver of a state bus speeding down the right side of the north-bound flank not slammed the brakes when Seths Scorpio suddenly switched lanes to take the U-turn 10-15 metres before the JK Island crossing. Witnesses said the bus hit the side of the Scorpio, causing it to topple over.        
	An officer on duty said he and his colleagues came to know that the car involved in the accident (WB 30F 9696) was a VIP vehicle only after a bystander told them that Seth was among the trapped passengers. We immediately pulled everyone out. We then offered to take them to SSKM Hospital but Seth insisted that he was fine and that he would get his driver treated elsewhere, the officer added.        
	Maidan police station filed a motor collision case instead of one involving rash and negligent driving by Scorpio driver Sheikh Osman Ali. We can act against him only if the CSTC (which owns bus number WB04C 9955) files a complaint, the officer said.         
	But what about Osman violating rules to take a wrong  and dangerous  U-turn? Please ask officers of the local police station, deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Bandyopadhyay told Metro.        
	A driver taking a prohibited U-turn on a thoroughfare as busy and accident-prone as Red Road is liable to be booked under Section 279 of the IPC, which carries a maximum of six months in jail or a fine of Rs 1,000, or both.        
	Osman claimed he took the wrong U-turn without knowing it was banned. His boss declined comment on who was at fault. Accidents occur because of human error. The matter is being investigated. Luckily, my driver escaped with a minor leg injury, said Seth.

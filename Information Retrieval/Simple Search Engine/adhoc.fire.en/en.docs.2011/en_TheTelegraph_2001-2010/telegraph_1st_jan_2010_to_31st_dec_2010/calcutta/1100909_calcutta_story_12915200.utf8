  - Vets report rush of dog cases with high temperature and loss of appetite          POULOMI BANERJEE                                                  
	Five-month-old Roxys mom Piya is breathing easy after a week of viral woe.        
	Hes a bundle of energy and drives me crazy with his antics, but last Thursday he was droopy and listless, she recounts. Next day, he refused to eat. On Saturday morning, he threw up, was running a temperature and just couldnt get up. I panicked and rushed him to the clinic where I was told that this was a viral attack happening to many like Roxy. He was put on saline and medication and is much better now.        
	Piya is a 36-year-old finance executive and Roxy her adorable Labrador pup.        
	The viral attack in question is robbing many dogs of their woof and wag and giving their parents sleepless nights.        
	Roxys is among 60-70 such cases that veterinary physician Aparajita Chakraborty has treated in a month. Dogs do tend to be ill when the weather changes, but this time I have seen an unprecedented rise in the number of viral infections in dogs. In acute cases, dogs are dying if not treated in time, she warned.        
	The symptoms are lack of appetite, severe panting, vomiting, blood in the stool and a temperature. The temperature may suddenly shoot up to 104 degrees or more, said veterinary physician and t2 columnist Goutam Mukherjee who has treated more than 15 such cases in recent weeks.        
	This is the first time that I have seen this kind of an illness in dogs. Alsatians, Labradors and Pugs are the most common victims, he added. In two instances, Mukherjee laments, the dogs couldnt be saved, because they were brought in too late.                          
	Francisca Vincent has her fingers crossed over the condition of her 30-month-old Dachshund, Lucy. She started refusing food four days back. Then, she threw up. When I took her to the vet, she was immediately put on saline. She is now on medication and is not refusing food anymore, said an anxious Vincent on Wednesday.        
	The infection-causing virus is yet to be detected. Different medicines are working with different dogs, so we cant say which particular virus is causing the illness, explained Mukherjee.        
	But Aparajita Chakraborty blames weather changes in the monsoon weeks as one of the factors.        
	Preventive measures include not taking the dogs out frequently in this weather and monitoring their diet to ensure that they are eating healthy.        
	Call your doctor as soon as you find that your dog is ill. If he is running a temperature, then just give him a paracetamol and a shower to bring down the temperature and call the doctor, cautions Mukherjee.        
	Vets stress the need for dog owners to be alert and aware till this viral wave passes.

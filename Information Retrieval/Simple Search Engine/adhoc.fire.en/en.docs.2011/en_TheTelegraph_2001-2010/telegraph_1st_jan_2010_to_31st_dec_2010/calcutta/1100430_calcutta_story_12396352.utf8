  - Flurys to reopen after 38 days followed by other food n fun stops          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          LET THERE BE LIGHT: Flurys and Music World aglow at Stephen Court on Thursday evening. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)				                                       
	The pink and mauve glow signs flickered back to life on Thursday evening, after 38 dismal nights at Stephen Court.        
	I was walking down the opposite pavement when the pink of Flurys and the mauve of Music World came aglow. It was like the return of hope to Park Street, said Rashmi Sen, 33, a Park Street addict.        
	We are delighted to have the power connection back and we will reopen Flurys for lunch at 1pm on Friday, said Anirban Simlai, the unit head of The Park hotel, which operates the landmark tearoom premises.        
	The commercial establishments which are housed on the ground floor of Stephen Court have been properly inspected after corrective measures were taken. We restored their power supply after they submitted the risk bonds. We can do the same for at least 15 residential apartments if the owners submit risk bonds likewise, said the CESC executive director, Dilip Sen.        
	Six out of 16 flat-owners of blocks III and IV  untouched by the March 23 blaze  submitted copies of the risk bonds with court notification on Thursday.        
	Flurys will be first off the blocks on Friday, followed by Music World. We hope to reopen in the second half of Friday or latest by Saturday morning, said an official of Music World. Peter Cat fans will have to wait a few more days for the Cello Kebabs. We want to ensure proper hygiene and cleanliness before we lay our tables if not by the weekend, then early next week, said owner Nitin Kothari.        
	Also in line are Jet Airways, One Step Up and Silver Grill. Electricity has been restored. We will visit the office on Friday and take a call on when operations can be shifted, said a Jet Airways official.

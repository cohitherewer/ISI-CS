The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Monsoon countdown
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Monsoon countdown
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A few spells of rain on Friday afternoon brought respite from the swelter but the relief which would come with the monsoon is still at least three days away.        
	Thursdays showers began around 2.30pm and continued in spells till 5.30pm.        
	G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore, said: We dont expect the monsoon to reach south Bengal before another three to four days.        
	The northern limit of the monsoon now passes through Mumbai, Hyderabad, Agartala and Gangtok. The eastern end of the monsoon line would move freely once the low-pressure area over the west-central Bay moves towards the Andhra coast. That is likely to happen in another three days or so, said a Met official.

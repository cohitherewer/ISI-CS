          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Md Wazid and Md Raza, alleged aides of extortionist Zafar Siddiqui alias Gudda, were arrested in Howrah and Watgunge, respectively, on Thursday.        
	Wazid offered shelter to Gudda after he walked out of jail on bail a month ago. Raza used to help Gudda collect money from the families of those he kidnapped, said Damayanti Sen, the joint police commissioner (crime).         
	Gudda and his friend Shabnam Begum walked into a trap laid by the police in a central Calcutta hotel on September 12. The 35-year-old has been accused of kidnapping two traders while he was out on bail.        
	Unless Wazid and Raza were arrested, they would have gone around extorting money in Guddas name, said a senior officer of the detective department.         
	Wazid had allegedly offered Gudda shelter after he kidnapped Seikh Aslam from Tiljala Road, kept him in a Sonarpur house and moved to Howrah.        
	Raza had allegedly played a vital role in the abduction of Md Asmat from Watgunge Street in end-August.         
	Gudda used to pay Wazid and Raza handsomely. Neither of the two could contact the extortionist. When Gudda wanted to get in touch with them, he would call them from a PCO, the officer added.

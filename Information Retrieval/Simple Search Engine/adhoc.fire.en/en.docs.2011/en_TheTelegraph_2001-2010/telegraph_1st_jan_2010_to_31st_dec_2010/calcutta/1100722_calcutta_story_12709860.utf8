The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mamata army rips divider   Rally that rips, repairs
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mamata army rips divider   Rally that rips, repairs
          SANJOY CHATTOPADHYAYA                                    RIP amp; REPAIR for rally: The road divider was yanked off (top) on Tuesday and a makeshift one was put back on Wednesday. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Chardike camera, keu dushtumi korar cheshta korben na  Mamata Banerjee urging her army not to do anything naughty on Wednesday as they were being watched.        
	But when the cameras were not looking on Tuesday night, her army had ripped off a long strip of road median divider, from the Esplanade crossing to Mamatas stage in front of Victoria House, an act that qualifies as criminal rather than naughty.        
	The metal divider, more than 60 feet long, is a vital device for traffic management and pedestrian safety on the busy Esplanade stretch that links Central Avenue and Bentinck Street. But it was nonchalantly sacrificed at the altar of the martyrs day rally.        
	Around 10pm on Tuesday, a senior official of the Calcutta traffic police noticed some youths at work on the divider. They were armed with a hammer and gas-cutter, yanking off a portion of the divider. In my two decades of duty, never have I seen a political rally resorting to such an act of deliberate vandalism, said the cop, who alerted his seniors.        
	A Trinamul leader supervising the pre-rally arrangements was brazen when police demanded an explanation.                    
	He said it was being done with the CMCs permission to make space for Mamatas supporters and that the divider would be installed as soon as the rally got over, said the cop.        
	But the dividers had been erected by the police and the Trinamul-run civic body can merely request permission to bring them down in public (not political) interest. No permission was sought.        
	After the giant rally, Trinamul leader and key organiser Subrata Bakshi told Metro: We had appealed to the CMC and they gave us the permission. Our men are already on the job and the dividers will soon be back.        
	But police officials said the divider being put back by the Trinamul was a makeshift one, merely welded together and not dug deep or sealed, which could easily be knocked down by vehicles or vandals.        
	Till late on Wednesday no complaint had been lodged for the blatant violation. Who would dare incur the wrath of Mamata Banerjee? said a source in Lalbazar.

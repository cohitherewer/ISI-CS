The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Long vigil for Leh tourists
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Long vigil for Leh tourists
          SANJAY MANDAL AND ROMILA SAHA                                              quot;We are safe in our hotel but possibly stuck for at least two more days quot;
  Reshu (top) and   Rakesh Binaykia      
	Ma, the weather is excellent here and everything is so breathtakingly beautiful we are having a great time.         
	In her minds eye, Shanta Baid had conjured up Technicolor images of azure blue skies, snow-capped peaks and glacial lakes glistening in the sun as daughter Reshu described the last stop on her holiday over the phone on Wednesday night.        
	Little did the 54-year-old know that in less than 48 hours she would be sitting in front of the TV at her Park Street residence watching horror images from those very hills and praying for her daughter and son-in-laws safety.        
	Shanta was beginning to fear the worst after seeing the cloudburst-triggered devastation of Leh when the phone rang around 10am, this time with good news. It was her son-in-law Rakesh Binaykia.        
	 We are safe in our hotel but possibly stuck for at least two more days. Please dont worry, was all that the 29-year-old managed to say before the line went blank.        
	Till late on Friday night, Rakesh couldnt be reached again on his cellphone or the landline of the hotel.         
	Rakesh, a doctor, and wife Reshu, a software professional, had reached Leh on Tuesday with two other Calcutta couples. They were to take a Leh-Delhi flight on Saturday and return to the city on Sunday.        
	The Binaykias, accompanied by friends Rohit Banka, Mani Jain and their wives, had left the city on July 27 and visited Shimla and Kullu-Manali before capping their Himalayan holiday with a trip to Leh.         
	A relieved Shanta said on Friday afternoon she wouldnt have known about the cloudburst had daughter-in-law Jaya, a bank executive in Visakhapatnam, not called in the morning and asked her to switch on the TV. She immediately contacted Rakeshs parents, who also didnt know then whether their son and daughter-in-law were safe.        
	We are now awaiting a call from them to know when they are coming back, Shanta told Metro.        
	Elsewhere in the city, family members of seven LIC employees from the city spent the day anxiously waiting to hear from them but none of them could be contacted.         
	 Maybe they are stranded on the Manali-Leh road, said Deepak Banik, the brother of group member Apurba Banik.         
	Two city cops visiting Leh  inspector P. Shome and the additional officer-in-charge of Park Street police station, Amit Rakshit  were initially reported missing but traced to their hotel, joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim confirmed.        
	A team from the Howrah District Mountaineers and Trekkers Association was stranded at Kaja, in Lahaul-Spiti district, after scaling Mt Manirang in Himachal Pradesh.         
	The road to Manali is blocked by landslides. We have been told it wont be cleared in the next four days. We have already exceeded our budget, team member Kiran Mukherjee told Metro over phone.        
	A group from the city-based Himalayan Club on an expedition to Mamostong Kangri ran into heavy snowfall on the way to the peak. They are now waiting for the weather to clear, said a member of the club.        
	June to September is the tourist season in Ladakh. According to travel agents, 45,000 tourists from eastern India visit the district every year. The number of tourists has been growing every year with adventure sports becoming popular, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.         
	So would the cloudburst disaster prompt the Ladakh-bound Calcuttan to change his puja travel plans?         
	We dont have so many bookings yet that we need to worry about cancellations. Ladakh is still a niche destination that not everyone can afford. A seven-day package for Srinagar and Leh would cost around Rs 22,000 per person, excluding air fare, insurance and medical evacuation, said a tour operator.

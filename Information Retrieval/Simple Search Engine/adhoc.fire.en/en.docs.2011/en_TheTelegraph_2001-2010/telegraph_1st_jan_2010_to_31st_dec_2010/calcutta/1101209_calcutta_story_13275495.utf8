The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Prod for JU seat hike
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Prod for JU seat hike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A UGC team on Wednesday urged Jadavpur University to increase its student intake in both undergraduate and postgraduate courses.        
	The five-member team, headed by UGC vice-chairman Ved Prakash, was on a three-day tour of inspection of the campus to decide whether the centre of excellence tag awarded to JU six years ago could be renewed. The tenure of the tag ends this year.        
	The recommendation is in tune with the Centres policy to increase the gross enrolment in higher education from 12 to 15 per cent of the population in the age group of 18 to 24 years by 2011-12.        
	The gross enrolment ratio is lesser in India compared with developed countries. Our universities need to develop their infrastructure to accommodate more students. We have suggested to all universities, including JU, to explore ways to increase the number of seats in various courses, said Prakash.        
	JU now has around 8,000 students. It is difficult to increase the number of seats but we will consider the UGC suggestion, said vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh.        
	The team expressed satisfaction over JUs performance in implementing the projects it had proposed while applying for the centre of excellence status.        
	The university was given a grant of Rs 30 crore after the status was bestowed on it. The money was to be spent on development of infrastructure and conducting advanced research, especially in new-age areas like nano-science and mobile computing.        
	The university has properly utilised the funds and implemented the research projects in nano-science and mobile computing that it had proposed while applying for the status. The institute has also made significant research in some other areas of science, and in engineering and social sciences. We hope the varsity will be eligible for the renewal of the excellence tag, said Prakash.        
	If JU retains the status, it will get a maximum of Rs 25 crore from the UGC for the next six years.        
	Prakash said the committee would soon submit an inspection report, on the basis of which the UGC will decide on the renewal of the status.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fresh test for four, day before ICSE result
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fresh test for four, day before ICSE result
          MITA MUKHERJEE                              
	Four ICSE examinees from Calcutta are being forced to write their math paper afresh a day before the scheduled declaration of results on Wednesday because the board cant find their answer scripts.        
	Officials of the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations made calls to the students on Saturday evening to inform them about a retest at less than 72 hours notice.        
	Gerry Arathoon, the additional secretary and officiating chief executive of the board, admitted that a retest 24 hours before the declaration of results was unprecedented, not to mention unfair on students who had written the exam and submitted their answer scripts seven weeks ago.        
	We understand their state of mind but we have no other option but to put them through this again. Tuesdays paper will, of course, be different, Arathoon told Metro on Monday.        
	The four students, all from different city schools, were marked present on the day of the examination  March 29  but nobody noticed that their answer scripts were missing from the sealed packets that came in from the test centres.        
	The mystery of the missing answer scripts came to light only during the tabulation of results earlier this month.        
	The board has requested that the names of the four students and the examination centre where they would write the math paper be withheld to spare them unwanted attention and more trauma.        
	We tried our best to trace the answer scripts but couldnt. The council will order an inquiry and take stern action against those responsible for putting these four students through such trauma, said a senior board official.        
	Apart from sitting for the math paper all over again  and with barely 48 hours of preparation  the quartet would have to wait longer for their results. Their results obviously cant be declared on Wednesday but we will try not to prolong their agony by more than a week, the official said.        
	Sources said parents of the four students were wary about antagonising the authorities and affecting their wards careers by taking recourse to legal action. Its a very important exam and no parent would take such a risk. But spare a thought for the students. They are being harassed for no fault of theirs, said a relative of one of the four examinees.        
	As many as 22,878 students wrote ICSE 2010 from Bengal.        
	A teacher of an ICSE school in the city said the board should at least have verified whether the number of answer scripts matched with the examinees well before the tabulation of results. Had that been done, they would have detected the anomaly earlier and conducted the retest with time to spare instead of a day before the results are to be declared.  
	THE SYSTEM  
	Answer scripts are sealed in packets by exam supervisors   
	The board sends the sealed packets to examiners   
	THE GLITCH  
	The supervisors allegedly didn rsquo;t tally the number of examinees with the answer scripts submitted to them  
	The examiners too didn rsquo;t bother checking whether the sealed packets sent to them contained the number of answer scripts they were supposed to correct

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kin held for cyber crime
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Kin held for cyber crime
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Officers of Bengals first cyber crime police station on Sunday arrested a 35-year-old private bank official for allegedly sending anonymous emails to his sister-in-laws colleagues trying to malign her after she had spurned his advances.        
	Adhiraj Roy Choudhuri was picked up from his in-laws house in Baisnabpara Lane in Shibpur in Howrah on Sunday afternoon after investigators tracked him down using the records of a cyber caf on Ibrahimpur Road in Jadavpur from where he had allegedly sent the emails.        
	From what Adhiraj told us during interrogation, we gathered that his ego was hurt when his sister-in-law turned down his overtures. To get back at her he sent emails to her colleagues at a private firm in Park Circus claiming that she was of loose morals and should be sacked immediately, said an officer.         
	According to investigators, Roy Choudhuri started sending the emails in February 2009. When colleagues informed his sister-in-law about the emails, she ignored the matter for a few months. When the frequency of the emails increased and the contents became more malicious, she lodged a complaint with the local police station but the cops failed to track down the sender.         
	When her colleagues received an email in the second week of this month, she lodged another complaint with the cyber crime police station at Lalbazar.         
	We found out that the email had been sent from Infotech Cyber Caf on Ibrahimpur Road. We then narrowed down the list of suspects to her brother-in-law. We were able to get his phone number from the records of the cyber caf, said the officer.         
	Roy Choudhuri has been booked under the IT Act. If he is found guilty, he could be imprisoned for up to five years and fined up to Rs 10 lakh.        
	This is the first case that has been cracked by the cyber crime police station, which was inaugurated by Infosys chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy a month back.

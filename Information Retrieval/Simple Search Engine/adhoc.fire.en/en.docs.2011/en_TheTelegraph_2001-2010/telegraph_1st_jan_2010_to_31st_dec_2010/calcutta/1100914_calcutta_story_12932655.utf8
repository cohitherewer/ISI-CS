The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wettest day woes in city, on tracks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wettest day woes in city, on tracks
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The seasons wettest day left large parts of the city and its fringes inundated, throwing rail and road traffic out of gear. Metro travelled across Calcutta to identify the peeve points               
	Howrah station subway        
	Thousands of rail passengers had to wade through knee-deep water as the subway of Howrah station was flooded following incessant rain since Sunday night. With 10 ticket counters housed in the subway, passengers had no option but to queue up in the murky water. Some accused the authorities of slackness as pumps were pressed into service to drain the accumulated water only at 1pm.         
	 After each heavy spell, the railway drains overflow, submerging the subway. The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is responsible for pumping out water from the subway. I will find out why pumps were not used immediately, said Bidyut Bhattacharya, chief engineer, CMDA, Howrah.              
	Circular Railway         
	Circular Railway services were suspended from 11.25am between Bagbazar and BBD Bag stations because the tracks were submerged under 18cm water. Two pumps were pressed into service to clear the water. The rain also affected train services at Belgharia station as the signalling system had been affected.         
	Trains had to be detained for a few minutes, said a senior railway official.              
	Thoroughfares         
	Parts of CR Avenue near Sovabazar, MG Road and Ganesh Chandra Avenue were under ankle-deep water till 5pm on Monday.         
	As a result, traffic was reduced to a crawl for the better part of the day. Pumps were pressed into service but residents complained that nobody operated the pump near MG Road.        
	The western flank of Jawaharlal Nehru Road near Park Street and BT Road near ISI were flooded till late in the afternoon.         
	Since morning at least three bikers have skidded and fallen into the water. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)s pump started operating only in the afternoon, said a traffic constable manning the Park Street crossing.        
	Along with BT Road, nearby thoroughfares like Gopal Lal Thakur Road, Rani Hansamukhi Road, Sridhar Roy Road and parts of Paikpara in north Calcutta were also flooded.        
	Localities        
	Alipore Bodyguard Lines was under waist-deep water on Monday morning. Even in the evening, residents were forced to wade through ankle-deep water. Seven CMC pumps were seen in action.        
	Its the same story after every shower. We are used to the abysmal conditions now, said the wife of an inspector.         
	Parts of Behala including Silpara, KK Roy Road, Narayan Roy Road, Airport Bylane, Silpara, Sabarnapara, Netaji Pally, Vidyasagar Pally, Unique Park, and Rabindranagar were under water.        
	Traffic movement on the western flank of Diamond Harbour Road near Silpara had to be stopped in the morning and residents of Narayan Roy Road, Sabarnapara and Silpara Main Road had to wade through water till Monday night.         
	The extent of waterlogging was far less in the city proper this time because of the revamp of the brick sewerage system. All our 18 pumping stations are working to drain out the water. We hope that these localities will be clear by late evening, said Rajib Deb, member, mayor-in-council, sewerage and drainage.

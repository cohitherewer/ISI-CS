          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A passenger on a Bangkok-Calcutta Kingfisher flight was arrested at the city airport on Sunday evening for allegedly misbehaving with the crew.        
	Sarajit Deb, 51, who runs a consultancy firm in the city, touched an airhostesss hand and abused crew members.        
	He became angry after he was denied a fourth drink during the 160-minute flight.        
	He was drunk by the time he finished the third drink and was becoming difficult to control. So the crew decided not to serve him more alcohol, said an airline official.         
	Deb then asked for a non-vegetarian meal, which the airline had run out of. He stood up and started shouting at the cabin crew. He later touched an airhostesss hand, added the official.         
	The pilot alerted Calcutta airports air traffic control (ATC). Deb was detained by CISF men after the flight landed at 5.25pm. Deb apologised but since the airline did not withdraw the complaint, he was handed over to police, a CISF officer said.

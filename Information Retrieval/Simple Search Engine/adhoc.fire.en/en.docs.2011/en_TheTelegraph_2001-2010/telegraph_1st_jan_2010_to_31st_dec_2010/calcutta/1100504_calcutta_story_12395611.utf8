The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mom-in-law in political debut   jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mom-in-law in political debut
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          Rafat Javed believes access to education, clean drinking water and healthcare facilities are three things residents of ward 66 need the most                                        
	Perhaps the only mother-in-law among the first-time candidates in the upcoming civic elections, Rafat Javed was born and brought up on Alimuddin Street, made famous by the CPM headquarters, but is Mamata Banerjees nominee for ward 66.        
	The ward is where Rafats husband, Trinamul Congress councillor-cum-MLA Javed Ahmed Khan, was elected for the first time as an independent candidate in 1985, vanquishing both the Congress and the CPM.         
	A student of Pratt Memorial and Calcutta Girls College, the 51-year-old is the mother of two sons, both MBAs from Australia. The elder one married recently.        
	Rafats family has now been based in the city for four generations. Her forefathers came to Kashmir from Tajikistan and briefly settled there before making Calcutta their home.        
	Rafat knows Hindi, English and Urdu and can understand and speak Bengali. I can also read Bengali but I should confess that the joined letters often give me trouble, she says.        
	She has never taken part in any meeting or rally of the Trinamul or any other political party, but since she has been given the opportunity to serve the people of an area, she would not hesitate to take up the gauntlet.        
	Is contesting the municipal elections without any political experience too big a step?        
	A councillor must look after development of his or her area and politics has nothing to do with development. I think the city would have become a much better place to live in if there was no politics with development, she says.        
	According to her, a large section of residents in her ward is not financially sound and educated. There is perennial shortage of potable water. The coming up of Park Circus and Kasba booster pumping stations has not helped since Tiljala and Topsia are not part of their command areas.        
	The private healthcare facilities that dot the EM Bypass are beyond the reach of the middle-class and lower middle-class residents. The nearest hospital for them for 40 years has been National Medical College and Hospital.        
	Hence, she feels education for poor children, safe drinking water and healthcare facilities within the reach of the common man are the three areas that need immediate attention.         
	Have you ever met Mamata Banerjee? Why do you doubt? She had once held a meeting in our home on Mcleod Street. I respect her. She remains busy with so many things, and yet every year during Puja and Id she never forgets to send me a sari or salwar kameez as gift, says Rafat.

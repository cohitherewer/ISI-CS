The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Parking space for Sector V
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Parking space for Sector V
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Sector V will soon get two all-facility buildings comprising multi-tier bus stops, underground parking facilities and commercial zones.        
	One of the buildings will come up near Wipro and the other at the CSTC garage, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, the administrative body of Sector V. The projects will be executed on a public-private partnership basis.        
	The authority approved the decision to construct the buildings on Tuesday at a meeting attended by urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya.        
	Officials said the all-facility buildings would help solve parking problems in Sector V, which now has little space to keep vehicles and is dotted with illegal parking lots.        
	The focus of Tuesdays meeting was on traffic management in and around Sector V and the mess the tech town has been reduced to because of work on laying underground sewerage and water lines.        
	Several roads in Sector V will be made one-way to ease traffic congestion. We have also asked the cops to stop illegal parking, said a member of the authority.        
	Minister Bhattacharya also announced that the CMDA would take back unused plots in Baishnabghata and east Calcutta, including Salt Lake, which it had sold several years ago.        
	The plots were sold 15 to 20 years ago but are lying unused. The CMDA wants to build housing estates on these plots. At Baishnabghata, around 300 such plots are lying unused, said Bhattacharya. He also said he had approved Salt Lake municipalitys proposal to allow residents to add a floor to their houses. If residents are opposed to the proposal, the civic body should first talk to them, the minister added.

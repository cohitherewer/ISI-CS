          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 73-year-old man who was hit by a truck while praying at a roadside temple died after remaining trapped under the vehicles wheels for more than an hour, barely 50 metres from Bally police station.         
	Shankarnath Bera, a retired employee of a local school who lived in Chandra Pathak Lane, was out on his morning walk when he was knocked down near Bally bazaar around 5.45am. The driver and his help fled leaving the lower part of Beras body trapped under one of the front wheels. Bystanders could not pull him out.         
	Rabi Roy, the owner of an adjacent stall where Bera used to have tea every morning, said: He kept requesting us to save him. We pleaded with policemen to somehow move the truck so that he could be taken to hospital but they left for the police station with the driver and his help, who had been caught by pedestrians.        
	Residents tried to comfort Bera till the police brought a crane around 7am and moved the truck. Bera, who had lost consciousness, died on the way to NRS Hospital.        
	His daughter Sumita Mal, who had rushed to the spot, said he could have been saved if the cops acted promptly.        
	Sukesh Kumar Jain, the additional superintendent (town), Howrah, said: I shall look into the matter.        
	Fatal mishap: Salima Bibi, 70, died after being hit by a bus in Thakurpukur on Tuesday night. A mob damaged the bus and blocked Bakra Road for an hour.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Farce after every tragedy
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Farce after every tragedy
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mousumi Santra, mother of Abhijit                                  
	Yet another pool car accident. Yet another reason to pass the buck. Yet another knee-jerk call for a crackdown. Yet another farce being played out on the streets while schoolchildren are endangered and parents are living in fear.        
	Within hours of Fridays Maruti Omni crash on Jessore Road, which killed the driver and injured Abhijit Santra, a Class IV boy, the public vehicles department (PVD) in Beltola announced a crackdown on illegal pool cars.        
	Whenever there is a pool car accident, there is pressure from Writers Buildings to do something. So, we launch a crackdown for a few days. We seize some of the cars, slap fines on the owners and then release them, said a PVD official, summing up the farcical nature of the exercise.        
	At Writers, transport minister Ranjit Kundu expressed anguish at the string of pool car accidents before launching into a diatribe against the pool car operators vehicle of choice.        
	The Maruti Omni is a vehicle unfit to carry children and we do not want to see it operating as a pool car, said Kundu.        
	His department officials in Beltola confirmed that almost 50 per cent of the citys pool-car fleet in the city comprised the Maruti Omni. These box-type vans do not have any buffer in front or at the back as the engine is beneath the vehicle and the boot has been done away with to create more seating space, said a PVD official from the technical wing.        
	The transport department, for all its protestations after every accident, has failed miserably to regularise the fleet of pool cars.        
	The exercise began almost a year ago when the government laid down a set of guidelines to allow the conversion of pool cars into commercial vehicles and allow them to ferry schoolchildren.         
	Of the 5,000-odd vehicles in the city and its suburbs, only 50 have made the grade  or are in the process  of registered pool cars.        
	So, in mathematical terms, only 1 per cent of pool cars is eligible to transport 20,000-odd children to and from school.        
	On Friday, the transport minister admitted that it was not possible for his department to rein in pool cars. The schools have to come forward and help us, said Kundu.                
	What can be done to rein in rogue pool cars? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Victoria annexe plea in Supreme Court
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Victoria annexe plea in Supreme Court
          OUR BUREAU                          Building battle: Victoria Memorial Hall                                  
	The Victoria Memorial authorities moved the Supreme Court on Monday seeking to modify a Calcutta High Court order disallowing any new structure on the monument premises.         
	A three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, issued notices to the Howrah Ganatantrik Nagrik Samiti which had opposed the proposal to construct a building to house the memorials administrative offices and library. The apex court directed that the case be listed for hearing again on February 22.        
	Harish N. Salve, who represented the memorials curator, pleaded with the court to allow a modern building to replace an old crumbling structure in the complex.        
	Every museum has valuable artefacts which it has to protect. As it is, only 20 per cent of it (the Victoria Memorial collection) is on display because of lack of space, Salve contended. Once the (administrative) offices are housed elsewhere, that space could be used to display more artefacts, he argued.         
	We propose to have a new compact building with a little cafeteria proper toilets so we are not embarrassed when foreign guests come, he added.         
	The curators appeal, filed through law firm Fox and Mandal, stated that the proposed structure had been cleared by the National Institute of Design and the Centre.         
	The existing structure occupies 5,000sq m, whereas the proposed one will occupy only 3,800sq m, Fox and Mandal lawyer Jayshree Singh said. It will not obstruct the historical structure in any way, she said.         
	The high court had in an order passed on September 28, 2007, disallowed any new structure inside the complex.         
	Subsequent to that order, the Victoria Memorial board of trustees had in February 2009 filed a petition seeking permission to construct an administrative building. The plea was rejected.        
	Justices Bhaskar Bhattacharjee and Tapan Kumar Dutta had ruled that any new construction would be detrimental to the historical structure. The board may construct new buildings in other places, it had said.        
	The authorities had then said Calcutta Tercentenary Trust, a London-based NGO, had proposed to fund the construction of the new building.         
	We find that the sole object is to make the campus a place of brisk activities and entertainment without caring for the protection of the monument, the high court had then said criticising the monument authorities.         
	It had also observed that granting permission for any new construction would undo the painstaking monitoring for the past seven years to protect the monument.         
	Environmental degradation of the memorial had come under the courts scanner in 2002 after activist Subhash Datta, the general secretary of the Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samiti, moved a PIL.         
	Dutta said on Monday that he would oppose the curators petition in the Supreme Court.

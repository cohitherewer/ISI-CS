                      Legacy of creativity                    West Bengals rich heritage of handloom and handicraft is legendary. The fascinating handloom textiles of Murshidabad, Birbhum, Bankura, Hooghly and Nadia districts, with their exquisite colours and textures, have gained popularity worldwide. Jute products, wood and cane products, conch-shell products, brassware and puppets, along with handicrafts of different schools of art now embellish the drawing rooms of the elite. What is most interesting is that, in spite of the fact that these art and craft forms have been carried down through generations, each has still maintained its distinctive style and originality. This glorious tradition of Bengal comes alive in the two-day fair of traditional handloom and handicrafts, being held in support of the marginalised artisans of its villages. With exotic creations from Bankura, Purulia, Birbhum and Midnapore, it features an alluring collection of Baluchari, dokra, bell-metal, terracotta, conch-shell and stoneware, lanterns, bamboo and wooden showpieces and more. Plus, a tribal dance performance.

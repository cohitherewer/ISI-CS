The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 2-night break for the bleary-eyed
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      2-night break for the bleary-eyed
  - Lull after 19 days of Cup action greeted with relief by fans amp; families          RITH BASU                          CUP KEEPS CITY UP: David Villa of Spain in action against Portugal on Tuesday night                                        
	Will he switch to the mens quarters and womens semis at Wimbledon? Or fall back on the England vs Australia ODI at the Oval? Or just hand over the TV remote to her with a benevolent smile and snore the night away?        
	The Cup-crazy Calcuttan has suddenly hit a two-day lull after 19 evenings on the trot of Messi and Mueller, Villa and Kaka. And for the bleary-eyed brigade, its a welcome break.        
	I have been feeling drowsy for what seems like ages. I will turn in early these two nights and then be raring to go for the quarter-final action on Friday-Saturday, Brazil supporter Saikat Das told Metro on Wednesday.        
	Doctors give a thumbs up to Saikats sleep-when-you-can strategy. Even two nights of proper sleep is good for a sleep-starved body, said Syamasis Bandyopadhyay of Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, who hasnt missed a single midnight match since June 11. The doctor specialising in medicine also advises drinking lots of water, avoiding fried food and alcohol and taking an antacid if needed to survive the last lap of the Cup.        
	In some households, the 48-hour break will re-establish the womans right over the remote. There are 15 people and six TV sets in the house but they (the men) still refuse to let us watch the STAR Jalsa serial Ma from 8pm. They (the men, again) all want to watch the matches in the comfort of their rooms, grumbled Minati Das, 62, of Howrah Maidan.        
	For homemaker Anuradha Basu, 32, the bother is her husband not only watching every World Cup match but even some of the repeats. I think a change of attitude is called for. Men just walk in and change the channel when a match is on, she complained.        
	At least he hasnt been blowing the Vuvuzela. Yet.

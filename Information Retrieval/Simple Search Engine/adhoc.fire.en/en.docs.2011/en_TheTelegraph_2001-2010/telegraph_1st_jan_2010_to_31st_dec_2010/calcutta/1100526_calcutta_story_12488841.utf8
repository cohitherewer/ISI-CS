	Park English School, on Park Street welcomed its first batch of Plus II  level students on May 8 (picture left by Anindya Shankar Ray).         
	Getting affiliation from the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations was not a cakewalk for the school, 70 per cent of whose students belong to minority communities.         
	All credit goes to the principal, Francis Gomes, for his persistence in securing the affiliation, said Neil OBrien, chairman of the council.         
	The onus now was with the first batch to meet the expectations of the school, said educationist Barry OBrien.         
	You are the ones who will set the standards of the school. It all depends on how well you perform, he added.

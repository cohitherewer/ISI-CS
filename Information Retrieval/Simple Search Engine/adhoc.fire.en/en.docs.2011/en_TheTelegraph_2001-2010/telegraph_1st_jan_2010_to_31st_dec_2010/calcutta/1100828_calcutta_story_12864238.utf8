          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday directed the fisheries department to restore a 10-cottah pond in Amtala, on the southern fringes of the city, which has been illegally filled up to make room for a three-storeyed market.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice J.N. Patel and Justice B. Bhattacharya gave the department eight weeks to demolish the structure and restore the pond. The plot was originally recorded as a pond. Its illegal to fill it up and start construction on the plot. The original character of the land should be restored within eight weeks, the bench ruled.        
	The order followed a petition by Amtala Nagarik Adhikar Raksha Samity, alleging that Bishnupur I gram panchayat pradhan Tanushree Mondal had allowed two promoters to fill up the pond and construct a three-storeyed market on it.        
	There is an all-party nexus behind the move. Panchayat pradhan Mondal is from the Congress. One of the promoters, Rahaman Ali Shaikh, was once a CPM member of the panchayat, while the other, Sumit Mondal, is the brother of Bishnupur Trinamul president Shyamal Mondal, the petitioner stated.         
	The promoter duo had obtained the power-of-attorney from the ponds owner and applied for permission to start construction, said Samitys lawyer Kallol Guhathakurta.        
	The construction of the ground floor of the market is almost complete. The fisheries department had lodged a complaint with Bishnupur police station following a plea by the Samity but the cops are yet to act against the promoters.

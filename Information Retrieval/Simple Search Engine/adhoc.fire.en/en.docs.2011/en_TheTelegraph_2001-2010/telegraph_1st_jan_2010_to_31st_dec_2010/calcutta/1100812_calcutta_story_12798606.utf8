          A STAFF REPORTER                          Firemen dwarfed by the flames and the cloud of smoke in Salkia on Wednesday. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	An illegal plastic goods factory in Howrah was reduced to ashes early on Wednesday but firemen prevented a bigger disaster by controlling the flames before they spread to the 20-odd adjacent units employing around 1,000 people.        
	The blaze at Essel Polymer Private Limited in Salkia, around 4km from the heart of the city, exposed the lack of fire-safety measures in most of the manufacturing units in the north Howrah neighbourhood.        
	Twenty-seven tenders sprayed around 1,60,000 litres of water over six hours to douse the blaze.        
	It was a close shave. There would have been a major disaster had the fire spread to the other units, said Gagan Mahipal, a resident of Salkia Chowrasta, voicing the fear of the residents of the entire neighbourhood.        
	This was the second blaze at the GT Road unit in three years. Almost 75 per cent of the factory was destroyed in a fire in 2007, but it was up and running within months.        
	The blaze was spotted around 8.15am. Within minutes the flames roared through the factory, feeding on plastic goods, raw materials, chemicals and paper cartons stacked in the compound.        
	We were busy working when we saw flames and smoke billow from near a machine in the production unit. The fire was spreading rapidly, forcing us to run for our lives, said Amarnath Bera, who works at Essel Polymer that has around 105 people on its rolls.        
	The company supplies containers and pouches to Mother Dairy, Metro Dairy and other firms.        
	A preliminary probe revealed that the factory did not have any fire licence. Nor had the management taken any fire-fighting measures.        
	The unit did not have the mandatory water reservoir that could have helped the fire-fighting operation.... The place was stacked with various types of inflammable materials, said Bibhash Guha, the deputy director of the fire and emergency services department.        
	The officer said an FIR would be lodged against owner Abhishek Goyal on Thursday.        
	Factory supervisor Ashish Guha, however, claimed there was adequate water on the premises to start fire-fighting. The overhead tank had 5,000 litres of water but it could not be used as power supply was disrupted soon after the fire broke out, Guha said.        
	A fire department official said that of the 250-odd units in Salkia, most had not put in place even the basic firefighting measures.        
	Most residents of Salkia  the neighbourhood spread across one-and-a-half sq km is home to a lakh people  feel threatened by the mushrooming of illegal and polluting units.        
	These factories have turned our lives into hell. A disaster is just waiting to happen, said a resident.         
	Howrah police superintendent Hari Kishore Kusumakar said: If the fire brigade lodges a complaint against the factory owner, well definitely take action.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Examinees hit by review delay 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Examinees hit by review delay 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The delay in the publication of the review results of Calcutta Universitys Part I and II 2009 exams has put thousands of students in a quandary         
	The worst affected are those who have narrowly missed the qualifying marks for honours in Part II. They have the option of repeating the paper(s) and continuing as honours students or appearing in Part III as general candidates. The decision hinges on whether they obtain the qualifying marks in the review.         
	Part I students, on the other hand, will have to appear for the papers they had failed, if the review does not change their status.        
	Nearly 100,000 BA, BSc and BCom examinees had applied for review last year following the worst ever results in recent history of Calcutta University. The Part III exams are scheduled to start in mid-April and the Part I and Part II exams in June.        
	The 2009 BA and BSc Part I and II exams were held in August-September and the results declared in November.        
	Debashis Biswas, the universitys controller of examinations, said efforts were on to declare the review results before Part III started. He attributed the delay to non-availability of examiners.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mercury dips, to rise soon
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mercury dips, to rise soon
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The minimum temperature, after a slight rise over the weekend, started climbing down from Monday but the weatherman said the fall would be checked for a while from Wednesday because of a western disturbance in northern India.        
	On Monday, the minimum at Alipore dropped to 12.5 degrees Celsius, a degree below normal, from Sundays 13.1. At Dum Dum, the minimum was 11.6 degrees Celsius.        
	On Tuesday, the minimum is likely to drop by another degree. The dip in the mercury is resulting from an intensification of the cold and dry northerlies and northwesterlies. The flow was active on Monday and will drag the minimum temperature down by another degree or so on Tuesday, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The chill, however, may lose some of its sting because of the western disturbance  storms from the Mediterranean that trigger sudden winter showers and occasional snowfall in northern and northwestern India.        
	The western disturbance will temporarily hinder the flow of the North Wind into the Gangetic plains. Temperatures should therefore rise from Wednesday. New Years Eve is likely to be warmer than Christmas Eve, Debnath said.        
	Meteorologists hope the first week of 2011 will experience another cold phase as the North Wind is likely to receive a fresh impetus then.

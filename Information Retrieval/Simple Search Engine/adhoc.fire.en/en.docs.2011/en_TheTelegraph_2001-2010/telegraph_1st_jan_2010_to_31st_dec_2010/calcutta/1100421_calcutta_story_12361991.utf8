          A STAFF REPORTER                          Agitators at Mitra Institution (Main) on Tuesday. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Classes were disrupted at two schools in central Calcutta on Tuesday as students and guardians protested alleged irregularities by the headmaster of Mitra Institution (Main) and the authorities of Lee Memorial Girls School.         
	Around 1pm, parents and students gheraoed Anisur Rahman, the headmaster of Mitra Institution (Main) on Surya Sen Street, demanding his resignation. They accused him of misappropriating funds received by the school under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. They also alleged that Rahman had illegally promoted five boys to higher classes.         
	The agitators confined Rahman in his office till the evening. A large police team prevented the trouble from escalating but failed to calm down the angry parents.         
	The mother of a Class V student said the students were entitled to Rs 250 each under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan or books worth the same amount. The headmaster insisted that we go to a particular shop to get books worth Rs 250 free. But to get the free books, we had to buy many books that our kids didnt need, she said.         
	The guardians relented late in the evening after the schools managing committee assured them of action against the headmaster. I will form a committee to probe the matter, said Anup Sirkar, the secretary of the committee.        
	At Lee Memorial School  a Christian missionary institution run by the Methodist Church of India  students and guardians gheraoed the headmistress on Tuesday morning, demanding that seven sacked part-time teachers be reinstated. We had just 15 teachers, seven of whom were working part-time. A number of classes were not being held after they were sacked, said a student of the school on Lenin Sarani.         
	Purnima Ghosh, the deaconess of the Methodist Church, later gave an assurance in writing that the teachers would be reinstated.

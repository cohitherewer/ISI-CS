                      Towards universal peace and harmony                    When we view the incidents of violence and callousness around us, we are often gripped with a feeling of helplessness and feel powerless to change the world. This exhibition aims to counteract that feeling, to make each viewer feel that he or she can be a major player in the drama of building a culture of peace. Lotus Sutra, the ongoing show, organised by Bharat Soka Gakkai, the Indian affiliate of the Soka Gakkai International in Tokyo, puts the spotlight on the Lotus Sutra, which is considered the highest level of teaching in Buddhist philosophy and which deals with peaceful and harmonious co-existence. This show is, perhaps, the first occasion that the city plays host to an assemblage of rare artifacts, calligraphic and pictorial representations and replicas of birch bark and palm leaf scrolls on the Lotus Sutra. The material has come from as varied sources as the Cambridge University Library, Columbia University Press, Lushun Museum Collection (China), the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland and the National of Nepal.                    Event: An exhibition of Buddhist artifacts, calligraphic and pictorial art and replicas of birch bark and palm leaf scrolls When: Till August 13; 11 am - 8 pm Where: Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR, Nandalal Bose Gallery

           Rally raj: It is most unfortunate that despite over three decades in office, the Left parties have not realised the amount of inconvenience they cause to the people when they block arterial roads in the city by holding rallies. On April 19, the Krishak Samity erected a huge pandal and dais in Metro channel without taking any permission. In the larger interest of the public, a PIL should be filed in the high court so that such illegal activities perpetuated by the Leftists are stopped forthwith.                                     
	Apropos the report Dyslexic girl wins exam duel, March 4, it is heartening to learn that Calcutta High Court cleared the decks for a dyslexic student to write her board exam though she was debarred from the test for poor attendance by her school.           
	It must be conceded that a section of students with learning disabilities is studying in many institutions across the country but the school authorities are not intimated about them by the parents.           
	Parents and guardians of such wards feel uneasy about disclosing their childrens inability to learn quickly in the classroom.           
	During admission, school authorities must test students to find out if they are slow learners. If such cases are detected, special considerations and facilities must be extended to those kids to help them study better.           
	The government and the Sarva Siksha Mission have arranged workshops on IEDL (Integrated Education for Dyslexic Learners) to ensure students with problems do not suffer at learning centres.           
	Guardians also need to co-operate with the school authorities by informing them about their childrens problems. The latter must provide all help to nurture the children.

	The report Hospital reopens doors but feeling of alienation keeps residents away amp; angry, April 30, dwelt at length on the Peerless Hospitals breach of promise of treating the poor residents of the locality free.             
	Pitifully, the report mentioned little of the vandalism unleashed on the hospital, destroying instruments and targeting the hospital staff for allegedly refusing to admit an injured person without advance payment.           
	There is no gainsaying this inhuman commercial outlook of hospitals  the big private hospitals in particular  that is inevitably followed by violent outbursts. But, are those readying themselves for avenging their anger in this fashion warranted or worthy of being encouraged or supported? Similar incidents at CMRI and SSKM hospitals close on the heels of the one at Peerless are instances in point. Instead of improving healthcare facilities, such incidents aggravate the sufferings of patients and their families.           
	The malaise has also spread to district and sub-divisional hospitals. Without going into the details of the version of the Peerless authorities, it ought to be emphasised that doctors in hospitals are not always responsible for the deaths of patients.           
	I dont hold any brief for the Peerless Hospital, nor do I deny the dismal conditions in government hospitals compounded by the crass neglect by a section of doctors, but organised attacks without probing the real causes of a patients death deserve to be condemned.           
	P.B. Saha,

	Apropos Panda-monium at Kalighat temple, March 9, it was distressing to learn that trouble broke out between pandas and sevayets at Kalighat temple. I feel the panda raj at the historic temple should be done away with as early as possible. In this connection I would like to state that numerous goats are sacrificed on the temple premises right in front of visitors. In 1900, when M.K. Gandhi visited Kalighat temple, he was so appalled to see the ghastly bloodshed that he reportedly left the temple in a huff.             
	Prahlad Agarwala, 
  Majdia, Nadia                               
	I would like to thank Metro for the report Want a driving licence, April 29. Because of your campaign, the instructors at the Alipore driving test centre are allowing licence-seekers to drive, thereby testing their actual skills and not bookish knowledge.             
	I took my driving test on May 6 and was satisfied with the procedure. I do hope that the practice continues at the test centre and does not stop after a few weeks, as is the norm in the city.

	Apropos Gold gone from locker (March 12), it was shocking to read that a homemakers jewellery went missing from her bank locker. Such incidents are happening often these days. To prevent a re-run, locker owners should be extremely careful before leaving the locker room and double check whether they have locked their locker. On their part, the banks should make all efforts to step up surveillance on their premises. Closed-circuit cameras are a must in all bank locker rooms.             
	Sourish Misra,

	Lonely couples suicide pact March 5, reveals the deepest malaise of Calcutta these days. Many elderly couples are living in the city without companionship or mental support. Monoranjan and Sikha Sarkar were spending their days in loneliness since their only son took up a job in Bangalore. In the last 30 years, employment generation was at its lowest in Bengal.             
	This bleak business scenario forced young people to take up jobs at far-away places. Though the parents lead a comfortable life, they are starved of companionship of their nearest ones. This sorry state ultimately drives them to depression, even suicide.           
	However, a silver lining is visible now  a few welfare organisations have come up in some localities in Calcutta to provide a healing touch to the bruised minds of the elders.           
	Sibaram Chakraborty,
  Howrah             
	The death of a young motorcyclist after the tyres of his bike skidded on sand dumped on Diamond Harbour Road was most unfortunate (Sand on road claims biker, March 23). Sand, stone chips and other building materials are often dumped on the roadside in and around Calcutta.             
	According to civic rules, builders using the roadside to dump materials must seek permission from the authorities concerned. To ensure that materials dont spill on to the carriageway and make it dangerous, a fence needs to be erected along the pavement.           
	But these rules are flouted blatantly. If residents lodge complaints against illegal dumping of materials, police and the civic authorities should immediately investigate the matter and take appropriate action.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
  Behala             
	The report Family dumps 80-yr-old (March 5) holds a mirror before us, forcing us to question whether we are living in a civil society or not. We demand punishment for children who treat their aged parents so cruelly. This is nothing short of a crime.             
	Sachindra Nath Mitra,
  Beleghata                               
	We are quite shocked to read your observation on Deshapriya Park in the report What the CPM promises and where the city stands, dated May 4.             
	DKS, a registered society, is situated on the western part of Deshapriya Park against a lease of 99.99 years signed in 1928 for which we pay rent to the CMC on a yearly basis. Payments up to 2010-2011 have been made.           
	We have not grabbed a portion of the park to carry out unlawful activities. We are an organisation engaged in promotion of sports and have facilities for cricket, football, table tennis, tennis, swimming and darts. More than 2,000 students are trained in various sports, including students from five schools under the GD Birla Centre of Education.           
	Our bar is authorised, operating with a Bengal Excise Licence renewed up to 2010-2011.           
	Your observations have not only hurt the sentiments of our members but also tarnished the image of an institution engaged in the promotion of sports since pre-Independence days.           
	Hironmoy Chatterjee,
  Honorary general secretary
  DKS

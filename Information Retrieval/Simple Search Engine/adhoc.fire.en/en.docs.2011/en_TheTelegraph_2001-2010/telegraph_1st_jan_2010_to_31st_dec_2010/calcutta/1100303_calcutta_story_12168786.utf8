The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court reunion bid falls flat
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court reunion bid falls flat
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta High Courts effort to reunite a warring couple by asking them to stay together for five days along with their three children backfired on Tuesday with the wife returning to court after living with her husband for just two days.         
	Amisha Singh informed the judges on Tuesday that she didnt wish to reunite with her husband, Joynendra Singh, or claim custody of their minor children.         
	Only the court can tolerate this kind of arrogance from any person, said Justice Amit Talukdar while hearing the case with Justice P.K. Deb.         
	Amishas lawyer Saswata Mukherjee argued that she had been facing regular torture by her husband. Just try to understand what conditions force a woman to leave her husband and even her kids, he pleaded.        
	But the division bench granted anticipatory bail to Joynendra, who was fearing arrest after Amisha lodged a case against him under Section 498A (cruelty on housewives by husbands and in-laws).        
	Moving his bail prayer, Joynendras lawyer J.N. Chatterjee had informed the court that Amisha had left her husbands house along with their 12-month-old child after a minor quarrel. The couples other children  aged seven and three  were staying with the father, Chatterjee added.        
	After hearing the case, the bench asked Amisha and Joynendra to attend court together. Last week, when they appeared in court with their children, the judges asked the family to stay together at least for five days. When Amisha refused to stay with her in-laws, the court asked Joynendra to go and stay at Amishas parents house on Durga Charan Mitra Street.         
	Sarovar project        
	Tourism minister Manabendra Mukherjee announced on Tuesday that the much-delayed Subhash Sarovar beautification project would be inaugurated on March 4 and work would begin this month. The Rs 4.9-crore project is expected to be completed by 2011.         
	The work at the 91-acre premises opposite Swabhumi is being funded by the Centre and will be implemented by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation and Calcutta Improvement Trust.        
	The project will be implemented in two phases, the minister said.         
	Metro had reported on Tuesday about the sorry state of the only man-made lake in north-eastern Calcutta.

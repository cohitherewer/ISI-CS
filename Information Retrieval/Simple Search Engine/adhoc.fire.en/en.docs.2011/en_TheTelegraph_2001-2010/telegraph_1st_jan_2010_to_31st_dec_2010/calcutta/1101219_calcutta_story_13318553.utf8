	With reference to Bengali to English, October 24, so many children from English-medium schools are weak in Bengali because of the lack of seriousness on part of both teachers and students.             
	A late start does not imply poor knowledge of a subject. There are many who have excelled in a foreign language despite learning it as an adult. If the teacher and student are earnest, the student can master a language at any age. Whom can we blame when we find that as many students of Bengali-medium schools are as weak in Bengali? Is the quality of teaching at fault then?

	Apropos Calcutta Chromosome, November 21, Calcutta will remain the fever capital of India because of poor sanitation. Health workers advise residents to remove stagnant water from homes as it breeds mosquitoes but few take such precautionary measures. So mosquitoes continue to breed.

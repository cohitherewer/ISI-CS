										      Art for kids rsquo; sake                                    
	An art exhibition by underprivileged children was held at Chitrakoot art gallery from February 20 to 25, as part of the Gold Underground initiative by NGO Kolkata Sukriti Foundation and Lions Club International.        
	The exhibition showcased paintings by 40 children, who were selected by the foundation and groomed for a year by artists Subhabrata Nandi and Samir Kundu.         
	The proceeds from the sale of the paintings will be used to fund the education of the kids, many of whom are from red light areas or from families that are below the poverty line.         
	Science sites        
	National Council of Science Museums (NCSM) released Propagation, a science journal and Popscience, a science portal, on Monday at its Salt Lake premises, with Bikash Sinha, the former director of Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre as the chief guest.         
	The objective behind the new additions to NCSMs branches across the country is to develop a scientific temper among the youth, explained an NCSM official.         
	While Propagation will showcase recent practices in the field of science, Popscience will provide information on new exhibitions in the country and also have space for articles on the lives and works of famous scientists.

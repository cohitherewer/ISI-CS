The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Beware, new dengue duo
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Beware, new dengue duo

	Dengue has become more dangerous this year with two additional strains of the virus making inroads into the city, triggering the most virulent outbreak of the vector-borne disease in recent years.        
	A study by the National Institute for Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) confirmed on Thursday that types 1 and 4 of the dengue virus were responsible for the severity.        
	According to the study, as many as 23 out of every 1,000 Calcuttans were infected over the past 12 months.         
	That is a very high rate of prevalence, comparable to other hyper endemic countries like Thailand, Columbia, Nicaragua and some other Latin American locations, said a scientist at the institute.        
	The NICED study, which covered 30,000 people with high fever across the city between 2009 and October 2010, revealed a distinct change in the pattern of infection this year.        
	We had detected only types 2 and 3 last year, but types 1 and 4 have also showed up in our tests this year. This is the first instance of these two strains triggering a dengue outbreak in the city in recent years, said Dipika Sur, the deputy director of the epidemiology division of the institute.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has recorded a lone dengue death this year, but unofficial estimates put the toll at not less than four.        
	Dengue is caused by a self-limiting virus and is fully curable, provided there is early diagnosis.         
	Maidan footballer Ashesh Das died of the disease in August, apparently because he didnt seek proper treatment despite running a temperature for over a week.        
	City doctors endorsed the NICED findings, saying that the extent as well as the severity of dengue this season was more than in previous years.         
	Patients have been coming to us with very low platelet counts, which wasnt the case last year, said critical care specialist Subrata Maitra.         
	Amitabha Nandy, the director of the Centre for Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, said the new dengue strains were the major cause of the virulent outbreak.         
	Each type of dengue produces partial immunity in the human population of a particular area. If another type comes in, complications arise, Nandy added.

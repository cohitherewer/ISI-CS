The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Drawing attention
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Drawing attention
										      eyewitness                        A work by Arpan Mukherjee				                           
	Jogen Chowdhurys awesome drawings of skulls and Partha Pratim Debs virtuosity notwithstanding, the real stars of the drawing exhibition organised by Emami Chisel on the EM Bypass are the young artists from all over India, and there are quite a few of them.         
	What jaded viewers will find refreshing is the abundance of ideas and images that emerge from life around us. In Sovan Kumars Land Deal, two heads float over a real metal ruler while matchbox-like condos sprout out of their tete-a-tete. One need not be a connoisseur either to appreciate or understand the import of this image presented with the minimum of colours and lines.         
	A multitude of fingers waggle in Koustav Nags light-hearted drawing with humanoid ants crawling all over it. Piyali Sadhukhans deceptively ultra-feminine centipede is actually composed of hooded terrorists or torture victims.         
	Arpan Mukherjee dwells on the quirks of the commonplace. Lines are always an important component of Rajiba Lochan Panis paintings. Here he uses them with fluency. Ritendra Roys work is clearly thought out although the significance of the yin yang symbol seems a little vague. Rajesh Debs appropriation of illustrations from Bengali classics is becoming a bore.        
	Senior artist Lalu Prasad Shaws woman fanning herself could have been delineated with an awl, so sharp and sure is the execution. One appreciates the touch of humour in Tapas Konars bundle of bodies with eyes sprouting all over. Aditya Basaks drawing needs trimming. There are a large number of works on display and it needs to be cut down to size.              
	Experimenter gallery presents the minimalist prints of Ariel Ruiz i Altaba, a scientist who works in Geneva. He uses archival pigment on heavyweight cotton rag paper. Titled Minimal Landscapes, the black blotches on virgin paper stimulate ones imagination. They could be anything from embryos and spores to human figures or flotsam.        
	From afar, the images look like a solid blob of paint but on closer inspection one discovers that the borders are fuzzy. This is what makes them enigmatic.       SOUMITRA DAS

	The first international convention of the St Xaviers College Calcutta Alumni Association, in Bangkok, was a mix of work and fun.        
	Held over two days, on July 24 and 25, Beyond Boundaries I saw over 150 Xaverians from across the world discuss everything from the road ahead for the college and the SXCCAA to the Indian economy.        
	Speaking at the inaugural session, industrialist and alumni Pawan Ruia pledged to erect a new building for the college, which is in expansion mode, in the 150th year of the institution.        
	Members of the SXCCAA donated Rs 50 lakh for the addition of a new floor to the existing hostel complex, that will be dedicated to postgraduate courses being offered by the college.        
	The alumni, including Ruia, came forward with their assistance while we were discussing the roadmap for the college  St Xaviers in 2020, said Father Felix Raj, the principal of the college and the president of the SXCCAA.        
	The alumni association also raised Rs 5 lakh as scholarship for poor students of the college.        
	While discussions, seminars and business meetings dominated the days, the evenings were reserved for cultural programmes.         
	A special programme, Seemar Majhe Asim Tumi, based on songs and poems from Rabindranath Tagores Gitanjali, was presented as a tribute to the former Xaverian. This is the centenary year of publication of the Bengali version of the volume.         
	The performance was conceived, directed and led by police commissioner and Xaverian Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti. Designer Agnimitra Paul joined him in the recitation and narration.        
	The programme also included performances by Toronto-based dancer and choreographer Sukalyan, actress Swastika Mukherjee and Xaverians Bickram Ghosh and Pandit Subhen Chatterjee.        
	A fashion show by Agnimitra Paul, showcasing Indian ethnic wear with showstopper Rituparna Sengupta, attended by Xaverians as well as the local Indian and Thai communities, was the finishing touch for the two-day gala.

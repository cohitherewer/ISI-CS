The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain alert in run-up to Puja
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rain alert in run-up to Puja
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The nagging rain that has dampened Puja shopping plans is set to get heavier over the weekend with the low-pressure area over west-central Bay of Bengal intensifying into a depression on Thursday.         
	The low-pressure area is now a depression and centred around 120km east of Visakhapatnam and 220km south-southwest of Gopalpur (as of 11.30am on Thursday), an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) told Metro.        
	According to the Met office, the system is likely to intensify further and cross the Orissa coast between Gopalpur and Paradip by Friday morning. The systems growing influence will bring heavy rain to coastal south Bengal and the city will also receive a fair share, an official said.        
	So does this mean the threat of a Puja washout has increased too? Even after this low-pressure system wanes, a fresh one might develop over central Bay of Bengal next week. That should bring rain for at least two to three days, warned an IMD scientist.        
	The city received 7.8mm of rain on Thursday, which kept the Celsius five degrees below normal but left the city looking bleak and Puja organisers worried with just four days to go for the festival.        
	The monsoon usually departs from south Bengal by October 7 but looks set to overstay its welcome this year. September was the rainiest month of the year.

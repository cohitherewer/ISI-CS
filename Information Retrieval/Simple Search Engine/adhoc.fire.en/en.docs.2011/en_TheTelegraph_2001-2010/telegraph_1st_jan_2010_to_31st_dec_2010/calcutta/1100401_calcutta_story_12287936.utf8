The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Welder torch sparks blame game
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Welder torch sparks blame game
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An LPG-powered welding machine found on the fifth floor of Stephen Court has prompted the custodians of the building to blame a spark from the welders torch  and not a short circuit in the lift  for the blaze that killed 43.        
	A representative of Stephen Court Ltd claimed on Wednesday that the company learnt shortly after the tragedy that the welding machine was being used on the fifth floor of Block II when the fire broke out. We came to know that a flat in that block was being renovated at the time of the fire. Sparks from the welding torch triggered the fire that spread to the lift, leading to a chain of accidents, he said.         
	The Stephen Court Ltd official identified the property where work was underway as the one belonging to Pradip Rawat, the owner of Rawat and Sons Engineering on the fifth floor.        
	Rawat, who lost the eldest of his three daughters in the blaze, denied getting any welding work done on the day of the fire. My three daughters were sitting in our office and having lunch when the driver informed them about the fire. Had the origin of the fire been my office, wouldnt they have noticed it first and run to safety? wondered Rawat, who was in Delhi on March 23.        
	Fire department officers confirmed finding the welding machine and a gas cylinder near lift number 2 on the fifth floor but wouldnt say whether sparks from the equipment triggered the inferno.        
	 Apparently, some welding work was being carried out on the floor, which might have played a role in the fire but thats for the inquiry team to find out. We have alerted police about it, said a senior official of the department.         
	A forensic team visited 18A Park Street twice and collected samples. The director of the state forensic laboratory, Dhurjuti Prasad Sengupta, said it was too early to say whether the welding machine had anything to do with the blaze. We would know for sure what caused the fire only when the final report is ready, which is within a fortnight, Sengupta told Metro.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The city police on Wednesday directed the owners of clubs, hotels, bars and restaurants to ensure the safety of women partying during the Christmas-New Year weekends.        
	Cops told the owners to install CCTVs in the party zones and provide the revellers with the police helpline numbers. Institutions will have to provide adequate security to women, said joint police commissioner Jawed Shamim.        
	A police watch tower will be set up at the JL Nehru Road-Park Street intersection. Nearly 5,000 cops will be deployed across the city from the evening till 2am to tackle any untoward incident.        
	We cannot allow a repeat of the incident on December 31, 2006, when some drunk army jawans attacked Park Street police station to free two of their colleagues held for indecent behaviour, said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Of chop, cutlet, devil, mamlet 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Of chop, cutlet, devil, mamlet 
                            Chops, fish fries and other disappearing delicacies				                           
	An elderly gentleman sat quietly with us as we discussed a simple vegetarian meal for the family after a shradhha. Like us he was mourning for the very dear person we had lost.         
	He opened his mouth three times during this discussion to say: Aar mochar chop? The caterer regretfully said: Ote bado hangama, so we had to leave it out. I like them too but have never made one.        
	I know why. As we grow older most of us become minimalist cooks: if you are like me you never enter a kitchen if you can help it, never mind cook something as labour-intensive as mochar chop.         
	The best things in life are Bad for You! So a cup o soup with toast seems perfectly good to dine on.        
	For Jamaisashthi, Durga puja or Nava Varsha one would rather do the Bengali buffet at restaurants. And thank god for these places which keep our memories and palates tingling. We havent really lost our taste for any of them.        
	Time was when the neighbourhood sweet shop sold crumbly dhakai parathas at breakfast, radhaballabhis and sweetish chholar dal (still available at Putirams in College Square), Mughlai paratha at teatime, fish fry, the charmingly named Kaviraji cutlet (there was nothing kaviraji about this sinful dish).        
	The snacks culture of chop cutlet devil mamlet is fast disappearing and will soon survive only in fiction.         
	Who has not been thrilled to the core by the modest repasts of Hemendra Kumar Rays Sunder babu? This pot bellied, bald inspector (during the Raj) of Hmmm fame could put away vast quantities of toast, poached eggs, bananas, kachoris, singaras, jelabis with oceans of tea, or fowl cutlet, potato salad and tea-cake. He fancied fowl curry in similar proportions for dinner which the resourceful and intrepid family retainer Ramhari could produce in the middle of nowhere.         
	Bankimchandra writes of two brothers, Shari and Bari, who sit down to profound philosophical discourse punctuated by chunks of lamb roast and roast potatoes stuffed in the mouth with knife and fork, then washed down by sips of sherry. (Most readers guessed the two brothers in question were Bankim himself and his older brother, another author and civil servant.)         
	Lila Majumdar can make your mouth water with her lists of food. Street foods abound in Narayan Gangulys Pataldanga. Tenidas cohorts are terrified of his bullying appropriation of them in difficult days of wartime rationing.         
	Tenida describes with anticipatory relish six clucking trussed-up chickens in Kyablas compound ahead of a meal there: chingri machher cutlet, bhetki maccher fry rising in a crescendo to a chicken curry, the ultimate delight of celebratory cuisine. (This was long before the availability of broiler chicken made it a boring daily fare.)        
	Saradindu Bandopadhyay writes of abadangsho in 9th or 10th century Bengal: snacks served with alcohol such as bharjito illish, bharjito illish dimbo, bharjita maurrallo. Move over dips and peanuts.        
	Calcutta residents have become less demanding in their spare time eating preferences, content now with ubiquitous fast foods: rolls (no longer the exclusive preserve of Nizams), dosas, chowmien and chilli chicken from street stalls and hand-pulled carts. Each is a family business (one cart even bears the legend Mama Bhegne).        
	A couple of decades ago one ate momos in a tiny family room off Lee Road or else with a fiery red sauce off Bentinck Street in the old Chinatown where one ate at crack of dawn or not at all. Now these are also tasteless street foods.        
	Great eateries disappear by the day: I mourn the closing of Firpos, Dilkhush, and now How Hua with its authentic Cantonese food, pork chops and dreamy chimney soup.         
	Now and then a caterer will revive some oldies for a wedding. They appear in all their glory on a menu. A particularly memorable one offered both dimer deavil, and the startling stupeed capsicum. Any takers?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Decoded: dais of disruption   Rally survives mishap with martyrs day tag 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Decoded: dais of disruption 
  Rally survives mishap with martyrs day tag           BARUN GHOSH                                                  
	Mamata Banerjee made a martyr of Wednesdays proposed Trinamul V-Day parade after Mondays train tragedy, but only in name.        
	We are not going to observe Vijay Divas on July 21, as announced earlier by Mamatadi. Instead, she wants it to be a traditional martyrs day rally where we will pay homage to those who were killed in the train mishap along with the 13 Youth Congress activists who fell to police bullets in 1993, declared Trinamul Congress president and MLA Subrata Bakshi.         
	The announcement seemed to leave even the Trinamul faithful surprised, many of whom had called party leaders and offices through the day to ask whether Wednesdays programme stood cancelled or postponed.        
	Our party would have risen in esteem in the eyes of the people had we postponed or cancelled the programme, rued a general secretary of the party. Mamata had announced after the civic poll victory last month that the usual martyrs day rally at the city centre on July 21 would be the partys Vijay Divas this year.         
	Actor Badsha Moitra, who had hopped from one TV studio discussion to another as a CPM supporter in the run-up to the civic polls, said he was shocked Mamata had decided to go ahead with the rally despite being morally responsible for Mondays train mishap that killed 62.        
	Accidents will recur as long as the (railway) minister doesnt attend office. As a citizen of this country, I appeal to her to understand her job and then declare rallies. She must be sincere in her work and then look after the party. The people of this country have elected her and she should behave responsibly, he said.        
	Trinamul sources said Wednesdays traffic-choker rally, which has already prompted city schools to curtail classes that day, would start with a two-minute silence for those who died in the collision between the Uttar Banga Express and Vananchal Express at Sainthia station.        
	But why couldnt Trinamul postpone the rally? We observe July 21 as martyrs day every year to honour the victims of the police firing in 1993. We could not have postponed or cancelled a rally that is meant to be held on a specific day, said Madan Mitra, the president of the all-India Trinamul Youth Congress.                
	In private, many Trinamul Congress leaders said they would have liked the rally to be postponed, if not cancelled. After the second train tragedy in as many months, Didi will need to be more cautious in her approach, felt a Trinamul vice-president.         
	Party leaders have cancelled over two dozen street-corner meetings slated for Monday and Tuesday in the run-up to Wednesdays mega show of strength in front of Victoria House.        
	The only official word of caution from Mamatas office, however, was for leaders to be careful that their supporters didnt carry any placards or banners highlighting the partys victory in the civic polls during the rally.         
	Didi has asked senior party functionaries in Calcutta to send an advisory to the districts on how party workers should behave, a source said.        
	Police have drawn up a traffic grid with APC Roy Road in the east, AJC Bose Road in the south, Strand Road in the west and New CIT Road in the north for the best possible routes of traffic diversion during Wednesdays rally.        
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti held a meeting with senior officers on Monday to discuss the traffic strategy for the rally.         
	The fact that the railway minister can lead a disruptive rally in the heart of the city two days after a train tragedy proves how irresponsible and adamant she can be, said a former top cop.

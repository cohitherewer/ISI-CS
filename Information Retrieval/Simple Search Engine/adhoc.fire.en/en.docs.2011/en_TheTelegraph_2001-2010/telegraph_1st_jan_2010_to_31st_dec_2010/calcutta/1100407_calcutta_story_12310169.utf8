	The 12-member committee probing the Stephen Court blaze has prepared separate questionnaire for the agencies blamed for the citys worst fire tragedy  police, civic body, fire brigade and CESC.

	Special police commissioner Banibrata Basu and civic commissioner Arnab Ray, both members of the probe panel, will reply to the questionnaire sent to their respective departments.        
	The duo accompanied the team, headed by former chief secretary Sourin Roy, during its first visit to Stephen Court on Tuesday morning.

	The fire department will be asked about the specific nature of firefighting. The authorities will have to state the number of tenders sent to the spot, the names of the stations from where they were sent and whether there was any delay in reaching the blaze site.        
	There will also be questions on the gadgets available for launching an effective rescue operation, how many of them were deployed and whether any key equipment was lying unused.        
	The CESC bosses will be quizzed about the electrical load of the Park Street landmark and whether there was any short-circuit that might have caused the blaze.        
	Committee chairman Roy said: We have looked at the point of origin of the fire, the affected areas and the extent of the damage. We will now discuss what we saw.

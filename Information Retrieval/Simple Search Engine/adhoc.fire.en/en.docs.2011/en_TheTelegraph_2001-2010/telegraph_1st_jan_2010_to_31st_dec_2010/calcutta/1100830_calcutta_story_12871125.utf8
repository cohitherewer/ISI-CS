	The authorities of a religious institution in north Calcutta have been running from pillar to post in vain for the past 10 days to get a brick platform with a Trinamul Congress flag on it removed from the road in front of their premises.        
	The three-tier platform in front of Gaudiya Math, on Kaliprasad Chakraborty Street in Bagbazar, was set up on the eve of Independence Day.        
	Some local Trinamul supporters had erected the platform and the flagpole on August 14. They had said they would hoist the Tricolour the next day and would later dismantle the structure, said B.S. Sanyasi, the secretary of the math set up in 1930.        
	We were shocked to find a Trinamul flag being hoisted on the Independence Day morning. When we asked them to remove it, they refused.        
	Sanyasi said he and other devotees had written to the local councillor, MLA and police station, as well as the chief secretary, home secretary, chief minister and even Mamata Banerjee.        
	The home secretary had promised help but nothing happened The police are pleading helplessness, saying there might be a law-and-order problem if the structure is demolished and the flag removed, said Sanyasi.        
	The secretary said the devotees  including many distinguished personalities  were uncomfortable with a political partys flag fluttering right next to the maths entrance.        
	When Metro visited the spot on Sunday afternoon, three youths were playing cards a couple of feet from the platform.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation should take action even if it is not bothered about the sentiments of the devotees who frequent the math. The road is a CMC property and any permanent structure on it is illegal, said a resident.        
	Firhad Hakim, the mayoral council member in charge of roads and a prominent Trinamul leader, said he would look into the matter and take immediate action.        
	We will raze the structure the moment we receive a complaint. We have decided to destroy all structures set up by party supporters on the road or the footpath, said Hakim.        
	Local Trinamul councillor Manjusree Chowdhury, however, has taken exception to math secretary complaining to party higher-ups.        
	The day after the secretary had complained to me, I sent my son to look into the matter. But by then he had complained to Mamata Banerjee and Sudip Bandopadhyay. Now let them handle the issue. I will not ask my supporters to remove the post, which in any case is not on the math premises.        
	The math, standing on 30 cottahs, has 34 branches in India and two each in the UK and US.

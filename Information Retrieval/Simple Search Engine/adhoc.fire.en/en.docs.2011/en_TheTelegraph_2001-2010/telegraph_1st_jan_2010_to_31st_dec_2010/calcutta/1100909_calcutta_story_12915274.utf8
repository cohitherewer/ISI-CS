The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Accused back in crime
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Accused back in crime
  - Focus on lax prosecution          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Two cases of extortion, a gang war and threats over the phone  police records on Zaffar Siddiqui, alias Gudda, suggest the 36-year-old is back in business barely a month after he walked out of jail on bail.        
	Not just Gudda. At least two other alleged extortionists, Sona and Nadeem, have been back in crime since their release on bail.        
	Senior officers in the city police say they are in a fix on how to deal with those who are wanted for various crimes but are out on bail. Lalbazar insiders admit that accused are getting bail because of the failure of the sleuths to secure prosecution or justify prolonged remand.        
	On most occasions, extortionists walk out on bail because victims or witnesses are too scared to identify them or depose against them in court, said a senior officer of the detective department.        
	Of the three alleged extortionists, police are worried most about Gudda. He is the deadliest. On September 3, days after his release on bail, he had arrived at Narkeldanga in a car around 6.30pm and spent a few hours hunting for his rival Mohammed Samsul. Unable to locate him, Gudda proceeded to Topsia where his men picked up trader Santu Seikh, said an officer of Topsia police station.        
	Seikh was released two days later, allegedly after his family paid Gudda and his gang Rs 10 lakh.        
	A few days ago, Gudda had abducted another trader Mohammed Asmat of Watgunge, and released him the next day. Insiders say  there is no official confirmation of the claim  that money had changed hands to secure Asmats release.        
	Gudda, accused of at least six cases of extortion and dacoity, has been in and out of the jail several times. Officers said he had started off from bylanes of Rajabazar and gradually teamed up with a few others to spread his network to Narkeldanga, Topsia and even in Howrah.        
	He was once arrested in Sankrail, Howrah. On another occassion, he was arrested from Asansol when he went there to meet his dying wife. On March 31, Gudda had to be shifted out of Presidency jail after he led a gang war on the premises  a show of strength aimed at his detractors outside.        
	Police records say Gudda is one of those alleged gangsters in the city who managed to come out on bail every time he was arrested.         
	Every time he has come out he has managed to find new gang members to avoid immediate police attention. Smaller ganglords are still loyal to him, said an officer.

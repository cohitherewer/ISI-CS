                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Finally, its time to say TGIF!
										      BIRDIE BUZZ - Day 4                                Tournament director Brandon de Souza wraps up the final day of KKN presents The Telegraph Cup Golf 2010 in association with Senbo and Ballantines at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club.                
	S for stress  
	Half the people who came today were drowning themselves in sorrow. Senbo (Yellow and Blue) were discussing how next year instead of hiring strategy they will hire more Chatterjees (they had only one in the team!).        
	Everyone was very stressed out in the morning. You should have seen their faces. I was telling them its only a tournament, relax guys.        
	Best for last        
	Over the last three days weve had 235 rounds but today the number of tee-offs was the highest at 135. The first tee-off was at 6.05am and the beautiful thing is that everyone showed up. Except Calcuttas ladies who seem to have boycotted the game. The ones who showed up were all from Jamshedpur.        
	Fightback                              (From Top) One of the four women who played on the last day of the The Telegraph Cup Golf 2010 at RCGC; a bird tracks the birdie action; Lakshman Singh on the road to Bunnykiri, till his team saved the day. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta      
	G.I. Security of India. They started very poor but they beat Ichiban Facility Management. They scored a total of 229.        
	Between the lines        
	Bunny Lakshman Singh came with two papers in his hand. One was a ticket from his boss to send him to Jodhpur in case he lost. The other was a letter from his wife saying Im not leaving Calcutta.        
	Gamesmanship        
	You think the Aussies talk tough on the cricket field? Then you have to hear what one golfer said to his competitor who wished him good luck. He said: You keep the luck, Ive got the talent!        
	Busybodies        
	For the caddies, its been a bumper week and a good tip if the boss plays well. They are the unsung heroes of the tourney  if you want to blame anyone, you blame the caddie; if you hit a great shot, you did it yourself! With more than 85 water bodies dotting the Royals course, its also been a special week for the waterboys who collect the balls from the water bodies, with many golfers showing their generosity by losing their balls close to 400 of them!        
	Overheard        
	The quote of the day has to be a golfer who said, When I can see it, I cant hit it. When I can hit it, I cant see it. The beautiful thing about a golfer is that its never his fault.        
	Toast of the day        
	Goes to Karan Taunk with a masterly round of 67 matching Aditya Khaitans round of Day One. Hes the star to watch out for.        
	Young gun        
	Karanbir Chowdhury, 21. Hes young and hardworking. With 36 points, it was so close that it boiled down to the last putt.        
	And the winners are        
	After some heart-stopping moments, the Division I winners are Williamson Magor (A) who almost redefined the Japanese term for harakiri as Bunnykiri! With three holes left to play, it looked like anybodys championship but a mediocre back-nine let down Sudeep Chitlangias good day at the office for Madhya Bharat Papers Ltd and his round of 72 fell short by four strokes. Oil India (A) finished second in the division.        
	In Division II, it was Tata Tea (A) who won and in Division III, G.I. Security India.        
	E-tax        
	And now the action shifts to the Oberoi Grand for the Final Night of The Telegraph Cup Golf 2010 which has city band Colours performing. (Psssst) If the entertainment taxes carry on like this, next year we will have a Calcuttas Got Talent contest with the worst players in each team performing!        
	Sign-off        
	On behalf of all the green-keepers, caddies, waterboys, waiters, cooks and the Tiger Sports Management team on the final day its TGIF Thank God Its Finished!       AS TOLD TO KARO CHRISITINE KUMAR

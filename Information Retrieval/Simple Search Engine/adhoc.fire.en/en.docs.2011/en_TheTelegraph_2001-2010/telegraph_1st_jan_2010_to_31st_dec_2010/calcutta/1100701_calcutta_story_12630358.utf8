	Ajay Rawla, the father of La Martiniere for Boys student Rouvanjit Rawla who committed suicide on February 12, met an official in the chief ministers office on Wednesday afternoon to apprise Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee about developments in the case. The chief minister is likely to make a statement on the issue in the Assembly on Thursday.        
	When I found out that the chief minister would make a statement in the Assembly, I thought I should provide him with information about the incident and the progress of the probe, said Rawla after the 10-minute meeting at Writers Buildings.        
	I provided details of the probe by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, including what they had found and recommended, and the police investigation, added Rawla.        
	Rawla had lodged a complaint with Shakespeare Sarani police station on June 7 accusing principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi and four other teachers of physically and mentally torturing Rouvanjit and driving him to death.        
	Rawla had written to the chief minister in April demanding justice for Rouvanjit and received a favourable reply. He was asked by the chief ministers office to keep faith in the legal process.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Upgrade blueprint for Ray film cradle 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Upgrade blueprint for Ray film cradle 
          KUSHALI NAG                        The mixing room at NFDC Film Centre (picture by Bishwarup Dutta), which was used for Satyajit Rays Ganashatru (film still below)				                                       
	NFDC Film Centre, the government-owned post-production facility in Behala where Satyajit Ray did the mixing, dubbing and editing of his films since it opened shop in 1982, is poised for a turnaround after lying almost defunct for five years.         
	A Tollywood team of filmmakers, producers, actors and Artistes Forum members, including Goutam Ghose, Sandip Ray, Shrikant Mohta and Mahendra Soni, have worked out an upgrade plan for the approval of the minister of state for information and broadcasting, C.M. Jatua.         
	The first revamp move would be to install a Surround Sound mixing set-up in the recording room at the 60 Upen Banerjee Road address. It will provide Dolby Digital sound at a low cost. We plan to add another floor to the existing one to support this set-up, said film-maker Haranath Chakraborty, who has brought the Tolly team together.         
	The recording unit with cutting-edge technology will be the first of its kind in town. The new set-up will save us at least Rs 3-4 lakh per film as we need to travel to Chennai or Mumbai for this bit of a films post-production work, said Soni of Shree Venkatesh Films.        
	The Behala facility currently has an equipment room stuffed with out-of-use analogue machines, like recorder, telecine transfer and dubbers. The dubbing room has a 70mm screen, an EL control unit, a mixer and a projector, all of which need to be upgraded as do the two edit bays on the top floor of the two-storeyed building. The only functional equipment here is a 35mm SR3 camera, which the centre rents out for Rs 4,000 per shift.        
	The machines have become rusty with neglect. Our centre is now used as a godown by NFDCs Calcutta head office, which functions from Camac Street. Theres scarcely any activity here, said a staff member.         
	Post-production work at the centre came to a halt in 2005 as it wasnt upgraded from analogue to digital technology.        
	From 1983, the post-production of all my fathers (Satyajit Ray) films were done at this centre. The post-production of all my films till Bombaiyer Bombete (2003) was done here too. We are planning to make the centre functional again, said Sandip Ray. Nabyendu Chatterjees unreleased film Sanskar was the last project to have its post-production work done at NFDC Film Centre, in 2005.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pointers for para stump students
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pointers for para stump students
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Madhyamik examinees schooled in process writing in passive voice were stumped for an answer on Thursday when asked to write a simple 100-word paragraph on gardening, using some pointers.         
	Question No. 9 of the English second language paper, carrying 12 marks, included points to write a paragraph on how you made a small flower garden in front of your house.         
	Some Madhyamik examinees were apparently confused about whether they were supposed to write a simple para with pointers meant for process writing or follow the method taught in school.        
	We are given points only for paragraphs to be written in the process-writing format. But after reading question No. 9, we couldnt understand whether we were to write a simple paragraph or one in the process-writing format, complained a student of a south Calcutta school.        
	Another examinee claimed that even the invigilators were confused.        
	We wasted several minutes wondering what to do, she added.        
	In process writing, it is compulsory for students to write in passive voice and follow the sequence of pointers on a given topic.         
	Mamata Ray, the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, said examinees would be given marks irrespective of the format in which they had written the paragraph if the syntax and spellings were correct.        
	Nearly nine lakh examinees wrote the English second language paper in Madhyamik 2010.         
	English is the bugbear of most students who fail to clear Madhyamik. The authorities should be careful not to set questions that examinees have difficulty understanding, said a teacher.

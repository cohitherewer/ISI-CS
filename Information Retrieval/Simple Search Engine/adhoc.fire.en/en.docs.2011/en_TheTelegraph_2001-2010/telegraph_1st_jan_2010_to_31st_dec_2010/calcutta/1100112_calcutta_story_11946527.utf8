The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Boy battles cancer and cash crunch
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Boy battles cancer and cash crunch
          RITH BASU                          Arnab Rana                                  
	A three-year-old is battling leukaemia and pneumonia in the ICU of a city hospital as his debt-ridden father struggles to raise Rs 10 lakh needed for the boys treatment.        
	Arnab Rana (picture below) had been undergoing chemotherapy at Apollo Gleaneagles Hospitals when he contracted pneumonia, forcing doctors to discontinue the cancer medicines. The child, a resident of Sankrail, had been admitted to Midnapore District Hospital on December 1 with persistent fever. He was transferred to the Bypass hospital after a blood report suggested he had cancer.         
	His cancer was in remission after two weeks of chemotherapy but a severe lung infection stopped the sessions, said paediatric haematologist and oncologist Arpita Bhattacharyya. The paediatric critical care specialist treating Arnab, P.S. Bhattacharyya, said: Leukaemia and chemotherapy hampered his immune system, making him prey to pneumonia.        
	Arnab is on antibiotics  for the infection only  that cost over Rs 6,000 a day. If the infection is cured and chemotherapy resumes, he has 70 per cent chance of survival, said doctors.        
	The hospital bill has crossed Rs 3,35,000 in 35 days. The family has taken loans from all conceivable sources to pay Rs 2,25,000. We were given an estimate of Rs 5 lakh for the cancer treatment but the cost doubled because of the infection. My husband pays an EMI of Rs 8,000 for the car he drives on hire and supports a family of six, said Arnabs mother Sujata.

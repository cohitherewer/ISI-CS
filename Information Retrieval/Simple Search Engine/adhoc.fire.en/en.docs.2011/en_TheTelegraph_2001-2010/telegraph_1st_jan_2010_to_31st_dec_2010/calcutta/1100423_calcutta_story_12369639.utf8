The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Letter seller in lock-up
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Letter seller in lock-up

	Whenever Haru Mohan Ghora was short of cash, he would reach inside his postmans bag and sell unregistered letters and packets containing documents to the kabadiwala.        
	Ghora, who was arrested for the crime in July 2007, was sentenced to four years rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs 10,000 on Thursday.         
	The Howrah court ruled that if the postman failed to pay the fine the jail term would be increased by a year.        
	It is unbelievable that a public servant who was supposed to deliver important documents to people sold them for a few rupees. Such offenders should be given strict punishment, said Indrajit Chatterjee, the Howrah district judge.        
	Police said a few residents had complained to Ashok Kumar Maity, the senior superintendent of the Howrah General Post Office, that Ghora had been regularly selling unregistered postal articles to vendors dealing in waste paper and old newspapers.        
	We learnt that Maity had asked one of his junior colleagues to keep a tab on Ghora, said an officer of Shibpur police station.        
	Police records suggest that on July 18, 2007, Gautam Chakraborty, a caretaker in the Howrah GPO, had called up Maity and told him that Ghora was selling unregistered postal articles to Lal Chand Shaw, a shopkeeper at Kali Babur Bazar in Shibpur.        
	Maity and an assistant superintendent, Snehasis Das, rushed to the spot and saw the postal articles were being weighed on a scale. They immediately alerted us, the officer said.        
	Ghora was arrested under IPC Section 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant) while Shaw was booked under Section 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property).        
	The cops learnt that Ghora had struck a deal with Shaw to sell unregistered letters and other documents at Rs 5 a kg.        
	The shopkeeper, however, was let off as the police failed to prove that he knew the items he had been buying were stolen.        
	The officer told Metro that Ghora had admitted during interrogation that he often sold unregistered letters and packets to supplement his income.        
	But he denied all the allegations during the trial. It was depositions by witnesses that clinched the prosecutions case, the officer said.         
	Of the 11 witnesses, nine had deposed against Ghora. The judge asked the chief judicial magistrate, Howrah, to start a case against the other two witnesses  Jayanta Chakraborty and Susanta Dey  under IPC Section 193 for giving false evidence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Campus cauldron over camera and card
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Campus cauldron over camera and card
                                    
	Protest rocked Jadavpur University last week, with students gheraoing the 15 members of the executive committee to protest the decisions to install closed- circuit cameras and make identity cards mandatory on the campus. The gherao was lifted after the authorities promised to include more students in the committee to review the decisions. Metro talks to both sides of the campus divide to know their stand

	Does not want: Closed-circuit television cameras anywhere on the campus and checking of identity cards during entry.              
	Reasons: Our security on campus is not under threat on a daily basis. On the few occasions the students security was compromised, it was the administration that was at fault. Like in 2005 when the vice-chancellor brought in police (following trouble over the expulsion of three students) and in 2009 when the authorities hiked tuition fees. After all these how could we be sure that the authorities have our interests in their minds?        
	The authorities are citing the stabbing of a student of electronic engineering in her department by an outsider to justify the decision to install cameras on the campus. But that was a freak incident.        
	As for the identity card, we are opposing the move because it would restrict the entry of outsiders into the campus. We dont want our university to be elitist.              
	Concerns: We feel the measures are aimed at denying us our freedom on campus and nipping any student protest in the bud. The campus would be a jail if the authorities have their way.                            A demonstration by students during the 52-hour gherao last week. A Telegraph picture      
	Expectations: We expect the review committee will be expanded to include more student representatives. The students must have a say in not just where the closed-circuit cameras would be installed but whether the security measures would at all be implemented.               
	Course of action: We have lifted the gherao but our movement against the installation of cameras and other measures is on. We are putting up posters, distributing leaflets and going from class to class to spread awareness on the issue. We will scale up our protests if the authorities ignore our concerns.              
	Deadline: We expect the committee will be ready and meet within a week. It may take some time for it to prepare the report.              
	Pradip Narayan Ghosh, vice-chancellor                    Pradip Narayan Ghosh      
	Wants: Closed-circuit cameras at strategic places on the campus, such as Aurobindo Bhavan (the main administrative building), Central Library and the gates. Students to carry identity cards and visitors to register at entry points. Cars to enter only through gate 3.        
	Reasons: The cameras will help us provide security to the students.        
	Consider the stabbing of the electronic engineering student. The culprit walked out of the department and then the campus but no one could catch him.        
	Had there been closed-circuit cameras, we could have identified him from the footage and later police could have caught him.        
	The cameras will also help us identify the sources of all alcoholic and narcotic substances on campus. The careers of many students are being ruined because of the abuse of these substances.        
	The incident of ragging, during which a girl was forced to consume narcotic and alcoholic substances, would not have happened had there been cameras.        
	The identity cards will help guards screen entry of people on the campus. All students entering the campus after 6pm will have to produce their cards. If outsiders are stopped at the gates, they will have to register their names and mention the purpose of their visit and the names of the persons they have come to meet.              
	Expectations: We want to install the cameras at the earliest. More student representatives will be included in the committee within a week.              
	Concerns: The students are protesting something that has been on the cards for the past four to five years. The measures could not be implemented earlier because adequate equipment was not available. The students are not realising that we are concerned about their safety. Why should we try to curb their freedom if it does not affect others?              
	Course of action: The security measures will be implemented irrespective of whether the students want it or not. Their views will be heard but I dont think that the decision on cameras will be changed.              
	As told to Chandreyee Chatterjee

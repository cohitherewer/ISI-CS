The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seal on Presi freedom
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Seal on Presi freedom
  - Governor gives nod, alumni in wait-and-watch mode          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Presidency College has taken the final de jure step towards autonomy with governor M.K. Narayanan on Wednesday putting his seal of approval on a bill that seeks to free the college from government control.        
	The government will now have to issue a gazette notification, following which College Streets landmark institution can function as a unitary university.        
	A source said the notification  expected in a fortnight  will mention the date from when the 193-year-old institute will start its new journey.        
	Several Presidency alumni, however, think that it would take a few years before real changes  ones that go beyond the change in nomenclature  are introduced.        
	Some provisions in the Presidency University Act retain legacies of the CPM education czars. Most of the key decisions of the university will have to be vetted by its court, where graduate representatives loyal to the party will have a big say. Unless such provisions are repealed, Presidency cannot be turned into a world-class institution, said a professor of the college.        
	Officials said the government was drawing up a list of competent faculty members and administrative officials for Presidency University.        
	The authorities are trying to fast-track the process of recruiting faculty members and introducing a new form of pedagogy at Presidency, as the state government wants the new varsity to start undergraduate and postgraduate courses from the current academic year itself.        
	We are trying our best to ensure that postgraduate admissions are held in the new system, said Amitava Chatterjee, the officiating principal of Presidency College.        
	Admission for undergraduate courses at Presidency has already started while that for postgraduate ones are to begin towards the end of this month.        
	Presidency is taking in undergraduate students as a CU affiliate. Once the act takes effect, hopefully in a month or so, they would be registered with Presidency University. That has to be done before Calcutta University starts issuing registration certificates to the first-year students of its affiliates, said a Presidency teacher.        
	The Presidency University Bill was passed in March 2010 and sent to the governor in April. The governor had raised some concerns and sent the bill back to the government.         
	The bill was returned to Raj Bhavan last Thursday.

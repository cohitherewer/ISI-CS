The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Frames of festive countdown
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Frames of festive countdown
                                        
	THE REEL HERO: When the going gets tough, the devout get going. No wonder members of the Shah Rukh Khan Fan Club are worshipping Durga in Kolkata Knight Riders colours. Our beleaguered team is in need of Durgas blessings, says club secretary Arnab Roy, keeping an eye on artists in a Kestopur studio, off VIP Road, giving final purple-and-gold touches to the idol. The KKR goddess will then move to the SRK fan club base in New Town for Puja. After five days of festivity, the idol will travel to Mannat in Bandra as a belated birthday (November 2) gift to the screen idol once he is back from Berlin, where he is shooting for Don 2.            
	THE REAL HEROES: A far cry from the gimmicky KKR idol is the Swanirbhar Durga on the Bidyut Sangha grounds in Beleghata. Here, more than 100 real-life heroes  some call them Durgas in flesh and blood  are fighting to be self-reliant. Women from the Aila-devastated blocks of the Sunderbans as well as other impoverished areas of Bengal like Amlashol, Pingla and Sabang are plying their handicraft in huts lining the path to the idol in a puja started by Senate, an NGO, which has trained them. In the adjacent field, their mats, scroll paintings, baskets and more are being sold. We are earning our bread while enjoying the festive ambience. We have been given organisational duties here as well, said Aila victim Laxmi Mondal of Saatjelia in the Sunderbans.          
	POWER CENTRE: Rituparna Sengupta, who has shared screen space with SRK in an ad shoot, will inaugurate the puja at the Shah Rukh Khan Fan Club.They insist that I do it, she said while attending the inauguration of the Manicktala Chaltabagan-Lohapatty puja on Monday evening. I have always been very involved with the Chaltabagan Lohapatty puja. They always try something new and do some good work for the people, the Tollywood star said about the puja that is a regular CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja awardee.

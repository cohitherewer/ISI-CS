The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops as all-rounders at Eden
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops as all-rounders at Eden
  - Power supply apart, Lalbazar to manage it all for South Africa Test        A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Walk-in to water pouches, Lalbazar will man it all at the Eden Gardens for the India vs South Africa Test.        
	From Sunday to Thursday  unless Team India decides to be kind to the cops and do a Nagpur  the men in uniform must manage everything at the Eden (see box), with the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) making it clear that it can do nothing.        
	A team of senior police officers inspected the stadium on Wednesday afternoon and made Lalbazars role official. We will be overseeing everything from visitor entry to player security, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police, headquarters, after checking the preparedness of the work-in-progress stadium.        
	That the floodlight remains a dark spot was clear when Shamim stated that the police would continue to perform all its responsibilities at the Eden apart from ensuring uninterrupted power supply for the floodlights. Since this is a Test match, we are not bothered about that, he then added.        
	After the floodlight fiasco during the December 24 ODI between India and Sri Lanka  and the subsequent storm raised by the police commissioners comment of not allowing another day-night match at the Eden till corrective measures were taken  Lalbazar had told the CAB that it would only get involved in the security aspect at the stadium and not perform duties like checking tickets or arranging for water pouches.        
	But with the CAB tossing the ball back into the cops court, Wednesday saw a serious recce.              
	The open view of the ground through the gaping holes in the demolished galleries was back to bother the police. Earlier, in the run-up to the Sri Lanka ODI, Lalbazar had hauled up the CAB for not plugging the holes.        
	It was action replay time on Wednesday, with a crowd on the street gaping at the ground. This must be covered at once because the players will be practising here from two days before the match and this could lead to chaos, said Shamim.        
	Water pouches was another worry. Every day three lakh water pouches will be kept ready. We inspected the taps of drinking water, the seat numbers in galleries, and the patchwork needed on the stadium premises, said Shamim.        
	According to sources, there will be around 1,500 policemen in and around Eden on the days of Test. Like previous matches, our men will take up position in the gallery as well as around the boundary rope, said another officer.        
	Besides checking tickets and quenching thirst.

	A Barasat court on Wednesday pronounced four men guilty for the murder of a key witness in the Parthapratim Roy Burman kidnap case.         
	The fifth additional judicial magistrate, Chaitali Chatterjee, will sentence Sirajul Mullick, Pintu Mullick, Dolu Mondal and Nazrul Mondal on Thursday.        
	The four were found guilty under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (criminal act by several persons) of the IPC. They were directly involved in the killing of Rafique Ahmed Chowdhury. The case was investigated by officers of Haroa police station, said special public prosecutor Sisir Nandi.        
	Roy Burman, one of the owners of Khadims, was abducted on July 25, 2001, on his way to a Tiljala warehouse. He sustained a bullet injury in his arm and was kept hostage in a house at Pakuria in Haroa, North 24-Parganas. Chowdhury had rented out the house to the gang and knew the members. The ransom negotiation happened in his presence.        
	The four hurled bombs and shot Chowdhury as he was heading home on his bicycle around 10.30am on July 17, 2002. The four, who had been employed by the kidnap gang, were arrested within a year of the murder, said a police officer.        
	Chowdhurys witness account was important since he knew the gang members, added the officer.         
	Girl body found: The body of Bantala resident Champa Khatun, 7, was found beside a roadside ditch on Wednesday. She had gone missing on Tuesday evening. Police suspect that she had been raped and murdered.         
	Suicide: M.M. Maniwel, 28, was found hanging in his Charu Market home on Wednesday. A suicide note was found.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Aftab Ansari during a court appearance                                  
	The state government on Monday pleaded with a high court division bench to uphold the death sentence awarded to Aftab Ansari and three of his associates by a trial court in the American Center attack case.         
	The authorities, however, left it to the bench to decide the fate of three other accused who had also been awarded death in the case.        
	Ansari and his associates had moved the high court against the death sentences.         
	The sentences awarded to Aftab Ansari, Zamiluddin Nasir, Musarat Hossein and Sakir Akhtar should not be changed. The high court should decide the fates of Hasrat Alam, Rehan Alam and Adil Hossain, who were also awarded capital punishment, public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami told the division bench of Justice A. Banerjee and Justice K. Mukherjee.        
	AK-47 bullets were found in the bodies of the five security personnel who had been killed in the American Center attack. According to the sub-section 4 of clause 27 of the Arms Act, capital punishment should be awarded to the user of this type of ammunition (AK-47 bullet). It has been proved that Ansari and three others had used the ammunition to kill the five, added Goswami, who finished his submission on Monday.        
	The investigators in their chargesheet before the trial court had claimed that all six were equally guilty and demanded their death sentences.         
	Ansari and nine others had been arrested in connection with the American Center attack on the morning of January 22, 2002.        
	Basudeb Majumdar, the 12th judge of city sessions court, had awarded death sentences to seven of the accused on April 27, 2005.         
	Submissions made by both parties have been completed. Only Shahid Imam, the lawyer representing Ansari, will file his reply within a couple of days. The court will then pronounce its judgment, advocate Jayanta N. Chatterjee, who is representing Hasrat and two others, said.

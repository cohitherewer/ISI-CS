The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pandal-hop with purpose
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pandal-hop with purpose
                                        MY PUJA
      MALINI BHAGAT      
	Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, tells Metro how her Puja was different this year, as a judge for the The Telegraph Festival of Joy              
	I went pandal-hopping with the family on Panchami night and was back home only at 6am. But that did not dampen my spirit  I was back on the parikrama trail at 8.30am, this time as a judge for The Telegraph Festival of Joy.        
	Of the five housing complexes I visited on Sashthi, the one I liked best was Golf Tower, particularly its community participation and hospitality. The women of the complex had an eye on every detail  from providing stationery to the children for the sit-and-draw competition to seeing whether the lighting was functioning smoothly to escorting elderly residents in a wheelchair.         
	The puja had a personal touch. The organisers said every child of the complex had made cards that were distributed among the residents. On the cards, one side displayed the panchali and the other had the roster of the five festive days. Its these little things that make up the festive spirit.         
	Co-operative Housing ONGC Block C and ONGC Green Tower (A amp; B block) were studies in contrast. While the former met most of the Festival of Joy criteria, the latter was yet to be ready for Puja.                         A safe and inclusive Puja was the theme of The Telegraph Festival of Joy      
	The warmth of one and the indifference of the other was stark. In a housing complex, the ambience is very important. The right atmosphere was missing at City High on Prince Anwar Shah Road, too. Though our visit was scheduled, there was not a chair to sit and the banners not prominently placed.         
	What impressed me at ONGC Block C  much more than the glitz of South City  was young girls busy drawing alpana. An elderly woman announced: Aami bhishon khushi, aami ekhane boshe dekhbo (I am very happy, I will sit here and watch them). Though it was not a big-budget puja, it had the flavour and feel of Durga Puja.         
	For me, the beauty and soul of a puja in a housing complex is not in its grandeur and display but in the participation of each and every member of the community  whether a child, a senior citizen or a disabled resident. We require the human touch not showmanship  to make Durga Puja a festival of joy.

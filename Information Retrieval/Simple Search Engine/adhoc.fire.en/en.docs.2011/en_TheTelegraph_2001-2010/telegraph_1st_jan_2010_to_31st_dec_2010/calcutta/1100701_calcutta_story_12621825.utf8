The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pool project to bring back blooms 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pool project to bring back blooms

	Lilies may bloom once again in the once-beautiful Lily Pool of Rabindra Sarobar, thanks to the initiative of about a dozen enthusiasts, who are trying to restore this largish patch of green opposite Bengal Rowing Club to its former serenity.        
	Veteran photographer Arun Ganguly, 72, who has just brought out a book entitled The Lure of the Lakes, says he has been visiting the lake and the Lily Pool from childhood when it used to be an oasis of peace with ornamental vegetation all around. Deer used to graze around and rare birds could be spotted.        
	But when he went around more recently he found the Lily Pool in a mess, dry as a bone.        
	Mudar Patherya, who along with a few others have taken up the task of cleaning up the mess, says when they started the project in February, vegetation was running wild all over. Now, after almost four months, the spot measuring 11 bighas 11 cottahs, has been cleaned up, the pathways cleared, and waterproofing of the two pools complete.         
	The two rock gardens have been deweeded and vegetation will be planted anew. The small bridge across one pond and some raised platforms have been repaired and their structures reinforced.         
	CESC has given a power connection and now a fountain can be installed. The rowing club has promised to provide all the plants necessary here and stone benches will be installed once again.        
	Patherya says they have raised Rs 4 lakh and their budget is Rs 25 lakh for lights, fountains and an aquarium.        
	The lily pool will be filled up with up to four feet of water and ornamental plants will be planted thereafter. Hopefully, in the near future.

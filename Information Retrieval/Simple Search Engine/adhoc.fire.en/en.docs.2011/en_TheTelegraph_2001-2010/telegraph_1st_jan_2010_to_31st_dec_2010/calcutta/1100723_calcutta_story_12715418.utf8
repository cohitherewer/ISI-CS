          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The next time you find a cockroach in your food served on a long-distance train, blame the railway ministry instead of a subsidiary.        
	The ministrys Catering Policy 2010, which will come into immediate effect, strips the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd (IRCTC) of the responsibility of serving food on 300-odd long-distance trains, including Rajdhani Express, Duronto and Shatabdi Express.        
	The responsibility will now be taken over by the ministry.        
	IRCTC, a public sector undertaking under the railway ministry, was set up during Mamata Banerjees first tenure as railway minister from 2000 to 2001.        
	Around 300 long-distance trains now offer catering service. IRCTC directly controls 10 per cent of the operations and hire private agencies to handle the rest.        
	In the new system, the railway ministry will progressively take over the management of all mobile catering services, including base kitchens and pantry cars.        
	The railway board will determine the menu and tariff for standard meals and breakfast. The catering charges for tea and coffee, too, will be decided by the board.        
	The role of IRCTC, which was given the responsibility of serving food on trains in 2005, will be restricted to managing food plazas, food courts and fast food centres at railway stations, as well as running the e-ticket service and the Rail Neer business.         
	All major and minor catering units will be awarded and managed by the zonal railways, except food plazas, food courts, fast food units. All such contracts presently being managed by IRCTC, on expiry of the contract period, will be awarded by the zonal railways, the new policy states.        
	The Jan Ahar stalls at various stations will be run by zonal railways. Well serve regional cuisine from these stalls at a cheap rate, said Derek OBrien, the chairman of the railway passenger services committee.         
	We were receiving too many complaints from passengers. The minister asked us to understand passengers problems and make recommendations without bowing to any pressure. We were also asked to break cartels, if there are any, and come up with a transparent policy, OBrien added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 2 girls die after lunch at school
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      2 girls die after lunch at school

	Two Class IV students of a Bansdroni school died soon after being taken ill during recess when they apparently ate lunch they had brought from home.        
	Doctors at MR Bangur Hospital, where 13-year-old Jyoti Singh and 11-year-old Payel Pande were taken, said the Bansdroni residents showed signs of poisoning. Jyoti died on the way while Payel died within a few minutes of reaching the hospital, said hospital superintendent Subhasis Saha.        
	Payel was unconscious and frothing at the mouth. She was not in a position to undergo any procedure to pump out the poison. There were froth marks on Jyotis mouth, too. It seems the children suffered poisoning but we can only ascertain that after the post-mortem, he added.        
	It was around 1.30pm when students of Devendra Dwivedi School saw Jyoti slump to the ground  some said she had just eaten lunch brought from home  and alerted the teachers. When we reached the spot, Jyoti was unconscious and frothing at the mouth. She was taken to a room where we splashed water on her face. Her family members were asked to come over, said a teacher. Around the same time, Payel, too, started displaying similar symptoms.        
	Jyoti was taken to MR Bangur Hospital at 2pm, after father Ashok reached the school. Payel, who lives with her uncle as her father works as a contract labourer in Midnapore, was taken there minutes later.         
	Neighbours claimed Jyoti had told her father that a friend had given her rat poison. The statement could not be confirmed because Ashok, an auto driver, was too shocked to speak. The neighbours also claimed that the girls might have survived had the school been prompt in sending them to hospital.

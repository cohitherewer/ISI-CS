The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | His writings on the walls of change
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      His writings on the walls of change

	Calcuttans are no strangers to graffiti. One look at the walls and you know this is one city where everyday architecture has an intimate link with the brush and paint. Every political party puts its message where the wall is, making graffiti an iconic  albeit dubious  part of the social template that is Calcutta.        
	The explanation draws a smile from the Paris-based Olivier Rizzo aka Speedy Graphito, a pioneer of the street art movement in France and one of the best-known graffiti artists of our times.        
	Everything can be political, whether it be graffiti, poetry, songs or any form of art, said the painter/graffiti artist with the Tintin tuft.        
	On his first visit to Calcutta to paint the town, literally, Speedy plans to transform the inner walls of the La Martiniere School for Girls on January 5-6, Studio21 on Dover Terrace on January 7-8 and the Government College of Art amp; Craft on Chowringhee on January 9-11.        
	In conjunction with Bonjour India, the festival of France, and Studio21, the 48-year-old artist will leave his mark of urban cool on the whitewashed walls of these locations, with brush and stencil. He prefers the brush as it allows one to adapt to the contours of the surface rather than be limited by it.        
	The other tool usually associated with graffiti work, spray cans, is out for now  the spray cans we got hold of here arent very good.        
	That wouldnt stop Speedy from creating graffiti in his typical style; a busy mash of realistic, larger-than-life images of historical figures, cartoon/comic strip characters and everyday objects all thrown into a situational whirlpool, always underlined with a sense of humour and a hint of satire. His work does carry a socio-political message but is never burdened by it. The smile that plays on the corners of this pop art helps lighten the context.         
	With the mainstream still waking up to the stature of graffiti as a bona fide art form, Speedy explains the pseudonym. When I was growing up and drawing on the streets, I didnt want to offend my parents. I worked really fast, so I chose a name that would ring like a brand. He has worked on an installation graffiti for New Age music pioneer Jean Michael Jarres concert, transformed the plaza at Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and even worked in spanking clean Tokyo.        
	The next step? Speedy hopes the blatant political propaganda that lines the walls of Calcutta will one day grow into poetry. And he said that without knowing the chief ministers poetic lineage or the chief ministerial aspirants poetic ambitions.

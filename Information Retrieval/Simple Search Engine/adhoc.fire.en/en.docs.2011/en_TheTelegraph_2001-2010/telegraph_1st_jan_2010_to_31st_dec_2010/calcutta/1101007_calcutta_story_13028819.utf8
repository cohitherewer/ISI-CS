The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dadas new nightmare: not a fast pitch but slow traffic
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dadas new nightmare: not a fast pitch but slow traffic

	King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck left Taj Bengal around 8.10am on his way to the Dakshineswar temple. The 12-car convoy drove down AJC Bose Road, Esplanade Row East, Central Avenue, Shyambazar and BT Road, throwing traffic haywire along the route.        
	On his way back, the king visited Bhutan House on Mall Road in Dum Dum, prompting police to stop traffic on VIP Road between 10am and 10.25am. The ripple effect spread across large parts of the city, with at least 130 passengers missing their scheduled flights between 10am and 1pm. Seventy passengers of seven flights couldnt fly as scheduled as they were stuck on the road, said an Indigo official.                The traffic situation   is becoming a nightmare in   Calcutta.

	Around 60 people booked on 12 Jet Airways flights, too, failed to turn up on time. Air India kept its counters open beyond the stipulated hour.      
	The effect was also felt on the AJC Bose Road flyover and the Park Circus connector, where traffic came to a halt in the afternoon. Diamond Harbour Road, near Ekbalpore, was also chock-a-block.        
	Pre-puja blues        
	Civic workers started working on a patch of Rashbehari Avenue near the Gariahat crossing since morning, disrupting traffic flow. The chaos spilled onto Hazra Road. The steady drizzle and the rain of Puja shoppers added to the chaos. A rally on RR Avenue choked Esplanade in the afternoon.        
	How to beat it        
	The rain is likely to get heavier and the shoppers surge will only swell, so police have advised people to leave early for their destinations. And pray.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clothes help identify son 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Clothes help identify son 
          POULOMI BANERJEE                          Ghosh at SSKM on Monday. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	Anil Ghosh must have captured many heart-wrenching moments as Satyajit Rays assistant cameraman but nothing seems to have steeled him for the shock awaiting him in the autumn of his life.        
	Ghosh and wife Anju on Monday identified the body of their only son Ankush, who died in the Stephen Court blaze last Tuesday.         
	Some more bodies were brought to SSKM Hospital today and Ankushs mother identified his body among them, said the 67-year-old, who had been a member of Rays crew since 1962.        
	Ankush was close to his mother. A glass of sherbet his mother had prepared for him is still on our table, covered, said Ghosh, his voice breaking.        
	Ankush, who as a child accompanied his father to Rays sets, wanted to set up his own business but his familys financial condition came in his way.        
	He took up one job after another in an attempt to improve his prospects, Ghosh recalled. The 29-year-old left his job with Airtel and joined Microsys Technical Enterprise, on the fifth floor of Stephen Court, as sales manager on March 16.        
	He was happy with this job and asked his mother to get a passport made for him as he might have had to go abroad, said Ghosh. On Tuesday, Ankush had left home early as he had a meeting with his seniors. He asked me to choose a tie for him. He was wearing dark brown trousers and a white shirt, so I chose a brown tie, recounted Ghosh. It was the clothes that helped Ankushs mother identify his body.        
	The familys TV was not working, so Ghosh and Anju had no clue that their sons office was on fire. When Ankush failed to return till 8.30pm, his mother contacted his friends in the locality. It was then that she came to know about the blaze and rushed to Park Street.

Waqar Younis  You are adaptable and easygoing but emotional. You take life as it comes. You are competent and efficient at work. You are intuitive, with a spiritual streak in you. You find it hard to face adversity or live in a harmful environment. Others admire you for your liberal views. Be generous, but never go out of your way to help others. You prefer a relationship that is stable and allows you space.

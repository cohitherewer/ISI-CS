The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | AC bursts in trade hub hotel
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      AC bursts in trade hub hotel
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The AC that burst at Hotel Rituraj. (Amit Datta)                                  
	An air-conditioner burst in a hotel in Burrabazar on Thursday afternoon, filling the room with dense black smoke and giving its two occupants a scare.         
	The incident occurred at Hotel Rituraj, a multi-storeyed building on Madan Mohan Burman Street. Seventy-odd visitors from Bangalore, including the two affected occupants, had checked into the hotel just hours before the incident.         
	I was with my grandson in room 304 when I heard a loud bang. Within seconds the entire room filled with black smoke. I was unable to see anything and started shouting for help, said the shaken occupant of the room. She and her grandson were rescued by her co-travellers. The other members of the group also fled their rooms and gathered in the reception. They later demanded a refund from the hotel.         
	Officers of Jorasanko police station said many people might have lost their lives had the building caught fire. It would have been impossible for tenders to reach the hotel. A number of lorries were blocking the entire approach road, said an officer.         
	The cops later detained the drivers of two lorries parked in front of the hotel.         
	Firemen at the site said a short-circuit had possibly caused the AC to burst because of excessive load.        
	Members of the Bangalore group said some of them had even complained to the hotel staff about the shoddy electrical wiring and narrow corridors.         
	The building lacks proper ventilation. The windows are covered with thick glass that will be very difficult to break. In case of a fire, the occupants might die of suffocation, said G.N. Manjula, a member of the group.         
	The hotel owner, Anup Singh Chawla, dismissed the mishap as a minor incident. Nothing happened. Somebody called up the fire brigade, making a mountain of a molehill, he insisted.        
	Around 1.45pm, a fire broke out in a meter box at Calcutta University. Two tenders put out the flames.

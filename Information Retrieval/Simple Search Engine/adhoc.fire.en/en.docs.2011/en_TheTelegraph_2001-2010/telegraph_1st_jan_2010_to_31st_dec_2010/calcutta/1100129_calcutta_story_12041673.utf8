                      Parallel perspectives                    Three young minds, three radical expressions, three visions, as it were. The Other Vision, the ongoing show curated by Manas Acharya, offers viewers a parallel universe of figure, form and lineation, a glimpse of the creative impulses of those at the up-and-coming fringe of the citys art spectrum. Sambaran Das, Goutam Khamaru and Anup Mondal, all in their late 20s, collectively conjure up images of urban disconnect. Their conjoined milieu shares themes of abandonment and despair, giving shape to other images of not just what the eyes see, but what it perceives. Sambaran Dass strength lies in his inanimate studies, the charcoal drawing-like quality of dry brush acrylic-on-canvas offering infinite interpretations of loneliness as its essence. Khamaru works with his sense of humour in place. His Animal Series features creations familiar yet not easily recognisable; and functional opposites collide to question what constitutes Nature. Typically without a cognitive face, Mondals aluminum figures are distorted, with shapes that seem to haunt dreams of despair.

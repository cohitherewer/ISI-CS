The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops hunt for Nepal gang 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops hunt for Nepal gang 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Nepalese gang might have been behind the murder and robbery at a Gariahat flat last Friday, police said on Monday. Pen manufacturer Pawan Drolias flat was robbed of Rs 25 lakh in cash and jewellery and his domestic help Annapurna Sharma was found dead.        
	While interrogating two acquaintances of the main accused  20-year-old domestic help Amrit  the cops have learnt that he was part of the gang. Arjun, one of Amrits friends who worked as a help in the Park Circus area, is also absconding since Friday afternoon, said an officer. A probe revealed Arjun, 19, had arrived in the city from Nepal six months ago.         
	The police have learnt that before joining the Drolia household, Amrit had worked in other flats in south Calcutta. Amrit was introduced to the Drolias by Badri, a security guard who works for one of their relatives in Salt Lake.         
	Amrit and Arjun lived in a rented house in Beniapukur along with another Nepalese man, Jeet, 45. Jeet has been working as a security guard in a nearby building for the past 32 years, the officer added.        
	The sleuths found a pair of jeans and a T-shirt in the Beniapukur house that Amrit had worn on Friday morning. The Drolias have identified the clothes, the officer said.         
	City detective chief Damayanti Sen said the operation had been carried out by more than one person. We suspect the involvement of a Nepalese gang and raids are on to nab them, she said.         
	The post-mortem on Annapurna has revealed that she died of an internal haemorrhage in the head and not a drug overdose as the cops had earlier suspected.         
	She was hit on the head with a blunt weapon. The post-mortem report has not indicated any poison in her stomach, said an officer.        
	According to him, the robbery plan was possibly hatched right after Amrit joined the household on March 30.         
	Pawan Drolia, who owns a pen factory in Belgachia, said: The police have failed to make any progress... they are not disclosing anything to us.         
	The police are also probing whether the same gang robbed a Creek Row flat by drugging the entire family last year.

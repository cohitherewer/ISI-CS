The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gift of the gag

										      SILLY IN THE CITY                                    
	One of the 68 women newly elected to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) was being interviewed. But her appreciative husband was answering the questions.         
	Evidently some husbands are not convinced that even if women can win elections, they can speak for themselves. In such cases, many women feel like throttling the man or biting his head off. But our councilor bore it patiently. She didnt even scream.         
	Towards the end, when the reporter asked her about her pastime, and her husband answered this too, she calmly reminded him that the questions were meant for her, not him. That shut him up.         
	Lesser women go through this too. I remember a lunch with a couple. I am very fond of both of them, and I am sure they are of me too, but the gentleman did not think I was capable of ordering my food.         
	I had been thinking of a nice juicy steak. When the waiter came and I, full of lust, was about to order the object of my desire, the gentleman broke in.         
	Fried fish for the lady, he announced.         
	Why? I wailed.         
	Because you are too fat and you dont need red meat. Same for the other lady, he said.         
	You are too fat too, he explaned to his wife.         
	And when the fried fish arrived, he pounced on it, swiftly tearing away the crumb cover and offering me two naked, slim slivers of fish that looked entirely crestfallen.         
	Now, this has no fat, he said. When his wife and I wanted to order ice cream, he sabotaged that too, ordering fresh fruit juice, unsweetened.         
	He saved me the trouble of ordering food that day, but I had to make another trip to the restaurant later to have that steak.         
	Sometimes the mans relentless voice can lead to violence. The recently deceased artist Louise Bourgeois describes her father at the dinner table.         
	What frightened me was that at the dinner table, my father would go on and on, showing off, aggrandising himself. And the more he showed off, the smaller he felt. Suddenly, there was a terrific tension, and we grabbed him  my brother, my sister, my mother - the three of us grabbed him and pulled him onto the table and pulled his legs and arms apart  dismembered him, right? And we were so successful in beating him up that we ate him up. Finished. It is a fantasy, but sometimes the fantasy is lived.         
	It led to her work The Destruction of the Father, which is quite bloody, if metaphorically.         
	But the good news is our councilor did not have to employ any violent means. She asked her husband to shut up politely, and he did.         
	Sixty eight women in a house of 141. Men shutting up gracefully. If this is change, it is welcome. What next? Women replacing the male TV anchors?       CHANDRIMA S.

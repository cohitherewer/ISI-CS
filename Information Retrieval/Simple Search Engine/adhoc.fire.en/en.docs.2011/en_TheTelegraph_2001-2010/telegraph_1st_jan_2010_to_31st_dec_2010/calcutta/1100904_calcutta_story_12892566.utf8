                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Man lynched over slap
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A former army major with a history of mental problems was lynched near his Mahestala home on Friday morning after he allegedly slapped a female neighbour and threw tea on her face.        
	Police started a case of unnatural death but did not arrest anyone though at least 100 residents were involved in the lynching of 52-year-old Jayanta Sarkar. His body was sent for post-mortem.        
	The trouble started while the neighbour, a 24-year-old homemaker, was drawing water from a tubewell near the house where Jayanta lived alone.        
	It was about 8am. I saw Jayantakaku walk towards me holding a cup of tea. He asked me what I was doing. When I replied that I was collecting water, he held me by my hair, slapped me and then threw hot tea on my face, Dolon Chakraborty, the homemaker, said. I ran home and fainted, she added.         
	A mob assembled outside Jayantas home soon after. When the former major tried to flee, residents caught him and beat him up with sticks and bricks. He was later declared dead at a local hospital.         
	Jayantas younger brother Sukanta said the major had been removed from service in 1998 on medical grounds. He was posted at Binnaguri in north Bengal at the time.         
	Earlier that year, he and his wife had divorced. My brother had been depressed since. My sister-in-law now lives in Delhi with their only child, a girl. She was an army doctor but now has a private practice, he said.        
	Jayanta used to assault his brothers and their mother after returning to their ancestral house at Dharmatala near Nungi in Mahestala, forcing them to move out, according to Sukanta. He was admitted to an army hospital in the city twice for psychiatric treatment.        
	Gopa Mitra, a neighbour, alleged that Jayanta used to drink and smoke ganja and had attacked women and children from the neighbourhood several times. He had reportedly threatened neighbours with a knife.        
	Additional police superintendent (industrial) S.K. Chaudhary said: Nobody has lodged a complaint. We have started a suo motu case.

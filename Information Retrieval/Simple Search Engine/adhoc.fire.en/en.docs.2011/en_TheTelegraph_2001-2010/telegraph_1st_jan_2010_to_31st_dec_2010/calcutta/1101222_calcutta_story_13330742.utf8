The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trinamul wins 2 college polls
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Trinamul wins 2 college polls
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Manindra Chandra College students celebrate the Trinamul victory on Tuesday. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                  
	The Trinamul Chhatra Parishad (TCP) routed the Students Federation of India (SFI) in the student union polls at two colleges but the CPM-backed organisation managed to retain its hold at another.        
	The TCP bagged 32 of the 36 seats at Manindra Chandra College in Shyambazar, marking a turnaround from last years 16-20 loss, and won all 29 seats uncontested at Naba Ballygunge Mahavidyalay in Kasba.        
	At St Pauls College on Amherst Street, an SFI bastion, the CPM wing won all 29 seats.        
	We knew we would win at Manindra Chandra College but beating the SFI, which had ruled the union for 27 years, by such a huge margin was unexpected, said Baiswanar Chatterjee, the chairman of the advisory committee of the TCP.         
	Keeping in mind the recent spate of campus violence, the authorities did not take any chance and deployed police and RAF personnel around the college during the poll.        
	The election was peaceful. Around 1,200 students had turned up to vote, said Amit Chatterjee, the teacher-in charge of Manindra Chandra College.        
	Sukamal Dutta, the principal of Naba Ballygunge Mahavidyalay, said: The 29 nomination papers for as many seats were all filed by the TCP. It can be assumed that the union will be led by the TCP. The polls scheduled for January 11 becomes redundant.        
	An SFI spokesperson alleged that supporters of his organisation at the Kasba college were not allowed to file nomination papers. He refused to comment on the drubbing at Manindra Chandra College.

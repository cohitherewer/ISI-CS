                      Of colour and composition                    Ekta Singha is a talented, young city-based painter, determined to embark on a daunting journey fraught with impediments. Even as a teenager, Singha was well focused and knew exactly what she aimed at  she wanted to establish herself in the vast horizon of art. Now in her second year at the Government College of Art and Crafts, she is already considered one of the foremost upcoming talents of Bengal and is a recipient of the Presidents Award. Her artwork displays astonishing depth, diversity and maturity. Her current series of solo paintings, titled Toward Tomorrow, projects her unique mind-set and style. A kaleidoscope of vibrant colours and monochromatic hues, Singha creates pieces of art that are both attractive and inviting. Her abstract style and realistic themes explode on canvas as a scintillating combination of colour and composition. This series depicts an extraordinary change in the young painters career. Previously, a watercolour artist, Singha exhibited a leaning toward scenery and landscape earlier but this series is a statement of her creativity and diversity. Working in mixed media and creating art that is abstract and modern, Singha strives to break out of her mould and showcase herself in a new light. Her works flaunt her ingenuity and lust for life. Based on human life and emotions, her recent paintings are attractive in more ways than one. In their vitality and passion, these works are an excellent medium of introduction to Singhas new-found vigour and ardour.

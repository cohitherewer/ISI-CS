The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Guideline review by task force for schools
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Guideline review by task force for schools
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The nine-member committee tasked with recommending guidelines for approval and setting up of unaided private schools held its first meeting on Tuesday.        
	The members reviewed the present guidelines and decided to meet again soon to discuss what needed to be added and which provisions should be spelt out in clearer terms.        
	We agreed that the existing guidelines need to be re-formulated, a panel member said after the meeting in the school education departments office in Bikash Bhavan, Salt Lake.        
	The state government, the member added, has insisted that the panel meet the July 15 deadline for submission of the report.        
	Officials said the setting up of the committee was the first step towards implementing the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009.        
	A key concern of the members is to rid the school education system of red tape and corruption, and make it more modern and transparent.        
	The process now followed is archaic. We need to simplify it as well as take into account the rules laid down in the education act. We also want to make the system online, said Vikram Sen, the secretary of the school education department.        
	Barry O Brien, a committee member, said: We need to have a system where the applicants will be told that they will get their no-objection certificates (for setting up schools) within a deadline.        
	An official of an ICSE school, which got its provisional no-objection certificate two years after applying for it and is now waiting for a permanent one, highlighted the loopholes through which corruption seeps in.        
	Schools at times fail to meet all the requirements and are asked to do the needful. Its here that corruption seeps in, the official said.        
	The committee will also focus on ensuring proper distribution of quality schools, especially in the non-municipal areas. Calcutta is saturated but even now most applications for new schools come from within the city. We need to prioritise areas for new schools, said Sen.

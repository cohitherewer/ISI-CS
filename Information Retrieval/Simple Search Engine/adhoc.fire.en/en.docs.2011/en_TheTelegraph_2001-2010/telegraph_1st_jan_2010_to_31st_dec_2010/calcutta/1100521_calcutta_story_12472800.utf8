                      Tagore on celluloid                    Of Tagores prose works, his short stories are perhaps the most popular. Indeed, he is considered as the pioneer of this literary genre in Bengali. His works are frequently noted for their rhythmic, optimistic and lyrical quality. His stories mostly borrow from deceptively simple subject matter: the life of the common man. As part of the ongoing birth anniversary celebrations of Tagore, Tapan Sinha Foundation and Nandan, West Bengal Film Centre host Chalachitre Rabindranath, a festival of films based on his works by renowned filmmakers. To be screened today are Atithi (at 4.30 pm) and Teen Kanya (at 6.30 pm). A lyrical tale, Atithi (directed by Tapan Sinha) tells the story of Tarapada, a young Brahmin boy,who catches a boat ride with a village zamindar. It turns out that he has run away from his home and has been wandering around ever since. The zamindar adopts him, and finally arranges a marriage with his daughter. However, Tarapada runs away again the night before the wedding, refusing to be tied down by lifes duties and responsibilities. As a tribute to Tagore on his birth centenary in 1961, Satyajit Ray made Teen Kanya, an anthology of three short films adapted from Tagores short-story collection Golpoguchchho, which included Postmaster (a still from it appears here), Monihara and Samapti. The women characters are central to each of the stories, and poignantly reveal the varying nuances of the feminine mind.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A student scuffles with cops on the JU campus on Tuesday afternoon. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Police lathicharged students for the first time at Jadavpur University (JU) on Tuesday after supporters of a pro-Naxalite forum tried to stop the chief minister, who was on the campus to inaugurate an auditorium, from leaving.        
	Scores of students supporting the United Democratic Students Forum had assembled near Gate No. 1 while Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was attending the launch of the Gandhi Bhavan auditorium.        
	Black flag in hand, the students broke the police barricade as the chief minister was about to leave JU around 4.30pm. One student tried to lie down on the path of the convoy to make it stop.         
	The police managed to push back the agitators, allowing Bhattacharjees convoy to drive out amid the slogan Khuni mukhyo montri dur hato (Murderer chief minister go back).         
	Within seconds of the convoy leaving, lathi-wielding policemen started chasing the agitators around the lawn in front of the auditorium.         
	Oke maro, oke maro (Beat her, beat her), shouted a policeman to a female colleague as she chased a girl, who had allegedly slapped her, with a lathi. An officer of Jadavpur police station later said they had tried to restrain the agitators after being assaulted by them.         
	Raktim Ghosh, the general secretary of the forum, denied the allegation and said: The police attack was planned. They beat us mercilessly for holding a peaceful demonstration.        
	S.K. Choudhury, the additional superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, only said two cops, including a woman constable, were injured in the incident.        
	Some students told me that the police had beaten them with lathis while they were holding a demonstration. I am not aware of the incident as I was inside the auditorium at the time, said registrar P.K. Ghosh, adding that students had never been lathicharged on the campus.        
	Teachers who witnessed the episode said it was unfortunate that police beat up students in an educational institution.

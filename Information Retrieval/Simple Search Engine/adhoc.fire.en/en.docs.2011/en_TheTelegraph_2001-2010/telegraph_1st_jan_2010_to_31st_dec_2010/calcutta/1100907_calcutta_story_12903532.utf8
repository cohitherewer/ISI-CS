	It is always difficult for any panel with a political mindset to select an apolitical person (Final stamp on varsity tag, July 24). Although the three academicians entrusted with the task of selecting the first V-C of Presidency University are proficient in their respective fields, it is to be seen whether the panel can rise above the pressure from political circles to select an efficient person, above any political colour, for the post.           
	There can be no denying the fact that excessive political interference has eaten into the reputation of Presidency as the centre of excellence. Merely upgrading the college to university status will be considered a political gimmick if everything else continues to function in the same fashion. The very purpose of granting freedom to Presidency will thus be defeated.           
	In order to restore some of its lost glory to Presidency, a V-C with a brilliant academic record and lack of political patronage would be the perfect choice. However, given the present scenario, even the most optimistic Presidencian will have to rule out that possibility.

	The autocracy of kanwarias on trains is nothing new (Where rowdies rule the rakes, August 20). Every year during the month of Shravan passengers suffer because of the antics of these ticketless devotees. It is a pity that many ticket examiners are hand-in-glove with them. I think the railway management committee is responsible for this. The railway ministry needs to run some extra trains during the season to ease the crowd.             
	Atif Ayaz, Serampore,Hooghly                     
	lIndian Railways and Bihar GRP are responsible for the atrocities faced by passengers in the hands of kanwarias.           
	Every rail passenger in India knows how dangerous it is to travel through Bihar by train, particularly at night. Ticketless travelling and occupying reserved seats by force is an accepted practice in the region. Even women and elders are not spared.           
	Neither ticket checkers nor the railway police protect passengers. They prefer to keep their eyes shut.           
	Debasish Chatterjee,VIP Road                     
	lThe railway minister cannot be blamed for the trauma on tracks since the minister does not run the trains or manage the crowds in the compartments.           
	But credit goes to the minister for 80 per cent work done in a year, including introducing new trains in West Bengal almost on a daily basis.

	I am not quite sure whether Mamata is really changing her stripes (Mamata slams brake on strike, July 31). There may be a sense of political shrewdness creeping into her otherwise overtly emotional mind. But if she indeed sticks to her stand, so much better for us. However, on a humourous note, new and improved Mamata sounds quite similar to unnatatara bam front!             
	Anupam Deb, Ariadaha                     
	Mamata is showing a positive attitude by dispensing with the bandh culture. But she was also a party to this culture.           
	Bandhs are always disasters. No purpose has so far been served by them. It is all about showing off the muscle power a party commands over an area.           
	The sufferers include senior citizens, women and children. Students are hit by the loss of classes and delays in examinations. Daily wage-earners are the worst hit. Madam Mamata, please carry on with this positive attitude.           
	Prabir Ray Chaudhury,Address not given                     
	Yes, Mamata will stick to her stand and usher in better governance in Bengal once she comes to power.           
	Tapan Pattanayak,NSC Bose Road                     
	Yes I think Mamata is really changing her stripes but she needs help  from all the well-wishers of Bengal.           
	Akhilesh Bhaduri,Address not given                     
	 support Mamata Banerjees decision not to allow strikes of any kind in West Bengal. However, I am not sure if the Trinamul chief will stick to her decision since she has gone back on her words on several occasions.           
	I think political leaders should look for other ways to solve a problem rather than resort to strikes and disruptions.           
	However, leaders should not stop protesting against problems such as price rise. The Trinamul Congress needs to work very hard to develop a transparent and efficient administrative system.

	When Rabindrasangeet like Pagla hawa or Momo chitte are being remixed, I dont understand the noise about a films music being copied in another film (Ogo Bodhu release cancelled, August 27).             
	Most film-makers, in the name of original composition, anyway dish out music that can at best be called collages. The absence of originality and hurried penning of words ruin the fond memories we have of our favourite films or music. Remixes are a cheap and easy means for making quick profits. Remixes and remakes should be banned. Just deleting one song or scene will not do justice to the original.           
	It is strange that the Indian film industry is resorting to plagiarism to such an extent! Originality has no substitute. We are too tired of rip-offs!

	The report Honey, they shrunk our Eden, August 12, presented a visually charming image of the refurbished Eden Gardens. With the first match of the 2011 World Cup between England and India to be played at this venue, the stadium needed the sprucing up.             
	The CAB officials are thoughtfully making necessary changes in the seating arrangement. And I do not think that the heavens will fall apart because of the downsizing of the crowd capacity of the ground from 100,000 to 60, 000.           
	It is true that many spectators will be deprived of the live action, but for a mega event like the World Cup, spectator comfort is a priority.           
	The stadium may shrink, but it will surely rise to the roar of the crowds, who will enjoy the facilities being added.           
	P.B. Saha, Salt Lake                               
	We have been encouraged by the recent The Telegraph School Award for Excellence 2010. We applaud the winners and your newspaper for taking up this kind of an initiative. However the report titled A twang and a tremor, September 1, unfortunately snubbed the efforts of another young group of eager students.             
	We, the judges at the Speaking Festival (not a fest), found many comments of the report undeserving and in some cases inaccurate.           
	The participants were, for the first time, speaking English in public. They had written their own scripts based on a common framework, not a pre-set format. The Irish volunteers brought not only humour and their impressive Irish accents but encouragement and support by organising intra-school speaking festivals to select the finalists. This gave the students confidence and enjoyment in their speaking roles.           
	Further, the participants had been told that the judges would ask questions and that they could answer in Bengali as bi-lingual strategies are universally accepted. It is rare that these students get such an opportunity to speak out for themselves unlike students from more elite schools.           
	The atmosphere during the prize-giving ceremony was electric and the students where ecstatic in their celebration of the joy of speaking, even if one is not perfect.

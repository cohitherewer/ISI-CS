The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Day of disruption and downpour
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Day of disruption and downpour
          OUR BUREAU                                                      (From top) A cloud of dust blew across the city following strong winds in the afternoon; pedestrians caught in the shower; and vehicles stand bumper-to-bumper on Rashbehari Avenue.

	Tuesday was a day of disruption in the city, from Kumartuli down several arteries to the airport.        
	While the sudden showers and the strong winds in the afternoon threatened to derail the schedule at the idol hub and disrupted flights, the visit by Bhutans king threw traffic haywire across the city.        
	A late Puja had raised hopes of a dry run-up among Kumartuli artisans. That hope now lies shattered.        
	We thought we wouldnt have to bother to save the almost-ready idols from the rain this year because the monsoon was expected to be over before we start giving the finishing touches. But though it rained less this year, it rained at all the wrong times, Babu Pal, the joint secretary of the Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskriti Samity, rued after Tuesdays rain.        
	As the artisans will have to start delivering the idols from Wednesday, they cant afford to have their works ruined now. But thats exactly what happened on Tuesday.         
	Idols that have already been painted got discoloured because of the rain that lashed in through shop-openings and plastic covers. Theyll have to be re-painted. The ones that are still taking shape need to be dried, Babu explained.        
	Mintu Pal, another joint secretary of the association, said he was more worried about delivering the idols than the damage.        
	Delivery starts tomorrow and Im keeping my fingers crossed that it wont rain during the delivery. Its difficult to carry such big idols through the rain and muddy, slippery streets.        
	The sudden showers also spawned trouble for puja organisers and kept many shoppers away from the malls and stores.         
	The rain forced us to stop painting the outside of the pandal today. A days loss wont be much of a problem as our work is progressing well, but if it continues to rain well be in trouble, said Manoj Sau of Mudiali Club.        
	A source in Sealdah Railway Athletic Club said: Around 40 per cent of the pandal work is left. Our opening is scheduled for 11th. But if it rains in the run-up to the puja, we are ruined.        
	Badal Bhattacharjee of the College Square puja echoed the same fear.        
	If organisers are worried about meeting the deadline, shop owners fear their business would take a hit in a wet run-up to the puja.        
	A Forum spokesperson said Tuesdays footfall dipped by half. The revenue loss is quite alarming.        
	At the airport, bad weather and strong winds affected flights for nearly an hour from 12.30pm. Airport sources said six city-bound flights had to hover over the airport for 45 minutes before they were allowed to land.        
	The departure of four flights had to be delayed.        
	Traffic along several arteries  including AJC Bose Road, Belvedere Road, Kidderpore Road, Red Road, Government Place (East), Chittaranjan Avenue and College Street  took a hit because of the kings movement down these stretches.        
	Traffic was heavy following the rain. Then the roads had to be cleared because of the VVIP movement. The chain effect left several roads choked, said an officer of the traffic police department.        
	King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk left Taj Bengal for Calcutta University, where he attended the convocation, around 2.10pm.        
	Things were bad since the afternoon following a huge rally in Metro channel and then the kings visit brought traffic to a standstill on Red Road, said an officer.        
	It took over an hour from 2.30pm to restore normality, he added.        
	Corporation sources said 11 trees were uprooted across the city, another reason for the traffic disruption.        
	It took me two hours to reach my office on CR Avenue today from my house in Salt Lake. Normally, it takes only 45 minutes. I was stuck near Sealdah forever, said 27-year-old Arundhuti Chatterjee.        
	The Met office attributed the rain on a low-pressure formation over the west-central Bay of Bengal.         
	The formation is intensifying and is likely to stay for a day or two. It will cause thundershowers in and around the city for the next one or two days, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.                          
	Since cars slow down in the rain so there is naturally a congestion that is created across the city. Also some trees fell down in places like Southern Avenue and disrupted traffic flow. We had to deploy our disaster management team to clear those, said the DC (traf fic) Calcutta police.

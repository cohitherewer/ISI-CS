                                                                                                                         3                                      Letters
           Past perfect: Kudos to Renate Kant and the Intach team for restoring The Last Supper (picture above) painted by Johann Zoffany in April 1787 (Masterpiece restored by enormous commitment, July 5). Calcutta not only has many heritage buildings but also priceless manuscripts and paintings of great historical value. These need to be carefully preserved and stored away from humidity and dust. Some are housed in National Library but I must point out that the walls of the library, especially in the new wing, are damp and can damage the masterpieces.                                     
	After reading the report Pollution big boys ply at night, July 8, I kept wondering whether anyone was at all monitoring the implementation of the ban on old commercial vehicles. In the past six months, many of the cabs I have ridden seemed older than 15 years.           
	But this is West Bengal. The late Jyoti Basu and his ilk demolished the rule of law in this state since the late Sixties. I am curious to know whether the court is monitoring implementation of its orders, for I have little expectations from the government of West Bengal, Calcutta police or the toothless pollution control board.           
	Your revelations, even though on expected lines, surprised me. I had not expected a hundred per cent failure by taxis on the emission count. Ninety per cent, may be, but not 100!           
	I pin the blame on the nexus between the petite bourgeoisie  the cabal of private bus and taxi owners  and the CPM. The late Subhas Chakraborty was instrumental in creating the present situation. Subhas babu didnt care. Buddha babu had no time. And the Konars, the Dasguptas, the Yechuris and the Karats, from inside air-conditioned SUVs, said Death to the capitalist roaders (better if its cancer) as they moved on to more important matters like mobilising cadres for elections or opposing the nuclear deal.           
	Tapas Bandyopadhyaya,
  Address not given                                     
	The meet arranged at Town Hall for the civic body expert committee was a little short of a farcical exercise. It was essentially exhibitionist and an avoidable wastage of the already depleted corporation coffers (Enter, meet-greet-eat-experts, July 7).           
	The new board needs to do a lot to improve civic services. Attention is required in areas like adequate water supply, improvement in the sewage system, relieving the city of traffic snarls and preventing promoters from filling up water bodies to build highrises.           
	Steps need to be taken to eradicate malaria from the city with advice from expert doctors and endocrinologists, not celebrities.           
	P.B. Saha,
  Salt Lake           
	The expert committee that included actors, singers and painters will only help in securing the vote bank of the intelligentsia and not in improving civic services.           
	Singer Goutam Ghosh admitted that he was a misfit in the committee. Other members almost echoed him. In case of any severe crisis like the fire at Stephen Court, singers or painters will not be of any help to the mayor.           
	Supply of drinking water, concern for the environment, effective management of the drainage system, health and sanitation are some of the areas to be taken care of by the civic board. Hence, instead of artistes, inclusion of architects, civil engineers, eminent physicians and environmentalists in the committee is the need of the hour.           
	Also, delicious dishes for the committee members amount to misuse of the taxpayers money.           
	Subhankar Mukherjee,
  Burdwan           
	The idea of an expert committee comprising professionals from all walks of life who will use their expertise to improve Calcutta is welcome.           
	But we cannot deny that the members of the expert committee, being mostly celebrities, have little knowledge of the grim reality and the colossal problems that citizens face.           
	The average Calcuttan has to commute in crowded buses and trains, combat potholed roads, pass by the stench of garbage vats and wade through stagnant water. Once the meet-greet-eat sessions are over, the starry members should get down to business. The CMC should also have interactive sessions with common people.           
	Suparnaa Sinha Dutta,
  Tollygunge           
	lIt appeared that the expert committee did not know what to suggest. Here is some food for thought.           
	1. Removal of makeshift roadside eateries           
	2. Removal of places of worship from pavements           
	3. Disposal of solid waste in covered containers, preferably late at night or early in the morning           
	4. Road laying should be mechanised, thereby avoiding hazardous fumes           
	5. Trimming/felling of trees that pose accidental hazards           
	6. Lamp posts to be freed of power cables. Power lines should be transferred underground           
	7. Calcutta is possibly the only city to have manholes in the middle of the road impeding traffic flow. These should be shifted to pavements/roadsides           
	8. Rehabilitation of roadside settlements.           
	Niyoti Kumar Bose,
  Janak Road           
	As the saying goes, morning shows the day. The manner in which the attendees decided to ignore the seat cards to sit closer to the power-mongers tells you all you need to know about our civil society advisers at large.           
	As for valuable suggestions received, I liked the one about CMC forming its own police team. They can now impose a fine on mayor Sovan Chatterjee when he decides to ride his bike without a helmet.           
	Ajit Kundu,
  Address not given           
	lI have one suggestion to make to the CMC. The civic body should start night shift cleaning campaigns as is done in Visakhapatnam. The team starts work at midnight and finishes by 8am. The jobs include cleaning, painting, road repairs, and watering of park. This will also generate employment for 10,000 to 20,000 people.           
	S.R. Roy,
  Jadavpur                   
	What difference does it make if some imbecile kids of indifferent parents turn deaf? (Psst, its not music to GenX ears, August 20). Doctors have insisted that awareness building is the only way to save the kids from turning deaf. But we do believe in the liberty of every individual. If they prefer to go deaf, it is their informed choice, and as it is not harming others in any way, society need not intervene.             
	Rather, it is the other way round. Sensitising them about the perils of earplugged music might push them to switch to speakers. This will create noise pollution and nuisance in public places.           
	Most of todays kids have a blurred sense of public place and private space. Students of ersatz colleges commuting by local trains playing loud music on their cellphones are already a menace to sane people.           
	To the under-literate, creating cacophony is perceived as empowerment. Case in point: auto drivers, and youths commuting by local trains. We need not encourage them and increase the nuisance further.           
	Tapan Pal,
  Batanagar                   
	Apropos Panel push for lead-free colours, July 9, it is good to learn that the state environment department has taken an initiative to provide financial help to idol-makers of Kumartuli for buying non-toxic paints. As toxic paints have been in use for many years, an awareness campaign about the ill effects of such paints has to be launched. Not only artisans but potential customers of the idols should be sensitised about the need for using lead-free paints. In this context the CMC, the health department and the puja organisers can play a vital role in making lead-free paints popular.             
	Sukumar Ghosh,

	Congratulations on your extensive coverage of the wedding of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Calcutta girl Sakshi Singh Rawat in Dehra Dun (Secret life of Mr. And Mrs. MSD, July 9). Let all of us wish our Jamai Raja a happy and prosperous (though he is already prosperous beyond comprehension) conjugal life.             
	Dipak Bysack,
  New Alipore                   
	The report Upkeep hitch in Metro glitch, August 11, is not factually correct. The correct information and clarification on this subject are given below:             
	Maintenance of third rail is never ignored. The same is carried out regularly as per prescribed schedules. An adequate number of staffers exist for third rail maintenance. Maintenance units at Masterda Surya Sen (Bansdroni) station is very much in existence and is fully functional. Maintenance in the new sections, i.e. from Mahanayak Uttam Kumar (Tollygunge) to Kavi Nazrul stations, is being carried out regularly as per prescribed schedules.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A triumphant homecoming
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          A triumphant homecoming
          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          The four South Point High School students who participated in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair                        
	Three Class XII students of South Point High School were among a few lucky youngsters who bagged awards at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair at San Jose, California, in May. They were among a group of eight who represented the country, competing with around 1,500 from over 50 countries.         
	The team was selected by Initiative for Research and Innovation in Science, a collaboration of Intel, Confederation of Indian Industry and government of Indias department of science and technology.         
	Manosij Ghosh Dastidar and Anarta Roy won the Third Grand Award in the team projects category for their low-cost, single-shot hypodermic syringe, winning $1,000. Aritra Chowdhury won the Fourth Grand Award in the chemistry category with a $500 prize.         
	For Manosij and Anarta, the idea of the project arose from a TV programme on mass immunisation. We saw the same syringe being re-used, exposing the kids to the risk of infections. The only way to stop the practise was to come up with a syringe that cannot be reused, said Anarta. Aritras project was on the extraction of carbonaceous nanomaterials from natural soil sources.         
	Interacting with Nobel laureates and students from across the world was an added high. One of Manosijs favourite moments was interacting with British molecular biologist and Nobel laureate Richard J. Roberts.

	Lovers are bound in treasured moments         
	But when intimacy gives way to desolation         
	The confetti of life breaks up into ruins.         
	Crisis turns relationship into an ordeal.         
	Life turns out to be blue         
	The endless talks, The moonlight walks,         
	Cease all at once.         
	Life seems to close down its shutters on to a fragile end.

	Economically backward children in and around Nepal Bhattacharya Street can now access creative online games and self-explanatory learning tools from 8 in the morning to 9 at night. To help in their skill advancement, the Rotary Club of Lille has sponsored two computers, that were installed in front of the local Dharamdal Trust Model School. The computers will be unmanned and slum children can use them any time to widen their knowledge base. At a programme organised by NGO Tomorrows Foundation and Kalighat Byayam Samity on June 23, Michael Ducin  the ambassador of bioethics and corporate social responsibility of France  inaugurated the computers, as part of the Hole in the Wall project.         
	The systems are loaded with educative games and learning tools with bright visuals. They are easy to use and need no instructors, said Tathagatha Dutta, a member of the NGO.

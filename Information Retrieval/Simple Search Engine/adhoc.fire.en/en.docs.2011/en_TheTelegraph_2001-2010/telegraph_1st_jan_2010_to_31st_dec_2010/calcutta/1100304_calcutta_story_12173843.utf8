                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court stays 1400 insolvency cases 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                    
	The high court on Wednesday stayed over 1,400 insolvency declaration cases registered with the office of the Registrar of Insolvency since April 1, 2008.         
	Justice Sanjib Banerjee, who passed the stay order, also asked the state advocate-general to look up the legal provisions for prosecuting government officials like the registrar insolvency and official assignee, who were allegedly involved in the insolvency declaration scam.         
	Advocate-general Balai Ray said he would inform the court about the law on March 9, when the matter will be heard next.         
	Insolvency cases came under the courts scanner after some private banks moved petitions last month highlighting how some lawyers and government officials were misusing the insolvency law to help people evade credit card dues and loan repayment.         
	Besides ordering a stay on any fresh insolvency petition, the judge had asked the registrar-general to release advertisements asking people who were declared insolvent since April 1, 2008 to attend court on Wednesday.        
	Around 50 people declared insolvent under the Insolvency Declaration Act turned up at room No 16. on Wednesday afternoon. Six of them were questioned by lawyers of the petitioner banks about their personal information as well as the reasons for declaring themselves insolvent.         
	Around five years back, I had taken personal loans from three private banks adding up to Rs 1.25 lakh for my wifes treatment. But the computer firm where I worked shut down three years ago. My wife also passed away, replied Robin Haldar of Dankuni.         
	When asked whether he had a place to live, Haldar, who is in his late 40s, said he was living in a house registered in his wifes name.         
	My friends are paying the property tax on my behalf as I have no income, Haldar told the court.        
	After hearing the replies, the judge observed that the respondents, who were accompanied by their lawyers, sounded tutored.         
	Refusing to hear any more answers, Justice Banerjee put a stay on 1,400-plus insolvency declarations.        
	The judge however, admitted that the stay order might affect some genuinely insolvent people and advised them to file fresh applications before him.         
	Following an earlier order, an additional commissioner of Calcutta police had submitted a report in the court through the advocate-general on the touts and agents involved in the insolvency scam.         
	On Wednesday, the judge asked Ray to keep the report with him in a sealed envelope. He said he would go through its contents later.

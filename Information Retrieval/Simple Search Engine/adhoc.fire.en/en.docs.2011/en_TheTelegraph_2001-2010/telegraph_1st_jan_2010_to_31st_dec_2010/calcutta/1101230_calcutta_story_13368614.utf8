The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | I feel like Jhansi ki Rani 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      I feel like Jhansi ki Rani 
          ANKITA GHOSH                                               
	Ever since childhood, I dreamt of doing something adventurous and challenging, something that would allow me to compete shoulder to shoulder with the boys. Equestrian is one of the very few sports in the world where men and women compete in the same category and this was one of the reasons that led me to riding and jumping.         
	I was also drawn to the glamour associated with this sport. My dream came true when my father was posted at Fort William and he enrolled me at the Fort William Riding and Polo Club.        
	The instructors taught me the basics of riding and motivated me to take part in various competitions. I have competed at the Calcutta Horse Show, the Tolly Horse Show and the Floodlit Equestrian Gymkhana, winning medals in various events. This year, I am thrilled to have qualified for the Junior National Equestrian Championship. Its my passion for the sport that drives me straight from school (Ashok Hall, Class VIII) to riding classes.        
	My school gets over at 3.20pm, I reach home around 4.20pm, quickly change into my riding gear and reach the riding club by 4.30pm.         
	Whenever I ride this majestic animal, I feel like Jhansi ki Rani or Maharana Pratap.        
	Participating in equestrian championships gives me a real high. Entering the arena brings out the best in me and I strive to prove my coordination and control over the horse. As soon as the bell rings, Im in rhythm with my horse facing the obstacles as one.        
	A few years down the line, I see myself as a national equestrian champion, making my parents, teachers, school and city proud.

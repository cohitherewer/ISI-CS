          ARKA DAS                          Nemaichand Sen puts final touches to a designer kite. (Pabitra Das)                                  
	Petkati, Chandial, Mombaati, Bokka,/Aakashey ghurir jhaank, maatitey abagya.        
	The now-famous lines by (Kabir) Suman best sum up the 68-year-old Nemaichand Sen. Over the past 50 years, Sen has painstakingly built his reputation as one of the finest kite-makers in the subcontinent but his reputation has not travelled much beyond the cloistered world of competitive kite-making.        
	The wizard makes a kite in less than five minutes, sitting in his tiny 8ftx6ft attic workshop in Banchharam Akrur Lane, in Bowbazar Lohapatti. He has been at it for the past five decades, single-handedly.        
	Yet, kites still retain their allure for Sen; nearing 70, he is still one of the most in-demand kite-makers in the country. Not just that: he is an active participant at various kite-flying competitions all over India, with no less than three national and one international titles under his belt.        
	I was fascinated with kites ever since I was a kid. I always loved flying them. Back in the 50s, we had several kite clubs in and around our neighbourhood  the Bowbazar Kite Club, Royal Kite Club, Dharmatalla Kite Club. I used to go watch their informal competitions. Watching kites soar, and then learning the art of how its done was a thrill. Of course, I was reprimanded at home for neglecting studies, smiles the affable Sen.        
	In 1954, the various clubs came under one umbrella organisation, the West Bengal Kite Association, with its office in Jeliapara Lane. Formal tournaments started the same year. Two of the central figures of the association and its activities were Anup and Dilip Nag of Bhim Nag Sweets.        
	While flying the quadrangles were one part of Sens story, he was intrigued by the very mechanism of how kites are built. And theres an interesting story to how he got around making them. At that point, the best known kite-maker in town was Madan Dutta. He, however, refused to accept any apprentices, but seeing the then 14-year-old Sens interest, let him hang around his workshop.         
	I would be at his workshop all day, trying to pick up his technique. But the secret to his kites was his phorma (design blueprint), which he would never let me handle, says Sen. An alcoholic, Dutta would often pass out after a drinking bout.        
	One day, as he dozed off, I stole his phorma, says Sen. I made a kite according to that design structure and showed it to him. When he asked me whose phorma I built it on, I admitted stealing his design. However, he was pleased enough to see that my kite was almost on a par with his. Instead of being angry, he corrected my mistakes and blessed me. I still use his patent design for making my kites.        
	Sens kite ranges from the smallest Ektel, measuring 20x18 to the largest Ara, measuring 27.5x24.5.        
	In 1965, Sen took up a job with Remington Typewriters, and started making kites professionally.        
	In 1968, he, along with a few friends, set up the Biplabi Surya Sen Kite Club and started competing in all-India kite-flying tournaments, primarily in Jaipur, Jodhpur, Ahmedabad and Gwalior.        
	In 1972, in the Jaipur all-India tournament, Sen took down five kites with a single Panta kite made by him. He met Badri Narayan Sharma, a lawyer, who was very impressed by his kite-making skills.        
	He told me that if I really wanted to excel in kite-making, I should become a shishya of his guru, the legendary Haji Chunnar Ustad of Bareilly. In 1978, I officially became Chunnar Ustads disciple in a formal ceremony, recalls Sen.        
	Today, the Biplabi Surya Sen Kite Club is a name to reckon with in competitive kite-flying; it has been crowned state champion thrice and all-India winner on four occasions.        
	The club also won the prestigious international tournament, the Desert Kite Festival held at Umedh Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur in 1999, beating competition from Thailand, Korea, Japan and Singapore.         
	Sens kites continue to be a rage, with orders coming from as far as Russia and France. During Vishwakarma Puja, he earns over Rs 80,000 in a week. And why not: his kites, apart from being the finest in business, are also a visual treat.        
	I only use Ballarpur paper for my kites, and the frames are made out of muli baansh and dhutu baansh, a rare Assamese bamboo species. These need to be seasoned, rubbed with mustard oil, dried in the sun and packed up to be used after at least two years, Sen explains.        
	Its this no-compromise attitude that makes his kites much in demand, soaring in the skies way above competition.        
	Know your kite        
	Depending on their size, there are approximately five kinds of kites:         
	1. Ektel, measuring 20 x18        
	2. Showa-ekka teen, measuring 22.2 x 19.5        
	3. Adha, measuring 24.5 x 21        
	4. Panta, measuring 26-26.5 x 23-23.5        
	5. Ara, measuring 27-27.5 x 24-24.5               
	The Panta variety is used for all-India kite-flying competitions         
	The strings used in these contests are made of 6-cord cotton, with strict guidelines on the manja (the coating applied on the string). The usual ingredients are aatop rice, ground glass, a spice called taal magna, a resin-like material called ranamastaki, a fragrant cardamom-like spice called tosh, powdered ruby and lapis lazuli and, in some cases, even diamond dust. Nylon cords are a no-no        
	The hub of kite-making in India is Uttar Pradesh; kites from UP, especially from Bareilly and Lucknow, are exported the world over         
	The primary quality required to become a decent kite-maker is patience. Being a perfectionist helps        
	To be a good kite-flyer, one must be a good reader of the weather. Different kites suit different weather conditions, and one must know which specific kite to use on a given day, especially depending on wind speed

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Xaverians win war of words

	The threat to Indias security is essentially internal. This was the verdict of the audience at the silver jubilee celebrations chapter of the Father Joris Memorial Nihil Ultra Trophy debate on Saturday.        
	The event, organised by the St Xaviers College Calcutta Alumni Association along with The Telegraph and held at the college auditorium, saw Xaverians argue for the motion that security threat to India is essentially internal while politicians tried to oppose it. City sheriff Utpal Chatterjee moderated the debate.        
	The director of the JD Birla Institute, Suman Mukherjee, opened the debate for the Xaverians. More lives have been lost in recent internal strife than in external strife in the past 20 years, he said.        
	There is foreign hand even in the current threat posed by the Maoists. Jihadi terrorism is encouraged, aided and abetted by neighbours. Maoists are dominant in 80 districts in the country but terrorists can attack anywhere, countered the Union minister of state for urban development, Saugata Roy.        
	The Xaverians did not buy Roys argument and stressed that lack of basic amenities had created home-grown threats to Indias security.         
	While for Gautam Mallik export of terrorism into India only proved the presence of importers, film-maker Ashok Viswanathan felt high level of tolerance was the cause of strife. O.P. Shah spoke about the Dantewada massacre to highlight the seriousness of the internal threat.         
	The additional director general (rail) of state police, Dilip Mitra, said lack of basic amenities had made parts of our country the breeding ground of internal threat.        
	Our northern neighbour is racing ahead and will not want to invade our country and our western neighbours are themselves falling apart. Whether it is Ulfa or the Maoists, the threat is home-grown, said Mitra.        
	BJP leader Tathagata Roy and Congress leader Pradip Bhattacharya argued that internal strife wouldnt have gained ground without external support.         
	According to Independent candidate Yousuf Jamal Siddiqui, the global threat to India also included Indians living in other countries. The threat that India faces is military, economic and environmental and the other countries are responsible for these threats, said Forward Bloc leader Chandra Kumar Bose.        
	The show of hands at the end crowned Xaverians winners in the war of words.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Focus on cancer at health fair

	A healthy diet, no smoking and regular check-ups are the ways to prevent cancer from becoming the biggest killer by 2020, doctors said at Arogyam, a health fair organised by Anandabazar Patrika.        
	Officials of the healthcare institutes from across the country that took part in the fair said a majority of the 10,000-plus visitors asked questions on cancer.        
	Despite the smoking ban, many Calcuttans remain addicted to tobacco in different forms because of low cost and easy availability. This is the reason most of the cancer patients are suffering from head and neck cancer, said surgical oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay at an interactive session at the two-day fair at Netaji Indoor Stadium, which concluded on Sunday.        
	There are lots of myths and misconceptions about cancer and its treatment among people that need to be cleared through awareness campaigns, said surgical gastroenterologist Sanjay De Bakshi.         
	More than 70 per cent of the people above 50 years old had queries about cardiac problems and diabetes, said Santraj Singh, a physician at AMRI Hospitals.

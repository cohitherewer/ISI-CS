TABU, LUIS FIGO amp; MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY  You are intelligent, curious and practical to a fault. You love to socialise and mingle with people from all walks of life. You are dynamic but prefer to maintain a low profile. You take life as it comes. You are responsible and efficient with the ability to improvise when necessary. You know the value of money and never spend foolishly.

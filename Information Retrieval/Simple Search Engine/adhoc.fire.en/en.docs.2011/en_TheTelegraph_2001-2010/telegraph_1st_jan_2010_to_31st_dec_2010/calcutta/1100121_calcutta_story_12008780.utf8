	For Ajit Kumar Saha (picture left), a retired teacher of Sainik School Purulia, the greatest recognition of his 35-year-old service came on September 5 last year.         
	He was one of the seven from the state to receive the National Award to Teachers given by the ministry of human resource development in recognition of their work, at Vigyan Bhavan in Delhi. He was recommended by the Sainik Schools Society of the ministry of defence.         
	His career started with a years stint at Bikash Bharati Sikshayatan in Midnapore in 1975. He moved on to Sainik School, Purulia in 1976, where he taught social science and geography to students from classes IX to XII until his retirement in April last year.         
	Though congratulated by many, his greatest reward was the happiness of his brothers. They took great pains to put me through school and college. I owe my success to them, he said.         
	While geography is his calling, his passion is to script plays. Initially, I wrote skits staged in my own school, but they also bagged prizes at inter-Sainik School events, said Saha.         
	Saha wants to donate the prize money of Rs 25,000 to his alma mater, Singer High School (HS) in Murshidabad. My father was the secretary of the school and I want to use the money to institute an award in his name, for meritorious Madhyamik and Higher Secondary students, he added.

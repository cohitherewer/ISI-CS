The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Two boarders expelled
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Two boarders expelled

	The authorities of the Armenian College and Philanthropic Academy said on Friday two boarders were being sent back home to Armenia. The two led the group of 35 that had gone on hunger strike on Monday to protest the alleged highhandedness of the authorities.        
	Father Ktrij Devejian, a senior representative of the Armenian Church, told Metro that the poor grades of the two boys and their acts of indiscipline had led to their expulsion. He has been sent by the Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians, His Holiness Karekin II, to look into the matter.        
	Typically, when a student graduates from the academy, he is sent back home. Students can pursue further education here only if their grades are good and they are disciplined and respectful of the privileges they are receiving, said Father Devejian.        
	This, he added, was not the case with the boys who were expelled. Their grades were 40 and 50 per cent and that is failing grade. There were disciplinary issues too and they were setting a bad example for the younger boys. They were warned a few times, but they didnt pay heed, said Father Devejian.        
	The two had passed their Class X from the Academy in 2009 and were studying at La Martiniere for Boys, Calcutta.         
	When I spoke to them on Thursday and gave them an opportunity to apologise, they were still very rigid in their stance, Father Devejian said.        
	According to him, the boys who went on strike were manipulated by outside forces not happy with things working well at the institution.        
	He made it clear that there was not going to be any change in the school management.         
	The academy founded in 1821, runs a free school for Armenian children up to Class X and also funds the college education of students from the community.        
	On Friday, calls on the cellphones of the boys who had been expelled went unanswered. One of them complained in a Facebook post about having been treated unfairly.         
	Sonia John, a former honorary manager of the institution and ex-chairperson of the Armenian Church Committee (Armenian Holy Church of Nazareth), said the way the education of the boys had been interrupted was disgusting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cash key to wheel scam
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cash key to wheel scam

	In December 2007, Metro had exposed how a driving licence could be procured from Beltola PVD without even knowing how to drive a four-wheeler, just by lubricating the corrupt machinery with cash.        
	A cash amount of Rs 3,500 and a packet of cigarettes was all it took for this corresponded to get access to a driving licence with a validity of five years.        
	This despite not being able to drive anything with wheels apart from a bicycle.        
	It was done without appearing for a driving test and clearing it, an exercise mandatory in any country before getting a driving licence.        
	Regular visits to the PVD since then have revealed that nothing has changed in these three years.        
	The tout raj at Beltola continues to churn out licences for a bribe  allowing underage drivers to get behind the wheels of a truck and allowing underqualified drivers to steer cars through our streets.        
	How does the licence-for-a-bribe loop work? The first step is to establish contact with the all-powerful network of touts that operate in Beltola.        
	One such tout, standing behind the Lalbazar police headquarters, had told this correspondent: Aap humko paisa deejeeye, hum aapko licence denge.        
	He had gone on to boast: There is nothing that you cannot get done in Beltola for money. All you have to do is pay the right amount to the right person.        
	And he was true to his word. Within a week of the money being handed over, this correspondent was summoned to Beltola PVD to get his photograph clicked and fingerprints taken.        
	A total of 20 minutes spent in a smaller building behind the main PVD building ensured a smooth completion of all formalities  minus a driving test, of course. The PVD official behind the web camera did not even bother to find out if the candidate he was clicking was genuine or not.        
	In less than four weeks, this correspondent received the licence. Thankfully for the already-perilous streets of the city this is one licence to kill that has not been put to use. But then thats an exception.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blaze bar on trade licence
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Blaze bar on trade licence
          SUBHAJOY ROY                          Stephen Court on fire on March 23. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided not to renew the trade licences of the business establishments in the 32 markets and 14 buildings in central Calcutta deemed fire hazards by an inspection team set up after the Stephen Court blaze.         
	The civic body decided to take the step after the fire services department informed it in writing that commercial establishments in the building should be allowed to continue trade only after adequate fire prevention measures are put in place on the premises.        
	We decided not to renew the trade licences, said municipal commissioner Arnab Roy.         
	We have to be firm to enforce fire-safety norms in the markets. The condition of electrical wiring in most of the buildings that were inspected is very poor, said a fire services official.        
	The 32 markets and 14 buildings were jointly inspected by officers of police and fire services and officials of the directorate of electricity, CESC and the CMC after the Stephen Court blaze on March 23.        
	The owners of the markets and buildings have been asked to take short and long-term measures to improve fire safety, said a fire services official.         
	According to a civic official, the trade licences would be renewed only after police, firemen and other agencies concerned are satisfied with the fire prevention measures in the markets and buildings.         
	The civic body might find it difficult to prevent the owners of all the establishments from renewing their licences since some of the buildings and markets have multiple addresses. Hence, establishments in these premises have different addresses, not all of which are mentioned in the civic records.         
	For example, Raja Katra in Burrabazar has 12 addresses, as do the shops in it. The civic body is not sure whether it has all the addresses against which trade licence renewal is to be blocked.        
	To overcome the problem, the civic body has asked the bailiffs who collect trade licence renewal fees from the markets to visit the premises and update their database. They will provide a detailed list of the individual shops and their addresses, said an official.         
	The market owners are worried about not receiving licence renewal notice. Every year we receive the notice in April, said a trader in one of the markets.

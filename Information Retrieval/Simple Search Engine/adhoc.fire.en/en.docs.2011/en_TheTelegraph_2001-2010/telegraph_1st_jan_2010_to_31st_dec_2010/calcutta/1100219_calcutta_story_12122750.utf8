	The high court has set aside a trial bench order and asked a city girl who did her MBBS from Nepal to appear in a Medical Council of India test if she wished to practise in India.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice M.S. Shah and Justice P.C. Ghosh on Thursday vacated an order by Justice Sanjib Banerjee of the high court, who had in July last year asked the council to register Baisakhi Home Chowdhury as doctor. The council had moved the division bench against the ruling.        
	Baisakhi, the daughter of orthopaedic Ramendra Home Chowdhury and paediatrician Bandana Home Chowdhury, studied at the BP Koirala Institute of Health Science in Dharan in east Nepal after passing the Higher Secondary from a city school. She got her MBBS degree in 2006 and applied to the medical council for registration in October 2007.         
	She was denied registration as her marks in physics, chemistry and biology in HS were less than 50 per cent. Medical colleges in India dont admit students who score below 50 per cent in these three subjects in the school-leaving exams, said lawyer Saibalendu Bhowmik, who represented the councils Bengal chapter.        
	According to him, doctors with degrees from abroad have to pass a test to be registered as medical practitioners in India. But instead of appearing for the test, Baisakhi moved the high court trial bench that ruled in her favour, prompting the council to file an appeal before the division bench.        
	Baisakhis lawyers said they would move the Supreme Court, claiming that she need not sit for any test as India and Nepal shared a cordial relationship.        
	The rules cant be bent for any individual, said a council lawyer.

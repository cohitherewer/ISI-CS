The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pool cars mock 4th sign-up deadline
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pool cars mock 4th sign-up deadline

	More than 3,000 pool car operators are yet to apply for the regularisation of their trade though the fourth government deadline since February for the mandatory move passed 10 days ago.        
	The government had announced in November last year that the conversion of pool cars to commercial vehicles was a must for enforcement of directives aimed at ensuring the safety of the students who travelled to and from school in them.        
	Officials in the transport department said only 1,800 applications had been submitted till the fourth deadline  December 16  lapsed.        
	Though there are no official figures on the number of pool cars plying in and around the city, estimates by various operators put the count at 5,000.        
	Which means, at least 3,200 cars are still beyond government monitoring.        
	Transport minister Ranjit Kundu has threatened a crackdown on errant operators, but without committing to a deadline. If any unregistered car is found ferrying school children, we will seize it, Kundu told Metro.        
	Officials said only 600 operators had applied for the conversion since the third week of November, when the transport department fixed December 7 as the deadline. It was later extended by eight days.        
	The earlier two deadlines, treated with similar defiance by a majority of the operators, were February 15 and then November 16.        
	As of now the only legal pool cars are those that have applied for conversion, said an official.        
	In November, a child was critically injured when the Maruti Omni he was travelling in met with an accident on Jessore Road.        
	In a knee-jerk reaction, minister Kundu announced that Maruti Omnis  comprising almost half the pool car fleet  would be banned from ferrying schoolstudents. But the operators soon arm-twisted him into backing down.        
	The pool car lobby said the main reason for so many operators ignoring the deadlines was that almost 50 per cent of the vehicles were registered before January 2000. Such cars, according to a government order, could not be treated as commercial vehicles.        
	The government has to give some time and support to the owners to replace their vehicles. Similar sops were granted to autorickshaw and taxi operators, said Abir Roy, the secretary of the Pool Car Owners Association.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Campuses queue up for solar power
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Campuses queue up for solar power
  - Grid-linked plant to cut down energy cost          JAYANTA BASU                                                  
	The cost-effective green power is gaining popularity on campuses with around 30 educational institutions expressing their willingness to install roof-top solar power plants linked to the general grid.        
	Gurudas College and Heritage School/Heritage Institute of Technology have already set up such plants to cut their power bills and fight loadshedding.        
	The power generated by the grid-linked rooftop system  less than 100KW  is supplied to the general pool maintained by power utilities and the owner has to pay only for the balance electricity consumed.        
	The state electricity regulatory commission had in August issued an order allowing the setting up of grid-linked small solar power plants, a moved billed by the government as the first of its kind in the country. Earlier, individuals or organisations keen on solar power would install standalone set-ups.        
	The electricity regulatory commissions order has paved the way for educational institutes to opt for grid-linked solar power system, said S.P. Gon Choudhury, the managing director of the West Bengal Green Energy Development Corporation Limited, a state government undertaking.        
	Gurudas College and Heritage School /Heritage Institute of Technology have already set up such plants. At a recent meeting, around 30 educational institutions had expressed their intent to follow in their footsteps.        
	S.P. Gon Choudhury, an expert in alternative energy, said around 1,500sq ft of rooftop space was required to set up a plant that could produce 10KW of electricity. Such a system can run for 25 years and can save around Rs 65,000 in power bill a year and reduce annual carbon dioxide emission by 15 tonnes, Gon Choudhury pointed out.        
	Kaushik Nandy, an assistant professor at Gurudas College, said the institutions power bill had started decreasing and hoped that it would soon come down to one-third. We are also generating enough electricity to cover up for up to three hours of loadshedding.        
	The installation of a rooftop solar plant costs around Rs 13 lakh, which most institutes are trying to raise from various government and corporate funds.        
	Gurudas College has set up the plant with grants from the local area development scheme of CPM parliamentarian Shyamal Chakrabarty. Mainak Gupta, a teacher of Asutosh College, said the authorities hoped to raise a major part of the initial investment from various government and private funds. We have decided to install the plant to ensure uninterrupted supply. Funds, we believe, wont be a problem.        
	Avijit Majumder, of Loreto Day School in Sealdah, said: We are already using heaters, fans and other gadgets powered by solar energy. Now we want to go the whole hog and set up a solar plant linked to the general power grid. Dilip Dhar, the solar energy coordinator for the RK Mission school and college in Narendrapur, said the experience of using solar power had prompted the authorities to set up a grid-linked terrace plant.        
	Debashish Majumder, the chairman and managing director of Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, which financially supports alternative energy projects, said the Centre might soon come out with a financial package for those opting for small rooftop solar power plants.

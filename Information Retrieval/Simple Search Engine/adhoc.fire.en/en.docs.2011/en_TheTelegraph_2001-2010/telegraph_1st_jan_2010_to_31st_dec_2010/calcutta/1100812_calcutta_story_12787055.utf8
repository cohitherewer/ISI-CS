The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rocky road to comfort ride
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rocky road to comfort ride

	The convenience of an underground train ride is often compromised by the inconvenience of reaching a station. Metro lists the problems that plague the path to the four Metro Railway stations that are most difficult to reach.              
	Dum Dum        
	Commuters of both suburban trains and Metro share the corridor that leads to the station. The passage was built to ensure that people do not have to walk through the adjoining bazaar to catch a train but has since been taken over by hawkers and beggars.        
	To add to the troubles of commuters, cycles are often parked in the corridor.         
	This stretch is a hellhole. You take an eternity to reach the ticket counter, if waterlogging has not made the station approach out of bounds. I feel there should be separate approaches to the two stations, said Somdeb Chandra, a 21-year-old student of engineering.        
	Garia Bazar (Kavi Nazrul)        
	The condition of Garia Canal Side Road, which connects the station to Raja SC Mullick Road, is the main hurdle here.        
	The layer of asphalt on the road has worn off exposing bricks and stone chips. Commuters often stumble and fall down on the steep incline. Many have sustained fractures here, said Gopal Chandra Barik, who runs a medicine shop in the area.        
	An added disadvantage is Raja SC Mullick Road remaining clogged by unruly autos throughout the day. At least 10,000 autos on 14 routes ply from here.        
	Park Street        
	The area around the busiest exit, opposite Asiatic Society, is also the most congested. Hawkers and food stalls line both sides of the pavement. One has to jostle through a crowd to enter the platform.        
	Rabindra Sadan        
	A part of the passage beside the exit on the eastern side of the Exide crossing is 2ft wide. Commuters have to fight for space with customers at the eatery next door.        
	It is frustrating to lose valuable time trying to cross this passage. Women commuters suffer the most here, said Ishita Dutta, who walks to her Sarat Bose Road office from the station.        
	Official word         
	Commuters keep lodging complaints about approach roads to stations, especially Dum Dum and Garia Bazar. We have written to the municipal authorities several times but to no avail, said a senior Metro official.        
	He promised to see if the narrow passage beside the Rabindra Sadan station exit can be expanded.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Faces of festive finale
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Faces of festive finale
  - Metro spent an evening at Babughat to pick seven players from the bhashan team without whom no Durga Puja immersion spectacle can be complete                                                  
	THE DRIVER        
	Mohammad Ashraf takes a break from hitting the highways to do bhashan duty every year. We cant speed beyond 5km an hour to safeguard the idols. Two helpers keep an eye on the pedestrians, cars and overhead wires. I have to step lightly on the brakes. A little bit of carelessness can damage the idol, said Ashraf, who took three hours to drive from Sealdah to Babughat on Monday. He drives for three to five pujas a day, for Rs 1,500-2,000 (four hours). His para puja, though, gets a free ride.                  
	THE IDOL CARRIER        
	They are brought down from the Sunderbans, Basirhat and the citys outskirts every year for a two-day stint of carrying the massive idols from the truck to the river. They wind down the riverbank in groups of 30 with the idols resting on their backs, heads and shoulders.        
	Kartick Mondal, 45, has been coming down from Jatar Deul in the Sunderbans to carry 30 to 40 idols, making Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 a day.        
	We have a group head who teaches us the technique of tying the idol with ropes and supporting it with bamboo poles, said Kartick, pausing to catch his breath.                  
	THE DANCER        
	Sharmistha Roy, 28, was dancing at Babughat without a care in the world. Not to Munni badnaam hui but to the beat of the dhak. Its great fun and I dont feel uncomfortable at all, she smiled. And its all in the family. My husband urged me to join him four or five years back. Now I go dancing on bhashan every year. My mother-in-law and daughter are also here.                  
	THE COP        
	For inspector Partha Dutta, immersion duty means being firm in the time of the festive finale. People are very sentimental about the bhashan but we cannot allow everyone on the banks. We direct those interested in watching the immersion to a separate viewing space on the Gwalior, Nimtala and Babu ghats. Most people co-operate, said Dutta, keeping an eye on the crowd and the river.                  
	THE VETERAN        
	Proloy Sarkar from a Beleghata puja has been coming to Babughat for over 15 years on bhashan night. This time, he found the immersion process most systematic and hassle-free. The 44-year-old elaborated: Earlier, everyone was allowed on the banks. It was so crowded and chaotic. Now, only a small group is allowed with each idol. We also get proper parking space.                  
	THE DEBUTANT        
	For Ayushman Banerjee, 9, the chance to see lots of idols at one place made him drag his mother to Babughat. Ive seen barir bhashan in Bankura where they drown the idol in the local pond but never a bhashan like this. Its so much fun watching all these people running down the banks carrying these heavy idols, he said, wishing he was on a launch mid-river.                  
	THE VIEWER        
	A face in the crowd of immersion watchers  all armed with cameras, some cellphone, some digital  was Emily Galey, 24, from Texas. Im a little concerned about the debris being put into the Ganges, said Emily, who has been in Calcutta for a year. But that concern did not colour her unique experience. The mass procession and the fervour show how passionate people are about their faith. Im also quite intrigued by how laborious the entire process is.... The dancing and the colours make it a very unique place on earth, said Emily.

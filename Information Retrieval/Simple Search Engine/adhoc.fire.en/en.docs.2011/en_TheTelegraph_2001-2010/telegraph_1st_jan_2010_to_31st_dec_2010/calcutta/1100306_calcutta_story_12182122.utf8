	Thana theke aschhi for Thana Theke Aschhi!        
	That could have been the opening credits of Fridays evening show at Nandan as some of the top cops of Lalbazar trooped in to watch a modern re-telling of the Uttam Kumar thriller.        
	The evening out was a first in recent memory, as senior officers put the hoax (and extortion) calls off the hook, kept their own cellphones on silent and settled down to watch Sabyasachi Chakraborty the cop (and also Paoli Dam the kisser).        
	So what made Lalbazar set up a date with Tinkari Halder, the sleuth played by Uttam Kumar in 1965 and Sabyasachi in 2010? Morpheus Media Ventures (producers of the Saron Datta film) had sent us the synopsis of Thana Theke Aschhi. We heard that police have been projected in the right manner and felt that our officers would be motivated on watching the film. Besides, the film has been dedicated to Calcutta police, said Debasish Roy, a special additional commissioner of police and a key coordinator for the cops evening out.        
	And what does he make of the portrayal of policemen in our films? Honestly in most films the police are portrayed as jokers. Theres a directive from the censor board to project cops in better light but hardly anyone pays heed, he rued.        
	For once, Tollywood has done just that with Thana Theke Aschhi. At Nandan, the reel cop did not salute the real cops, but chatted and laughed with them before the show. Theres a police in every man and theres a thana in every mans mind, said Sabyasachi. Thana Theke Aschhi is not exactly a cop film but it talks about the human conscience. I think the police in Calcutta are better than Tinkari Halder, added the actor famous as Feluda, Satyajit Rays super sleuth on screen.                  Sabyasachi with the cops at Nandan. (Aranya Sen)      
	There are moral aspects in the film that will stir the cops, added leading lady Paoli. (The officers being gentlemen did not even clear their throats when her character Sandhya was cavorting in a towel with Parambrata, her screen lover, for company.)                          
	The film has touched me. Such a film makes people face reality, since cops are otherwise projected very poorly, said joint commissioner Jawed Shamim.        
	But wasnt it tough for officers ranked far higher than the sub-inspector in the film to make time for their tryst with Tolly? We asked the producers to delay the screening for an hour so that we could finish work, smiled Shamim.        
	Talk to your mirror before the cop calls on you, actress Churni Ganguly had warned in her t2 review of the film.        
	For once, the cops came calling on Friday and liked what they saw in the mirror called the movies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Party police on prowl
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Party police on prowl
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta police are set to join the crackdown on all-night partying with cops hitting the bars and dance floors at curfew hour to check who needs to face the music.        
	Sources said Lalbazar would strictly enforce the no-liquor-after-2am rule at star hotels even on weekends this month. Bars at these addresses are usually kept open for an additional two hours against a special licence that is renewable every month.        
	The decision to raid nightclubs that flout curfew norms was taken following a request from the excise authorities to strictly enforce the new regulations. Excise officials had raided a Park Street watering hole last weekend and allegedly found it open beyond the permissible time.        
	Our job is to implement rules. We will go by the rules mentioned in the licences issued by the excise department. For this, we will conduct surprise raids. If any nightclub or bar is found flouting the norms, the management will face legal action, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	The police brass met the managers of various nightspots on Wednesday and advised them to strictly adhere to the limits specified in their licences issued by the excise department.         
	Sources said the anti-rowdy section of the detective department would form a team for the raids.        
	Late-night revellers herded out of nightspots following the excise raids last week had complained about the citys night life being unnecessarily targeted. Some insisted that all-night parties in Calcutta were safer than those in other metros.        
	According to excise department norms, notified every month at the time of liquor licences being renewed, star hotels are barred from serving drinks after 2am on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. On other days, the cut-off time is midnight.        
	Standalone bars and restaurants across the city will have to stop serving drinks by 11pm. Nightspots that are not part of star hotels have been asked to stop serving liquor at midnight.         
	The new restrictions will be in force for the rest of July. The excise department may review the norms while renewing licences in August.

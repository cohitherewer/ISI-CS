The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sorry, but not for boycott
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sorry, but not for boycott
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Engineering students of Jadavpur University have apologised to their teachers in writing for their conduct during the semester exam boycott, saying they were sorry if any of them felt insulted by the manner of the agitation.        
	We are not apologising for the boycott. But we have sent each and every teacher of the engineering faculty a letter where we have said that we regret it if they felt humiliated during the movement, said a leader of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu), which spearheaded the exam boycott.        
	University officials confirmed that a copy of the three-paragraph letter, signed by the Fetsu chairman, had been sent to all 350 teachers of the engineering departments.        
	 The students have not only apologised, they have also requested us to forgive them for their act. We are happy that the students have realised their mistake, Parthapratim Biswas, a member of the universitys executive council, told Metro.        
	The apology comes close on the heels of a rare climbdown by Fetsu last Friday when it called off its boycott of classes following the universitys refusal to start a dialogue if the agitation continued.        
	University officials wouldnt commit themselves to holding a special exam for the students as a reciprocal gesture, but did say that the apology had created the ground for amicable talks to end the status quo.        
	On Friday, the Jadavpur University Teachers Association had adopted a resolution not to bail out the students until they apologised for insulting their teachers.         
	Nearly 150 teachers designated as invigilators had spent three hours in empty exam halls on each day of the semester test from November 19 to December 4. Some students had allegedly taunted the invigilators on their way to the exam centres every morning.        
	The tone of the teachers on Wednesday suggested that all was forgiven, if not forgotten. Now that the students have apologised, we will call another meeting of our general body to decide our course of action, the general secretary of the teachers association, Keshab Bhattacharya, said.        
	So would conducting a special exam for the students be considered at the meeting? Although we appreciate the students gesture, we are yet to find a suitable solution to the impasse triggered by their exam boycott, a senior university official said.         
	The boycott of exams and classes by 3,000-odd students was meant to pressure the authorities to withdraw an FIR against 37 of them for allegedly creating trouble on the campus on November 9, when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had visited the university to inaugurate an auditorium.

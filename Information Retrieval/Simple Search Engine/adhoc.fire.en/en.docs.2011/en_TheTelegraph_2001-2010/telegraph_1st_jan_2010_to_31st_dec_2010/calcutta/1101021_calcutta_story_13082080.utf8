The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SOS? Metro couldnt be bothered
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      SOS? Metro couldnt be bothered
  - Ladders amp; lights in short supply        ZEESHAN JAWED                          Motorman Pritimoy Roy, who was driving the derailed train.   Picture by Amit Datta                                               
	Wednesday morning proved that emergency does not exist in Metro Railways dictionary.        
	So ill-prepared was the citys transport lifeline to evacuate passengers from the smoke-filled compartments of the train that derailed in the tunnel around 15 metres before Central station that 20 minutes passed before help came their way.         
	When Metro Railway, police and the fire department finally got going, lack of co-ordination hampered the rescue operation. Seeing how shoddy the rescue effort was left me more scared than the actual incident. Each minute spent in that smoke-filled, dark train was a torture, Sujata Roy, 55, told Metro.        
	According to the passengers, even emergency must-haves like flashlights, ladders, ropes and oxygen masks were not available at the station.        
	Passengers who came out through the door of a coach stranded in the middle of the tunnel had to jump on the track and walk along the walls to reach the station. I saw so many women, children and senior citizens coming out like that. Couldnt a ladder have been arranged for them? demanded Roy.        
	Swapna Ghosh, a 39-year-old bank official who was to get off at Netaji Bhavan station, bruised her elbow while trying to climb onto the platform. A few co-passengers had to finally lift me up to safety, she recalled.        
	Not that Metro officials couldnt have known the need for ladders and lights in such a situation after what happened barely eight days ago.                    Motorman Pritimoy Roy, who was driving the derailed train.  Picture by Amit Datta      
	On October 12, a trainload of Metro passengers had spent 35 minutes trapped in the dark, airless coaches of a non-AC rake stranded in the tunnel before the doors opened for them to walk along the track and climb the high platform at Sovabazar without ladders.        
	On Wednesday, those travelling in the last couple of coaches suffered the most, walking in near-darkness for almost 100 metres to reach the platform.        
	The Railway Protection Force personnel on duty had a few torches but they were inadequate, said a stranded passenger.        
	As the enormity of the incident dawned on everyone, what if? was the only question doing the rounds. Many admitted to almost giving up hope when help didnt arrive until 20 minutes after the incident. I shudder to think what would have happened had the sparks triggered a fire inside the train, said an elderly man who didnt wish to be named.         
	The lack of preparedness for an emergency was evident even after everyone on the train was evacuated. Passengers with cuts and bruises suffered during the derailment or while walking along the track complained about not a single first-aid box being available at Central station.        
	The least that the Metro authorities could have done was arrange for a doctor to attend to the injured passengers. It is shocking that a transport system that ferries lakhs of passengers daily does not have such basic facilities in place, rued schoolteacher Parimal Ghosh, who had boarded the train at Dum Dum station.

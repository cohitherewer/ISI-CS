          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University on Thursday launched a five-year integrated masters course in library and information science for students who have passed the plus-II exam.        
	The university is set to offer more such courses in science subjects following orders from the University Grants Commission.        
	The course in library and information science, to start from July, will have 40 seats. Classes will be held on the College Street campus of the university. Students who will drop out after four years will be issued the graduate degree.        
	CU now runs a two-year postgraduate course in the subject. Science graduates who have done a years bridge course in library and information science can apply for it.        
	Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro vice-chancellor (academic) of CU, said: Once the masters course in library and information science starts running, we will launch similar ones in other science subjects such as chemistry, physics and mathematics.        
	A university official who did not want to be named said the authorities were looking for departments that had suitable infrastructure for running integrated courses.        
	We do not want to rush with the courses as the expert panel has warned against compromising on pedagogy and infrastructure, the official added.         
	At present, only St Xaviers College, which was earlier affiliated to CU and is now an autonomous institution, runs a five-year integrated course which offers a masters degree in bio-technology.         
	A panel of scientists from three reputable institutions  Indian National Science Academy (New Delhi), Indian Academy of Sciences (Bangalore) and National Academy of Sciences (Allahabad)  had suggested to the UGC a series of measures to upgrade post-school science education.        
	One of the suggestions was to introduce five-year integrated masters courses in science subjects.         
	The UGC has accepted the recommendations and asked universities across the country to implement the expert panels recommendation.

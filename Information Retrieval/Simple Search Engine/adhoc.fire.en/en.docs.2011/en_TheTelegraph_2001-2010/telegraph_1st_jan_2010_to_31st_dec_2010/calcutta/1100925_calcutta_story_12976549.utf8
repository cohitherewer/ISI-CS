  - Emaar-MGF Land exits prime plot, 300-key JW Marriott eyes 2014          SUBHRO SAHA                          FLASHBACK: Artists impression of the original Emaar-MGF Land project                                        
	A star hospitality project on a Bypass plot that had smashed land-sale price records, but was then dumped in the downturn, has been pulled out of the freezer to plot a Rs 1,000-crore address, including a 300-key JW Marriott hotel and a block of serviced apartments.        
	Emaar-MGF Land had made real estate history here by quoting Rs 213 crore for the 6.24-acre plot on the Bypass, between ITC Sonar and Silver Spring, announced a double-header of JW Marriott and Holiday Inn but then shelved it.        
	It has now agreed to dilute 74 per cent of its equity in the project to a consortium comprising the SPS Group and the Mani Group from Calcutta and the Bangalore-based Sattva Group, with construction set to resume in October.         
	Emaar MGF has taken this step in line with the company strategy to unlock value from our assets with a long gestation period, said a spokesperson for the company.        
	The resuscitated Bypass project is being designed by Singapore-based architecture practice Smallwood, Reynolds, Stewart, Stewart amp; Associates.        
	We hope to complete the entire project by 2014. We have an agreement with the Marriott group to do the JW Marriott five-star format. They will operate our serviced apartments as well, Bipin Kumar Vohra, the chairman of the SPS Group, told Metro.        
	This big-ticket transaction could put some momentum back into the hospitality trade in town tripped chain delays and scrapping of planned star hotel projects. As local developers, we are excited to be able to revive such a high-profile project, and a JW Marriott in town will go a long way towards improving brand perception of Calcutta, said Sanjay Jhunjhunwala, the MD of Mani Group.        
	Abhijit Das of property consultants Lemongrass Advisors is bullish about the JW Marriott effect, since it re-activates a prime land parcel on the Bypass.        
	The SPS Group is readying another revival project  the 69-key hotel on Loudon Street, The Loudon  for a pre-Puja opening. The makeover of the erstwhile Hotel Rutt Deen in a franchisee agreement with Fortune Park Hotels of ITC will be followed by a 30-room budget hotel, Fortune Inn, on Ballygunge Circular Road, Vohra said.

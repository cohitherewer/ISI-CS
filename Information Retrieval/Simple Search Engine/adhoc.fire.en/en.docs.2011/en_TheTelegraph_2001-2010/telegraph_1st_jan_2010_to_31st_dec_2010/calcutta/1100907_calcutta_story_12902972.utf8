The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Aerobridge wake-up call for city airport 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Aerobridge wake-up call for city airport

	Calcutta girl Amrita Roys tragic death at Hyderabad airport on Sunday has set alarm bells ringing on home tarmac with officials admitting that aerobridge safety guidelines are routinely flouted by airline staff.        
	We have discussed the accident and asked all personnel to follow basic safety norms like not leaning on the aerobridge wall or moving around when it is in motion, said Vijay Matta, the chairman of the Airlines Operators Committee, Calcutta.        
	The safety reminder came even as the body of 25-year-old Amrita, a guest services officer with Air Asia, was brought to her Kalighat home from Peace Haven mortuary on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Street.        
	Although Amrita had never worked at the city airport, her death was the talking point through Monday with many airline employees admitting that they were lucky not to have suffered a similar fate.        
	 We often lean on the aerobridge or scribble something on a piece of paper using its wall as a support. We have now realised how dangerous that can be, said a ground executive.        
	Officials said it was illegal to stand on the rotunda (platform) of an aerobridge when it was opening or retracting.        
	There are two doors  one through which passengers get on board and another on the ground floor. To save time, airline staff usually board the platform before the aerobridge is attached to the aircraft, an official revealed.        
	So why was it being allowed? Nobody was bothered because no one ever thought a mishap could occur, he admitted.        
	The condition of the aerobridges has also raised concern. One of the four aerobridges at the airport invariably remains out of service. The only aerobridge at the international terminal was out of order for more than nine months until recently.        
	Back in Nakuleswar Bhattacharjee Lane on Monday morning, shock gave way to tears as the hearse stopped in front of the three-storeyed house where Amritas parents Kamal and Sudakshina Roy and grandparents Kashinath and Jharna live.        
	Amritas body had been flown in from Hyderabad late on Sunday and taken to the mortuary.        
	We brought Amrita home because her grandparents would not have been able to see her one last time otherwise, said uncle Shyamal Roy.        
	She had promised us a treat when she came home for Puja, cried a cousin.        
	Air Asia officials from Hyderabad and the airlines headquarters in Kuala Lumpur joined in the funeral procession.

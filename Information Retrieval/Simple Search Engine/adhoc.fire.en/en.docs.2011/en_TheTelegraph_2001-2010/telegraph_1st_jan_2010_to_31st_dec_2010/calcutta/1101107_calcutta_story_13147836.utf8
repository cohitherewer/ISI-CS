	With reference to Its in our jeans, October 31, I have been wearing denims since my childhood. It is the most versatile piece of clothing ever invented. The word jeans comes from the city of Genoa in Italy, where denim trousers were initially stitched for local sailors.             
	Today, its cool to wear jeans for most occasions. You can also wear it in any kind of weather. They are the ideal outfit for travellers, as you dont mind getting them dirty. I love collecting denim trousers of various colours, and brands. Though there is not much variation in their cuts and designs, denims will always remain a fashion statement.

	With reference to That Nineties Show, September 12, adda in that decade meant friends sitting at a para thek and chatting away endlessly without cellphone ringtones disturbing them, or drinking tea at Coffee House along with aloo chops and muri. There was much more human interaction in that era.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tolly wave on Goan shores
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tolly wave on Goan shores
          RESHMI SENGUPTA                              
	Tollywood hit a high at the 41st International Film Festival of India in Goa on Thursday, picking up two of the five big awards. Goutam Ghoses Moner Manush bagged the Golden Peacock for Best Film and Kaushik Ganguly brought home the Special Jury Award for Just Another Love Story (Aarekti Premer Galpo).        
	Prosenjit, the leading man of Moner Manush and the face of Tollywood in Goa, was feted for his contribution to cinema. The awards were announced at the closing ceremony of the 11-day festival, where Saif Ali Khan was the chief guest.        
	Moner Manush and Just Another Love Story competed with 16 entries for the best film, director, actor, actress and special jury categories.        
	I thank the jury for their endorsement of tolerance in these times of intolerance, said Ghose in his acceptance speech.        
	I felt the need to tell this story of non-violence through a character like Lalan or Kabir right after the Babri Masjid demolition. I think it is a very relevant subject for today and winning an award here will give Moner Manush a big boost, Ghose had told Metro earlier in the day.         
	Starring Prosenjit as the 19th century mystic poet Lalan Fakir, Moner Manush is an Indo-Bangladesh co-production that releases in both Bengal and Bangladesh on Friday, with 100 and 40 prints respectively.         
	The fact that they wanted to felicitate me signifies that we (the Bengali film industry) are on a par with the others in the country. We have a huge pool of young talent waiting to come up and a platform like this is very important for a regional film industry to get recognised as Indian cinema, Prosenjit told Metro.         
	Kaushiks Just Another Love Story got a thumbs-up from the jury for its fearless and honest portrayal of homosexuality. Just Another Love Story marks director Rituparno Ghoshs debut as an actor in the role of a gay filmmaker making a documentary on Chapal Bhaduri, the cross-dressing jatra legend.        
	This win feels great because the film represents Indian cinema before the world and it is important because it is a government acknowledgment of a film on a subject like homosexuality, said Kaushik.        
	Revathy (actress-director), who is one of the jury members, told me that she loved Just Another Love Story. She was very moved and emotional, added the director. Aarekti Premer Galpo hits the halls on December 24.

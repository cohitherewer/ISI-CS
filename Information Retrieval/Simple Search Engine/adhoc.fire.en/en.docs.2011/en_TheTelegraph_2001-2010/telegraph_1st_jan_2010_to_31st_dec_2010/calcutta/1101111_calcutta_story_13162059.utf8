The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Summer jobs rain on Joka campus
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Summer jobs rain on Joka campus
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A cracker of a start to summer placements has followed Diwali on the Joka campus of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta.        
	Investment banks, private equity firms and consulting giants crowded IIM Calcutta on Wednesday, making over 120 internship offers in the prestigious Slot Zero.         
	The companies that take on first-year students for two-month internships sometimes offer to absorb them.        
	The banks returned (after the downturn) last year. Offers in finance have gone up by 40 per cent and there is a 22 per cent rise in offers from consulting companies compared with last year, said Samyuktha Thirumani, the secretary of the external relations cell of IIM Calcutta.        
	Investment banks were the biggest draw in Slot Zero with Morgan Stanley, UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays Capital, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Nomura, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse making around 100 offers.         
	Offers were made for positions across the globe, including New York, London, Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai and even Africa.        
	Consulting firms McKinsey amp; Co., Bain amp; Co., AT Kearney and Boston Consulting Group recruited more than 20 students.        
	A highlight of this years summer placements is the variety of roles that were offered, including that of a chief investment officer at JP Morgan, rare in the B-school circuit.        
	This is a one-of-a-kind offer. Were glad that such a unique opportunity has been offered to one of our students, said Arun Devadas, a placement cell representative of IIM Calcutta.        
	The other highlight of the placements is the debut of international hedge funds on the campus. An international hedge fund that manages a $6 billion-fund visited the IIM Calcutta campus exclusively.        
	Hedge funds never hire from business schools in India. But this year they are participating. We hope this is a trend that will continue, said Thirumani.        
	Cop assault: Sunit Chowdhury, a retired assistant commissioner of police, was hit on the head with a piece of wood by a 45-year-old clerk in the accounts section of Lalbazar on Wednesday afternoon. Police said the clerk has a history of mental illness. He has been admitted to hospital.

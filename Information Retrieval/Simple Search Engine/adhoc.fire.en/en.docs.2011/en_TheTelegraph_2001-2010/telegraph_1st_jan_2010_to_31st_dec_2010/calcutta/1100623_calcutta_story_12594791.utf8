The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Suspend principal, says probe panel
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Suspend principal, says probe panel

	A probe team of the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights has sought suspension of the La Martiniere for Boys principal, Sunirmal Chakravarthi, who had caned Class VIII student Rouvanjit Rawla four days before he was found hanging in his Alipore home.        
	The three-member team, which visited the Loudon Street campus a fortnight ago, has also sought suspension of another teacher whose name figures in the FIR lodged by Rouvanjits father Ajay.        
	The principal and the teacher who are named in the FIR must be suspended for fair probe, a source said quoting the report, which has been submitted to the commission chief Shanta Sinha.        
	The committee also wants the police to consider charging the accused under the Juvenile Justice Act. Sinha, however, said: I am out of Delhi and have not seen the report.        
	The school is also under the scanner of human resource development ministry as a two-member panel appointed by minister Kapil Sibal is scheduled to visit La Martiniere this week to probe the caning of Rouvanjit.         
	The team headed by Ramesh Bhattacharjee of the ministry will probe whether to recommend action against the school. School officials were not aware of the visit till Tuesday evening, though the buzz in Delhi was that it was slated for Wednesday.        
	Unlike the criminal charges  filed by Rouvanjits father accusing the principal along with four other teachers of mental and physical torture driving him to suicide  being probed by the detective department, the task before the HRD ministry panel involves determining appropriate punishment rather than establishing guilt.        
	Chakravarthi has already apologised to the schools board of governors who have issued him a warning for flouting the no-corporal punishment rule. The school has also amended its Service Rules classifying corporal punishment as a major misconduct.        
	After the probe, if the team considers it appropriate, the ministry can recommend action, up to and including de-affiliation from the centrally-run Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations. Ministry sources said de-affiliation was unlikely but could be used as a threat to pressure the school into acting sternly against teachers responsible for corporal punishment.

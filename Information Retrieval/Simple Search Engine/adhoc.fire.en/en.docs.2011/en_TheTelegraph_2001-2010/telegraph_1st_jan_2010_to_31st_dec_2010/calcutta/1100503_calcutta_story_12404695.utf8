The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SSKM attack sparks strike, no-bail slap
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      SSKM attack sparks strike, no-bail slap

	A mothballed bill meant to prevent hooliganism in hospitals has been invoked to press non-bailable charges against four persons accused of assaulting junior doctors at SSKM over a newborn babys treatment that triggered a flash strike.        
	The Indian Medical Association, which had termed the legislation an eyewash after a mob vandalised Peerless Hospital three weeks ago, hailed the governments action but the junior doctors who have been on strike since Saturday werent convinced.        
	Medical services at Bengals largest referral hospital were crippled for the second successive day with the junior doctors demanding foolproof security for them to return to work. Around 300 of them have been off work since Saturday evening, though the union claims they have been offering emergency services.        
	Police had swung into action even as the strike was declared, arresting Alok Chakraborty, Bappa Roy, Abhishek Chowdhury and Tanuja Adhikary on the charge of assaulting six junior doctors in the gynaecology department.  
	The trigger for the attack was apparently the condition of a male baby born to Shibani Chakraborty, 40.        
	Around 11.30am on Saturday, some people suddenly barged into the gynaecology ward shouting at the top of their voices. A woman snatched my dupatta, put it around my neck and tried to strangulate me, said Priyanka Singh, a post-graduate student on duty in the ward.        
	The accused also assaulted two other women doctors, Pooja Banerjee and Joyita Mukherjee. Three male colleagues  Sudip Mukherjee, Subhendu Chowhury and Devi Prasad Dey  were beaten up while trying to save them.        
	According to the hospital authorities, the baby born to Shibani had trouble breathing immediately after his birth on Thursday.         
	The babys condition worsened, forcing doctors to shift him to the neo-natal intensive care unit and put him on ventilator. The infant was in the ICU till late on Sunday.        
	Officers at Bhowanipore police station said the arrested quartet were booked under sections 307, 353, 341 and 324 of the IPC (attempt to murder, assault to deter public servant from discharge of duty, wrongful restraint and voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons or means). The first two are non-bailable sections, with 307 providing for a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail. Section 353 also carries punishment up to two years imprisonment.        
	The 15 people arrested for the April 13 mob attack on Peerless had got bail the very next day. The four accused in the SSKM incident were produced in an Alipore court on Sunday and remanded in police custody till Wednesday.         
	Sanjoy Banerjee, the state secretary of the Indian Medical Association, said he was happy that the West Bengal Medical Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Act, 2009, was finally being implemented.        
	We welcome the action taken by the administration and we want the legislation to be invoked whenever incidents of hooliganism occur inside a hospital, he added.        
	The act came into force last September but implementation has been lax.        
	At SSKM, the authorities held talks with the junior doctors twice in as many days to get them back to work but to no avail. They are continuing with the agitation as they have some more demands which the hospital authorities cant fulfil on their own, said Pradip Mitra, the director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research.         
	A security meeting with police officers and representatives of a private security agency is slated for 10.30am on Monday in Mitras office. A five-member team from the junior doctors unit will meet the hospital authorities at 11.30am.         
	For many who went to SSKM on Sunday, it was yet another instance of patients needs taking the back seat. The doctors in the emergency ward did not even look at my fathers reports, said Rajib Bose, seeking cardiac and neurological help for septuagenarian Shyam Sundar Bose.

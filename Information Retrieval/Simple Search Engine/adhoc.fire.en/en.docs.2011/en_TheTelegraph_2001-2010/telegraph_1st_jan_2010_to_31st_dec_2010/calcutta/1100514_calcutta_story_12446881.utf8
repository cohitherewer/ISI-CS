                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Teachers bail plea rejected

	The high court on Thursday refused to grant anticipatory bail to a school teacher accused of detaining a boy in Class IV after being denied a laptop as bribe.        
	The teacher has been absconding since the boys father lodged a complaint against him with Shakespeare Sarani police station on April 2.        
	Todays ruling has cleared the decks for the teachers arrest, said a lawyer. The FIR lodged by the father had made the principal of the south Calcutta school a party to the case.        
	My client also accused the principal and the teacher of hatching a conspiracy, committing acts of extortion, criminal intimidation, threat and cheating, said the fathers lawyer Jaymalya Bagchi. The principal, however, hasnt sought anticipatory bail.        
	The father has also filed a petition in the court accusing the school of violating the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, which states a student cannot be detained till Class VIII.

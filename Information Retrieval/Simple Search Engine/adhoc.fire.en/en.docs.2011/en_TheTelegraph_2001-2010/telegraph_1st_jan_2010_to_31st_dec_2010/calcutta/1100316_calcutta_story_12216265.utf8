The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Concert date with American bass great
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Concert date with American bass great
          MOHUA DAS                                                Victor Lemonte Wooten		      
	He has won five Grammys, toured the world with bass virtuosos Stanley Clark and Marcus Miller, played with legends like Chick Corea and written a chart-topper book on music. And the best part: hes coming to Calcutta next month.        
	On the evening of April 7, music lovers in the city would get a chance to groove to the strains of Victor Lemonte Wootens fretwork at GD Birla Sabhagar.        
	The 45-year-old American bass great is visiting India for the first time to introduce the Swarnabhoomi Academy of Music, founded in Chennai by his Boston-based friend, Carnatic guitarist R. Prasanna (the music director of Smile Pinki that won the Academy Award for best documentary short in 2008), and perform in four cities.        
	Calcutta will be the third stop after Chennai and Bangalore. Mumbai would set the stage for the final performance on the tour.        
	Calcutta was chosen because of its vibrant live music scene. We would have ideally liked to organise the concert at an open-air venue since that would have allowed people to eat, drink and move around freely but we did not get permission because of the board exams, said organiser Pravin Singhania. Congo Square is the local organiser of the event.        
	Apart from attending the two-hour evening concert, city musicians can take part in a workshop conducted by Wooten at the Calcutta School of Music on the afternoon of the show.        
	Wooten will conduct a three-hour workshop in each of the four cities. He will interact with participants, demonstrate musical ideas and answer questions. He will also invite different kinds of musicians from the audience to jam with him on keyboard, drum and guitar, added Pravin.         
	Rock and jazz lovers in the city are understandably excited. I am a fan of Victor Wooten and have been studying his learning videos ever since I started playing. Anyone who plays bass watches his videos at least once for his unique slap technique and unusual combination of melodic bass with a groove, said Nitin Mani, the bassist of The Supersonics.        
	It is hard to believe that I would get to see him at close quarters at the workshop. We usually end up going to Mumbai or Bangalore for the big rock acts. I am excited that we would get to see such a talent performing in our city, added Mani.         
	The youngest of the five Wooten brothers will be accompanied on stage by Prasanna and Indian percussionists S. Karthik on ghatam and Bangalore Amrit on kanjira.         
	Calcutta hosted the likes of John McLaughlin, Jonas Hellborg, Joe Satriani and Firehouse but missed big-ticket acts like Roger Waters, Mark Knopfler and Scorpions in the recent past.         
	Victor Wooten is a big figure. He is a musicians musician, who is not really into the commercial glamour scene. His show will be as much a landmark event as Joe Satrianis was five years ago. Let us hope the word goes around that there is a discerning audience in Calcutta, said city musician and t2 columnist Nondon Bagchi.

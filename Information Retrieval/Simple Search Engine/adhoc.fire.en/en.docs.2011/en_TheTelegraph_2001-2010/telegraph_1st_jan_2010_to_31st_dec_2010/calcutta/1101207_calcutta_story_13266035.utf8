The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Exam decision divides JU

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	A new engineering semester begins at Jadavpur University on Tuesday amid uncertainty over whether the nearly 3,000 students who boycotted the exams that ended lasted Saturday will be given a second chance.        
	The university is apparently a divided house on the subject with a section of teachers and officials opposed to the idea of holding a fresh exam. The rest are advocating the middle path.        
	A new semester will begin on Tuesday in accordance with the academic calendar we had finalised at the beginning of the current session. But I cannot comment, at this stage, on the fate of the students who boycotted the last semester exams, vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh told Metro.        
	Although the official line is that the students would have to pay the price for boycotting the entire exam, political pressure is mounting on the authorities to soften their stand.        
	A hardline attitude will not only jeopardise the careers of 3,000 students but also have political repercussions, said a teacher.        
	But the Jadavpur University Teachers Association, which is dominated by pro-Left members, has resolved not to succumb to student pressure. Nearly 150 teachers turned up for duty in the examination halls on time every day between November 19 and December 4, but not a single student wrote the test. We will not accept such humiliation. We deplore the exam boycott, the general secretary of the association, Keshab Bhattacharya, said.        
	In a memorandum to the vice-chancellor following its general body meeting last Friday, the association said the authorities should not waste time in declaring the status of the exams. The authorities should take a decision on the semester exams that were boycotted in the light of what the rulebook states, general secretary Bhattacharya said.         
	The university think tank is scheduled to meet later this week to finalise its stand.        
	Having skipped the entire semester exams, the students ostensibly cannot hope for a reprieve unless the authorities find a way to save them a year.         
	According to an official of the exam department, the four options are holding a fresh test within a month, bunching the re-examination with the next semester exams in May, arranging for phased tests over the next six months or easing the supplementary exam rules.        
	According to the university rules, those who skip semester exams are allowed to take supplementary tests but only for three papers. Students missing more than three papers are not allowed to take the supplementary tests, which means that the 3,000 students who boycotted the exams would need to write all the papers in November 2011.

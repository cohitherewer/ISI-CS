          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          Leslie Claudius fills up the survey sheet sitting beside Barry OBrien. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Former Olympian Leslie Claudius filled up a two-page data sheet on Wednesday, marking the launch of a private census on the states Anglo-Indian community.        
	Each respondent will be asked 25 questions, ranging from education and employment to whether he or she has a voters identity card.        
	You cant deal with the problems of a community unless you know its strength and details of the members, said Barry OBrien, the nominated MLA for the Anglo-Indian community, who has taken the census initiative.         
	All the other MLAs know how many people they are representing but I dont, OBrien added.        
	A few years ago, the Indian Statistical Institute had steered a government census on minority communities across the state, but the survey could not be completed.        
	OBrien said the private census started with 83-year-old Claudius because he was a role model for the community. He is the quintessential Anglo-Indian, an achiever who loves being with people, said OBrien.        
	The former hockey star, who has been living in a McLeod Street home since 1936, welcomed the move, saying: We dont know where people (of our community) are and what they are doing. It is important to have this survey done.        
	OBrien said many members of the community, including Claudius, did not have a voters identity card. This survey will help us take active efforts to get them their IDs.        
	The general census, held once in 10 years, used to have a separate questionnaire on the Anglo-Indians till 1961.        
	OBriens initiative is being funded by the Frank Anthony Public School and himself and supported by a host of organisations, including the Church of North India and the Catholic Church.

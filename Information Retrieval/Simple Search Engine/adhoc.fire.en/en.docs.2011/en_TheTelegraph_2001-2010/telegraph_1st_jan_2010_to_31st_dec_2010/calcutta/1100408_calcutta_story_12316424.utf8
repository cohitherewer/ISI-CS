          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Three persons, including a police constable, were killed in three road mishaps in the city since Tuesday night.         
	Motorcyclist Mumtaz Afzal, 33, was crushed under the wheels of an unknown vehicle near Chinatown on the Park Circus Bypass connector late on Tuesday.        
	Police said Afzal, a constable with the Reserve Force, sustained severe head injuries. Residents of the area took the cop to Ruby General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.        
	The vehicle hit Afzals motorcycle from behind, throwing him on the road. He was wearing a helmet but it was not enough to prevent fatal head injuries. The tyres of the killer vehicle crushed the helmet, said an officer of the traffic control room.         
	According to him, the police could not find any witness to the accident.         
	Roshanara Begum, 45, died and another woman suffered serious injuries after a mini-truck rammed into the autorickshaw in which they were travelling at the crossing of Syed Amir Ali Avenue and Congress Exhibition Road early on Wednesday.        
	An officer of Karaya police station said the mini-truck was moving at high speed and made a sharp turn before hitting the autorickshaw.        
	The autorickshaw overturned and the two women passengers sustained severe injuries. Local residents pulled the two passengers and the driver out of the vehicle, said a police officer.        
	Roshanara, a resident of West Row in the Park Circus area, and the other injured woman, identified as 20-year-old Alisha Fernandes, were taken to Chittaranjan Hospital. Roshanara was declared dead by the doctor.        
	Roshanaras head was smashed. The body has been sent for post-mortem, he added.         
	Alisha, a resident of Picnic Garden, suffered injuries on her waist and knee. She was discharged from hospital late on Wednesday afternoon.        
	Munna, a 60-year-old labourer, was knocked down by a speeding Tata Sumo in front of a post office on AJC Bose Road, near SSKM Hospital, early on Wednesday.        
	He was taken to the hospital, where he was declared brought dead.        
	Police said Munna was one of the labourers engaged in a road repair project of the public works department in the area. The car sped away after the mishap.

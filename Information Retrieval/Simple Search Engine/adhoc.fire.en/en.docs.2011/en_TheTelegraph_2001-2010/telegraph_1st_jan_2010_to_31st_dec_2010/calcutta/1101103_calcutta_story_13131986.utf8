The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops roll out cracker plan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops roll out cracker plan
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Anyone caught bursting banned crackers on Kali Puja/Diwali will have to spend at least a night behind bars.        
	The police announced on Tuesday that those caught violating the cracker ban would be booked under the Indian Explosives Act and IPC Section 188 (disobedience to government order).        
	Though the sections are bailable, the accused cannot be released till court production the next day, said an officer.        
	According to a state government order, crackers producing more than 90 decibel sound at four metres from the point of origin are banned.        
	Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), said that apart from the regular force, 500 traffic homeguards, 900 trainee constables, 850 trainee sergeants and 200-odd homeguards would be deployed in the city from 4pm on Diwali. Our men will be deployed in highrises, too.        
	In the past few years, residents of highrises were primarily held responsible for large-scale violation of noise norms. Reports of violations from police quarters, too, had reached the state pollution control board.        
	Rules are the same for all. The joint commissioner (organisation) has held meetings with the caretakers of the army and police apartments to ensure that the rules are not flouted, added Shamim.        
	The cops have urged people to call up the control room (2214-3230, 2214-3024 and 2214-1310) to report any instance of violation.        
	The police are also organising awareness campaigns, involving school students and NGOs, to sensitise people against bursting banned crackers.         
	Green activist Subhash Dutta, however, is not too optimistic about adherence to cracker norms. Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti is holding roadshows to create awareness but his force is not arresting people selling banned firecrackers, alleged Dutta.        
	The police have till now seized 8,750kg of banned crackers and arrested 78 people in the past few days for possessing, carrying, storing, transporting and using banned crackers. But thats just the tip of the iceberg, claimed Dutta.        
	He and other activists said proper vigil along the state borders would help prevent banned crackers and ingredients to make such fireworks from reaching the city.  
	Diwali deployment  
	Traffic homeguards: 500   
	Trainee constables: 900  
	Trainee sergeants: 850  
	Homeguards: Around 200  
	Plus, the normal force will be on duty

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Four injured in political clash
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Supporters of the CPM and the Trinamul Congress traded bombs and bullets at Metiabruz on Monday morning injuring four persons.        
	According to police, the struggle for area dominance between the parties led to the two-hour clash that started around 11.30am. A large contingent of police had to be deployed to restore order.         
	Trouble started when CPM supporters from Mollahpara allegedly beat up a Trinamul supporter from adjacent Crookpara when he was accompanying his two daughters home from school.        
	After learning about the incident, Trinamul supporters raided Mollahpara and attacked their rivals. After some time, both sides started firing at each other.        
	The gunbattle continued for nearly an hour, triggering panic among residents. Traders downed shutters and pedestrians ran for cover.        
	Over the past few months, working-class residents of Crookpara, which was a CPM stronghold, shifted their loyalties to Trinamul. This triggered the clash, said an officer.        
	Two of the injured allegedly sustained bullet injuries  a bullet grazed a youths abdomen and another youth was hit in the leg. Witnesses said the two were actively involved in the clash.        
	Nobody from either side has lodged a complaint. Our officers are probing the matter, said an officer of South 24-Parganas police.         
	Two residents who were hit by splinters were treated at a local hospital.         
	A preliminary probe indicates 10 bullets were fired and two dozen bombs hurled during the clash. Both groups had amassed a large number of weapons. Raids are on to arrest the criminals, said a cop.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Illegal party office turns criminal den
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Illegal party office turns criminal den

	A Trinamul Congress office which has come up encroaching on Calcutta Port Trust land on Hyde Road, in Kidderpore, has turned into a criminals den, officials and residents have alleged.        
	A party leader admitted that the office had been built illegally but denied that it was harbouring criminals.         
	The goons are hand in glove with some local Trinamul leaders. The party office has been built illegally without permission from the port authorities, a CPT official told Metro.        
	He alleged that the party had set up the office only to extort money from importers and the owners of the godowns in the area.        
	Extortion and other criminal activities have been on the rise since the party office came up. We are living in constant fear as nobody wants to risk his/her life by lodging a police complaint against criminals enjoying political patronage, said a port employee who stays with his family on Hyde Road.        
	Meghnath Poddar, the president of south Calcutta district Trinamul trade union, admitted that the office had come up illegally but claimed the intention was to help local residents.        
	Its true that we didnt take permission from the port authorities and encroached on its land but it was all for a social cause. Its our duty to reach out to the poor and illiterate people in the area. Many people visit the party office daily seeking help and we do whatever we can, he said.        
	He denied that supporters of his party had joined hands with criminals. The allegation is baseless and politically motivated, said Poddar.         
	Residents echoed CPT officials allegation that local Trinamul leaders were in collusion with criminals and the illegal office was the nerve-centre of unlawful activities in the neighbourhood.        
	They (Trinamul leaders) are doing what CPM supporters once did. The political colour has changed but the modus operandi remains the same, said a retired school teacher.        
	An officer of the special section port division (SSPD), too, said: Goons once backed by the CPM switched camps after the last Lok Sabha elections. They are now running the Trinamul show in the area and extorting money from traders. But we cannot take any action against them as no one has come forward to lodge a complaint. The SSPD is a special wing of the city police entrusted with tackling crime in the port area.        
	A group of residents has decided to approach Mukul Roy, senior Trinamul leader and Union minister of state for shipping. His ministry is in charge of the port. We will send him a memorandum highlighting the nexus between the local leaders of his party and criminals, said a resident who did not want to be named.

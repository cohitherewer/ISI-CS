The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Merc noses ahead in Jan lux race
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Merc noses ahead in Jan lux race
          ANASUYA BASU                                            
	Mercedes has nosed ahead of BMW in 2010 after finishing behind it in the sales race of the German marques last year.        
	In the process, the three-pointed star has notched up its best January sales ever of 14 units in the city, four more than BMW.        
	Last year, Mercedes, which had enjoyed a monopoly in the super luxury segment in the city from 1993 till BMWs entry in 2008, sold 103 units, 27 less than BMW.         
	Both the auto majors have launched a marketing blitzkrieg to woo buyers.         
	BMW sent mass text messages during the January Auto Expo claiming 40 per cent of the market share in the super luxury segment.        
	Mercedes launched seven models, starting with the two category-leading products, the S 500L and the GL 350CDI, an SUV, along with the Rs 2-crore two-seater SLS AMG and the Mercedes 3-axle luxury coach at the Delhi Auto Expo. This was followed by the E-Class 250 V6 and E-Class 250 CDI. The companys latest is the Rs 4.5 crore S Guard.        
	The results are showing, in the city as well as across the country. Mercedes had sold 403 units in January nationally, against BMWs 382.        
	We are not interested in capturing the largest market share. We would much rather have profitable growth that would help us in the long run, said the CEO of Mercedes Benz India, Wilfred Aulbur.        
	BMW India president Peter Kronschnabl underlined the companys success in the relatively short time it has been in India. BMW India delivered a strong operating performance in 2009. With a carefully planned and successfully executed market entry strategy and consistent sales performance, BMW India has achieved market leadership in the luxury car segment in India.         
	On the 2009 performance, Aulbur said: The ninth generation E-Class was launched last year. The old E-Class was phased out in the earlier part of the year but the new E-Class was not ready for customers. So, we lost out a bit last year. But we have already bridged the gap and 2010 will be a blockbuster year for Mercedes-Benz in India.

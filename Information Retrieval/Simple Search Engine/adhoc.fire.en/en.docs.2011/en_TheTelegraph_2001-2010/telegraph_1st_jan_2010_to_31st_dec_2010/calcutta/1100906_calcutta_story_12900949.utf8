The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Day-long disruption in Metro
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Day-long disruption in Metro
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Metro Railway trains did not ply on the extended stretch throughout Sunday because of maintenance, forcing hundreds to queue up at the Tollygunge-Garia autorickshaw stand after more than a year.        
	The work on the elevated stretch had to be done during the day since the stretch is not lit. We can carry out maintenance in the tunnel at night since there are lights inside, said a Metro spokesperson.        
	This was the first time Metro trains did not ply on a stretch throughout a day. The work on the third rail, tracks and signalling system started at 10am and continued into the night.        
	Trains would ply as usual on Monday, added the spokesperson. We did not want to inconvenience office- goers, so we chose a Sunday. For two days, we had been publicising that Metro would run on a truncated route on Sunday.        
	The Tollygunge-Garia auto stand near the tram depot bustled with people, many carrying bags after Id and Puja shopping, through the evening. All the horrible memories of these auto rides are coming back, said Arpita Dey, a 21-year-old student of media communications, who was returning home to Bansdroni (Masterda Surya Sen) with stuffed shopping bags around 7pm.        
	On the new stretch, inaugurated on August 22 last year, trains have been prone to breaking down because of alignment problems of the track and the third rail, allegedly caused by overcrowding.

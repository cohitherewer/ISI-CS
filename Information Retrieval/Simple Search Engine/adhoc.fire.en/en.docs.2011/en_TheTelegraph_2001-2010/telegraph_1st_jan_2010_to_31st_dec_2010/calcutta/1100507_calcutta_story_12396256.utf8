The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Water body turns dump
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Water body turns dump
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                          The water body half filled with garbage. (Aranya Sen)                                   
	A nearly eight-bigha water body beside VIP Road at Narayantala is being filled up with garbage collected from nearby buildings by private operators.         
	Every morning and evening we see garbage being carried to the water body on at least 50 carts and being dumped into it. Some of us had tried to stop the youths, who are part of a gang, but they threatened us, said Anuj Mukherjee, a resident of the area.        
	Since municipal workers collect garbage in the morning, some late risers in buildings along VIP Road pay illegal private operators to pick up trash at convenient times, said a conservancy official at Rajarhat-Gopalpur Municipality.        
	According to him, some of this garbage finds its way into the water body. Municipal workers only dump garbage in two specified vats along VIP Road, the official added.         
	The water body, already half-filled with garbage, is the only one in the vicinity.        
	The chairman of the municipality, Tapas Chatterjee, is aware of the problem. We had received a complaint that the water body was being filled up with garbage and put up a bamboo fence around it about three months ago. If the dumping continues, we will definitely take action, he said.

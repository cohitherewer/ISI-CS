                Bahauddin Dagar 

  Bhuvanesh Komkali        Monsoon moods and melodies                    According to the Indias spiritualistic concept of Naad-Brahma, sound is immortal; because, like reincarnation, pure melody re-invents itself again and again. That is why we find folk tunes like Malhars being improvised as powerful ragas blending diverse moods of imposing strength, deep pensiveness or sheer revelry. Maybe this inspired Tansen to re-invent the notes of a zestful raga Bahar as his own meditative Miyan Ki Malhar. Even otherwise, varsha (monsoon) or barkha is also termed as Barkha-Bahar. Both these moods are going to dominate in this evenings concert where rudraveena exponent Bahauddin Dagar, who hails from the legendary Dagar-clan, chooses to evoke the desolate mood of Malhar ragas on his mellow, majestic and rarely-heard instrument. It is bound to reverberate like the slow moving rain-bearing clouds while Bhuvanesh Komkalis vocalism may choose to tread on the borderline between folk-tunes and ragas  in a manner similar to his legendary grandfather Pandit Kumar Gandharva.                  Event: An evening of Malhars presented by Bahauddin Dagar and Bhuvanesh Komkali When: Today at 6 pm Where: Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Vivekananda Hall

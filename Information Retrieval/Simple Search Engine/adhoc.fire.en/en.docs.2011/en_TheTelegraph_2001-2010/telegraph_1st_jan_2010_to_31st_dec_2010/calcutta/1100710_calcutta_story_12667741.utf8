  - Reel-life reunion falls flat          PRATIM D. GUPTA                                          
	October 26, 2007: Long queues outside INOX (Forum) to catch the first-day-first-show of Jab We Met.        
	July 9, 2010: Shahid-Kareena are back on screen but Milenge Milenge is off to a false start with the first show at Fame South City being cancelled. Not that many viewers are disappointed  only two tickets need to be refunded.        
	Producer Boney Kapoor may pitch his six-years-in-the-making Milenge Milenge as the Jab We Met jodis swansong but there are no takers for the Shahid-Kareena pair. Himesh Reshammiya may continue to croon Kuch toh baaki hai, but the audience seems to have had enough of Kapur and Kapoor.        
	The Friday morning show was, in fact, blanked out at the Prince Anwar Shah Road plex after the exhibitor refused to give in to the distributors demand for more shows. With almost zero advances and very little enquiries about the film, four shows a day is more than enough, that was the word from Fame (South City).         
	We wanted more shows because we wanted to give Milenge Milenge the maximum chance of succeeding, insisted Debashish Dey, the distribution head of Aum Moviez, which is handling the Satish Kaushik-directed film in Bengal.        
	But leave alone holding its ground, Milenge Milenge has been a non-starter with the Imran Khan-Sonam Kapoor-starrer I Hate Luv Storys doing much better in its second Friday than the new release. Young audiences are loving the fresh pair (Imran-Sonam), said Deborshi Basu, the general manager of INOX (Forum).         
	Milenge Milenge was conceived in 2004 when Shahid and Kareena were a couple, but problems galore delayed the film. The audience these days is very smart no matter how you package it, they can smell an old, stale film, explained Bollywood trade analyst Vinod Mirani.        
	IT professional Debjani Chakraborty summed it up best: Given their current relationship status, watching Shahid and Bebo romance is a turn-off. Catching a re-run of Jab We Met on TV is a much better option.

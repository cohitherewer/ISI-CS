          OUR BUREAU                                  Spot the plot: land without infrastructure for Infy and Wipro            Farmland as far as the eye can see beyond the action area                Piles of sand but no sign of construction activity                A dirt road runs through the last stretch of the allotted acres    Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta    
	Bengal has again blurred the line between a promise and a pipe dream, banking on land deals with IT behemoths Wipro and Infosys to transform gloom town Rajarhat into a boom town without bothering about basic infrastructure.        
	A plot of land is not all that you need to set up a large IT project. You need infrastructure first, a senior industry official said, echoing all-round scepticism about housing minister and Hidco chairman Gautam Debs claim that all is well in Rajarhat-New Town.        
	Metro visited the Infosys acres in Action Area II after Debs news conference announcing the deal, only to find the area still resembling a wasteland.        
	The 100-odd acres, located around 10km from Technopolis, have no infrastructure worth the name for Infosys, Wipro and Tata Consultancy Services to even contemplate starting their proposed projects in the near future.        
	Azim Premjis Wipro had set an 18-month deadline for work to start on its second campus, but a year has passed without a brick being laid. Officials of the IT department admitted that the fault lay with the government, which inked the land deals but failed to back them up with infrastructure.        
	Both Infosys and Wipro are eager to start operating from the state as soon as possible. We need to work on a war footing if we are to get the requisite infrastructure ready for them, said an official.        
	Although the Bengal government insists that Infosys has urgently asked for land, confusing signals emerged from the companys Bangalore headquarters. Chief executive officer S. Gopalakrishnan said the company wanted to start work in six months, but officials who did not wish to be named insisted that the deal signed last month was just to keep an option open for the future.        
	Even if the IT biggies fast-track their proposed projects, a plethora of infrastructure problems await them. The most obvious drawback is power, or the lack of it.        
	A Hidco official blamed unwarranted resistance from land owners in Chhapna Mouza of Patharghata panchayat  Metro has reported several instances of villagers chasing away workers, trying to install three high-tension electricity poles, to protest the low land price  for the delay in providing power to action areas II and III.        
	Unless we manage to end the impasse, no project can start in action areas II and III, said a Hidco official.         
	The operations head of a top IT company with an office in Sector V said the government should have resolved such intrinsic issues before seeking investment in Rajarhat-New Town.        
	Power and telecom connectivity are something that IT companies cannot do without from construction to operation, he said.        
	Action areas II and III also lack sewers and water pipelines because 30 families living in the nearby Baliguri Mouza have been preventing Hidco from undertaking any work. Their grouse is that the government acquired land from them at nominal prices years ago and is now allotting these plots to IT companies for huge amounts of money.        
	With Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress fanning the flames, chances of a breakthrough before the Assembly elections appear remote.        
	The only development in the area since Wipro picked up a 50-acre parcel of land last December is the construction of a motorable road leading to the IT plots.        
	The road, supposed to be a six-lane expressway, now has four lanes till the 100-acre Uniworld housing project by Unitech. It is a two-lane road thereafter that ends near the Wipro plot.

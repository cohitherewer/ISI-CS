The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Post kills youth on train 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Post kills youth on train 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Passengers hanging out of trains run the risk of crashing into posts                                  
	A 22-year-old youth leaning out of a local train to spit out gutka crashed into a signal post near Howrah station and died within minutes on Sunday morning.        
	Family sources said Sujay Majumder was returning home to Purulia for the first time since he got a job in a Karnataka hatchery four years ago.         
	The mishap occurred under the Bamangachi bridge  the spot where, according to RPF sources, at least five commuters in the past one-and-a-half years fell off over-crowded compartments after hitting against signal posts.        
	An RPF officer often deployed along the stretch said the posts were barely two-and-a-half feet from the tracks.         
	Sujay and cousin Rabilochan Sarker, who works in the same hatchery, arrived at Howrah from Bangalore early on Sunday. At 8.30am, they boarded a local train for Burdwan, from where they were to take another train to Purulia.        
	Being Sunday, the train was not over-crowded and both cousins got seats.        
	Sujay was chewing gutka and he leaned out of the door to spit out when the train was passing under the Bamangachi bridge.        
	I rushed to the door after hearing a loud thud and a scream, recalled Rabilochan. Other passengers told me that Sujay was flung off the compartment after crashing his head against a signal. I leaned out and saw him lying beside the tracks in a pool of blood.        
	Rabilochan got off at Liluah, the next station, around 3km from the accident spot, and got in touch with the station master, who immediately alerted the RPF.        
	The RPF authorities arranged for an engine from Liluah that carried Sujay from the mishap spot to Howrah station, from where he was rushed to the district hospital.        
	Doctors said he was admitted to the surgical ward with critical head injuries but died soon after. The body has been sent for post-mortem and a case of unnatural death has been registered.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Landfill cry against realtor
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Landfill cry against realtor
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                              
	A realty company is illegally filling up a water body beside VIP Road to create a path from the airport artery to an apartment block it is constructing, residents have alleged.         
	The 15 residents who recently wrote to the state pollution control board requesting it to save the Sreebhumi water body believe the local civic body, South Dum Dum Municipality, is hand in glove with the realtor. According to the complainants, a portion of the water body about 300ft long and 20ft wide has been filled up.        
	Officials at the project site said a direct link with VIP Road would increase the price of the flats in the seven-storey building and hence the path was being constructed over the water body.         
	Local Trinamul councillor and the vice-chairman of the municipality, Sujit Bose, claimed the PWD, which owns the land, had allowed the water body to be filled up.         
	A PWD official said: We had given a conditional permission. We lodged an FIR with Lake Town police station three months ago when they violated the condition.         
	We will probe the matter. No government department, apart from the land and fisheries departments, can allow landfill, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the pollution control board.        
	The realty firm refused comment.

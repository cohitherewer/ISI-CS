The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flames swallow pen factory
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Flames swallow pen factory
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The gutted unit at Tiljala. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	A ballpoint pen manufacturing unit in Tiljala that lacked the basic firefighting preparedness was gutted on Sunday morning.        
	Ten tenders fought from 9.15am to 10.35am to control the blaze, which firemen said could have spread to adjoining shanties. Had it not been a Sunday, there could have been some casualties, said a fire department officer.        
	Divisional fire officer Tapan Ghosh said his department had only gathered that the gutted unit was owned by someone called Jalan.        
	We will try to trace him and if he cannot produce a fire licence we will lodge an FIR against him, he said.         
	The unit, where around a dozen women worked, was stacked with inflammable articles. It shared the premises, 3 Tiljala Road, with two more factories and several shanties, some of which are within a few feet of the gutted unit.        
	Ghosh said a drive would be launched within a couple of days to check whether other factories and godowns in the area had fire licences.        
	If that happens, probably the first to be hauled up would be the owner of another units at 3 Tiljala Road, who told Metro on Sunday that he did not possess a fire licence because he refused to pay hefty bribes to fire officers.        
	According to the law, you have to pay Rs 500 for a fire licence, which isnt much. But you actually end up paying 10 times more, said the owner.        
	Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of the fire and emergency services, said he would take stern action against officers asking for bribe to issue fire licences if there were specific, written complaints.

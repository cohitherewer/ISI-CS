	 The article Maximum city (November 14) was very informative. The transformation of the erstwhile marshy and muddy hinterland of Salt Lake into a thickly-populated area is surprising.             
	I make frequent visits to the place as I have relatives living there. Keshtopur is gradually becoming an important hub because of its proximity to Salt Lake and Rajarhat.           
	This area scores over many others mainly because of its easy connectivity to other important places.           
	A lot of IT employees also prefer living here as the rent has shot up in recent times. But the stretch from VIP Road leading to Ghoshpara and Londonpara is unimaginably busy with people and vehicles of all sorts jostling for space. Accidents are also common here.           
	Civic problems are also a big issue here, thanks to the unplanned way buildings are coming up. One hopes that the Rajarhat-Gopalpur Municipality will tackle these problems with more seriousness.                     
	P.B. Saha,

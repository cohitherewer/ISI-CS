The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Devotee suspect in temple theft
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Devotee suspect in temple theft
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An unknown woman devotee who had been spending hours at a family Sitala temple in Girish Park stole the silver jacket of the stone idol on Sunday afternoon.         
	The middle-aged woman made off with the jacket, worth Rs 1.5 lakh, while an elderly member of the family was making arrangements for evening prayer in the 200-year-old temple.         
	The jacket with engravings, known as Abhay Murti, was meant to protect the stone idol from wear and tear.         
	Regulars at the 17 Panchu Dhawan Lane temple, which belongs to the Dutta family but is opened to outsiders in the morning and evening, said the woman had been spending hours on the premises for the past three days.         
	On Sunday, the temple gates were opened at the usual time of 4pm.        
	The woman walked in soon after. She disappeared after some time with the jacket even as my father-in-law Manimohan Dutta, who is 80 and partially deaf, was preparing for the evening prayer. There was no one else in the temple at the time, said Pinky Dutta, a member of the family.         
	Pinkys husband Soumen lodged a complaint with Girish Park police station, based on which a probe was started.        
	According to sleuths, the accused, in her mid-40s, was wearing a saffron sari on Sunday. There was hardly anything suspicious about her. She had only been sitting inside the temple and praying, sometimes with her eyes closed, said an officer.         
	We now realise that she had actually been surveying the temple. She had probably noticed that Manimohan Dutta was hard of hearing and hence dared to steal the jacket when his back was turned to the idol, added the officer.

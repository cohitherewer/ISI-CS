          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                      The building under Karaya police station. (Bishwarup Dutta)      
	Two senior civic officials and a police officer will have to explain in the high court why contempt proceedings must not be started against them for allowing a construction in the Karaya area in violation of a judicial stay.        
	Justice Prosenjit Mondal on Wednesday asked Debasish Manna and Asish Guha, the executive engineer and assistant engineer in the civic building department, to appear before him and submit their replies within three weeks.        
	Similar orders were also passed against A.K. Ghosh, the officer-in-charge of Karaya police station, and developer Ali Hossain and three of his aides.        
	The court order followed a contempt petition by Amir Hossain, the owner of a three-cottah plot at 32/B Miajan Ostagar Lane.        
	Hossain had moved court stating that co-owners of the plot, all his relatives, had kept him in the dark while getting a building plan sanctioned by the civic body and hiring a developer to start construction.        
	Acting on his plea, Justice Mondal had on May 28 ordered the developer to suspend work till the case came up for hearing again in the third week of July.        
	On Wednesday, Hossains lawyer Ibrahim Sheikh told the judge that construction was on despite the injunction. On May 28, only the ground floor was built. But now the third floor is under construction, Sheikh submitted.        
	The lawyer said his client had sent a copy of the order to the civic building department and Karaya police station. But the authorities did not bother to ask the developer to stop work.        
	Achinta Banerjee, who represented the civic body, did not oppose the submission.        
	The judge, after verifying all documents, issued contempt rule against the accused.

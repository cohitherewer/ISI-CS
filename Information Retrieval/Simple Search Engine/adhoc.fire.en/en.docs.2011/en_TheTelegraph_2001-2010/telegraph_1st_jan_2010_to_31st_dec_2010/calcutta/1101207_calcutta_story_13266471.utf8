                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rajarhat school to reopen today
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Delhi Public School Megacity, closed since villagers went on the rampage on campus on Saturday, is likely to reopen on Tuesday.        
	Normal classes will be held from Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Rajarhat school said on Monday after representatives of the management attended a meeting with villagers and cops at Rajarhat police station.        
	On Saturday morning, a giant water drum being carried to the school on a cycle van had toppled on the bumpy road and crushed local boy Rakibul Islam Mollah to death.        
	Villagers blamed the school for the poor condition of the road and destroyed two security booths and a bus on the campus.         
	The management immediately deferred the annual sports scheduled for Saturday and Sunday. On Monday, too, the campus remained closed.        
	Cops and villagers who attended the meeting at the police station said the management had offered to recruit Rakibuls father Jehar Ali Mollah to a Group D post.        
	The school spokesperson, however, refused to comment on the claim.        
	Jehar Ali, who has two small kids, attended the meeting. The school has agreed to offer Jehar Ali a job with a salary of Rs 4,000. If Jehar Ali refuses to accept it, the school is ready to recruit someone else from the family. The school also agreed to talk to the local panchayat and arrange for the repair of the road, said Saidul Molla, a villager who had attended the meeting.

	A software engineer working for IBM hanged himself at his Baguiati home, a complaint by his father prompting police to arrest his wife and her mother on abetment charge.        
	Gopal Chandra Saha, 28, was found hanging in a room after he apparently locked up his wife in another room following a tiff.        
	Neighbours broke into the flat early on Thursday after hearing someone bang on a door. After rescuing Gopals wife Joyita from the locked room, they broke open another door and found the husband hanging from a ceiling fan.        
	The police said Gopal returned from work late on Wednesday and blasted his wife for not taking his calls. His wifes phone had apparently been busy when he tried to reach her. He accused her of chatting with her lover, a police officer said.        
	Joyita, 23, and her mother Hena Banerjee, 47, were arrested following a complaint by Gopals father Tushar. The duo have been booked under IPC Section 306 (abetment to suicide). They will be produced in Barasat court on Friday, said North 24-Parganas police superintendent Rahul Srivastava.        
	Tushar, who lives in North Dinajpur, stated in his complaint that his son had come to know about his wifes affair and asked her several times to end the relationship. But she refused. Her mother knew about the affair and backed her. The two drove my son to suicide.        
	Gopal, an MTech in electronics and communication from Calcutta University, had got married to the woman from Bagnan in Howrah six months ago. He had been working at IBMs New Town facility as an application developer since 2007.

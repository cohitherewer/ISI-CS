The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | VC hunt beyond Bengal
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      VC hunt beyond Bengal
  - Search panel casts net wider after two candidates opt out          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	The three-member search committee deputed by the government to fast-track the appointment of a vice-chancellor for Presidency University has landed in a spot with a couple of suitable candidates already declining the offer.        
	The search committee had sounded out two senior academicians from the city but both of them have since opted out. So even drawing up a list is becoming a bit difficult. The panel is now looking for candidates from outside Bengal, said a source in the higher education department.         
	Desperate to complete Presidencys upgrade to a university before the Assembly polls, the beleaguered Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has set August 20 as the unofficial deadline for drawing up a shortlist of candidates.        
	Economist Amiya Bagchi heads the search committee, which also includes former Indian Statistical Institute director Sankar Pal and Jadavpur University vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh.         
	The standard procedure of selecting a vice-chancellor is a long-drawn one, starting with the formation of a search committee. The panel draws up a list of around 10 candidates either on the basis of recommendations from academicians or from a pool of applicants. A scrutiny whittles down the list to three or four names, which are then forwarded alphabetically  to the chancellor (in this case, the governor).        
	Although the process takes around two to three months, the government wants it completed in less than a month.        
	The government announced the names of the committee members on August 2, but the trio have met only once so far. The first sitting was held earlier this week.        
	We are expecting the recommendations of the committee by September 3, higher education secretary Satish Tiwary told Metro on Thursday.         
	Ghosh had earlier admitted that meeting the governments deadline was not possible given the onerous task of selecting the best possible candidate for an institution like Presidency University.         
	But sources in the higher education department said the committee had already been briefed about the need to speed up the selection process and that the members were trying their best to draw up the shortlist in the shortest possible time.         
	The government had initially insisted on someone from Calcutta. But the net has been cast wide now. The committee members are looking for suitable alumni of Presidency College now living outside Bengal, said the source.

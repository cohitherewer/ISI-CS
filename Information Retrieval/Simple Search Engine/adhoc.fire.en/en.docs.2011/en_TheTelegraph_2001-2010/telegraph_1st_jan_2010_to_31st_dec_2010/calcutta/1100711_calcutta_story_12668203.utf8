The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Premier problems 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Premier problems 
          World Cup fever grips the city. Premier division city football clubs try to find a ground to practise, reports Poulomi Banerjee                          Chirag United players practise at Salt Lake stadium. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                      
	Thirty-one-year-old Abhijit Mondal played for Dempo Sports Club in Goa for eight years and has now joined Chirag United Sports Club in Calcutta. He lives in Santoshpur. His fitted red T-shirt and jeans show his toned body to advantage. He was part of the team that won the national I- League four times in recent years, but laughs: I dont think even my neighbour knows that I play football.               
	Worse, new in Chirag, he is unsure whether the officials at the clubs Maidan office will recognise him.         
	There has been talk about the revival of Indian football. There has also been talk about more money being pumped in by private sponsors. But other than the Big Three  East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting  most Calcutta premier division clubs do not even have a locus standi.        
	Sixteen clubs from the city play in the premier division of the Calcutta Football League, organised by the Indian Football Association (IFA), the governing body for football in the state.         
	We do not have a ground. We practice at the University grounds. If it is unavailable for some reason we practice somewhere else, says Sibaji Banerjee, a former player and the superintendent (sports) of Calcutta Port Trust Sports Club.        
	Chirag practices at the Bidhan Nagar Sports Academy ground. So does Peerless. Chirag doesnt have its own tent either and uses the Airlines Recreational Club tent at the Maidan. We have some very good stadiums in the state, but they are under the control of one political leader or another. They wont let the players practice, grumbles a source in Chirag.         
	Usually the condition of the grounds is so bad that playing becomes difficult in the monsoons, says 23-year-old Arnab Mondal who plays for Chirag. Its a good thing that the Yuva Bharati Krirangan has got an artificial turf. We will be able to play better, he says.         
	A big club like Mohun Bagan or East Bengal would have an annual budget of about Rs 9 crore each, says an official. A Mohammedan Sporting or Chirag would have a budget of approximately Rs 2 crore each, the other smaller clubs which play the premier division of the Calcutta Football League will have a budget of less than Rs 20 lakh, said Subrata Dutta, a vice-president of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and as well as the IFA, and general secretary of the George Telegraph Sports Club. A budget of Rs 20 lakh is just enough to run the club, but not enough to play good football, says Banerjee.         
	Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Chirag United Sports Club play at the I-League, organised by the AIFF, the national administrative body for the sport. Mohammedan Sporting plays in the second division of I-League.         
	A big player in a big club may earn more than Rs 50 lakh a season. But there are only a few in the big league, such as Bhaichung Bhutia of East Bengal and his teammates Alvito DCunha and Rahim Nabi, and Barreto in Mohun Bagan.         
	I sat for the SSC (School Service Commission) examination. Its a little frustrating to not have had a job offer even after four seasons in top division teams, says Mohan Sarkar, 22, a promising side-back set to sign with Aryan Club this year for Rs 1.25 lakh for the season.         
	According to Maidan veterans, the drying up of government and public sector jobs has been a deterrent. The middle and upper classes of society have distanced itself from the game. In the Port Trust team, only three players are employees, the rest are all hired players. The Peerless team is made up completely of hired members.         
	Most of the players come from families that are not well off. All the players are from poor families and most of them are from the outskirts of Calcutta or from the districts, says Anjan Banerjee, chief coach of the Dukhiram Coaching Scheme.         
	Nutrition is an almost unheard of concept. Football requires a lot of physicality. You need at least 2,000-2,500 calories every day. But most clubs would only give the players a few pieces of bread, eggs and bananas after practice or sometimes a vegetable stew and bread. How many of the players can afford to have meat and fish on a regular basis? asks an IFA official.         
	Subhas Chakraborty, the 26-year-old player of Chirag United, says that he was prescribed a diet when he was a part of Mumbai FC. But I dont think we have all that here, he says. In the absence of proper maintenance burn-out is common. Players of the small clubs here enjoy a shorter life on the field than they should because they start losing their stamina, says Asoke Dasgupta, the manager (football) of Peerless Sports Club.         
	Injuries are common. Often the clubs, especially the smaller clubs do not even pay for the treatment of the players. Or they pay only a part of the cost, says a physiotherapist.         
	So what happened to the sponsors? The National Football League, now I-League, which started just 14 years ago and draws football clubs from all over the country, has hurt Calcutta football. Before that, the Calcutta Football League was the main tournament in the country and drew the best players. But now the National League gets the big cash flow.         
	And of course, cricket. Its where the sponsors like to put the money, more and more. Dutta feels football needs a makeover. Whether its George Telegraph or Chirag or the Port Trust Club, they have no fans because people do not identify with them. If the teams were called Calcutta or Bengal they would have more support, he feels. Dutta gave the example of clubs abroad. They are named after places. Chelsea or Manchester. People identify with those clubs, he pointed out.         
	Football is a game that does not allow for much on-air promotion. There is only the half-time when one can advertise. Sponsors look for people connect. The middle class and upper middle class do not go to the stadium because there are no provisions for drinking water, toilets or security, says Dutta.         
	The way forward, suggests the Cricket Association of Bengal joint secretary Biswarup Dey, is to groom players at the school stage: In China, there are two periods in school dedicated to sports. If kids are introduced to soccer at the school level many of them can take to it.         
	Stars like Shilpa Shetty and John Abraham have expressed interest in funding teams, says Dutta. But even John Abraham promising to go topless if his team wins cannot save Calcutta football unless bigger changes take place first.                     WITH INPUTS FROM RITH BASU

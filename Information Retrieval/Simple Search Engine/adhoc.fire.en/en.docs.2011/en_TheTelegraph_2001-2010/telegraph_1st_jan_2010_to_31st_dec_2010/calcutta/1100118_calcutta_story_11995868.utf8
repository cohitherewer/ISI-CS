The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vanilla with chocolate sauce was his favourite
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Vanilla with chocolate sauce was his favourite

	For years, she was the one person Jyoti Basu would listen to at home. Dolly Basu, the former wife of son Chandan, tells Metro about the workaholic and foodie she knew so well              
	He was always a small eater. But he never said no to ice-cream. Vanilla with chocolate sauce was his favourite.        
	He loved meat as long as it was tender. His usual comment on a meat dish was khub bhalo, norom chhilo.        
	He had an irritable bowel syndrome. Once he told Dr Bholanath Chakraborty Dolly ke shariyechhen amake sharachhen na to (You have cured Dolly but not me).        
	You have to give up fries, Dr Chakraborty said.        
	But I hardly eat fries, he replied.        
	Machher chop, mangsher chop I reminded him.         
	O gulo abar bhaja naki? was his surprised reply.        
	Dr Chakraborty gave up.        
	I eat a lot of salads, and he always used to tell me: Aami tomar moto ghash phush khete parbo na (I cannot have those leaves and vegetables).        
	He would work 12 months a year with hardly any break. He would do exactly what he pleased at home and would not listen to anyone. I was the only one to shout at him when he took too much stress.        
	I was in touch with him, always. I did visit him in hospital on Saturday but one can hardly call it a meeting. The last time we spoke was when I visited him at home six-seven days before he was hospitalised. He was fine then, except for a cough.

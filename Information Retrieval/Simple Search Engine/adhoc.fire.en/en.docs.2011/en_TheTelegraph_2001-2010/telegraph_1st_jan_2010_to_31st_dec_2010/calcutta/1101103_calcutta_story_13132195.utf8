The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pleasant spell minus chill
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pleasant spell minus chill
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Mondays chill was missing for most part of Tuesday following the weakening of a low-pressure trough but the pleasant spell is likely to continue for a few more days.        
	The maximum temperature on Tuesday was 27.4 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal.         
	The day before, it had slid six degrees below normal, heralding a cold day condition that meteorologists said was unusual for November.        
	The cold feeling will steadily reduce over the next couple of days. The maximum temperature, predictably, has climbed up and the minimum was a degree higher than normal, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	He attributed the change to the weakening of the low-pressure trough extending from coastal Bengal to Tamil Nadu, which had on Monday resulted in a dense cloud cover that blocked out the sun and insulated the surface from heat.        
	The systems influence has weakened. The weather will become warmer after a pleasant spell for a few more days, said Debnath.        
	Over the next few days, the city could experience light to moderate rain because of a low-pressure area hovering over the South Andaman Sea.        
	The system may turn into a depression in the next 24 hours.        
	It may further intensify into a cyclonic storm and move towards the Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh coasts, said an official.        
	But the weatherman said the system is not likely to have a major impact on the weather over south Bengal. It may only bring light to moderate rain.

                      Tribute to Chopin                    The music of Frdric Chopin is, in many ways, a record of Chopin the pianist. All of his music is either for solo piano, or places the piano in an important role. As a performer, he was known for his improvisational ability, and his compositions are often the result of these performances. The wonder of Chopins music is the way he conjured new sounds from the piano. His pieces explore the full expressive range of the instrument, and he had the ability to create, sometimes in just a few lines of music, a kind of musical poetry. He also extended the harmonic language of the Romantic style; not by bold leaps to new chords and tonalities, but by subtle side trips that take his pieces to those new tonal areas. Remembered as one of the first nationalist composers, using the themes and dances of his native Poland as the sources for his pieces, Chopin was, in every way, the quintessential Romantic composer. To celebrate the year of Chopin in India, Embassy of the Republic of Poland, Indian Council for Cultural Relations and Bangalore School of Music, in collaboration with Calcutta School of Music, Consulate of Poland in Calcutta, Alliance Francaise and Goethe Institut, host Universal Chopin, an evening of Chopindia music and dance presented by piano maestro Jersy Sterczynski with Indian contemporary dance artiste Madhu Natraj and group.

                      Vignettes of American life                    People do not often juxtapose the terms art and history. They tend to think of history as the record and interpretation of past human actions, particularly social and political actions. Most think of art as part of the present  as something they can see and touch. People cannot, of course, see or touch historys vanished human events. But a visible and tangible artwork is a kind of persisting event. One or more artists made it at a certain time and in a specific place, even if no one now knows just who, when, where or why. Although created in the past, an artwork continues to exist in the present, long surviving its time. The first painters and sculptors died 30,000 years ago, but their works remain, some of them exhibited in glass cases in museums built only a few years ago. The current exhibition showcases the artistic heritage of the US and offers unique insights into the character, ideals, and aspirations of the country. Hosted by the US State department, in association with the National Endowment for the Humanities in Washington, D.C., it comprises 40 framed reproductions of significant American art (including paintings, fine crafts, sculpture, photography and architecture). The images span several centuries and feature artists ranging from early American Indian artisans to painters Mary Cassatt and Thomas Hart Benton, photographers Walker Evans and Dorothy Lange, to architects Frank Lloyd Wright and William Van Alen.

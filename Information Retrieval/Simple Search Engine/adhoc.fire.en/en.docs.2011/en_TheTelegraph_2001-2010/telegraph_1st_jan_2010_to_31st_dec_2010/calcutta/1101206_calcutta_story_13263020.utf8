The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Winter hope in cloudy sky
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Winter hope in cloudy sky
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An overcast sky on Sunday triggered hopes of light rain the day after and a cool and dry weekend ahead.        
	The weatherman has predicted spells of light rain on Monday, which will drag down the mercury that has mostly remained below the normal mark this month.        
	The clouds will gradually move away, leading to sunny days and cooler evenings and nights around the weekend, said an official in the India Meteorological Department.        
	The Alipore Met office attributed Sundays cloud cover to the combined influence of two atmospheric formations over the Bay of Bengal.        
	A low-pressure area over the southwest Bay and a cyclonic circulation near the Bengal coast have boosted the flow of moisture into south Bengal from the sea, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Thanks to the excess moisture, the days minimum humidity, which usually drops to 40 per cent or below around this time of the year, was 58.        
	Also because of the moisture, the weather is not as dry as it should be now, said an IMD official.

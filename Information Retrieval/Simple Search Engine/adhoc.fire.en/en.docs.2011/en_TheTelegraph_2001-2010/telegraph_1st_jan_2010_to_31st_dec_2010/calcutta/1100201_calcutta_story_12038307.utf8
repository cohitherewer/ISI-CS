The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The physics behind Nobel laurels
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      The physics behind Nobel laurels
          PRASUN CHAUDHURI                           Anthony James Leggett. (Prasun Chaudhuri)                                  
	If the country needs more Nobel laureates in science it should make sure there are enough good teachers at the elementary level. Thats the prescription by Anthony James Leggett, physics Nobel Prize winner in 2003, for drawing talented students to basic sciences.         
	A lot depends on the quality of teaching and it should be the highest priority of governments all over the world, said Leggett on the sidelines of the Meghnad Saha memorial lecture, which he delivered at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Salt Lake on January 27.         
	Scientists should also come out of ivory towers and deliver popular talks to share the excitement in the arena of basic sciences, he added.        
	Leggett did that during his lecture tour of the city, finding time to interact with researchers, postgraduate students and young faculty members of various universities. He also went to the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, and met budding techies.        
	The septuagenarian, who won the Nobel prize for his work in low-temperature physics, found his calling relatively late.        
	I was channelled into the stream of classics (Latin, Greek and philosophy). In those days in Britain, good students chose classics and became either civil servants or teachers. Only after graduation did I decide to follow my heart and shift to physics, he said.         
	He joined Oxford University to start afresh as an undergraduate. Despite acute financial problems, he carried on with theoretical physics and four decades later was rewarded with the Nobel prize for his pioneering contributions to the theory of superfluids.         
	Leggetts early inspiration was a retired priest in his school who encouraged him to explore math and physics casually after the lessons were over.        
	Its possible to convey the fundamental charm of physics to school children if there is a good teacher. You need not go into the complicated things or technical ramifications, just show them the big picture, he said.         
	His own love affair with his subject continues. Right now Ive delved deep into a new area of research called quantum computing opened up by early work in superfluidity, he said.        
	Doesnt he regret losing four years of his career?        
	Not at all. I jokingly say that my basic study in Greek helped me identify the letters alpha, beta and lambda in formulae more easily compared to my colleagues. However, there is a serious answer: a background in philosophy taught me to be more sceptical about things my colleagues take for granted. Moreover, it taught me to value the notion that in order to get the right answer you have to learn to formulate your question properly, said the scientist.

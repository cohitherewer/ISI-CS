The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Non-invasive surgery to remove tumour
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Non-invasive surgery to remove tumour
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Patients with tumour less than 4cm in diameter can now go for a non-invasive surgery in the city.         
	Doctors seem happy with the procedure performed for the first time in eastern India on Jivan Das (name changed on request), who had a tumour in his pituitary gland.        
	The tumour was removed using a precision-based high dose radiation therapy, said Arundhati Chakraborty, a senior consultant oncologist at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Calcutta, who led a team of doctors to treat Das.        
	Electrons, photons and different types of energies can be used to diffuse different types of tumours. In traditional radiotherapy this is not possible, said Chakraborty. While higher levels of radiation energy are required for deep-seated tumours, lower energy is used for superficial ones.        
	The radiation is planned three to four days before the procedure on the basis of a CT scan image. The information is fed into the software used for the radiation therapy, said Chakraborty.         
	To ensure that the radiation hits the target, doctors use two devices known as the infrared camera tracker and the infrared marker. The radiation comprises focussed beams of rays affecting the tumour and not harming other parts, said city-based neurosurgeon L.N. Tripathi.        
	This procedure protects the normal structures of the brain like the eloquent area which controls speech, understanding, memory, vision, hearing and other key functions, added Tripathi. According to him, the procedure is also effective in treating spine, lung and brain tumours. The radiation beam is synchronised with the bodys breathing process, ensuring that normal tissues are unaffected.        
	The radiation therapy does not result in trauma usually associated with an open-brain surgery. The patient can go back to normal life from the next day. There are also no external scars, pointed out a doctor.

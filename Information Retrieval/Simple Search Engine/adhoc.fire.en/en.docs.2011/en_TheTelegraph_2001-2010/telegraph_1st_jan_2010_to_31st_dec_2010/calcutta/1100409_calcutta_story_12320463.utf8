The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Park Street trio await nod 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Park Street trio await nod 
          SUBHRO SAHA                                            
	Two weeks after the inferno scorched Stephen Court and scarred Park Street, the citys food-and-fun corridor is desperate to bounce back, hoping that raising the shutters would help lift some of the gloom. But they might be forced to wait a few more days.        
	Flurys-Music World-Peter Cat, the Stephen Court addresses comprising the feel-good nerve centre of Park Street, were till Wednesday hopeful of resuming operations by the end of this week. The establishments were handed out a damper at a conclave on Thursday morning when the civic body and the fire department sought fresh applications before they could give the go-ahead.        
	We were told we had to send separate applications to the CMC and the fire department for clearances, following which there would be another round of inspection of our premises, based on which the green signal could be granted. It doesnt look like happening by this weekend, said Chetan Arora, the business head (east) of Music World Retail Ltd.        
	Music World Park Street, the countrys best-performing music retail outlet, has already lost over Rs 50 lakh of business since the March 23 blaze. Poila Baisakh is round the corner and this is the time our average footfall jumps from 1,500-2,000 to over 3,000 a day, observed Arora.        
	Flurys, the landmark tearoom of 1926 vintage next door, was even more buoyant, hoping to lay its tables from Friday. We have carried out all the changes recommended by the inspection team and are absolutely ready. We were expecting the formal go-ahead from the authorities by Thursday, Anirban Simlai, the unit head of The Park, Calcutta, which operates Flurys, told Metro.        
	Now it seems Flurys fans will have to wait longer to be served their favourite beans on toast or toasted ham sandwich. The Swiss confectionery has lost considerable sit-down footfall, being forced to retail out of The Street inside The Park, pending the green signal for Stephen Court.        
	Rajiv Kothari, the owner of One Step Up housed in the same building, was not counting his chickens before they were hatched. Our premises was inspected by officials of the CMC, the fire department, CESC and the police, but there is no clear indication yet as to when power connection will be restored and we can resume operations. We are losing over Rs 60,000 worth of business a day, said Kothari who lives and works at Stephen Court and has been forced to relocate with his family.        
	Peter Cat owner Nitin Kothari is also forced to count his losses now as the shutters remain down. We are a 160-cover restaurant with more than 110 employees. Clearly, the liabilities are huge for every day of business lost. Since the ground floor hasnt been affected, and we have already taken recommended measures, we thought we could open by this weekend. Now, anything before the middle of next week looks unlikely, he sighed.        
	Police bosses have maintained that they were open to the idea of business establishments opening up at Stephen Court and even allowing residents to walk in. We have been open to the idea for long. Residents who have a flat should be allowed in and that holds for business establishments as well, said Jawed Shamim, joint police commissioner, headquarters.        
	Senior officers maintained if the civic officials along with their counterparts in fire services were ready to give the nod, the cops wont play party-poopers.        
	Its not about any one body giving any final clearance. The establishments would have to seek separate clearances from the bodies concerned, said Banibrata Basu, the special commissioner of police.        
	Officials in the CMCs building department told Metro on Thursday that portions of Stephen Court were precarious and it would be risky to give the go-ahead. It will take at least a week if not more for us to give the nod, they said.        
	Across the road too, business had nosedived as the mood was sombre after the devastating blaze, but things are looking up. For a few days after the fire, there were hardly any walk-ins, as Park Street became more like a museum. Everybody stopped and stared at the ravaged floors of Stephen Court and it seemed no one was interested in stopping for a sip and a bite, said Pratap Daryanani, the proprietor of Oasis restaurant.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Our calling card to dark ages
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Our calling card to dark ages

	The way our airport looks, Calcutta seems to be the only important place in the country that has been left behind, like 20 years behind.        
	Anywhere else, say even a smaller city like Jaipur, has moved ahead. We want Calcutta  and its airport  to move ahead and not remain in its present stagnant mode. We obviously dont take pride in the citys airport, because if we did, it wouldnt have looked like this. Its like we are living in the past, in the dark ages.        
	We call ourselves a metro city and even if we cant compete with Mumbai or Delhi, how about places like Bangalore and Jaipur? Even if we cant beat everyone and become the finest in the country, cant we at least try to keep up?        
	There is no reason that we cannot, especially since we call ourselves the countrys first city, the city of intellect and culture. And werent we supposed to be a city with good taste and sophistication? What happens to us in a situation like this?        
	We are too complacent. We have been taking a backseat for far too long. We have learnt to accept everything  whether it is a bandh or a malfunctioning airport. How long are we expected to sit back and accept everything that is thrust upon us?        
	An airport is a citys calling card. We have to remember that the first impression is the last impression. When any visitor enters our airport it is no less than a nightmare. And why visitors alone, what about us? We have to do things for ourselves first and then for others.        
	We have to change things. If that means the airport being privatised, so be it. If those running it are not competent enough, then what is the other option?        
	Here are some suggestions to help improve things at the airport.         
	 Form a think tank. This committee should share the same vision and include people from different walks of life. Calcutta has a lot of people who can bring their expertise to the table so we can really blend art, culture and, of course, efficiency. Intellectuals, writers, artists, businessmen and people who are competent to discuss infrastructure have to be part of this think tank.        
	 Treat it like a business venture. At the end of the day, any successful project is a good business venture. Right now the attitude is that they are doing the passengers a favour. With a business-oriented attitude, they will work hard in bettering the experience of the customer  in this case the passenger  and things will definitely improve. The focus should be on providing the customer or the passenger the best, whether it is what they see and how they are made to feel to the infrastructure and the technology.         
	 Learn from the mistakes  made by us and some made by various airports around the country  to get the basics right. The focus should be on easing bottlenecks and allowing a smooth passage to the passenger.         
	 Introduce some art and sculpture. What about a huge art installation that will take peoples breath away?        
	 Focus on building a beautiful boutique airport. We dont have the resources to build an airport like Hong Kong, Dubai or London but whatever we have, we can surely build a boutique airport.         
	When a passenger arrives at or departs from the airport with a smile, you know you have the best airport in the world. At present, Calcutta airport draws a scowl or a smirk.

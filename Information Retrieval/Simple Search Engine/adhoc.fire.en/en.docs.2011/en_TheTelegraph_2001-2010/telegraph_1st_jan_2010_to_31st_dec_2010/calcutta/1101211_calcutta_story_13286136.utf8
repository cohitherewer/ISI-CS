                Heroin worth Rs 6.27 crore, meant to be delivered to Indonesia, was seized on Friday, moments after a woman had left a bag containing the narcotic at the Park Street office of a courier firm.  We had a tip-off about the consignment but we reached the spot minutes after the woman had left, said Anutosh Khasnobish, the superintendent of the customs preventive and intelligence wing. The consignment comprised two vanity bags and 40 bobbin wraps. The vanity bags had been slit open from inside and heroine pouches were layered within. Pouches were also attached to the bobbins before they were wrapped with threads. Around 1.2 kg of the contraband was seized. Khasnobish said the woman had mentioned a fake address while booking the consignment.    Housing minister Gautam Deb said on Friday that he would clarify how land was acquired for the Rajarhat township at a news conference on December 14.    Nearly two dozen fake printing cartridges of a prominent company were seized in a raid from two Kankurgachhi shops on Thursday. Bireswar Mahapatra, the owner of one of the shops, was arrested.    Pankaj Sharma and Rajib Ghosh were arrested for making extortion calls to Sharmas former employer Vinod Kabra, a trader in Jorasanko. Police said Sharma was sacked a few days back, following which Kabra received calls demanding Rs 2 lakh. The calls were traced to a Howrah PCO. Ghosh, whom Sharma had hired, made the calls, police said.    Residents of Stephen Court met mayor Sovan Chatterjee on Friday to discuss when they could return to their flats. After the meeting, residents said Chatterjee had assured them of all necessary help in the buildings re-construction. Chatterjee said CMC engineers would meet the engineer appointed by the residents next Tuesday to discuss the re-construction plans.    Citu activists blocked railway tracks near Dum Dum Cantonment for 30 minutes from 10am following a clash with Trinamul activists on Friday.

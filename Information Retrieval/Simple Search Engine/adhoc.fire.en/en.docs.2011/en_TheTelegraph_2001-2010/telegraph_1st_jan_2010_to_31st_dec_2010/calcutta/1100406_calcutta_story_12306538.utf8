The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Evening power cut across town
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Evening power cut across town
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Large parts of the city suffered power cuts for most of Monday evening following a severe shortfall in generation.        
	A CESC official said the utility had generated to its capacity but supply from the state grid was restricted.        
	CESC produced 1,178MW and sent out 1,099MW during the peak demand, which shot up to 1,577MW. Because of restricted supply from the state grid, there was a load-shedding of 210MW, the official said.        
	Most parts of north, central and south Calcutta faced power cuts for around two hours in the evening. The worst-hit areas included Belgachhia, Shyambazar, Sovabazar, Lake Town, Ultadanga, Sealdah, Park Circus, Camac Street, AJC Bose Road, Elgin Road, Rashbehari Avenue, Gol Park and Jadavpur.        
	Our area plunged into darkness at 7pm. The last thing we needed during this period of stifling heat was a power cut, said Lake Town resident Rudrani Mukherjee.

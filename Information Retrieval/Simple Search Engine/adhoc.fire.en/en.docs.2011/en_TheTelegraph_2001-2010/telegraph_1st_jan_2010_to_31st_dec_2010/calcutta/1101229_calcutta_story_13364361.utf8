The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Brake on bike gangs
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Brake on bike gangs
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The police spotlight this New Years Eve will be on motorbike gangs, identified as the prime perpetrators of crime against women during the festive period.        
	Lalbazar has formed eight roving teams to keep an eye on groups of youths moving around town on motorbikes, some of them with the sole intention of preying on soft targets in areas without police presence.        
	We are putting special emphasis on preventing any incidence of crime against women and the arrangements are accordingly being tailored to the situation, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti told Metro.         
	The eight teams, comprising four to five officers each, will fan out into the party zones as well as thoroughfares which biker gangs are most likely to use, including the EM Bypass, Ultadanga, Taratala and CIT Road in Phoolbagan.        
	They have been briefed on how to identify trouble-mongers and take pre-emptive action. The final blueprint of the rescheduled arrangements is being drawn up and senior officers will be briefed again about the new focus areas within the next 24 hours, said an officer.         
	Joint police commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim said biker gangs would not only be under the scanner but also have restricted access to the main party zones, including Park Street.        
	Two-wheelers would be barred on the Free School Street-Park Street stretch, which has a watering hole every few metres.        
	This restriction is based on inputs about bike-borne gangs converging on Park Street after midnight in search of soft targets. We have also identified trouble-prone areas around bars and sent advisories to the officers-in-charge of all 48 police stations, asking them to be especially vigilant about the safety of women, said an officer.        
	All party organisers have been asked to install CCTVs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Job after 25 yrs, pension pending for 3 yrs
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Job after 25 yrs, pension pending for 3 yrs
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mohammed Abdur Rouf. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Mohammed Abdur Rouf was selected for a government job in 1982 but got his appointment letter only in 2007, when he was just 41 days short of his retirement age of 60.        
	In the three years since his retirement, the 63-year-old has been running from pillar to post in vain for pension. I am suffering for no fault of mine, said Rouf, who has approached the West Bengal Minorities Commission for relief.        
	The petitioner, a victim of injustice, should get his pension. We have summoned the officials of the food department where Rouf worked, said Kalyan Chaudhuri, the vice-chairman of the minorities commission.        
	Rouf was selected for the post of assistant sampler in the food department on May 5, 1982. But the appointment letter was handed over to him after 25 years because of an alleged delay in filing the police verification report (a must for regularising any government recruitment) and criminal cases filed against him by his brother.        
	Rouf was acquitted of all the charges in 2001, with the court stating that he had been falsely implicated.        
	My brother framed me when he learnt that I had been selected for a government job. But even after I was acquitted the government did not hand me the appointment letter. I visited the food department several times but nobody heard me out, Rouf recalled, sitting in his 9ftx9ft room on Jannagar Road in Park Circus.        
	In 2007, Rouf met Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim and narrated his plight to him. Following Halims intervention, the government issued an appointment letter to Rouf on November 19, 2007. He joined office the next day.         
	I got a salary of Rs 10,736 for the 41 days I was in service. Before that, I had survived on around Rs 900 that I got as rent from my tenants. Even now that is my sole source of sustenance, said Rouf.        
	The government turned down his plea for pension on the ground that a person had to work for at least 10 years to become eligible for post-retirement benefits.        
	Rouf moved the state administrative tribunal which observed in 2008 that there was a provision allowing the government to reconsider and review the question of granting pension. The tribunal directed the principal secretary in the food and civil supplies department to recommend to the appropriate authority for reconsideration of the case... so that he (Rouf) may be favoured with a minimum pension.        
	But the government did not budge, prompting Rouf to petition the minorities commission.

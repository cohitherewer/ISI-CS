                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Blaze guts two illegal factories
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Firemen douse the flames at the factory near Bondel Gate on Monday. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha      
	Fire broke out in two small factories in the city and on its eastern fringes on Monday. Fire department officials said both units lacked basic fire-fighting arrangements.         
	Around noon, a massive fire enveloped a sawmill-cum-plywood godown near Salap on the Howrah-Amta Road. The flames spread quickly and rose as high as a two-storeyed building, creating panic among local residents.        
	A garage and a tyre repairing shop beside the factory were also gutted, said a resident.         
	Ten tenders battled the blaze but even till late in the evening, the fire could not be extinguished. We will need more time as flames remain hidden under stacks of ply. Whenever there is a gust of wind, the flames flare up, explained Subhas Guha, the deputy director (western zone) of the West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services.         
	Monday being a holiday for Holi, no one was injured. On any other day, the fire could have turned fatal. Around 35 people work in the factory, said another resident.         
	Fire services officials said they would press non-bailable charges against the factory owner. The factory did not have the mandatory no objection certificate from the fire services department, said the official.         
	A hosiery factory on Sridhar Roy Road in Kushtia, near Bondel Gate, caught fire around 7am. Ten tenders worked for nearly four hours to bring the blaze under control. This unit, too, didnt have any fire-fighting arrangement.         
	The hosiery factory, located on the ground floor of the five-storeyed building, was badly damaged. The extent of loss was yet to be ascertained.         
	Fire services officials said there were several such hosiery units in the area that lacked basic fire fighting arrangements. We have lodged an FIR against the owner of the factory at Tiljala police station, the official added.         
	The cause of the fire in either factory could not be ascertained till late on Monday.

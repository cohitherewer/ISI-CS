          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                      Shamik Debnath arrives at Howrah station on Sunday evening with his arm in a cast. (Tamaghna Banerjee)                          
	The circumstances leading to teenager Sreejit Karmakars fatal fall off a moving train while returning from a school excursion on Friday night is every parents worst nightmare come true.        
	Class IX student Sreejits family filed an FIR on Sunday accusing El-Bethel School of not only shirking responsibility for the safety of the students but also trying to mislead them about the tragedy.         
	The boys father Jayanta Karmakar, a trader, had apparently called one of the tour operators on the train to speak to Sreejit around half-an-hour before he and classmate Shamik Debnath, both 15, fell off the crowded S4 coach of the Howrah-bound Bagh Express near Sonepur in Bihar.        
	Karmakars sister Sujata Halder said her brother had called one of the tour managers around 7.30pm to enquire how his son was doing, only to be told that it would not be possible for him to trace Sreejit on the crowded train as he was in another coach.        
	The school had provided two numbers (9007797794 and 9735144968) so that parents could contact their children during the excursion. The person who took my brothers call was rude to him. He said Sreejit couldnt be contacted and hung up. My nephew apparently died just half-an-hour later, she told Metro.        
	The timing of the incident was confirmed by the injured Shamik, who was escorted back to the city around 6.30pm on Sunday with his crushed right hand in a cast.        
	Sreejit and I had just come out of the toilet when we spotted a boy almost hanging from the door of our coach and called out to him to come inside. As we went near him, the boy thought we were trying to take his place near the door. He suddenly pushed Sreejit who lost his balance. I tried to pull him back and toppled over as well, he recalled.                    
	Shamik doesnt remember much of what happened after that except that he was numbed by pain and slipped in and out of consciousness. Some residents of the area  around 40km from Patna spotted the two boys at the crack of dawn and informed the railway police.        
	I gave the policemen my fathers number before they took me to a hospital (Patna Medical College), he said.         
	Shamiks father Preeti Ranjan Debnath, who works in the accountant-generals office, received a call from railway police around 7.30am on Saturday saying that his son was injured in a mishap.         
	Debnath immediately called principal Mitali Panda, accompanying the excursion team, and was told that his son and another boy had gone missing from the train.         
	But as vice-principal Gobinda Chandra Dey was to confirm later, principal Panda knew by then what had actually happened.        
	Shamiks parents, who took a flight to Patna in the evening, decided to bring the teenager back to Calcutta despite his injuries  bruises, broken tibia and crushed right hand  because they found the condition of Patna Medical College pathetic. Family sources quoted doctors as saying the fingers of his right hand could be amputated.        
	Sreejits father took a flight to Patna on Saturday evening to bring back his sons body, his sister said. Sreejits parents are separated.        
	The GRP officer who informed him of his sons death had told Karmakar that the body would be disposed of if he didnt claim it within an hour.        
	El-Bethel School, near Thakurpukur, has declared Monday a holiday in memory of Sreejit but its reputation has been scarred. My daughter wanted to join the excursion but I am glad I refused. I would rather take her on a vacation myself than trust the school authorities, said the mother of a Class VI student.

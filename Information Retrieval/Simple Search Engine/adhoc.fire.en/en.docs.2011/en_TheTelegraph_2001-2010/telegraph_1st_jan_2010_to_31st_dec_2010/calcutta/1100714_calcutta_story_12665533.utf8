The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Star hotels miss gun amp; bomb beep
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Star hotels miss gun amp; bomb beep
          KINSUK BASU                                            
	Explosives-laden cars and men with guns tucked under their belts slipped undetected through the security sieve at four out of five star hotels in town last month.        
	The security breach may not have been real but the safety test was, and the results were shocking enough to set alarm bells ringing at Lalbazar.        
	According to the report filed by the detective department, security was found to be generally slack at almost all the star hotels. A team of six armed officers in plainclothes split into two groups and visited these hotels in cars carrying bombs on June 9. Not only were the cars let in at all but one hotel, the officers roamed the floors of these addresses with guns and were not stopped even once, a source said.        
	In one of the hotels, an armed officer walked up to actor Mithun Chakraborty and sat close enough to be able to hold a gun to him. The police team later met the hotels security staff to narrate the incident. There were red faces all around when they heard what we had done, said a member of the team.         
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti wouldnt elaborate on the results of the mock test but did say that the star addresses needed to scale up security by several notches.         
	We intend meeting their representatives again to explain the importance of adhering to the norms for mandatory security checks. If the hotel authorities still appear reluctant or lax, we will be forced to initiate steps against them, he told Metro.         
	The police team that conducted the test spent considerable time waiting outside the star hotels watching how the private guards were frisking vehicles and visitors.         
	Our team spent 15-20 minutes in front of each location checking the security drill at the hotels. The shocking part was that except for one hotel, they didnt even have to try to bluff the guards, said an officer of the detective department.        
	Although each visitor was frisked, the police team noticed that the guards at all the hotels were doing their job in a mechanical manner. They would run the handheld metal detector but nobody bothered finding out if there was anything tucked under the belt at the back, the officer said.        
	The car checks were also done casually. You might think its an elaborate exercise but little effort was made to find out whether arms and ammunition were hidden anywhere other than the obvious places. The mirror checks to trace guns or explosives strapped to the undercarriage also appeared flawed. We found the guards in a hurry rather than eager to run a thorough scan, a policeman said.                    A guard at a city hotel checks a car during the security overdrive following the 26/11 terror attacks 
  in Mumbai     
	At two of the hotels, the doorframe metal detector spotted the man with the hidden gun but the guards didnt.                                 
	The guards did ask my colleague to stop when the machine beeped but let him go the moment he flashed a set of keys, the officer said.        
	Enquiries revealed that CCTV footage was also not monitored regularly at some hotels.        
	Representatives of star hotels, however, insisted they werent taking security lightly. Our staff, including F amp;B and ground-level personnel, have been trained to be watchful without being offensive. Apart from on-the-job training, we have invested a lot in our security system, an average of Rs 3 to 4 lakh on each unit of The Park group. Security equipment of international standards have been acquired, said a spokesperson for The Park, Calcutta.        
	A senior HHI official insisted that the AJC Bose Road hotel also had foolproof security without mentioning whether plainclothes cops had come calling last week.         
	Being a star hotel we already have strong security infrastructure in place like baggage scanners, CCTVs and metal detectors. We also have a strict car-checking regimen in the main porch area for all visitors to the hotel. We are, however, making our security department stronger by recruiting a few more supervisors and tightening the procedures, he said.        
	The Union home ministry had asked all states to beef up security in hotels following the terror attacks in Mumbai on November 26, 2008. The recommendations included individual risk assessments and greater use of technology to secure these establishments.        
	Lalbazar immediately issued a notification and set a two-week deadline for hotels in the city to install baggage scanners, doorframe metal detectors and CCTVs.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court crackdown on bankrupt brigade
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Around 1,500 people who had managed to declare themselves insolvent to evade repayment of bank loans cannot be treated as bankrupt and will have to cough up Rs 70 crore in dues, the high court ruled on Tuesday.        
	Justice Sanjib Banerjee held the present and former registrar of insolvency and official assignee guilty of helping the defaulters escape paying back their dues.        
	A departmental probe and criminal proceedings will be started against registrar Abhijit Chakraborty and his predecessor Tapan Kumar Chandra, as well as former official assignee Moloy Banerjee and his successor Nirmal Ghosh.        
	The assignees duty is to investigate claims of insolvency and send the genuine cases to the registrar for approval. Both have their offices on the high court premises.        
	Justice Banerjee took away the registrars right to declare an applicant bankrupt, ruling that for one year a high court judge will adjudicate all insolvency proceedings. If within such period the chief justice amends the rule, the same shall be done by a judge designated by the chief justice.        
	The judge also ordered criminal proceedings against the 1,500-odd defaulters who had been illegally declared insolvent since April 1, 2008.        
	Five private banks had in February moved the court, alleging that many people were illegally getting themselves declared insolvent to evade repayment of bank loans or credit card dues. Pramod Srivastav, who represented one of the petitioners, said a racket had been active to facilitate bankruptcy declarations.        
	Since April 1, 2008, more than 1,500 people have been declared insolvent by the office of the registrar of insolvency, Srivastav had told the court.        
	In response to the petitions, Justice Banerjee ordered the registrar of insolvency to produce all documents related to declaration of bankruptcy since 2007.        
	The judge then ordered a probe by the city police, which submitted that some lawyers had been publishing advertisements in newspapers assuring people of help in evading repayment of bank loans.        
	The judge also questioned some defaulters and found that they had made false statements before the registrar. A Salt Lake resident, for instance, had taken a loan of Rs 50 lakh from ABN AMRO and got himself declared insolvent. A probe revealed he was running a thriving business around the time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rally hits heart, chokes arteries
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rally hits heart, chokes arteries
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The mid-week afternoon traffic came to a halt in the heart of the city, with protesters cutting off the crossing of JL Nehru Road and SN Banerjee Road for over 15 minutes.        
	The busy intersection  Dorina Crossing in police parlance  got cut off while more than 8,000 supporters of the All India Democratic Students Organisation marched to Metro channel between 3.50pm and 4.05pm.        
	The ripple effect of disruption spread to Central Avenue, AJC Bose Road (near Entally) and Park Street.        
	Mahatma Gandhi Road and College Street were severely hit and so was Central Avenue, Ganesh Chandra Avenue and BB Ganguly Street, said a senior police officer. If the heart is hit, the arteries are bound to be affected.        
	From 5pm, half an hour after the meeting got over, it was the turn of the supporters of the CPM-backed Coordination Committee to gather on Rani Rashmoni Avenue. As preparations for another great show continued, vehicles gradually came to a halt on Mayo Road. The meeting finally started at 6pm. A delay by an hour, coupled with a brief spell of shower at the peak traffic hour, made it difficult for us to manage the traffic, the officer said.        
	Rahul Gandhis convoy left the airport at 5.50pm on its way to Raj Bhavan, via the Park Circus seven-point crossing and the AJC Bose Road flyover. We had to keep one flank of the roads free at least a few minutes before the convoy passed. Naturally, traffic was held up at several points, said another traffic officer.

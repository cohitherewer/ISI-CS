	The way history is taught in schools and colleges needs to change, not the names of streets (Wayward City, April 11). If we continue to teach about our past in mundane history classes then Elgin Road would matter as little as Lala Lajpat Rai Sarani. Knowing and understanding our past does not depend on the naming of streets, ghats or stations, but on the realisation that it is on the bedrock of our past that our present has been built.             
	The controversies regarding the naming of Metro stations, ghats and streets are a blatant manifestation of our superficial attitude towards our past.           
	Hundreds of places, especially residences of important people lie in ruins all over our city. Masterda Surya Sen, Gitanjali or Rabindra Ghat does not matter if we fail to understand the real significance of these people or the creations.

	Apropos the report Tipus ticket to Chandni Chowk (March 14), it is annoying to see railway minister Mamata Banerjees zeal at renaming Metro stations, causing confusion among passengers.             
	Perhaps the time has come for like-minded citizens to move the court so that the railway minister can be restrained from wasting public funds and inconveniencing Metro travellers.           
	A.S. Mehta,

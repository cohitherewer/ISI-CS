The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Young adults on the shelf
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Young adults on the shelf

	Once young adult meant 20-somethings ready to get on to life. The contemporary young adult seems someone with the gift of the gab, a sense of humour, the ability to laugh and sneer (at others and himself/herself) and preferably street smart, if also underage.         
	They are growing in number as authors and finding new customers for publishing. Young adult fiction is fairly new in India with a handful of publishers developing their list and purchasing rights to foreign publications.         
	Anshuman Mohan of St Xaviers Collegiate School, 15, has written his much-publicised book about school and life thereafter that goes by the name of Potato CHIPS. Pradipta Sarkar, a 25-year-old editor at Harper Collins which published Potato CHIPS, feels lack of choice spawned the trend: We thought that after Enid Blyton, Rudyard Kipling, Ruskin Bond, what does the young adult read? He then has to skip straight to adult fiction, she says.         
	HarperCollins has four books on the list of young adult popular fiction. It includes Mitali Perkinss Extreme American Makeover, which is about a Pakistani girl adopted by American parents, Dona Sarkars How to Salsa in a Sari, about a half-Indian and half-African girl whose mother is about to marry a Mexican, and Anjali Watsons Body Talk, a book on the body and relationships.         
	Puffin, the childrens imprint of Penguin, has Ranjit Lals Faces in the Water on female infanticide in the young adult fiction list. Among Puffins forthcoming titles is Arjun Vajpayees account of his climb to the Everest. Young adult fiction is a fairly new list and it addresses the teenagers and adult, says Sudeshna Ghosh of Puffin India.        
	Typically, books on the list are priced around Rs 190 and have a first print run of 5,000 copies.         
	Scholastic India has roped in Samit Basu and Meenakshi Madhavan Reddy, two young and established writers. Basus Morning Star Agency series has Terror on the Titanic as its first title that sold 3,000 copies last month. Reddys Confessions of a Listmaniac, a diary of a 17-year-old, is also on the stands.        
	Siddharth Sharmas The Grasshoppers Run, a novel set in the backdrop of WWII in Kohima, has been shortlisted for the recently started young adult fiction category of Vodafone Crossword Award.        
	But why is CHIPS written in capital letters?                     ANASUYA BASU

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Elders suffer postal shift
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Elders suffer postal shift
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                          Mayor Sovan Chatterjee at Lake Mall on Friday. (Sudeshna Banerjee)                                  
	From a prime position facing Rashbehari Avenue to a cubby hole without ventilation to a stall at the rear, next to a foul-smelling urinal with the entrance next to a garbage dump. Such would be the changes in address and fortune of the Lake Market sub-post office if the third and permanent shift is forced upon it.         
	The shift might be imminent with the post office authorities receiving a letter from the market supervisor urging them to shift or ship out in May and the new councillor dropping by on Monday to inquire what was holding them up.        
	The sub-post office, which since the inception had faced the main road, was shifted inside when work started to convert Lake Market into a multi-storeyed mall in May 2007. This is where it now operates from, partially blocked from view by stalls selling mattresses and incense sticks, and looking out to vegetables and foodgrains.        
	It operates as a savings bureau. There are more than 15,000 accounts here and 90 per cent of us are senior citizens. They cannot push us around like this to benefit commercial units. We were told that the shift within was for 11 months and the post office would be back in front as before. But the original space has been allotted to a shop, fumes Mina Bhattacharya, 60.        
	You should see the long queues to collect pension and MIS payments, says Anjan Bhattacharya, who sells savings certificates there. Next door is a pice hotel. We are scared to bring out cash during the crowded lunch hours. If they shift us, we will have to count the notes in the open, moans P.K. Pathak, 79.        
	The summer was tortuous, the lack of ventilation causing claustrophobia. But worse is on offer. Where will I catch my breath if there is no space, wonders Ranjit Laha, 90, with impaired vision.        
	Consumers have been running from pillar to post, petitioning the corporation, developer and the postal department against the shift, to no effect. If we are offered an unsuitable place, we will not accept it, says Gautam Bhattacharya, post master general, Calcutta.        
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee visited the mall on Friday but committed nothing to the postal consumers who raised the matter with him.        
	The rehabilitation of stalls was done in consultation with the market traders body. The post office might have lost out as it does not have similar lobbying power, said a senior civic official.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Three workshops sandwiched between houses and a congested slum and stacked with combustible materials like wood and kerosene were reduced to ashes in an early morning blaze in Maniktala on Monday.         
	Alert residents prevented the flames, which were first spotted around 4.30am, from spreading to nearby residential buildings and the slum in Munshi Para Lane.         
	Two of the workshops in Kalimuddin Lane, a stones throw from Maniktala police station, made carom boards and the third, steel utensils.         
	Nine fire engines, which could not enter the narrow lane where the workshops stood, took over an hour to control the flames.         
	On one side of the fire were the houses. On the other side, the slum with over 150 shanties made of plastic sheets and wood. Moreover, our fire engines could not even reach the workshops through the narrow lane. The vehicles had to be stationed 300 metres away from the source of fire, said a fireman.        
	A chain of pipes allowed firefighters to spray water on the flames.         
	The workshops, spread over 1,000sq ft, were stacked with wood planks and boards, kerosene and paint. The rooms had wooden ceilings. As a result, the place burnt down in no time.         
	Residents had started fighting the fire before the firemen. We fetched water from wherever we could think of. Had we not done so, the flames would have engulfed several buildings as well as the slum, said a resident.

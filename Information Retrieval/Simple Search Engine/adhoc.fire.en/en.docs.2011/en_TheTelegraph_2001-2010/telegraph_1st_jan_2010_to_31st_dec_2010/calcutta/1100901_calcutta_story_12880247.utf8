The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rat bites patients hand
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rat bites patients hand
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A rat nibbled at the hands of a 50-year-old cancer patient at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital early on Tuesday while her son spent the rest of the day dodging the mousetraps in the healthcare bureaucracy to lodge a complaint.        
	Abha Adhikary, who is supposedly under critical care, apparently woke up to a painful bite on her right ring finger and screamed for help. It was a rat, declared a nurse on duty in the ward, who had seen another patient being bitten by one the previous night.        
	The nurses cleaned Abhas hand with soap water and administered a tetanus vaccine. Around 11am, son Narendranath came to visit her and Abha narrated the horror story.        
	Narendranath immediately met the doctor on duty, Santanu Pal, to hand him a written complaint. Pal forwarded the letter to the assistant secretary, mentioning in a note how another patient in the ward had been bitten by a rat only the night before. Narendranath then went from one office to the other trying to find out who the assistant secretary was.        
	When he finally reached deputy superintendent Harekrishna Chandas office a few hours later, he was allegedly asked: Dont you have rats at home?        
	Chanda would not accept Narendranaths complaint, but the resident of Bankura stood his ground. So Chanda finally sent him to the assistant superintendent.        
	Assistant superintendent Kumar Kanti Mal kept Narendranath waiting till around 5pm before declaring that he and other officials were busy trying to end the junior doctors strike and had no time for useless things.        
	He then abused the ward boys and nurses for sending such complaints to him, alleged Narendranath, who owns an electrical goods store at Birashimul village in Bankura.        
	With Narendranath refusing to budge, Mal put a received stamp on his complaint around 5.30pm.        
	Deputy superintendent Chanda told Metro on Tuesday night that a rat bite is not that serious.        
	Asked if he knew about the presence of rats in the hospital, he said: Yes. Some of them are large. We have a rodent-control agency working for us.        
	So why was Narendranath made to wait six hours just to lodge a complaint? How can we establish how long he had to wait. In any case, we were busy with meetings, said Chanda.        
	Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, who has been busy going after the guards of a star hotel who dared stop him for frisking recently, said he would enquire about Narendranaths harassment at the hands of the hospitals administrators on Wednesday.

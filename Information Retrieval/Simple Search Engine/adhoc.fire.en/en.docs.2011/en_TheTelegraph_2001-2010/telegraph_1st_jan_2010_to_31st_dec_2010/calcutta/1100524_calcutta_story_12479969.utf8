                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Boy suffers kidnap trauma on return
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        Aman at home on Saturday before being taken ill. (Gopal Senapati)      Aman Gupta was weeping, biting his mother and tearing at his hair, and even failed to recognise his parents. He also suffered convulsions which he never had before. Doctors suspect the symptoms are caused by the mental trauma the three-year-old suffered in captivity      
	The Howrah boy who was freed by his abductors in Bihar on Friday night became aggressive after returning home and showed other abnormalities which doctors suspect are caused by the mental trauma the three-year-old suffered during the weeklong captivity.        
	Aman Gupta, now being treated at a Dobson Road nursing home in the district, was his usual jovial self after returning home to Bally on Saturday morning.        
	But there was an abrupt change in his behaviour around 5pm, said father Pappu Gupta, a trader at Burrabazar.         
	He started weeping and biting his mother. At times he was tearing at his hair. As hours passed, he failed to recognise us and started having convulsions.        
	Around 10.30pm, family members took him to Belur State General Hospital where doctors said the boy might be suffering from epilepsy and referred him to a hospital better equipped to handle the case.        
	He had never shown any sign of epilepsy, said Gupta, who then took Aman to the Dobson Road nursing home.        
	At the clinic, the boy went through a CT scan and several other tests. The CT scan report is normal but the results of the other tests are yet to come.        
	Nursing home director Bijoy Kejriwal, a paediatrician, said Amans abnormal behaviour was the manifestation of the mental trauma he had suffered in captivity.        
	There is no sign of external injury. But the trauma of being confined in an alien and hostile place, away from the parents, as well as the stress of being dragged from one hideout to another are taking their toll on the little boy, said Kejriwal, who has formed a three-member team comprising himself, a psychiatrist and a neurologist to treat the boy.        
	The doctor also suspects that the boy had been drugged by the abductors.        
	Nursing home sources said Aman was put on sedatives and his condition had stabilised a bit but he would be under observation for 48 hours.        
	He was drowsy for most part of the day but even in that state he was at times screaming maar doonga, said an official of the clinic.        
	Aman went missing after Rakesh Singh, once Pappus colleague at a Burrabazar shop and now settled in Bihar, took him out on May 14 evening for a walk.        
	Rakesh, who had returned to Bally 15 days before, later called the Guptas and demanded Rs 4 lakh. Sleuths had traced the call to Gaya in Bihar but thereafter the phone was switched off.        
	The same night Pappu left for Bihar where he was joined by a few cops from Howrah the next day. Rakesh kept in touch with Pappu through various numbers, but for almost a week the sleuths were in the dark about the boys whereabouts.        
	On May 21, Rakesh told Pappu that Aman would be freed and asked him to turn up in front of a temple in Baktiyarpur town in Patna district around 9pm. Accompanied by three plainclothesmen from Howrah and a few cops from Bihar, Pappu reached the spot and found Aman alone.        
	Family sources as well as the police said no money had changed hands to secure the boys release.         
	Rakesh is still at large.

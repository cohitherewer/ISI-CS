The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Election excuse for extended weekend
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Election excuse for extended weekend
          KINSUK BASU                          An empty office at Writers on Monday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Work on Sunday and relax on Monday was the mantra for the majority of those who were on municipal poll duty, reducing Writers Buildings to barely 60 per cent attendance on the first working day of the week.        
	Ardhendu Bhattacharya, a senior clerk in the backward classes welfare department, was among the few who did poll duty and yet turned up at Writers the day after. But while he worked, many colleagues who had Sunday off didnt bother coming in.        
	Sources said around 60 per cent of the 90-95 employees in one of the offices of the backward classes welfare department were deputed for election duty. Only four members of the staff attended office on Monday.         
	Most of those who reported for duty hardly worked, spending the day discussing the poll prospects of various parties, reading newspapers or dozing off.        
	This is how things are at Writers after any polling day. Those deputed on election duty get their officers to give in writing that he or she had to stay back past midnight for election work. This ensures a holiday the next day, said a senior official of the transport department.         
	Writers Buildings has 4,000-odd employees, but only 10-12 per cent of the total workforce was deployed for poll duty.        
	Sources said senior officers led the list of absentees and that Wednesday could be a repeat of Monday.        
	We are hoping June 2 will be a big day for us. We will celebrate with aabir (colours) and sweets, said Sanket Chakrabarty, the secretary of the Trinamul-affiliated Federation of Secretariat Employees (Unified).

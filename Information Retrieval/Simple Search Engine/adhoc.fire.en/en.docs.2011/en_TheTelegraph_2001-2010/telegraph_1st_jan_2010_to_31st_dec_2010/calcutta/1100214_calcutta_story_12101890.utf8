                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      In Venice amp; in Varanasi
										      BOOKBAZAR                        Geoff Dyer (right) with Amit Chaudhuri at the launch.   Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha				                                 
	This peripatetic Englishman is like the brilliant, bored kid in class who can never bring himself to follow the assignment. So said David Kipen from San Francisco Chronicle of Geoff Dyer, who despite not following assignments, manages to pen brilliantly funny, genre-defying novels, literary essays, historical writings, travel books, book on music          
	This time he has written a novel that has two parts, as the title itself tells  Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi. In town as part of British Councils Lit Sutra programme, Dyer was in conversation with author Amit Chaudhuri at Oxford Bookstore on January 30.         
	Chaudhuri introduced Dyer with his book is hysterically funny and moving with interesting insights of the place and self. Dyer agreed with Chaudhuri when he remarked, that the book not only echoes with allusions but has notes too. This has never happened after Wasteland.         
	Jeff in Venice began in 2003. I thought it would be a nice idea to do a Thomas Manns Death in Venice and explore a romance in the time of hedonism and wild partying, said Dyer. And then he went to Varanasi. I wanted the part in Venice to be complemented by a part in Varanasi to explore some of the Thomas Mann bit, he said.                       Janeja			     
	Maachh musings        
	The Indian social world, joked historian Tapan Ray Chaudhuri, is made up of binary opposites  Bengali and non-Bengali. But Manpreet Janeja, whose Transactions in Taste: The Collaborative Lives Of Everyday Bengali, was launched at Seagull Bookstore recently, was the best and the acceptable example of the other, he added.         
	Janeja grew up in a Punjabi household in Calcutta, where lunch was mostly maachh ar bhaat, and stopping by at the mishtir dokan was a part of daily life.         
	No wonder then that the Eugnie Strong Research Fellow at Cambridge University ended up writing about food and its aspects as a determining influence in Bengali life.         
	The book deals with Bengali food and its differences, not just between that of East and West Bengal but between Hindus and Muslims, the poor and middle classes and of food as a determinant of social stratification. This ethnographic work asks how and why food is pivotal to social relations and forms of identity. Everyday events figure in the book, such as a conversation between two Bengali housewives who discuss their cooks across their verandahs; one says: Or haath ta bhalo. Boshe gache. Kintu roj deri kore ashe. Or where a college student accuses another in the canteen: Bangali kintu maachher gondho shyojhyo hoye na? (Youre Bengali but cant tolerate fish?).         
	With Bengalis, the proof of the payesh is in not only in the eating, but also in talking about it.       MALINI BANERJEE

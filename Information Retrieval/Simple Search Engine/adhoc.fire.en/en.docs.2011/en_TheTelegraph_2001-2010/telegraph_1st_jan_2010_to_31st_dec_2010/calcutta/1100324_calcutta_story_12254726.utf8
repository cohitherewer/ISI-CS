                      An eternal alliance                    Relationships between men and women form the core of the paintings of Anand Gadapa and Nirmala Bulika. In Sync, the ongoing show of their recent works, they attempt to highlight various nuances of the timeless, yet highly complex, connection shared by the two sexes. Gadapas present series of watercolours embodies the peculiar affiliation between the male and female, with the pre-eminence of woman in a constructive sense. His woman-figures can often be associated with various deities, who are ancient representations of fantasies born out of fear, love and sensuous pleasure. In his works, the female character is depicted as a goddess or devi, who is trying to tame a beast, the male counterpart. The paintings of Bulika portray the enthralling journey of love, the contradictions in a relationship and the complex emotions involved in a marriage. What is interesting in her works is that, through their constant struggle to define their identities and through sharing the responsibilities of their relationship, her characters grow as individuals and complement their other half as well.                  Event: An exhibition of recent paintings by Anand Gadapa and Nirmala Bulika When: Till March 31; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C S. P.

                      Wondrous watercolours                    An immensely talented city-based artist, Debasish Senguptas forte lies in his creations in watercolour. Nevertheless, he works with ease and acumen on all mediums, be it acrylic, clay, mosaic tile, woodcut and so on. Usually, the artist prefers to experiment with the subject as well as the medium of his painting. The ongoing solo show of his vibrant watercolours, done on paper, showcases his latest style and idiom, using bright, short strokes and fantasy or fairy tale inspired themes. Most of the works are cheerful and imaginative, and use a kaleidoscopic range of colours and shades. They are inspired by human life, landscape and animal forms, although they never overlap in terms of size, technique or theme.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Day-long fire at warehouse
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Day-long fire at warehouse

	A Strand Road warehouse, packed with inflammable materials but lacking in fire-safety measures, was up in flames early on Sunday.        
	The three-storeyed, 45,000-sq ft Calcutta Port Trust warehouse  let out to several tenants  stands close to Nandaram Market that had burned for a record 100 hours in 2008.        
	Officials said around 90 per cent of the building was occupied by transport company Inland Courier Private Limited.        
	The blaze, spotted on the second floor around 2am, spread across the building stacked with butter, dalda, ghee, synthetic textiles and rubber pipes even before the first tender could arrive.        
	Firemen were struggling to douse the fire even almost 16 hours after it started. The floors, made of wooden planks supported by iron beams, collapsed as the fire spread. We have to cool down the debris by spraying water before our men could move in to douse the flames, said Gopal Bhattacharjee, the director of the fire and emergency services.        
	Fire safety measures were not in place in the warehouse, said Bhattacharjee. Fire officers also questioned the presence of LPG cylinders in a canteen in the warehouse.        
	We may lodge a complaint against the owners and occupiers, said Bhattacharjee.

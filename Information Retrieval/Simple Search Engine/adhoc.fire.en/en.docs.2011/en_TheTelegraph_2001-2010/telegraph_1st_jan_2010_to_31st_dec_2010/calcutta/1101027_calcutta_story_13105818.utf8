	Enthusiastic Class V students of South Point High School got a chance to showcase their creativity in a mask-making contest organised by TTIS (The Telegraph in Schools), in association with Vodafone, on their school campus on October 12.         
	The contest was also held in 29 other schools from September 20 to October 12.        
	Armed with coloured papers, sequins and other decorative items, the children came out with interesting depictions of Devi Durga And Her Family on their masks.         
	Goddess Durga was the most popular choice, followed by the asura and the lion.                 Children of Little Learners, a Montessori house in Alipore, perform during their annual show at GD Birla Sabhagar   on October 2. Picture by Aranya Sen                Students at the AIESEC event      
	While some stressed on Durgas facial features, others were more interested in depicting the Goddesss glittering ornaments with the help of shiny paper, big bangles and elaborate borders.         
	Be it the Goddesss thick tresses or the lions fluffy mane, the students did not leave out a single detail.         
	We will be looking for creativity and the use of colours. They make a mask attractive, said Souvik Dey, the schools art teacher for classes IV and V and a judge of the event.         
	Three other art teachers of the school also joined in to select the three winners.        
	Arpit Bhattacharya came first with his depiction of Asura.         
	I wanted to do something different. So I preferred to portray the Asura, he said.         
	Sarbari Choudhury came second with his creation of a lion mask, while Shuvam Aich was adjudged third for his innovative portrayal of the owl.         
	The winners received certificates and goodies.        
	CHIT CHAT          
	Hundreds of students and business houses attended the Conclave Youth to Business Forum, 2010, organised by the Calcutta wing of an youth-run organisation, AIESEC, at the Golden Park recently.         
	The high point of the event was a panel discussion involving various industry leaders. Its topic was Indias youth-leadership and empowerment.         
	The panelists included Piyush Jaju, the co-founder of Onergy  a social enterprise that aims at providing energy solutions to rural India, Renu Khatter, the owner of Kaytex Issues, architect Sobhanlal Banerjee, and Raunaq Singh Minhas, the student speaker of the day.         
	Raunaq stressed on the qualities a youth leader should have. The panel discussion also saw interaction from the audience.

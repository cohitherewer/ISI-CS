										      eyewitness                        A photograph by Veer Munshi				                           
	Burning Kashmir invariably makes headlines. But the plight of the Pandits, who have been driven away from their hearth and home and are refugees in their own homeland, often goes unheard.         
	Veer Munshis exhibition, Shrapnel, The Chamber + Pandit Houses, now on at Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, focuses on the ancient heritage buildings, which the Pandits have been forced to abandon. It includes a series of digital photographs of the houses, a video documenting the artists gruelling journey through his homeland, and a huge chamber, whose walls he has painted.        
	Munshi, a Pandit himself who practises in Delhi, has photographed these desolate buildings, some centuries old, still boasting beautifully-crafted woodwork and jharokha-like balconies done by Turkish carpenters. People of Calcutta will be familiar with such scenes of destruction and desolation, for in this city itself a wealth of old buildings is being systematically erased, albeit for different reasons.        
	Munshis video shows him alighting from a shikara, trudging through a scene of arson, crunching chinar leaves underfoot, and finally, through a snow-covered countryside, to be swallowed by the snow itself. Next to it is a static picture of a house on fire using animation. Munshi does not show a single human being in these works and this intensifies the silence of these scenes.        
	In his Chamber, on the other hand, there is a lot of action. He depicts instruments of torture and arms used by both terrorists and the armed forces, and men being tortured. But this is nothing after Abu Ghraib.       SOUMITRA DAS

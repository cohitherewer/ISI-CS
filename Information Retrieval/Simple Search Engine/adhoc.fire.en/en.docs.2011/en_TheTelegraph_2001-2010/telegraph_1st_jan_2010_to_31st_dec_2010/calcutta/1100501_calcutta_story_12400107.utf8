                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Safety tips for malls, markets
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police have issued security guidelines to the managements of malls and markets in the city in an attempt to thwart terror attacks.        
	The police brass wants the managements to install baggage scanners and door-frame metal detectors, intensify vigil in the parking lots and ensure that the CCTV footage is monitored and stored.        
	The police directive follows an alert from central intelligence agencies that terror outfit Indian Mujahideen is plotting to strike places of major public gathering.        
	The guidelines were handed over to the managements of the malls and markets at separate meetings called by special police commissioner R.K. Pachnanda.        
	Its difficult to ensure that the mall operators maintain a high level of alertness throughout the year. So, the operators were asked to abide by the basics, which include installation of a three-tier security system at the entry, said a senior officer.        
	The mall operators  more than 18 of them had turned up at the meeting  were asked to instruct their guards to use both under-carriage mirrors and hand scanners to check cars and alert the authorities about unattended cars.        
	The mall and market operators have also been asked to ensure CCTVs are in working condition, said an officer.        
	The market representatives who attended the meeting demanded support from local police stations, saying it was impossible to remain vigilant without back-up.        
	While senior officers were devising ways to step up security at the probable targets of terror groups, the Special Task Force is trying to spot the local contacts of Indian Mujahideen.        
	Clubs, too, have stepped up security. Prodipto Banerjea, the president of Calcutta Club, said: We are keeping an eye on unclaimed objects and trying to ensure that strangers do not walk in. Deepankar Nandi, the chief executive of CC amp;FC, said: We have all the measures in place. We have a metal detector but it is now under repair. Itll be installed as soon as it is back.

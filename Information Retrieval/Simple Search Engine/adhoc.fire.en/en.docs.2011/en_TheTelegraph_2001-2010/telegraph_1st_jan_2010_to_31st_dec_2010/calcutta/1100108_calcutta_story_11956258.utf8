The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wetland plot to be returned
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wetland plot to be returned
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday directed four traders, who claimed to have purchased a part of the East Calcutta Wetlands from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), to hand the plots back to the civic body by February 15.         
	Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay passed the order after the Wetland Management Authority claimed the plots in Boinchtala mouza, measuring over one bigha, that petitioner N.A. Siddiqui and others had purchased two years ago were water bodies owned by the civic body.        
	The four moved the high court after the civic body and the Wetland Management Authority had conducted raids on July 29 last year to demolish constructions in the area.        
	Challenging the legality of the raids, the petitioners claimed they were the owners of the plots and wanted to put up factory sheds there. The lawyer representing them submitted the sale deeds of the plots to the court.        
	The court should pass an order restraining the authorities concerned from conducting further raids in the area, the lawyer said.        
	Appearing for the civic authorities, Aloke Ghosh told the judge that a racket was using forged documents to sell portions of the wetland. Ghosh said: Even if we find that the purchasers are the owners of the land, how can they erect structures on the wetland?         
	When asked to comment on the case, a senior officer of the state land and land revenue department said such a racket was active in the area and an inquiry was being conducted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gold rush adds sparkle to 1417
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Gold rush adds sparkle to 1417

	Bowbazaar wore a festive look on Poila Baisakh, not just because of the crowds thronging its jewellery stores for complementary sweets and cola but also because of a fair bit of serious shopping.         
	Business was good, an increase of about 10 per cent in terms of volume from last Poila Baisakh. We had thought that the people were here for the sweets and calendar that we offer our customers on Bengali New Years day, but most turned out to be serious shoppers, said Bablu De of Guinea Emporium on BB Ganguly Street.         
	Jewellery stores lining both sides of the road were decked in flowers and fairy lights to usher in Bengali New Year 1417. Enthusiastic shoppers didnt even mind standing in long queues to get into their favourite stores. At R. Choudhury and Sons, the queue snaked out of the shop and wound its way right into an adjacent lane.         
	Business was good elsewhere in town too. The footfall was high on Thursday and most of them came with the intention of buying. Poila Baisakh is an auspicious day, more so this year since it was on a Thursday, the day of Goddess Lakshmi. People are buying everything  silver, gold and even diamond jewellery, said Anargha Chowdhury of Anjali Jewellers.         
	De, who is also the working president of the Swarna Shilpa Bachao Committee, said jewellers were a worried lot over the past few days as according to the Bengali calendar, this month was a Mala Mash.         
	A Mala Mash is considered inauspicious. Bengalis do not hold weddings or any other function in this period. But the shoppers have proved our fears baseless, beamed De, adding that Thursday was the first day of big business in 2010.        
	The price of gold  Rs 16,750 per 10g  proved hardly a deterrent for the determined shopper.         
	I have been buying jewellery on Poila Baisakh for the last two years. Its an auspicious occasion and shopping for gold is a great way to celebrate the first day of the year. On such a festive day, I do not mind the price of gold, smiled homemaker Rekha Samanta, busy checking out chunky gold bangles in traditional designs at a Bowbazaar showroom.         
	But the buy-buy spree was not restricted to Bengalis. We usually buy something on Poila Baisakh. The jewellers invite us to their stores and so we buy something, said Uma Jaiswal, another shopper.         
	For others, it was, of course, the discounts. Theres a wedding coming up in the family and we are out shopping for the occasion. Poila Baisakh is a good day to buy jewellery because the jewellers offer discounts, said Sabiha, who is visiting her family in the city.         
	Sentiments or common sense, the gold rush on the first day of 1417 has left a big smile on the faces of buyers and jewellers alike.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      More rain on radar
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The forecast for thundershowers flattered to deceive with only traces of rain on Tuesday. The conditions, however, will remain conducive for another spell of rain for at least 24 hours.        
	The minimum temperature, which had remained three to four degrees above normal for most of the past fortnight, dropped three degrees below normal to 22.5 degrees Celsius because of Mondays thundershower.        
	The minimum temperature dropped 6.5 degrees in a day. Such is the relief thunderstorms can bring during this time of the year. The effect of Mondays rain would be felt till Wednesday afternoon, said O.P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of a private agency.        
	Meteorologists said the mercury could dip further if there was rain in the next two to three days.Wednesday, said the weatherman, is likely to be partly cloudy, with rain in the afternoon or evening.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | London gets a taste of mishti doi magic
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      London gets a taste of mishti doi magic
          PRATIM D. GUPTA IN LONDON                                  (From Top) Sharmila Tagore, Soumitra Chatterjee and Soha Ali Khan; Usha Uthup and P.C. Sorcar at London Ananda Utsav. Pictures by Aranya Sen                          
	P.C. Sorcar wanted to make the Big Ben disappear. That did not happen but he ended up doing something even more bizarre over the weekend  he made Bengalis by the thousands disappear, from various parts of London.        
	Thanks to his abracadabra, more than 4,000 of them surfaced at the grand Alexandra Palace in north-east London on both Saturday and Sunday. They were all drawn by the promise of some true-blue Bangaliana.        
	At Anandabazar Patrika presents PC Chandra Jewellers London Ananda Utsav, the first of its kind all-Bengali cultural extravaganza on British turf, the 500-odd people who braved the windy chill to attend Day One swelled five times on Saturday and even more on the final day.        
	From Dona Gangulys fusion dance recital to Usha Uthups knockout medley of songs, from Soumitra Chatterjees powerhouse play to Sharmila Tagores enchanting narration, the Bengali in London got a taste of the Calcutta they miss. To put it in Sorcars words: Jekhanei Bangali shekhanei Calcutta!        
	Accompanying Sharmila was daughter Soha Ali Khan who might only be a half-Bengali but put a finger on the pulse just right.         
	An event like this really shakes up your roots and makes you feel at home, said the Bollywood actress who narrated the English portions of Robi O Radha, an adaptation of Rabindranath Tagores Bhanushingher Padabali. I am so proud to be here with my mother and to be part of such a celebration, she smiled.        
	The celebrations were not limited to the stage at the Great Hall of the Alexandra Palace. There were food counters serving quintessential Bangla lunch and dinner, replete with mishti doi and rosogolla. And there were stalls selling everything from diamonds and saris to designer apartments back in Calcutta.        
	People nowadays fly frequently between London and India and that explains why the sales havent been very high but there is still a lot of interest, said Priyanka Raja at the Kanishka sari stall.        
	The Bengali cultural juggernaut has in earlier years travelled to the US and Canada but London Ananda Utsav marked the very first European expedition. For a maiden event, the response has been extraordinary, said Mir, the host for all three days and someone who has been to other international Banga Sammelans. In America, the Bengalis who came to attend were mostly first generation or second generation. In London, there is a nice mix of old and new.        
	And quite a few foreign faces too. I dont understand Bengali but I can feel the warmth and the passion in their activities so I brought my kid to watch the programmes, said Marcos, a Londoner from Romania.        
	And no, P.C. Sorcar had not orchestrated that one. That all of us Bengalis got together and organised an event like this gives me the greatest pleasure, said the man with the magic wand.

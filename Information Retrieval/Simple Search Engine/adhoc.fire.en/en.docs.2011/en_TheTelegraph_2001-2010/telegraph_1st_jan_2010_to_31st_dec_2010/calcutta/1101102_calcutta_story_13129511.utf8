                      A flowery affair                    Nature has always inspired artists. The cave drawings of the early man or the sunflowers of Van Gogh. The ragas of the early morning or the dance of the peacock. Artists through the ages have found their muse in nature. Nature inspires art, and so it is with Kavita Poddar, an artist who works close to nature. The pure white rose, the exotic orchid, the dancing lily, the tall tulip and the happy petunia have all inspired her to create art. Her unique floral designs range from flower sculptures to theme and mood arrangements. Flora Fiesta offers a breathtaking survey of an annual floral extravaganza. On display will be floral installation and artworks by Poddar that promise to delight visitors with a colourful and fragrant experience.

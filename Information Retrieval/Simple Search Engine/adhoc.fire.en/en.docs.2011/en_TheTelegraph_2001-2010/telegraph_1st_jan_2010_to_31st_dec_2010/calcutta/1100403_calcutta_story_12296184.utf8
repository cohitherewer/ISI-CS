The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll hurdle for college exams
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Poll hurdle for college exams
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The announcement of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation elections on May 30 has come as bad news for over 1.75 lakh examinees due to appear in the Calcutta University (CU) undergraduate examinations this year.        
	The university authorities fear that the examination centres will be taken over by the election commission for nearly a week in end-May, disrupting academic schedules.         
	The BA, BSc and BCom (honours and general) Part I and Part II examinations are likely to start in mid-May and continue till June-end.        
	The premises of colleges where elections would be held have to be handed over to the election commission at least a couple of days before May 30. Election officials would take two or three days to move out of the premises after the elections. The examination process will have to be suspended during this period, said an official of the CU examination department.         
	The CU authorities will meet college heads next week to draw up an examination schedule in such a way that the election causes the minimum disruption. The university had submitted a tentative exam schedule to the election commission at the beginning of the year.         
	We will get in touch with the election commission again to find out for how long will the college premises be used for the elections, said CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.        
	The final examination schedule will be readied once the commission says for how long it wants to use the college premises.         
	According to university officials, if the exam process is suspended for a week, publication of results for undergraduate exams will get delayed. This, in turn, will delay the admission of students to postgraduate courses.        
	The Supreme Court had directed all universities to complete the process of admitting students to postgraduate courses within August.        
	We will have to adjust our exam dates to accommodate the election. We are taking all possible measures to ensure that students do not suffer and we can abide by the deadline set by the court, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the CU pro vice-chancellor.        
	College principals apprehend a delay in admission of students to first-year BA, BSc and BCom courses because of the municipal polls.        
	The results of the Class XII board exams will be declared in the last week of May and the admission process is supposed to start in the first week of June.

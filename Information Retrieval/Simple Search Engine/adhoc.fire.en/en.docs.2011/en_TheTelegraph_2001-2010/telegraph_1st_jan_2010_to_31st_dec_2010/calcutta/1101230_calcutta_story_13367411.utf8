                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Call centre girl hangs herself 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A cancer patients 20-year-old daughter who had skipped college and taken up a call centre job to supplement her familys income, committed suicide in her Kasba home on Tuesday night.         
	The reason why Sitama Sengupta hanged herself is not clear but police suspect problems in her personal life pushed her over the edge.        
	Preliminary investigation suggests there was no foul play. After speaking to her family members, it seems personal problems were weighing her down. We will talk to them again to get to the root of the matter, said a senior officer of Kasba police station.        
	Sitama had dinner with her parents and younger sister on Tuesday night before retiring to her room.        
	She was looking depressed, so her father had asked her to cheer up and watch television. He later went into her room to check on her and found her hanging from the ceiling, said an officer of Kasba police station.         
	Cops reached the house by the time Sitama was brought down. She was rushed to Ruby General Hospital.        
	The police claimed she might have survived had she been admitted immediately. The hospital authorities refused to admit her because there was no vacant bed. She was then taken to Desun Hospital, where she was declared brought dead, said an officer.         
	An official of Ruby Hospital said a doctor had declared Sitama clinically dead after she was wheeled into the emergency department. Even after doctors said nothing could be done to revive the girl, those with her chose to take her to another hospital. The body was later taken to MR Bangur Hospital for post-mortem.        
	The girl, who completed schooling at Patha Bhavan, joined the call centre instead of a college to support her family, said her relatives.         
	My husband is a cancer patient. That is why she had started working early. She was an ideal child, said her mother, now the sole breadwinner.         
	Sitama was pursuing English honours through distance education. She was in the first year and had taken study leave from January 1 to January 16 for her exams due on January 16, said a relative.

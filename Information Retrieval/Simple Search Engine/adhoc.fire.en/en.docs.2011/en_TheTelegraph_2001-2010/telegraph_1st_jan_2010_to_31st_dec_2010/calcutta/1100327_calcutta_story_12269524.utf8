The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fatal flaws in firefight laid bare by blaze
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fatal flaws in firefight laid bare by blaze
                              June   Gitanjali                           
	Actress June writes about the travails of her friends in Stephen Court              
	I am devastated by the Stephen Court fire. So many people died for no fault of theirs. I have friends who live in Stephen Court and all of them are homeless now.        
	One of my friends lives on the fifth floor, while the rest stay in the Flurys-side of the building. They were lucky that their homes were not destroyed. Today (Friday) they were allowed inside the building for 20 minutes; they picked up some documents and came out. Its been traumatic for them and for all of us too.         
	The saddest part is that there was no dignity in this death and there is no dignity ever after death. Families are fighting over bodies. I can only imagine the trauma they are going through.        
	I have been inside Stephen Court and its such a beautiful building with huge apartments. I have always seen these loops of loose wires dangling dangerously as the meter boxes went on piling up over the years, with more and more commercial set-ups coming up.        
	Its the same in Queens Mansion. I would often ask my friends why they didnt do anything about these wires, and they would tell me that they couldnt as it concerned several people and it had to be a collective effort. Its a scary situation because the city is full of old houses like Stephen Court.         
	So many people would not have died had the fire department been proactive. My friends told me there was no one to take their calls when they dialled the Free School Street fire brigade office. Its shocking that a proper fire-fighting system is not in place even after so many buildings were gutted in fires in recent times.        
	Its unbelievable that the firemen were sent to Stephen Court in gumboots and without gas masks. The administration practically sent its men to die! They dont have ladders, nets or tarpaulin sheets. Arent these some of the basic things that both the fire department and the police should have ready at all times?        
	Its even more upsetting when the fire minister (Pratim Chatterjee) says he has learnt lessons from this incident. Are we guinea pigs? Its time for us, the citizens, to speak up.              Gitanjali Jolly       
	Gitanjali Jolly, a resident of Flat 5F in Block III of Stephen Court, relives the fire and its aftermath   
	I was fast asleep when the fire broke out and was woken up by my cleaning lady banging on the door to warn me.        
	The sight that greeted me outside was traumatic. Black smoke was billowing out of a flat in Block II and young people were leaping to death in front of our eyes.        
	My 83-year-old mother, my husband and I made our way out of our fifth floor flat in Block III and went up to the terrace, and came down through Block IV. By then, there was thick smoke on the terrace as well and it was difficult to breathe. We were in a daze.        
	I keep thinking that so many people would not have died if the fire brigade had done its duty and the owners of the building, theirs.        
	One flat had caught fire. If the firemen had come on time then this disaster could have been avoided. They came an hour late. Three people had leapt to death by then.        
	And when they did come, they tried to fight a fire of this magnitude wearing rubber gumboots and with hankies covering their faces. Why is the fire services department this ill-equipped? The water they sprayed did not reach the flames. Neither did the ladders. They did not have nets or other safety measures in place so that people could be saved. A vital equipment was kept in Behala. They shouldnt blame residents for what happened.        
	I dont want to play a blame game. The Bagarias, from whom we took our flat on a 99-year lease, should have taken care of the old and exposed wiring. The residents also should have contributed. It should have been a two-way thing but no one came forward when we asked for help.        
	The whole building was a tinderbox with a maze of wires, most of them very old. There was zero maintenance. There was no one we could go to for maintenance  no managing committee, no association. We pooled in the money for maintenance of the lifts.        
	So many people died because the door to the terrace of Block II was locked which shouldnt have been the case. None of the other terrace doors was locked and that is the only way one can go from one block to another.        
	They kept that door locked so that children couldnt go up to the terrace and damage the mobile towers that were put up there. Residents protested against the towers being put up but no one would listen to us. We want to know who collected revenue from those towers.         
	Stephen Court was a residential building. Why was it let out for commercial purposes? If they wanted to, there should have been a proper guideline in place.        
	People are now saying the building is illegal. But we got our flat from Bagaria after it was regularised. How can there be no legal sanction when we have all the documents and have been paying our taxes?         
	The fact of the matter is that the firefighting equipment was not adequate.        
	We are not rich people. I bought that place with my earnings and my husbands earnings. It was my home. For the past three days we have been staying with friends. Now we dont have a roof over our heads.        
	Today (Friday) I went to my flat after three days. We were allowed in for half an hour. Our flat is okay but the one next door has been burnt. We have been very lucky.        
	I dont want to blame police. They have been really helpful. There were misunderstandings because we were scared and traumatised. But they were there protecting our interests.        
	The fire services department should be made answerable for so many people dying.                                AS TOLD TO CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

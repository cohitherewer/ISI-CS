The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blackouts rob city of heat relief 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Blackouts rob city of heat relief 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Rain eluded the city yet again on Wednesday but temperatures stayed near the normal mark  a lingering effect of Mondays thunderstorm, according to the weatherman. But whatever relief the weather god provided, the power utilities snatched away.         
	During peak demand, CESC-served areas faced a deficit of 290MW while areas served by the state grid suffered a shortfall of 600MW, resulting in power cuts adding up to two hours in the city and three hours in the districts.        
	The sky turned cloudy late on Wednesday afternoon and a strong breeze blew till evening. Mondays thunderstorm was enough to improve the weather for two days in and around Calcutta, said an official of the India Meteorological Department in Delhi.        
	An upper air cyclonic circulation over Gangetic Bengal has kept alive hopes of more rain. The conditions are favourable for rain or thundershowers in the city and its neighbourhood on Thursday, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Alipore Met office.        
	The maximum temperature stayed a degree below normal at 35.1 degrees Celsius on Wednesday while the minimum dipped two degrees below normal to 28 degrees Celsius. Thursday, said the weatherman, was likely to be partly cloudy, with rain or thundershowers in some areas towards the afternoon or evening.         
	On Wednesday, CESC sent out 1,106MW and imported 214MW, but fell far short of the total demand of 1,610MW in the evening. The loadshedding was on account of power deficit in the grid, said a CESC spokesperson.        
	North and central Calcutta, along with Salt Lake, bore the brunt of the blackouts in the evening. Power went off in phases from 5.30pm. By 8pm, we had suffered darkness for over two hours, complained Sulagna Ghosh, a homemaker in Salt Lakes BE Block.        
	The state utility blamed the deficit on lower generation by the state-run power generation company.

          OUR BUREAU                          The spot at Diamond Harbour where the five took a dip. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                  
	Three college students were detained on Thursday after two of their friends went missing while the five were taking a dip in the Hooghly at Diamond Harbour on Wednesday afternoon.        
	Krishnendu Ghosh and Pritam Naskar, first-year BCom students of Shyamaprasad College and classmates since school, could not be traced till late on Thursday. Both did not know how to swim.        
	The five, between 18 and 19 years old, reached Diamond Harbour on Wednesday morning. Krishnendu had told his parents he was going to attend a friends Id invitation. Pritam had said he was going with friends to a theme park near Rajarhat.        
	The other three  Subhadeep Sarkar, a classmate of Krishnendu and Pritam, and Ankit Sen Chowdhury and Kunal Chakraborty  returned home on Wednesday evening. They were detained on Thursday.        
	Ankit and Kunal are first-year students of a private B-school. Pritam is from Chetla and the rest from Behala and Thakurpukur.        
	Pritam, Subhadeep and Ankit had come to our place on Wednesday morning and had said that they were going to a friends place for Id. However, when my son did not return by the evening we started calling him but his cellphone was switched off, said Krishnendus father Kalpanath, a trader. The family members of Krishnendu and Pritam were not familiar with Ankit and Kunal.        
	The boys were intoxicated when they entered the water on Wednesday, according to police. Subhadeep told investigators that he had tried to save one of his friends but was unable to hold on to his hair.         
	Why didnt they call us or the police after the mishap and return to Calcutta? The three had appointed a lawyer by the time we tracked them down. We dont know whether Krishnendu drowned or was killed, said Krishnendus brother-in-law Arijit Kar.        
	Relatives of Krishnendu and Pritam lodged complaints with us. We have detained three boys for questioning, said additional superintendent (rural), South 24-Parganas, Ranendranath Banerjee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tinderbox mart in city centre

          A STAFF REPORTER                          The fire at Chandni Chowk market on Tuesday night. Picture by Soumen Bhattacharjee                                  
	Eighteen fire tenders battled the blaze at Chandni Chowk market through the night on Tuesday and much of Wednesday but in the evening the shops were still smouldering. Almost 45 shops near gate No. 5 of the market were charred.        
	Fire services officers said the flames, which rose to 40ft, could have claimed many lives had the fire broken out during the day, when around 15,000 people visit the market.        
	Firemen pointed out that Chandi market had flouted almost all fire safety norms.         
	The shops were stacked with inflammable materials like plywood, mattresses and cotton. Also, there was no space between shops, which helped the flames spread from one unit to another. We have lodged a police complaint against the shop owners and tenants, said Tapan Ghosh, the divisional officer of the fire department.        
	Narrow alleys inside the market and the absence of ventilation added to the problem. Three fire-fighters fell ill and had to be hospitalised because of the dense smoke in the alleys, said an official.         
	All markets must have their own reservoir from where water can be drawn to douse a fire. But here they have neither a water reservoir nor sprinklers, said fire services director Gopal Bhattacharjee.        
	Tuesdays fire was just another in the long list of blazes in the market. In 1995, a fire had wiped out almost the entire northern wing of the market, known for cheap hardware. Since then, many smaller fires have broken out in various sections of the market.        
	On Wednesday, Metro found electrical wires hanging loose over narrow, winding alleys, the eight entry points of the market encroached by shopowners and the absence of a centralised fire-fighting mechanism.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Anger singes political class
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Anger singes political class
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                              
	Politicians scurrying to show solidarity with the Park Street fire tragedy victims are landing in a cauldron of anger representing the feelings of a fast-growing apolitical class that demands accountability rather than a mere apology.        
	Why have you come? In trying to prove that you are with us, you are adding to the confusion, screamed Ratna Nath, whose younger sister Nita died in the fire, charging at Trinamul Congress leader Partha Chatterjee at SSKM Hospital on Thursday.        
	Trinamul Youth Congress president Madan Mitra, who has been the self-appointed man in charge at SSKM since charred bodies started coming in, was pushed and shoved when he tried to shield Chatterjee. Its such a shame that you are trying to derive mileage out of a human tragedy, berated an unidentified person trying to calm down Ratna, in her thirties.        
	A chastened Chatterjee told Metro later that he was only trying to stand with the people in their hour of need.         
	In trying to do that on Tuesday afternoon outside Stephen Court, even his boss had been booed. We need helping hands here, not a hunger strike, taunted one resident busy with the rescue operation on spotting Mamata Banerjee during her uncharacteristically brief and low-profile visit.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee too was smart enough to restrict his visit to the fire scene on Wednesday to a blink-and-you-miss six minutes.        
	Even after the blaze was brought under control, residents and owners of Stephen Court seethed over politicians of all hues entering and exiting their building while they remained cut off from their houses and shops. A group of residents even staged a demonstration before the police on Thursday morning.        
	If it is so unsafe, why are you letting them in? They are here only for political mileage, not to help us, said Vinita Chawla, whose flat is on the second floor.         
	A youth who had lost a friend to the fire was more vehement. This disaster tourism by politicians must stop. They are like vultures trying to feed off our misery, he cried.        
	In the line of fire were the likes of Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, a member mayor-in-council in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. His standard line is, Please be patient. I am here for you. You are not being allowed in because it is dangerous to go inside. But why are the rules different for him? He is here only for the cameras, said an elderly resident.        
	Picnic Garden resident Shane Bell, who had rappelled down a water pipe from the fourth floor during Tuesdays blaze, said he had approached Khan several times to take him to his office to retrieve a bag containing very important documents but to no avail. He is too busy giving interviews to television channels, said Bell.        
	So are the politicians listening? When asked whether there was a growing anti-politician sentiment in the city, senior politicians of various hues refused comment.        
	A policeman struggling to cope with political traffic outside Stephen Court was less reticent. They are an incorrigible lot. The moment there is an opportunity to be seen and heard, they wont miss it for anything. There is this group of people who are even serving water to us under the banner of a political party, said the police officer, pointing to a sign opposite Stephen Court.        
	Cops deployed at the site admitted that political delegations were making their job more difficult. The chief minister apart, the list of political visitors to Stephen Court since Tuesday includes Mamata Banerjee, fire minister Pratim Chatterjee, civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee, tourism minister Manab Mukherjee, Congress Legislature Party leader Manas Bhuniya and state BJP chief Rahul Sinha.        
	The anger and sarcasm over the political firefighting was also reflected in the views of the Twitterati. What is Mamata Banerjee doing at the site of the Fire? Is she a trained firefighter? Very Opportunistic, went a tweet.        
	The city had earlier seen a surge in anti-politician sentiments during the spontaneous candlelight vigil in support of the justice for Rizwanur Rahman campaign, also on Park Street. That was a unique peoples movement mirroring the growing resentment against the lack of accountability in the political system, said Pradip Datta, a professor of political science in Delhi University, who had researched the Rizwanur movement.

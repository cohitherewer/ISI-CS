                      Science and imagination                    Darwins curiosity was boundless. He thought on any material that he could lay his hands upon: pigeons and infants, fossils and climbing plants, novels and Euclid. He asked himself radical questions that provoked, and still continue to provoke, questions large and small for others. He asked different kinds of questions and his eye was always open for anomaly. He valued deviance; contradiction engaged him rather than annoying him. To Darwin, nothing was trivial, since his entire theory depended on transmission of slight variations which, over time, produce huge consequences. Yet he was always seeking general laws. The tension between observing minute differences and uncovering general laws was central to his thinking. So his theories have generated many contradictory stories: of ascent and descent, profusion and loss, politics and anarchy. Darwins Curiosity, this evenings lecture by Dame Gillian Beer (King Edward VII Professor Emeritus at the University of Cambridge; picture here), will explore all that is particular about his imagination and some of its consequences. Hosted by British Council.

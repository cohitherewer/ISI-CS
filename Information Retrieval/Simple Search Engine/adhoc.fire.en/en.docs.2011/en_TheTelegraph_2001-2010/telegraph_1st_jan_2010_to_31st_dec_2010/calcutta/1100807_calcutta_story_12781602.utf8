The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | MLA guard held with illegal gun
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      MLA guard held with illegal gun
          OUR BUREAU                              
	A bodyguard accompanying a CPM legislator from Maoist-hit Purulia was arrested at a high court gate on Friday after an illegal country-made pistol was found on him.         
	A scanner beeped as Buddheshwar Murmu, an accused in the murder of a Jharkhand Mukti Morcha activist in Balarampur three days ago, put his cloth bag in it. Police opened it and found a single-shot pistol and six bullets.        
	MLA Bandhu Majhi and his guard were packed into a police jeep and taken to Hare Street police station, where the leader was let off. Murmu was booked under the Arms Act, a non-bailable offence.        
	Majhi is the MLA from Balarampur, adjoining Bandwan block, where Maoist raids are frequent. Many CPM leaders in the area have armed policemen as their guards. Murmu, a CPM cadre, had been assigned to protect Majhi by the party, said sources.        
	The CPM has been accused of accumulating arms and ammunition in the Maoist-hit zones for a possible resistance and the unlicensed gun from the MLAs aide is likely to add fuel to the charges.        
	CPM state secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty expressed surprise and promised a probe.        
	An investigator said they had not taken legal action against Majhi as Murmu said he was alone.        
	He (Murmu) is one of the armed CPM cadres who are now fighting the Maoists in Jangalmahal. He works as Majhis bodyguard, a special branch officer said.        
	Court sources said Majhi was in Calcutta because he wanted to enquire about a case relating to a dispute over the control of a pond in a Balarampur village.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Puja organisers were fearing a washout but the weather god finally did not mar the Ashtami spirit.        
	The rain on Ashtami evening was nothing compared with Saptami, said Partha Pathak, an organiser of the 66 Pally Puja in south Calcutta.        
	Bholanath Gupta, an organiser of an Ahiritola puja in the north, said: It did not rain at all in many parts of north Calcutta. The Ashtami forecast had given us a scare but the weather remained pleasant, Gupta told Metro.        
	The depression over the Bay intensified into a deep depression on Friday and was on its way to the Orissa coast.        
	At 8.30am on Friday, it was 300km south-southwest of Digha. Its likely to make landfall between Gopalpur and Paradip, 515km from Calcutta, on Friday evening, said an official in the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The city will receive spells of moderate to heavy rain till Saturday evening. Dashami, too, could be wet. the official added.

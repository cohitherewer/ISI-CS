The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Govt wants school safety scan 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Govt wants school safety scan 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	The state government will urge the Delhi-based ICSE board and CBSE to monitor affiliated schools to ensure security of the students on campus.         
	During his reply to this years budget proposals, school education minister Partha De stressed the need for the central boards to intervene to ensure better implementation of child protection rights.        
	The government is concerned at the way security of students is being threatened in schools, said De, addressing the House after 12 members had expressed their views on the education budget.        
	Every school must ensure that its students are taught in a stress-free environment. The state government has decided to promulgate an act to bring all categories of schools under an umbrella. A draft of the act was forwarded to the Centre for clearance two years ago, added De.        
	Though the minister did not mention the death of La Martiniere for Boys student Rouvanjit Rawla, who committed suicide after he was caned in school, education department sources told Metro that the incident triggered the move.         
	The government has banned corporal punishment in schools but cannot implement the ban in private schools, especially the ones run by Christian missionaries, said De.         
	The government recently issued a guideline to the state-aided and state-run schools warning teachers of stern action if they beat up students.         
	Schools seeking affiliation to the CBSE and the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, which conducts the ICSE and ISC, need a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the state government. But once the NOCs are issued, the state government has no control over them.        
	The minister did not suggest how the central boards should monitor the schools.         
	A senior official of the department said: The boards might start including a representative in the managing committees of the schools or they might seek a declaration from the schools that no teacher would be allowed to punish students physically, said a senior official of the education department.         
	The boards act as affiliating bodies and have no say in the administrative matters of the schools. The state government also has no say in the workings of such schools, which makes it difficult to ensure proper security for students, De said.        
	According to the minister, apart from protecting students, the boards should also ensure job security for teachers and non-teaching employees.

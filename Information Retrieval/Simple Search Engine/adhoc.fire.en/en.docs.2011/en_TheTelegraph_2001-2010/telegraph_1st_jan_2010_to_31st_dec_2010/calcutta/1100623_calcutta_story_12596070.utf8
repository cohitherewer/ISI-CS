The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Unions too many fuel fire of inefficiency
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Unions too many fuel fire of inefficiency
  - Stephen probe reveals how blaze battle was lost        KINSUK BASU                                                  
	The fire services top brass is too busy dealing with the demands of 17 employees unions to be able to focus on improving efficiency in the field, according to the S.N. Roy Committee probing the Stephen Court tragedy.        
	Sources said the 12-member probe panel received eight letters from staff unions mentioning the fault lines within the fire brigade, but not one of these admitted to inefficient handling of the March 23 blaze at 18A Park Street that killed 43 people.        
	The letters, most of them unsigned, are basically a litany of complaints. Not a single fire brigade employee deposed before the committee in person, an official said.        
	An internal post-mortem of staff performance during the Stephen Court fire revealed that around 30 per cent of the 140-odd firemen deployed that day gave off their best but the rest were found wanting. The laggards, a senior officer said, could get away because of the unions.         
	The fire services headquarters on Free School Street apparently maintains separate files for the 17 unions, which queue up for deputation round the year. There is a union of drivers and one each for ministerial officers, senior officers, firefighters and even communication officers. You name the wing and there is a union. On an average, seven to eight unions turn up for a deputation every month, an official told Metro.        
	Four unions have already sought dates for meetings with the fire brigade chief in July. When the director-general is unavailable, the union members seek out the director. In his absence, it is the additional director-general. Sometimes members just walk in, rues an officer.        
	 So what are the issues they raise? It can be anything. If an errant fireman is reprimanded, there will be a delegation from the union at your door, revealed the official.         
	The unions even bargain for a posting of the members choice or recommend a member for promotion.        
	Earlier, recruits would be sent to north Bengal and brought back to Calcutta only after they roughed it out there. From 2005, the trend has reversed. New recruits even get their first postings in the city. Thats how powerful the unions are, said Rony Walter, the general secretary of the Jatiyatabadi Domkol Karmachari Samity.         
	But when a meeting was recently convened to discuss operational efficiency, few spoke up, a source alleged.        
	Unionism, banned under the West Bengal Fire Services (Maintenance of Discipline) Act of 1974, was legalised again by the Left Front in 1979.

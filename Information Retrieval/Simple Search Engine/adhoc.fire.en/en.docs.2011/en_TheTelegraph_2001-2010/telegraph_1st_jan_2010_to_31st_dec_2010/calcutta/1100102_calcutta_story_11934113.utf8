                Shrimati Rajlakshmi
  Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya        Fusion of another kind                    Santoor maestro Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya is a pioneering musician who can truly be described as one of the leading music ambassadors of the country. His recital thrills listeners, transcending countries, cultures, gender, religions and age. With his ability to adapt to the changing times despite remaining true to the classical genre of music, as well as an impressive stage presence, he is one of the few contemporary classical musicians who can reach out to connoisseurs as well as ordinary music lovers. Lately, he has collaborated with upcoming and popular piano artiste Shrimati Rajlakshmi. A disciple of late V. Balsara, she plays Indian music on the piano from bhajans and ragas to contemporary Indian songs, as well as popular Western tunes. In Synthesis, a unique jugalbandi of the santoor and the piano, the duo will present an interesting and innovative fusion of classical Indian ragas blended with popular tunes (Hindi, Bengali and bhajans).            Event: Duet santoor and piano recital by Tarun Bhattacharya and Shrimati Rajlakshmi

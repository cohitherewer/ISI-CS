          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three motorcycle-borne men shot a 37-year-old sales superviser near Kankinara railway bridge on Sunday afternoon and escaped with a bag containing cash that he was carrying.        
	Avijit Das, who was hit by multiple bullets in the chest and a hand, was declared dead at Bhatpara State General Hospital.        
	Police are yet to ascertain whether the assailants were only after the money. Investigators could not confirm how much money was in the bag. Officials of the company where Das used to work said he might have been carrying more than Rs 1 lakh.         
	Das, who lived in Shyamnagar, about 3km west of where he was killed, was walking to his companys office in Rathtala after getting off a bus when he was attacked. The superviser was returning from Kalyani, where he had gone to collect money from clients.        
	According to the police, some local traders heard the gunshots and saw two men get off the motorcycle and grab the bag that Das was carrying. The trio then sped towards Kalyani Highway, about 5km from the spot.

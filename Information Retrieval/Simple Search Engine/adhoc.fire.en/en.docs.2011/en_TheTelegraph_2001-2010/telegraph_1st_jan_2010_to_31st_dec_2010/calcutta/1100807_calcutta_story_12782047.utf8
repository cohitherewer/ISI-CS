          A STAFF REPORTER                          Yash Lakhotia                                  
	The CID on Friday submitted the chargesheet for the murder of Yash Lakhotia, the eight-year-old son of a Howrah realtor who was abducted and strangled.        
	Seven persons were arrested in connection with the abduction and murder but the chargesheet names only one  Santosh Singh. The sleuths have failed to find any evidence against the rest.        
	There is enough evidence to nail Singh, a friend of the Lakhotias. We are sure he will be convicted, said Somen Mitra, inspector-general (II) of police, CID.        
	The sleuths said Singh, who worked for Yashs father Anil and uncle Nandulal, abducted the child after he fell out with the family.        
	He was arrested at a Jadavpur bus-stop on April 26. He admitted to kidnapping and killing Yash and showed us the godown where he kept the child confined, said an officer.        
	Yash, a student of Class II, was abducted from in front of his school in Liluah on January 29. His body was found beside a bush off Foreshore Road, near the Lakhotias apartment, on January 31. The body bore a strangulation mark and the hands were tied.

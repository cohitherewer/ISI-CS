The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Online CAT evokes fear of mouse
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Online CAT evokes fear of mouse
  - Prometric assures jittery candidates of glitch-free test starting today          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                          
	MBA aspirant Gaurav (name changed) is more worried about handling the mouse than about belling the CAT on the eve of his second online crack at an IIM seat.        
	With less than 24 hours to go for the start of Common Admission Test 2010, coaching institutes in the city were busy calming the nerves of candidates haunted by glitches that had marred the first online edition.        
	We have had a lot of students coming to us asking what they should do if there is a technical problem midway through the test. Our advice to them is not to panic, said Rahul Reddy, the director of Triumphant Institute of Management Education.        
	The queries range from what one should do if the computer hangs to whether he or she would get extra time if the questions take longer than normal to appear on the screen. Some students fear being disqualified if they log out of the test by mistake, which many apparently did last year.        
	Around 7,500 students across the country were unable to even take the test during the first three days of the 10-day window in 2009 with online glitches striking some of the labs where the exams were being conducted.        
	Students had also complained about computers hanging mid-test while some were left waiting long for questions to load on their screens.        
	I did not face any problem but there were candidates in my centre who did. I am trying to relax but I keep worrying about a glitch spoiling my chances this year, said Gaurav.        
	Prometric, the US-based service provider contracted to conduct CAT, has assured candidates that all possible corrective steps have been taken.        
	The number of test centres has been reduced so that they can be monitored better and the isolation period for each test lab has been increased to minimise the chances of a virus infection.        
	Going by the steps that have been taken, there is little chance of a problem during CAT 2010. We have advised all our students to be positive and stay calm, said V. Viswanath, the academic head of the coaching institute Erudite.

  Allow time for final checks before clicking ldquo;quit test rdquo;

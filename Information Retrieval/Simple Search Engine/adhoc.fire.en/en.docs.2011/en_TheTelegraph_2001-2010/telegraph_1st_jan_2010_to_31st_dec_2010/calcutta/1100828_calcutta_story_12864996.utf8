          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Scattered showers on Friday afternoon brought relief to parts of Calcutta but steady rainfall is likely to elude the city and its neighbourhood over the weekend.        
	In the absence of prominent atmospheric formations which could generate heavy cloud formation, such rain is normal at this time of the year. Calcutta and its outskirts will have to wait for steady rains, said an official of the India Meteorological Department in Delhi.        
	Fridays rainy spells started around 11am and continued till around 4pm. Areas in north and central Calcutta received more rain than the south and the east.

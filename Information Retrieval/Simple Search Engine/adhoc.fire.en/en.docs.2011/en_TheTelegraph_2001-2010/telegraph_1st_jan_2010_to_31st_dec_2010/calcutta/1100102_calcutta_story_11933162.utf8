                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      200-plus arrested on New Years Eve
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Around 220 people were arrested on charges of teasing, unruly behaviour, pickpocketing and drink driving from across the city on December 31 night.        
	Our teams arrested 195 people, including a woman, for rowdyism and teasing in the Park Street, Shakespeare Sarani, Bowbazar and Hare Street areas. No major incidents were reported from anywhere and the night passed off peacefully, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.        
	According to him, the woman was in an inebriated condition and was arrested from a restaurant in Park Street.        
	She broke a couple of glasses in the restaurant and was arrested for unruly behaviour, the officer said.        
	Officers of the special raid section arrested 15 people for drink driving.        
	Most of the accused were youths from well-off families. After testing positive on breathalysers, they were taken to government hospitals for medical examination, said an officer of the raid section.        
	Cops came under attack from some youths in Entally when they tried to enforce the ban on playing loudspeakers at night. The youths picked a quarrel with the cops and later hurled bricks at them, forcing the men in uniform to beat a hasty retreat.        
	Nobody was injured. The youths seemed to be drunk, the officer said.        
	Senior officers said a tight security ring was thrown around the Park Street-Shakespeare Sarani zone which draws the maximum footfall on New Years Eve.        
	More than 2,000 policemen were deployed in the area under the supervision of senior IPS officers and assistant commissioners of police.        
	Plainclothesmen were posted in front of hotels, bars and restaurants across the city to prevent any untoward incident. Policewomen, too, were deployed in adequate numbers, the officer added.        
	The police had also stepped up security on the Maidan, from where 10 alleged pickpockets were picked up.        
	Senior officers kept a close watch on cops in the barracks who were asked not to attend parties in public places. No violation of the order was reported, said an officer.        
	The Bypass and the Park Circus connector, too, were under the scanner in an attempt to curb drink driving.

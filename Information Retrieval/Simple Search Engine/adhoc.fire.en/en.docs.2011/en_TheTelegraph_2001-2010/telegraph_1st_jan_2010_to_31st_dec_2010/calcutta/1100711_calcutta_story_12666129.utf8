	Apropos, Spouse grouse, July 4, I do not agree that the home is more stressful than office. At the work place you are accountable to your boss and have to explain every time why you fail to deliver. At home, however, you can turn a deaf ear when your partner complains about any job undone. So the boss is more stressful any day.             
	A.S. Mehta, New Alipore                     
	The stress that we experience at work often reflects in our personal life. With EMIs to be paid, we start giving our careers the priority. Unable to do the balancing act, many let their relationship with their spouses suffer. What is more stressful, the home or office, differs from person to person and depends on what our priorities are.           
	Soma Sengupta, Address not mentioned                     
	For a working woman both her house and office is stressful. She usually has more burdens on her shoulders than her spouse. Be it attending to family members or guests at home or making an office presentation at a meeting she has to handle all deftly. Todays nuclear family set-up is also the reason behind a stressful life. People need to visit their parents at least once a week. In a joint family however, since one is living with his parents he can go out and enjoy with his spouse on an off day. That way needless fights are avoided. Life becomes stressful only when people make them so. They can find happiness amidst busy schedules.

  - 12-hour feast of fashion with Gaultier and Stella, Marc and Moschino          SHRADHA AGARWAL                            CALCUTTA CALLING: Jean Paul Gaultier and Stella McCartney creations                                      
	Jean Paul Gaultier, Salvatore Ferragamo and Stella McCartney are coming to town.        
	A big brandwagon trundles into Calcutta next week with Fashion Yatra Crme, presented in association with t2. The exhibition with a difference on January 19, from 2pm to 2am at Hyatt Regency, will see a star-studded line-up ranging from Marc Jacobs and Moschino to Rohit Gandhi amp; Rahul Khanna and Rakesh Agarvwal.        
	I am glad that Fashion Yatra Crme is making its debut in Calcutta. It has been my dream to bring an event here, especially after seeing the citys phenomenal response to the Kolkata Fashion Weeks, says Chennai-based Kamini Saraf, founder of Fashion Yatra.        
	In the past three years, Fashion Yatra Crme has travelled to Hyderabad, Chennai and Delhi. In Calcutta, the luxury label yatra arrives with Alberta Ferretti, Lanvin and Escada along with Ashima-Leena, Gaurav Gupta, Anita Dongre, Bian, Zubair Kirmani, Siddartha Tytler, Geisha Designs, Asmita Marwa and Krsala. Monapali, Kallol Datta and Soumitra Mondal will provide the Calcutta connection.        
	Paramita Saha of Arts Forward, co-ordinating and promoting the event, says the participating designers are upbeat about coming to Calcutta. The market here is growing so rapidly and there is a lot of positive curiosity.        
	Delhis Zubair Kirmani agrees. I am looking forward to the event since Calcutta works well for me, says the designer who starred in both KFW events last year.        
	The shopping saga begins on January 19 with a coffee morning and closes with performances by Black Coffee and Sapphire. A set designer will ensure non-stall ambience.        
	Seasoned shoppers like Ratul Sood are happy to welcome such lifestyle events to town. Its terrific, as long as they bring us new collections. Calcuttans are well-travelled and so we refuse to be fooled by anyone anymore, he says.        
	Fashion Yatra Crme will be preceded by an edition of Fashion Yatra, at Taj Bengal, on January 18, involving about 35 domestic labels including Breathing Space and Agnimitra Paul. Part of the proceeds will go towards charity.

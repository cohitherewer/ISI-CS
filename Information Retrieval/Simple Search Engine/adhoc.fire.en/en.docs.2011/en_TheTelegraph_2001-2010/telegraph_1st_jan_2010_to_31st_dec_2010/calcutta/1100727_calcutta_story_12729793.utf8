	The heavy showers over the last couple of days, raising hopes of the monsoon making up its deficit in the last week of July, are not here to stay, warned the weatherman.        
	A low pressure area over Orissa had induced the rain but its influence is on the wane as it has started moving westward. By Monday afternoon, it had moved to Madhya Pradesh, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The intensity of rain is likely to lessen from Tuesday with the formation moving further away.        
	According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), rainfall during the week gone by (July 15-21) was 17 per cent deficient.        
	The total deficit for the season now stands at 30 per cent for south Bengal, including Calcutta.        
	From Tuesday afternoon there is little chance of seeing the kind of rainfall we have seen over the weekend or on Monday. The deficit is unlikely to be bridged within July, said Debnath.        
	The city on Monday received 14.22mm of rain, with several spells of rain between 11am and 5pm. The minimum temperature, however, stayed a degree above normal at 26.7 degrees Celsius. The maximum too was a degree above normal at 32.5 degrees Celsius.        
	While the IMD has forecast an active phase of the monsoon over central and adjoining north peninsular India, there is no such forecast for eastern India or south Bengal.        
	Heavy rainfall is unlikely over south Bengal over the next week. The volume of rainfall is not expected to pick up before August, said an IMD official.        
	Meteorologists, however, insisted that a dismal July was unlikely to spoil the total rainfall figures for the season.        
	At least two months of possible heavy rain lie ahead. The city, on an average, receives over 620mm of rain in August and September. There is no cause for concern yet, said one.        
	The monsoon usually lasts till the first week of October  inching close to Durga puja this time  in the city with over 1,400mm of rain and around 65 rainy days over the entire season.

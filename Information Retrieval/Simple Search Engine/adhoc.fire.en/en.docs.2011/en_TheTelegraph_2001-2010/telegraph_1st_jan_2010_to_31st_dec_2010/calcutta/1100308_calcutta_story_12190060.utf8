	Three men were arrested on Sunday on the charge of duping several people by making a false promise of selling 800sq ft plots at Rs 64,000 each.        
	Police said Metro Infrastructure, which claimed to be a Mumbai-based firm with its city office in Salt Lake, had published a newspaper advertisement seeking customers for the plots in Dankuni that were up for sale at Rs 64,000 apiece.        
	Shibpur resident Amit Majumdar, who lodged a police complaint that led to the trios arrest, had made a token deposit of Rs 500 and went to inspect the plot.        
	Majumdar found there was no land in the name of the firm. He also spoke to residents who said they had not heard of any such project, said an officer of Bidhan Nagar (South) police station.        
	Following the complaint, the cops raided the firms FE 488 office and arrested Chittaranjan Das, Sangram Kasturi and Ayan Mukherjee.        
	Das, who hails from Orissa and owns two flats in Mumbai and Calcutta, is the regional head of the firm, while Kasturi is an office assistant and Ayan works in the marketing wing, the officer said.         
	The cops seized 15 cheques for Rs 4.64 lakh from the office. We suspect the firm has duped several others as well, the officer added. A probe revealed that the firm had only started talks with a broker at Jaykrishnapur and Nizampur villages, near Dankuni, for acquiring the land.

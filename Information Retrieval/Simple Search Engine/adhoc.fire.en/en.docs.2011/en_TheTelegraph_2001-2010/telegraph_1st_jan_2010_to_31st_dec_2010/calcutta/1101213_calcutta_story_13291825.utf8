The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Slap after sop for profit fair
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Slap after sop for profit fair
  - Milan Mela charges increase nine times        KINSUK BASU                                    
	Book-lover Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees favourite annual event is reeling from the shock of a Rs 3.14-crore rent estimate from the government for the next edition after being spoilt silly by sops that have swelled its coffers and eroded the state exchequer.        
	Its a tall order for us. We will be requesting the government to bail us out, just as it has been doing since 1993, Tridib Chatterjee, the secretary of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild, told Metro on Sunday.        
	The last book fair at Milan Mela had cost the guild only one-ninth of the new rent  Rs 38.5 lakh for 12 days  thanks to a bouquet of discounts meant for non-profit organisations. The largesse was reflected in the guilds balance sheet for the last fiscal that shows a profit of Rs 22.6 lakh and a healthy deposit of Rs 1.25 crore.        
	So how has chief minister Bhattacharjees beloved book fair fallen from grace?        
	Industry minister Nirupam Sens statement on Saturday that the guild was doing business apparently reflects both the Left Front and the governments view on the contentious subject. Officials said Sen was scheduled to meet guild officials later this week to convey the message that the cash-strapped government could no longer bear the book fairs burden.        
	Chief minister Bhattacharjee might meet them later and maybe even scale down the rent a bit as a face-saving measure. But the days of 50 per cent discounts are gone, said a senior official of the industries department.        
	The chief minister did say at an event organised by Kamarhati Municipality in Belghoria on Sunday that the book fair was a little different from other fairs.         
	The West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation (WBTPO) has quoted a rent of Rs 9.15 lakh per day for the 18.4-acre fairground  phases I and II  and separate amounts for facilities like the air-conditioned halls and food kiosks.         
	Until last year, the rent for the ground was Rs 30,000 per day, but the guild had to pay only half that amount. The total rent for 12 days was Rs 63 lakh, which was slashed by almost Rs 24 lakh for the guild because it enjoyed the chief ministers blessings.        
	Minister Sens department has based the steep hike in this years rent as much on the guilds balance sheet as on the addition of various facilities to Milan Mela, which remains a work in progress even three years after construction began.        
	Phase I has four non-AC halls along with an open-air theatre, a food court, two toilets and an open paved area measuring 26,300sq m . With Phase II being readied as well, if the guild wants to use the fairground, it needs to be ready to pay a reasonable rent, said a senior officer of the WBTPO.         
	Phase II of Milan Mela includes an open space of 26,700sq m with various facilities, including nine food kiosks and four toilets. It will also have an office-cum-conference building with office space of over 230sq m, conference facility for 80 people, VIP rooms and a pantry.         
	Officials of the guild, registered as a non-profit organisation under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act, insisted that little magazines and regional publishers would perish under the mountain of extra charges.         
	We have been sharing whatever we earn by way of social welfare activities. We donated Rs 2 lakh to the CMs Relief Fund, apart from spending Rs 1 lakh on books for students in areas hit by cyclone Aila last year. We also spent Rs 23,000 on a health camp and another Rs 1.49 lakh on books among children in the fire-ravaged shanties of Ultadanga and Bantala, said secretary Chatterjee.        
	But Kalyan Shah, a former president of the guild, admitted that it was time chief minister Bhattacharjees beloved fair paid what was due to the government. The social work is fine but the fact remains that the guild is a profit-making body. So why should it seek incentives and waivers from the government?

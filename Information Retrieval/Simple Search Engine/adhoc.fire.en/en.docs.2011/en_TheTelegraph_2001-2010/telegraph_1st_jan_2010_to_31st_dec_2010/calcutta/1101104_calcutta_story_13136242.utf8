The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cracker monitor beats retreat as cops look on
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cracker monitor beats retreat as cops look on
  - Noise norm check hits a hurdle, search for blueprint to unclog road ahead of Kali Puja         JAYANTA BASU                                    
	Cracking down on banned crackers is turning out to be an uphill task for the pollution control board, as evident in the meek retreat of two of its inspection teams in the face of resistance from traders on the fringes.        
	On both occasions the inspectors were accompanied by police, but the men in uniform were hardly helpful.        
	A four-member board team, accompanied by a force from Barasat police station, visited a makeshift fireworks market at Narayanpur Nilgunge.         
	Almost as soon as they stepped in, the traders switched off all the lights to prevent the officials from inspecting the fireworks. Within moments a mob surrounded the board officials, hurling abuses and threatening them to leave the spot.        
	We had no choice but to come back... we were feeling insecure, said Debasish Chakrabarty, a noise pollution expert who led the team.        
	S.M.H. Meerja, the additional superintendent of North 24-Parganas police, said there was some altercation when the board officials went to Nilgunge.        
	We are trying to identify the trouble-makers and will take action against them.        
	A similar hostile reaction from traders greeted another board team the day before at Nungi, on the southern fringes. The accompanying cops allegedly refused to come to the officials help, pleading lack of knowledge about the types of crackers banned by the board.        
	Sources said Nungi and Barasat were among the places where banned fireworks landing in Calcutta were being diverted. On Tuesday, the city police had seized a consignment of banned crackers from Dhulargarh meant for Nungi and Barasat.        
	Its a fact that banned fireworks are being sold on the fringes. There are chances of the items being routed back to the city, said police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	Board officials who have been touring the districts said the police in most cases were refusing to act on the ground that there was no notification from the top brass on the cracker ban.        
	The city police had long issued such a notification. The lack of it, however, could not be an excuse for inaction. The board order is enough, said a board official.        
	Many officers in the districts are unaware of the state governments decibel norm  crackers producing more than 90 decibel sound at four metres from the point of origin are banned.        
	Is not 65 decibel the limit? asked an officer of Mahestala police station, when Metro asked him about the norm. There is some confusion as to which items are banned.        
	It is unfortunate if police officers have so little knowledge about the cracker norm despite holding a series of meetings and training programmes said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the state board and member-secretary of the state noise monitoring committee.                                
	Surojit Kar Purokayastha, the inspector-general of police (law and order), said a notification based on the boards order on cracker ban would be               
	On Tuesday Biswajit Mukherjee, chief law officer of state board and member secretary of state noise monitoring committee, has directed the secretary of Barabazar Fire works Dealers Association  members of which had brought the banned items from Sivakashi  to immediately declare the banned items, seal them in presence of police and keep them separately within specific godowns.        
	The copies of the order have also been sent to senior police officials of both Calcutta and state police. The policemen beyond Calcutta police area shrugged off the responsibility stating that no specific notification banning the specific items had been released by state police authorities.        
	There was some confusion as we had no idea which one was a banned item and which one was not apparently said a police personnel during the raid in Maheshtala.        
	Interestingly when Metro contacted Maheshtala police station in evening an official who picked up the phone - identified himself as the duty officer but refused to give his name - clearly had no idea about the noise bar limit.                           
	? What can one do, even the kalipatkas cross that limit. When it was pointed out that Kalipatkas are actually banned items, he disconnected the phone.         
	Mukherjee has asserted that the confusion for not having any notification in state police area is being created as all items beyond 90 decibel are banned in entire state and polices only job is to seize when PCB experts have been pointing out any banned item.        
	Today state board chairman Prabuddha Nath Roy told that state board would open a control room during the Kalipuja and Diwali days till midnight and also nine teams would be on road. This year , for the first time, apart from monitoring noise pollution, we will have a mobile air pollution measurement arrangement specially close to hospital areas as there were complaints of rising air pollution as a result of continuous bursting of fireworks said Roy.

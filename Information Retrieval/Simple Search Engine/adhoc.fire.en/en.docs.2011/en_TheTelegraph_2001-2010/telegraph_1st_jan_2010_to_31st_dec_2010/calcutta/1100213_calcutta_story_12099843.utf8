          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Spanish woman, now in Calcutta, has alleged that Euro 500 went missing from her bag at Delhi airport while she was going through the security check on Thursday.        
	The bag contained Euro 2,000 which Beartiz Gomez wanted to donate to a school.        
	Officers at Delhi airport refused to register a complaint, saying it would lead to my harassment. I lodged a complaint today with the foreigners regional registration office in Calcutta, said Gomez, who works for a travel agency in Spain.        
	Gomez had arrived in Delhi from Madrid on February 9 but missed her connecting flight to Calcutta. She then booked a ticket on Thursday evenings Jet Airways flight to the city.        
	After arriving at the airport, I put my hand baggage containing Euro 2,000 at the X-ray counter. When I went back to collect my bag, it was not there, recalled Gomez.        
	The bag was traced after 10 minutes but Euro 500 was missing from it. I wanted to donate the money to a school for underprivileged children in Calcutta.        
	The security personnel allegedly refused to take any action. When Gomez approached some CISF officers, they said nothing could be done.        
	I wanted to lodge a complaint, but the officers told me that if I did so I would miss my flight and also face harassment, said Gomez.        
	An immigration official in Calcutta said the complaint had been forwarded to the Delhi office.

	We dont need stardust in our eyes to be fascinated by these lovely black and white photographs from the golden age of Hollywood shot by some of Magnums finest photographers. At least one, Robert Capa, is associated more with five wars than with glamour. Magnum is the first cooperative agency for worldwide freelance photographers.         
	Film directors and actors were included among Capas wide network of contacts. Capa had the exclusive rights to shoot John Hustons The Misfits, which was Marilyn Monroes last film. It was written by her former husband, Arthur Miller, and she was cast opposite Montgomery Clift and Clark Gable.        
	In the exhibition, At the Movies  Magnum ke Tasveer, at the Seagull Foundation for the Arts, Monroe poses with her co-stars, script writer and director in a draped dress clinging to her curves. The cherry prints on her dress could easily be magnified images of spermatozoa on the move.         
	In an uncanny image, a half-draped Monroe sits on a chair with her back to the camera, while someones flabby arm shoots out from the side of the frame as if to slap her on her shoulder. The actress, whose skirt-in-her-face pose is one of the most imitated anywhere (you can see this famous shot from Seven Year Itch revealing her gams like ham here), was to die mysteriously a year after this photo shoot.        
	One cannot take ones eyes away from those stunning photo shots of a young Elizabeth Taylor and a nubile Sophia Loren, but Paul Newmans penetrating blue eyes look straight into the viewers soul. A glimpse of Grace Kelly caught between the heads of two men is even more captivating.             
	The missus voice  
	A crowded Metro station can reveal domestic secrets. Peak hour at Chandni Chowk station Metro station. The entrance and exit gates on the platform are not working as usual. Suddenly a scream fills the air. Matha mota! (idiot!), cries a shrill female voice. Time stands still for a few seconds for the shocked husband and his equally shocked co-passengers. The husbands crime? The poor man had no clue that the gates were already open and there wasnt any need to insert a ticket. And the wife had no patience.

	Suruchi on Eliot Road, one of the first Bengali restaurants in town, is run by the All Bengal Womens Union. It serves delicious dishes that taste like home-cooked food and vanish fast every afternoon. But the association is more notable for a home for rescued victims of trafficking that it has been running for decades.         
	Recently Tin Can, a city organisation, shot a documentary on the association. The film, set to Satyajit Rays music, sourced from his various films, is about the inmates and the various activities at the home. It was screened at the Bengal Club on August 28.        
	The All Bengal Womens Union was formed in 1932 by Ramola Sinha, says its president, Ratna Sen, who has been involved with the union since 1953. The union was formed to work for the suppression of immoral traffic in Bengal. In 1933, the union set up the home for rescued girls. We started with a handful of inmates, says Sen. Today, the union runs a creche, a primary school, a childrens home with 200 inmates, an after-care home for those above 18, Swadhar, a rehabilitation centre for trafficked women and an old age home.         
	We always got aid from the government. At present, we receive aid from both the central and the state government. But it is not always enough. We need private donors too, said Sen.         
	The inmates are trained in skills like weaving, block printing, tailoring and and an exhibition-cum-sale is held of their products. The union also runs a bakery and of course, Suruchi. The inmates run the kitchen. After completing primary schooling, children are sent to high schools in the neighbourhood. Some are helped to pursue higher education, computer training or other vocational courses, said Romola Sen.         
	Honorary general secretary Amita Sen added: We would also like to work in villages where trafficking is rampant. But all this would require more funds. The association hopes that the film will help them reach out to possible donors.

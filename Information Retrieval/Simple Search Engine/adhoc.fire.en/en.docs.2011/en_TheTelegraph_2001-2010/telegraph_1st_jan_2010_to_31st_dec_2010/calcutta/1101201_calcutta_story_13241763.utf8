The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | December is here, winter far behind
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      December is here, winter far behind
  - Sush in summer dress, city longs to bring out woollens           A STAFF REPORTER                          Sushmita Sen, in a polka-dotted off-shoulder dress, sparkles at the inauguration of Calcuttas second Hushh restaurant at South City Mall on Tuesday afternoon. (Rashbehari Das)                                        
	December is here and winter is officially only a week away, but the mercury is making Calcutta go grrr rather than brrr.        
	With November showing no sign of heralding winter and the Celsius staying several degrees above normal, those looking forward to bringing out the woollens are beginning to doubt whether the weather will change for the colder over the next few days.        
	 Even last year, we had to grab lighter woollens and bring home the quilts and blankets from the dry cleaners by the latter half of November. Whats wrong this year? wondered 23-year-old event manager Riya Sharma, who eagerly awaits winter like most in the city.        
	The only hint of cooler weather had come on the first two days of November, when the Alipore Met office was flooded with queries of whether winter was going to set in earlier than usual.         
	However, the Celsius started rising from November 3 and it wasnt until 20 days later that the readings returned to normal. The relief was short-lived, though. Temperatures started rising again last Thursday and Tuesdays minimum temperature stood at 19.5 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal.        
	According to Met office data, both the minimum and maximum temperatures were above normal on 26 out of the 30 days in November.         
	The Celsius staying above normal consistently through the month, with the minimum being 3 to 7 degrees above normal on 21 days, is remarkable, said a scientist from the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida.        
	G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, blamed the numerous atmospheric formations (from low pressure areas to cyclonic circulations) over the Bay for the warm spell.        
	A cloud cover, among other factors, hinders the free flow of cold, dry northerlies and northwesterlies over the region, he told Metro.        
	So when is relief expected? With a drop in temperatures over the next few days, the weather should normalise, said an official of the India Meteorological Department.        
	But will that finally herald winter? Not quite. Temperatures will fall over the next week, but the onset of winter could be delayed this year by 10-14 days. A clearer picture will emerge this week, said a scientist.

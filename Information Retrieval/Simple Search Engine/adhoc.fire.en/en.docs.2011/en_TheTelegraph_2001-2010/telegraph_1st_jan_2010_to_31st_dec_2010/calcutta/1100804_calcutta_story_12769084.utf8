                      Landscape art in India        Aesthetic theories in the West as well as in the East gave the highest status to works that required the most imagination from artists. In the West this was history painting, but in East it was imaginary landscape. A major contrast between landscape painting in the West and the East has been that while in the West it occupied a low position in the accepted hierarchy of genres till the 19th century, in the East the classic Chinese mountain-water ink painting was the most prestigious form of visual art. However, with the invention of photography in the 19th century, landscape painting became the chief artistic creation of Europe, as well as its dominant art, with the result that in the following period, people assumed that the appreciation of natural beauty and the painting of landscape were a normal and enduring part of spiritual activity. Underlying artistic ways to convert the complexity of landscape to an idea were four fundamental approaches: an acceptance of descriptive symbols, a curiosity about the facts of nature, the creation of fantasy to allay deep-rooted fears of nature, and the belief in a Golden Age of harmony and order, which might be retrieved. In the following century, artists engaged themselves with one or two, sometimes all four, of these criteria while composing their thoughts and visions in line and colour. Art of the Land amp; Land in Art (Part 1) aims to showcase such activities as practised in India during the last 100 years. A total of 80 artworks by 40 artists from Jamini Roy and Hemendranath Majumdar to young artists like Sanjay Bhattacharya and Jyotirmoy De are on display. Curator: Arun Ghose.

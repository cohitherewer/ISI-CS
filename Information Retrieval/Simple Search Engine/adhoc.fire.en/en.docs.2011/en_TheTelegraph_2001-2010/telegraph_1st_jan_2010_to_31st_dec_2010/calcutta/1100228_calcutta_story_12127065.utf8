The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The Yew effect
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      The Yew effect

	A large Hindustan Times cartoon from 1966 formed the backdrop to the event. Oxford Bookstore, the venue of the launch of Looking East to Look West: Lee Kuan Yews Mission India, by Sunanda K. Datta-Ray, was chock-a-block on Thursday with the citys literati and glitterati.         
	The cartoon showed a gargantuan Nehru sleeping with a minuscule Yew perched on top, yelling Wake up! It is this cartoon that encapsulates what the redoubtable SKDR wanted to say in his 388-page volume on India-Singapore relations. For governor M.K. Narayanan, who unveiled the book, it was a double pleasure to be at the event for he was an admirer of Datta-Ray and also had the pleasure to know the Singaporean minister-mentor Lee Kuan Yew.         
	Though I am not a historian, I am part of contemporary history and from that perspective I can claim that bilateral relations between India and Singapore have been most purposeful and warm, said Narayanan. Despite neglect on Indias part, the relation with Singapore remained stable largely due to the leadership of Yew, he said.         
	Datta-Ray regretted not having interviewed Narayanan when he wrote this book. He said the title was kept deliberately intriguing to capture the readers attention. In his inimitable style, the eminent journalist peppered his talk with anecdotes.         
	In 1976, Yew went to China for the first time, though he had been to India several times over before that. When he reached, the Chinese premiere gifted him Maxwells Indias China War and told him that this was the correct version of the 1962 war but Yew returned it, saying it was the Chinese version of the war just as India had its own version, narrated the author.

	Packed in two volumes, The Oxford India Anthology of Bengali Literature covers 130 years of Bengali writing, from 1861 to 1991, by 100 writers and includes nearly 250 selections from poetry, short fiction and non-fiction. Starting from Madhusudan Datta, Sukumar Ray, Rabindranath Tagore, Indira Devi Chaudhurani and Saratchandra to Bibhutibhushan, Tarashankar and Mahasveta Devi, the compendium, put together by translator Kalpana Bardhan, has sought to be thorough and inclusive.         
	But while the university press spares some thought and effort to publishing, the same cannot be said of its promotion programmes. For the launch of the present title, chief guest Sunil Gangopadhyay, as printed on the invite, was absent. Author Amit Chaudhuri was roped in after Kalpana, whose hospitality I have received many times, requested me to be here, the author said.         
	Chaudhuri, who has edited the Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature, talked of the challenges as an anthologist. He, however, had to leave halfway through. The programme then went on to a reading session by Tilottama Majumdar and Samik Bandopadhyay. As I read the English text, I was more than once reminded of the original pieces in Bengali, Bandopadhyay said as he read Sudhindranath Dattas Utpakhi, translated as Camel Bird.

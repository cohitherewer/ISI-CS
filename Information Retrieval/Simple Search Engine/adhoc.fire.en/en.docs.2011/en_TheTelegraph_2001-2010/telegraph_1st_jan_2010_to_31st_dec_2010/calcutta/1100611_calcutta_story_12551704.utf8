          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                    
	A marriage sealed in Calcutta and severed overseas through an ex-parte divorce decree has triggered a fresh legal battle here with the husband challenging that order and the wife filing a counter suit.         
	The high court on Thursday stayed proceedings in the case filed in Sealdah court, challenging the divorce granted by an American court in response to the NRI womans plea for separation on the ground that her spouse had deserted her and their daughter.         
	Lawyers said the case was made more complicated by the womans second marriage to an NRI, with whom she has a son. Her second marriage prompted the appellant to challenge the divorce decree and accuse her of bigamy.

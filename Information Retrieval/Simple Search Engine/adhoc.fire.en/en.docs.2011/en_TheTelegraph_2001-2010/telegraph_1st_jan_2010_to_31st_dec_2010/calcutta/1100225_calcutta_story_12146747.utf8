The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Monks on road-repair mission
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Monks on road-repair mission

	Two Ramakrishna Mission monks did on Wednesday what a central or state agency should have done months ago.        
	Early morning commuters on Vivekananda Setu, or Bally bridge, were pleasantly surprised seeing the saffron duo fill up with gravel a large crater on the city-bound flank that the National Highways Authority of India and the state public works department had ignored over the past five months.        
	Every day I face problems while crossing the bridge because of the crater. So I decided to fill it up, said Swami Divyananda, a member of the board of trustees of the Ramakrishna Mission and Math. As a citizen of the country I felt I should do something when the authorities are not doing their job. I hope the authorities now repair the road.        
	The Swami and fellow monk Swami Ramakrishnatmananda carried the gravel in six gunny bags in a car.              
	Metro had on February 11 reported the poor condition of the bridge, highlighting how a large, worn-out chunk of the road in the middle was forcing vehicles to slow down and causing snarls during rush hour (see grab). The crater  across the entire width of the flank  had exposed the metal framework under the road.        
	The cracks started appearing five months back. Thanks to the authorities neglect, it grew into a death trap, said Lakshmi Manna, a Dakshineswar resident who frequently crosses the bridge. We are grateful to the monks but what the bridge needs is a thorough repair. A cosmetic repair job had taken place on the 710 metre bridge in December 2009 for President Pratibha Patil to pass.        
	The upkeep of the bridge has recently changed hands, from the PWD to the NHAI. In 2008, we had asked the PWD to submit details of the bridges maintenance. We have got some papers but they are not enough, said an NHAI official.        
	A PWD official said: Weve sent all papers to the NHAI and cant do anything more.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Car in pond, drunk switches on wiper
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Car in pond, drunk switches on wiper
        A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Papa, theres a car in the pond!        
	Six-year-old Rohinis father became speechless. Is it James Bond in an amphibious vehicle, Soumen Ghosh wondered. There was indeed a car in the pond in front of their house and it was moving towards the deep. There was no 007 inside, but a drunk Nimai Giri, who kept pressing the accelerator even after landing in the pond at Ramgarh in Baghajatin.        
	Trader Sandip Das had asked his driver, Giri, to give the grey Hyundai Santro a wash on the occasion of Vishwakarma puja. Instead of parking the car on the edge of the pond, a sloshed Giri drove straight into it around 1.30pm on Friday.        
	Horrified onlookers said the driver had the AC on and switched on the wiper to see through the water. Some of them jumped into the pond, smashed the windows and pulled Giri out. Residents, firemen and a crane whose operators apparently did not know how to run it dragged out the eight-year-old car four hours later.        
	The car nearly hit three youths and went into the pond at full speed. It kept going and finally sank in the pond, about 12ft deep, said Saumitra Ganguly, who saw the entire episode from his bedroom window.        
	Himadri Chakraborty was among the three youths who dived into the pond fearing that several people might have been trapped inside. The driver hardly seemed bothered that the car had fallen into the pond and kept pressing the accelerator. Only when we broke the window and water gushed in, did he realise that something was wrong, Himadri said.         
	Once out of water, Giri complained of illness and said he was going home, in an adjoining lane. He has been missing since.        
	By the time Sandip Das rushed from his home to the nearby pond, the car had sunk. Giri has been driving my car for a year and has been a safe driver. But I can see how well he has washed my car today, Das said glumly.        
	Two fire engines arrived soon after but those inside could not decide what to do. A police crane came next. Its operators kept pulling the iron cables for 20 minutes before realising that only a button had to be pressed to do the job.        
	Then, there was no one to dive into the water to hook the car. About half an hour later, three firemen agreed to take the plunge. The crane had almost pulled the car till the bank when its cables snapped. The vehicle, upside down now, remained submerged for close to an hour and a half after that.         
	People from nearby localities started arriving at the spot in rickshaws and motorbikes for the show of their lives. The car was finally brought out at 5.30pm amid loud cheers.         
	The police have lodged a rash and negligent driving case against Giri.

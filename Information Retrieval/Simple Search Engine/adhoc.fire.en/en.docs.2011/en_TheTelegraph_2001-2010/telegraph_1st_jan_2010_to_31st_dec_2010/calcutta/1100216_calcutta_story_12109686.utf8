The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Damaged warehouse parts pulled down
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Damaged warehouse parts pulled down
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Firemen on Monday started tearing down the damaged parts of the more than century-old Strand Warehouse which caught fire early on Sunday.        
	The blaze, which was spotted around 2am on Sunday, raged for more than 40 hours with fire services director Gopal Bhattacharya announcing at 8pm on Monday that the flames had been doused.        
	The demolition squad of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and men from the fire and emergency services department started pulling down the affected parts from late afternoon. A part of the rear has been torn down but the team failed to demolish the centre of the faade.        
	Demolition has temporarily been halted. The CMC is pressing into service more sophisticated equipment for the demolition. Most of the work has to be done in daylight, said a fire official.        
	D.P. Biswas, the additional director-general of the fire and emergency services, said efforts were on to save as much of the colonial era edifice as possible. It does not feel good to bring down such a structure but we cannot risk loss of lives by letting the building stand in its present state.        
	The three-storeyed red structure  spread across 45,000sq ft  is owned by Calcutta Port Trust and has been let out to a number of trading houses which stored inflammable materials such as kerosene, tyres and cotton bales in the warehouse.         
	It is one of the four Calcutta Port Trust warehouses on Strand Road  the others being Clive, Fairley and Canning warehouses.        
	The structures, built between 1901 and 1903, were the gateway to the city for ships that left with tea, gunnies, shellac, linseed and jute.        
	The Strand, which has a history of mysterious fires, is the most ornate of the four warehouses. It has multiplying arches on the second floor which is now bare, thanks to an earlier blaze.        
	The late Animesh Roy, former CPT chairman, had drawn up a plan for commercial use of the warehouse but it was never executed.        
	The cause of the latest fire and the extent of damage are yet to be ascertained. The loss cannot be estimated right now. As for the cause, we will have to await the forensic report, fire services director Bhattacharya said. A forensic team visited the spot on Monday but could not gather samples as the temperature was still very high.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Smoke stalls Metro
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Smoke stalls Metro
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Metro Railway services were disrupted on Tuesday after smoke started billowing out from under a compartment of a Dum Dum-bound train, forcing the driver to stop and vacate it at Maidan station during the morning peak hour.        
	A senior Metro official said a glitch in the braking system was responsible for the fumes and the disruption.        
	The rake, which ran empty to the Noapara car shed, is one of the oldest in the Metro line-up and had been stalled because of such snags earlier.         
	Trains did not ply for eight minutes because of the snag and a train each in either direction had to be cancelled. The ripple effect continued for more than an hour with subsequent trains getting overcrowded.

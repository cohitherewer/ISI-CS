	Representatives of oil companies on Wednesday told the state government that autorickshaws would not face LPG shortage in the next 30 days and more outlets of the green fuel would come up in the city and its suburbs by March.         
	The assurances were made during a meeting at Writers Buildings, attended by chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti, home secretary Ardhendu Sen, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury and police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.         
	The government on Wednesday asked the oil companies to keep their outlets open from 6am to 11pm and a fuel tanker on standby.        
	According to Chowdhury, two LPG stations would come up in and around the city by February-end and three more in March. By the year-end, 41 LPG stations are slated to come up in the city.

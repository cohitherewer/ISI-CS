                A Class X student of Dolna Day School on the Rashbehari-EM Bypass connector sent a text message to a teacher around 9am saying a bomb would explode inside the school by 1.30pm. The authorities evacuated the building. The bomb squad, however, found nothing. Police said the boy was let off after he apologised. No complaint has been lodged.

Association general secretary Bimal Guha said the strike had been called off as a mark of respect to former state transport minister and association president Subhash Chakrabarty, who died on August 3 last year.

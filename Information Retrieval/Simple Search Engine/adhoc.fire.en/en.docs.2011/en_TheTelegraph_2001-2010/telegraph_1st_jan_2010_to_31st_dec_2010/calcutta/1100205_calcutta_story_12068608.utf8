The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cancer of constraints
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cancer of constraints
  - Late detection and poor treatment in ill-equipped hospitals          SANJAY MANDAL                                    
	Cancer is being diagnosed late and managed poorly in Calcutta as the number of sufferers rises, exposing the crisis of man, machine and medical expertise in state-run hospitals.        
	World Cancer Day on Thursday was once again an occasion to lament the citys infrastructural inadequacies that have remained unresolved for two decades, forcing patients to go outside the state for treatment.        
	There is a severe shortage of oncologists, equipment and beds for detection and treatment of cancer. We have very few trained medical and surgical oncologists here, said Jaydip Biswas, the director of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, the only government facility of its kind in the state.        
	As many as 70,000 patients are added to the list of cancer sufferers in Bengal every year with Calcutta and its suburbs accounting for more than 10,000. Seventy per cent of these patients first visit a state-run medical college without an integrated oncology department. Medical College and Hospital and SSKM are in the process of setting up regional cancer centres. The first one is awaiting the Centres nod while SSKM has been asked to submit a revised proposal, a senior Swastha Bhavan official told Metro.         
	Four medical colleges now offer only radiotherapy services to cancer patients while National Medical College in Park Circus does not have even that. The main government hospitals in most states have integrated oncology units. An integrated oncology unit with trained personnel and all facilities under one roof is critical to treating cancer patients admitted with multiple-organ failure, said Abhijit Basu, the head of the radiotherapy department at Medical College and Hospital.        
	The PET-CT scan machine that helps diagnose cancer early is available in a solitary private diagnostic centre  Eastern Diagnostic on Mirza Ghalib Street. Each scan costs around Rs 15,000.  
	CHRONIC PROBLEMS  
	 Few oncologists
  Most equipment over 20 years old
  No dedicated oncology unit
  Shortage of cancer wards

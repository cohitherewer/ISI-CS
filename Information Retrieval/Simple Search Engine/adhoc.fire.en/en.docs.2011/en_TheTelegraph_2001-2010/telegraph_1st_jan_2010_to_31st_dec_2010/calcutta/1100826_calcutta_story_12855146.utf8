The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Varsity review lapse exposed
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Varsity review lapse exposed
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A former Calcutta University student who had moved the high court dissatisfied with the review of two of her MA Part II answer scripts found on Tuesday that they had not been reviewed at all.        
	A division bench of Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay and Justice Mohammed A. Ghani had asked the university authorities to produce Anjana Banerjees answer scripts of the first halves of papers V and VIII and other documents relating to their review.        
	When the documents were produced on Wednesday, the judges found that the authorities had not reviewed the answer scripts. Formalities mandatory after the review of an answer script, such as an expert examiner signing it, had not been done, said Milan Bhattacharya, the lawyer representing Anjana.        
	The bench set aside the result and asked the CU authorities to declare the result after proper scrutiny of the answer scripts.        
	The bench also directed the registrar-general of the court to send a copy of its order to the CU vice-chancellor to ensure that steps were taken to prevent similar errors.         
	Anjana, a resident of Bhadrakali, under Uttarapara police station in Hooghly, had taken her MA Part II in English last year. She was not satisfied with her score of 21 and 27 (out of 50) in the first halves of paper V and VIII, respectively, and applied for a review of the answer scripts, said Bhattacharya.        
	When the review result was published, Anjana found her marks in the first half of paper V had been increased to 25 and her score in paper VIII was unchanged. She moved the high court in July seeking an order directing the CU authorities to produce the answer scripts before them.

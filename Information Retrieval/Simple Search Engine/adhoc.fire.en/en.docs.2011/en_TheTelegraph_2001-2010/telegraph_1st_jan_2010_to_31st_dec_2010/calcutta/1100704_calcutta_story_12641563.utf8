	Huma is a little- known getaway in western Orissa, 28km east of Sambalpur on the bank of the Mahanadi. A leaning temple is the main attraction here. The place must not to be confused with Humma, which is 110km from Khurda, 6km from Ganjam.        
	After a quick tour of Sambalpur, we set off for Huma on a winter afternoon. The light of the setting sun twinkled through the leaves of the trees that formed a green carpet on the hillocks as we drove past the Hirakud dam, the largest in Asia.        
	The hum of our car engine was the only sound we could hear as we left the state highway and entered a narrower road. The cold breeze and the spectacular natural beauty kept us quiet as our car sped through the path between parallel rows of sal, segun, akashmoni, dudhra and palash.        
	The tortuous and bumpy ride had left us tired by the time we reached but we did not mind the short walk to the temple through sylvan surroundings, listening to the gurgle of the clear water of the Mahanadi.         
	Lord Vimaleswar is worshipped in the temple, which leans towards the north-east at an angle of 5 to 6 degrees.        
	Thousands of devotees gather at the temple during Shivratri, when a mela is held in the area.        
	Many legends are associated with the origin of the temple. One version credits king Balaram Dev with attempting to build the temple during the fifth century BC. The construction was finally completed between 1617 and 1657 by Veer Ballyar Singh, the king of Sambalpur.        
	According to another version, King Ananga Veema Deva III, who was suffering from tuberculosis, erected the temple to ensure his quick recovery.        
	Residents say that soon after the temple was built, it tilted to one side with a sound as loud as a thunderclap. Others claim the river current forces the temple to stand at an angle with the ground. The quality of the soil is also cited as a factor behind the tilt.        
	The Machinda ghat behind the temple is a favourite among visitors because of the red fishes in the pond.        
	Those staying more than a night, could consider visiting Debrigarh wildlife sanctuary, 55km from Sambalpur.              
	Going         
	Take Koraput Express from Howrah station. Get off at Sambalpur. Huma is 28km from Sambalpur. There are several transport options. You can also drive down NH6        
	Staying         
	Panthanivas of Orissa Tourism, 7km from Sambalpur station, is the best option. There are small hotels and lodges at Huma. Food is available at Panthanivas and other eateries

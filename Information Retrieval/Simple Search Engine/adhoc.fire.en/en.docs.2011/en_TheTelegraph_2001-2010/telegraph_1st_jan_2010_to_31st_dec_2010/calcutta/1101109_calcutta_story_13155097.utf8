The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Baracks Bong connection
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Baracks Bong connection
          CALCUTTA FOUND A PLACE (A RATHER DUBIOUS ONE, WE DARE SAY) IN PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMAS ADDRESS TO PARLIAMENT ON MONDAY. RABINDRANATH TAGORE AND SWAMI VIVEKANANDA COMPLETED THE BENGALI TOUCH TO THE 4,175-WORD SPEECH                                
	A photograph of Calcutta 1945-46 clicked by American GI and military photographer Clyde Waddell. The personal press photographer of Lord Mountbatten wrote: Calcuttas traffic is usually snarled. And the reasons are clearly shown. Shuffling coolies and pedestrians with little regard for their lives...        
	David N. Nelson, South Asia Bibliographer, Van Pelt Library of Pennsylvania State University, writes on the library website, which has put up 60 pictures by Waddell: The annotations have been included because of their intrinsic interest not only to the photographs but to a typical American impression of India at this time. The typical American impression of Calcutta has not changed much in 65 years. Right, Mr President?        
	OLD CALCUTTA                      
	OBAMA SAID: We believe that no matter where you live  whether a village in Punjab or the bylanes of Chandni Chowk... an old section of Kolkata or a new high-rise in Bangalore  every person deserves the same chance to live in security and dignity....              
	WE HEARD: Reaffirmation of a stereotype.        
	What Obama said is an affirmation of the perception that Calcutta is old and Bangalore is new. Its the way people have always stereotyped Calcutta, said brand guru Wally Olins, whose company has got the onerous job of giving Bengals image a lift.        
	But one shouldnt be oversensitive to what he said, added the man who is helping to brand London for Olympics 2012. He was just looking at the standard perceptions that people have about different parts of India. Its an interesting clich. What we need to think about is among all the major Indian cities with their old historic parts he could have spoken about, he chose to talk about Calcutta.        
	SWAMI VIVEKANANDA                      
	OBAMA SAID: Its the richness of faiths celebrated by a visitor to my hometown of Chicago more than a century ago  the renowned Swami Vivekananda. He said that, holiness, purity and charity are not the exclusive possessions of any church in the world, and that every system has produced men and women of the most exalted character.        
	WE HEARD: Keep the faith.        
	The Calcuttan Obama referred to haltingly  he stumbled on the name  was the man who laid the foundation for the relationship that the President hoped would define the 21st century. On 9/11, 1893, Swami Vivekananda took the US by storm, beginning his address to the Parliament of Religions with Sisters and Brothers of America... The 44th American President may or may not have known that a professor of his alma mater, Harvard, had introduced the 30-year-old to the congregation. In his letter        
	 of introduction, John Henry Wright wrote: Here is a man who is more learned than all of our learned professors put together.        
	RABINDRANATH TAGORE                      
	OBAMA SAID: India not only opened our minds, she expanded our moral imagination. With religious texts that still summon the faithful to lives of dignity and discipline. With poets who imagined         
	a future where the mind is without fear and the head is held high.               
	WE HEARD: Reiteration of a clich. The line the President borrowed from the Bard of Bengal has suffered from overuse, be it by the Indian politician or the income-tax office. To a Calcuttan on the street, the line could also belong to Mamata Banerjee. The Trinamul leader has hashed and rehashed it so often that she can almost claim its ownership. But it is only apt that Obama would quote this one from Tagore because it has a universal appeal, said poet-scholar Sankha Ghosh.         
	Tagore wrote Chitto jetha bhoye shunya, uchcha jetha shir in the poem Naibedya in 1901. The line was translated into Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high in Gitanjali in 1912.         
	During the Emergency (June 25, 1975 to March 21, 1977), this was one of the Tagore poems that was banned, said Ghosh.

	Gautam Roy, a Howrah resident, died and three others were injured after a Mitsubishi Lancer crashed into the Tata Sumo he was travelling in on Rajarhat Expressway, near Jatragachhi, on Sunday morning. Roy died on the way to hospital. Police said Roy and his family members were on their way to Chakla Dham in North 24-Parganas when the accident occurred. Police said the driver of the Sumo had probably braked suddenly to ask for directions.

	Flier unconscious: Santosh Kumar Bhattacharjee, in his mid-30s, became unconscious on a flight from Agartala to Calcutta, prompting the pilot to seek priority landing at the city airport on Sunday afternoon. Bhattacharjee was rushed to the airports medical unit. His condition is stable, said a doctor.        
	Scare: An unclaimed sack with four tin containers inside, lying under a seat of a state bus plying on route 3A, triggered panic after it reached the Kankurgachhi terminus on Sunday morning. Cops found pieces of paper inside the containers.

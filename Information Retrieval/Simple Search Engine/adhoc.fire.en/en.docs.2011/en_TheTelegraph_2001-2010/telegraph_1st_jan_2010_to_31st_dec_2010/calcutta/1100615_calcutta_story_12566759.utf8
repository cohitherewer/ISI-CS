The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mishap price of mess
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mishap price of mess
          KINSUK BASU                                                   
	Official apathy and absence of cops have brewed a traffic management mess on the EM Bypass that endangers the lives of the thousands who use the high-speed corridor every day.         
	After an early-morning accident on the EM Bypass on April 13 claimed six persons, the state government had drawn up a plan to hand over traffic management of the entire road to Calcutta police. The force was even asked to prepare a blueprint, designating stretches to different traffic guards. The project files, however, are now gathering dust at Writers Buildings.         
	South 24-Parganas police currently manage traffic between Ruby rotary and Garia on the Bypass. If Calcutta police were managing the entire road it would not have to co-ordinate with another arm of the police, said a senior state home department official.         
	While readying the blueprint, Ranvir Kumar, a special additional commissioner of Calcutta police, had pointed out more basic flaws in the Bypass traffic management.        
	Road markings such as zebra crossings and bus bays, traffic furniture such as guard rails and traffic signs were rare on the stretch, he had said. Absence of service roads and poor surface condition posed further challenges.         
	The senior cop had also stressed the need to increase manpower. Beleghata traffic guard, for example, with its 100-odd constables, 60 home guards and 13 officers, struggles to man the stretch between Ultadanga and Parama island in addition to managing traffic within the city.        
	Office-time traffic on the Bypass is maddening. Add to it the rush of VIPs and other dignitaries. And then there is the night crowd on weekends, said a senior officer of Calcutta police.         
	The last shift of traffic cops ends on the Bypass, and the rest of the city, at 10pm. Those who frequent the eastern corridor feel the risk of mishaps goes up manifold after dark with some truck drivers not switching on headlights.        
	Even the patrol vans of local police stations can rarely be seen on the Bypass at night, said regulars.

	A 59-year-old man died after being sandwiched between two buses in front of Purta Bhavan in Salt Lake on Monday morning.         
	Several others were injured in the city and Salt Lake in four other accidents that cops blamed on roads made slippery by persistent drizzle through the day.        
	Rabindranath Sadhukan, an Ultadanga resident, was trapped between the buses while he was on his way to his office at Jal Sampad Bhavan in Salt Lakes DF block.         
	According to police, as soon as the sales tax employee got off the bus that had stopped in the middle of the road, another bus plying on route 201 tried to overtake it from the left. He was crushed between the two buses, which sped away without stopping.        
	We have got the registration number of the bus that tried to overtake from the left and would soon arrest its driver. Sadhukan was alive when his colleagues took him to Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital. He died within minutes of being admitted, said a senior officer of Bidhannagar North police station.        
	A doctor at the hospital said he died because his lung had burst, causing internal bleeding.        
	He had only 11 months of service left. He was complaining of a mild chest pain in the morning but insisted on going to office, cried his wife Bijoli, sitting on the hospital staircase as her daughter Archana tried to console her.        
	Around 11.10am, near Karunamoyee in Salt Lake, a minibus on the Belgachhia-Salt Lake route collided with a dumper truck, injuring several passengers.         
	According to residents, accidents have become a daily affair on the Karunamoyee-Sector V road, where traffic movement has been restricted to a single lane because of East-West Metro construction work.        
	Our bus was moving at a considerable speed when I suddenly heard a thud and my head hit the back of the drivers seat. I regained consciousness on the hospital bed, said Tapan Mondal, a passenger. The drivers of both vehicles fled the spot.        
	Around the same time, CISF officer Kumaresh Bhatt was seriously injured when the autorickshaw he was travelling in, skidded and turned turtle in Salt Lakes DD block.        
	Bhatt and the four other passengers in the auto were taken to Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital. The officer received stitches on his forehead, face and hand while the others were discharged after first aid.        
	Earlier in the day, a Sector V-bound minibus plying on the Belgachhia-Salt Lake route hit the railings and boarded a footpath at Sector V near Nicco Park.        
	About a dozen passengers sustained minor injuries and had to be taken to Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital. The driver fled the spot.        
	On Beleghata Main Road, 26 passengers and a driver were injured after a bus plying on route 217B collided with a Howrah-Tangra minibus near Gandhi Colony of Eastern Railway Employees Quarters. Witnesses said the minibus was trying to overtake a bus.        
	The injured passengers of both buses were discharged after treatment. The driver of the minibus, Maheshwar Singh, 48, who sustained head and hand injuries, was arrested for reckless driving, said a senior officer of Entally police station.

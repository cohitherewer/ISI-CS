The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Show ends, long live the show
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Show ends, long live the show
										      stage                        Kumar Roy. A Telegraph picture				                           
	Kumar Roy of Bohurupee, who died on the morning of Dol, the day of colour, knew that for theatre practitioners no matter how high they fly or how brilliantly they sparkle, it is ephemeral, gone the moment the show ends. Yet he also wanted his group Bohurupee to be not just surviving, but alive. That is what the group is intent on doing.         
	For a long time now Kumar kaka (uncle) was not able to visit the group regularly because of his health. But we have come up with new productions on our own which he seemed to consider Bohurupee-worthy, says Sumita Basu, a member who is preparing a documentary on the actor, director and designer.        
	The documentary, including an interview, rehearsal footage and drawings, will be screened at the memorial service for Kumar Roy organised by Bohurupee at Sisir Mancha on Sunday, 10am.        
	When Roy went to meet Sombhu Mitra with college mate Ritwik Ghatak, Mitra had left the IPTA, produced Nabanna and was planning a new group. Roy was there at Bohurupees birth and when Bohurupee produced Pathik, Chhenra Taar and Ulukhagda before the pangs of Partition and famine had passed into memory. He contributed to Bohurupees historic productions of Char Adhyay, Bisarjan, Raja and Muktadhara.         
	For a long while Roy, as he himself put it, followed Sombhuda closely, trying to understand and internalise his instructions, the details he worked into the plays.         
	Roy was not only a director and actor, but a designer of costumes and sets and editor of the Bohurupee journal. Under him Bohurupee continued to break new ground and produce plays such as Mrichhakatik, Galileo, Rajdarshan, Aguner Pakhi, Malini, Kinu Kaharar Thetar, Yayati and Shyama to the more recent Kalsandhya.

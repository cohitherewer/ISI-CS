The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shower salve on last lap of 100% day
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Shower salve on last lap of 100% day
          OUR BUREAU                          RUN-UP TO CUP: A man and a child in soccer jerseys caught in Sundays shower near the Maidan. (Aranya Sen)                                   
	Humidity hit a season high of 100 per cent before sauna city finally got a burst of cooling rain on Sunday afternoon, coinciding with water man Sovan Chatterjee being named the new mayor.         
	As the cloud of suspense on Mamata Banerjees choice of mayor lifted and Jol Sovan was anointed, the cloudy skies opened up for some much-needed rain that immediately dragged down both the Celsius and the discomfort index.        
	The shower started around 4.45pm, with less than an hour to go for Mamatas formal announcement, and lasted till 5.15pm for a rain reading of 9.9mm by the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	The Celsius dropped by around three notches from the days high of 36.9 degrees, as did the stifling humidity ranging between 56 and 100 per cent.         
	The minimum temperature of 30.2 degrees Celsius on Sunday was three notches above normal.         
	Rain was on our radar but not many had expected it given the fact that the skies didnt open up once in the last few days despite a favourable forecast, the weatherman said.        
	Sundays breather from the swelter, however, does not alter the forecast of a slightly delayed monsoon in eastern India. Sources in both the Alipore and Patna meteorological centres said the monsoon wouldnt hit the sweat basket before June 10-15.        
	Monsoon usually arrives in the city on June 7 or 8.        
	So does the monsoon delay mean Monday would be just as uncomfortable as Sunday was before the sudden shower? Sundays rainfall is expected to keep Mondays minimum temperature at a normal level. The forecast is partly cloudy skies with rain or thundershowers in some areas, said a Met official.         
	Sundays rain disrupted flight services at Calcutta airport for an hour from 4.30pm with three flights scheduled to land during that time being diverted. Around seven flights lined up for take-off were also delayed.

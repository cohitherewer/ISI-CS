The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HC seal on club demolition order
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HC seal on club demolition order
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Thursday put its seal of approval on the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)s decision to demolish illegal portions of Outram Club on Outram Street.        
	The club authorities have illegally constructed galleries, a bar and restaurant, a restroom and other rooms on the premises. The CMC had issued a notice to the club asking it to demolish these portions. The club moved the court but Justice Tapan Sen ruled that the decision was legal, said civic counsel Alok Ghosh.        
	Senior club member Bitan Chowdhury claimed that some parts of the club that the CMC had claimed to be illegal were later regularised.        
	He added that the club would move an appeal before a higher bench of the court against Thursdays order.        
	In 2002, a special officer of the civic buildings department had first issued a notice to the club asking the authorities to demolish portions that had been built without sanction.         
	Ghosh said the civic body had regularised some portions but the illegal portions needed to demolished.

										      AUTUMN FLUSH                        If this road were never to end...				                           
	Hyphenated people like me, on the cusp of separate worlds, have an unbidden urge to make instant translations. When I come across something beautiful in a language I know I want people I know to share it. It could be a novel, a short story, a poem or a popular song, sometimes even a single word. Friends and relations often find this habit of mine intensely irritating.        
	I have tried to share Abol Tabol, Galpa Guchchha, the Feluda stories, Winnie the Pooh, Premchand novels, Upendrakishore, Sindhi songs, with varying degrees of success. Fiction in any form is easy: you can respond to phir kya hua and in time the story gets told even if the target audience doesnt get all subtleties of language, humour and style.        
	Nuances of single words, poems and songs are more tough. Popular music is the hardest of all. When my entire generation went wild over the Beatles I remember translating some of the songs for an elderly and normally open-minded uncle. His reaction was scathing: You call this a song! In earlier days he had been equally unaccepting of Walking my baby back home, and Mambo Italiano. He thought (like a late lamented minister of this state) that it was apasanskriti at its worst and it was the only time I felt a generation gap between us.        
	 The rest of the country has entirely appropriated some stalwarts of the Bangla adhunik music scene over the years and Hemanta Mukherjee, Salil Chowdhury, Sachin Dev Burman, Kishore Kumar and Manna Dey belong to them almost more than they do to us.        
	When the artistes themselves made Hindi versions of songs already popular in Bengali I felt relieved of the responsibility. In any case it is easier to move, I do believe, from one Indian language into another. But I have frequently met with disaster trying to translate some of them from Bengali into English. Try out some of these. You will found the irate responses I have received in brackets.        
	i) That you are mine tell me in my ear in my ear just once... [In my ear, in my ear means at least twice]        
	ii) If this road were never to end, how would that be, tell me ...[I would say you were lost!]        
	iii) I have taken this route with the intention of losing my way this time round...[It figures.]        
	iv) S/he did not give me [his/her] mind (heart?), friend, just took [mine] so what do I live with now... [Well you dont have a choice, baby!]        
	v) The nest is small, it doesnt matter. The sky is large... [We are birdies today, are we?]        
	vi) Across seven seas and thirteen rivers lives the princess of my dream country whom I visited on a peacock barge... [What did you use on land? An ostrich?]        
	vii) This night is yours and mine, this moon is yours and mine, just for the two of us... [Hey you gotta learn to share!]        
	viii) What I shall not receive in this life, dont believe I have forgotten about it, something goes thither: is it real gold or counterfeit? [Good grief!]        
	ix) Perhaps I shall receive nothing in return; I shall still love you from afar... [What does one do with such long distance leeches?]        
	I hope I havent ruined these golden oldies, my own all time favourites, for you. If you would like an amazing experience you should see the version of vii) above that was sung in Frankfurt by someone who calls himself Mr Bungle. He sings the original Bengali version in remix mode, accompanied by silly grins and pensive stares.         
	Try the youtube and let me know what you think.

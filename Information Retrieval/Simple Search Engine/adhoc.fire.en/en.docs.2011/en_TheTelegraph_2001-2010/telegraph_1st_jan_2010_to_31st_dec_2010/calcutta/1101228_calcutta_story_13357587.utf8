          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 34-year-old man died and his friend was seriously injured after the car they were travelling in rammed into a heap of bricks near Kalighat bridge on Chetla Road on Sunday night.        
	The two lay on the road for around half an hour before policemen in a patrol vehicle spotted them and took them to SSKM Hospital.        
	Doctors declared Sunil Singh, the owner and the driver of the car, dead. His friend Rajendra Prasad, 40, was stated to be in a critical condition.        
	According to police, Singh and Prasad were headed towards their Alipore homes when the mishap occurred, probably because of low visibility caused by fog.         
	The front of the car was smashed. Singh sustained fatal injuries in his head and chest, said a cop.

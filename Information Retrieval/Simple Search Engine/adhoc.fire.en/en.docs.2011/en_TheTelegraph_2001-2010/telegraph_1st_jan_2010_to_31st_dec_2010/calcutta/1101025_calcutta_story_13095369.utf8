          OUR BUREAU                          Rohan Bhattacharya at the airport. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                  
	The 22-year-old student whose parents and brother died in a road accident in Bhutan on Friday returned to the city with their bodies on Sunday.        
	The Indica the Bhattacharyas from Durganagar, near the airport, were travelling in fell into a gorge in Chukha district of Bhutan. Rohan managed to jump out as the car was skidding off the road but the other three and the driver could not.         
	It was foggy while we were going from Thimpu to Phuntsholing. I was sitting beside the driver. The gorge was on our right. Suddenly, the car seemed unstable. I asked the driver to stop and check the tyres, Rohan recounted at Jalpaiguri District Hospital.        
	As soon as the driver pressed the brakes, the car started sliding off the road. I opened the door and squeezed out but cannot say how I survived. Residents of the area and Bhutan police rescued me and took me to a nearby hospital, added the computer science student due to appear for his final examination next month.         
	The Royal Bhutan Police handed over the bodies of Biman, Soma and Soham Bhattacharya to Jalpaiguri district police at the Jaigaon-Phuntsholing border, around 150km from Siliguri, on Saturday evening.        
	The officers and Rohan reached Jalpaiguri with the bodies around 11.30pm on Saturday. The body of Lalan Das, the driver, was handed over to his family members at Jaigaon.         
	Rohan arrived in the city on a Jet Airways flight from Bagdogra around 3pm. The bodies were taken to the familys home and then for cremation.        
	Relatives said the family had decided to go on a holiday at the last moment, taking a bus rather than a train, to north Bengal.

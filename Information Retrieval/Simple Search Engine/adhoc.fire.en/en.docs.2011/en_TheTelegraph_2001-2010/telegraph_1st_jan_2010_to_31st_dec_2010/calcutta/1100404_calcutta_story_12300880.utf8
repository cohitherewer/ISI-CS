The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rhyme knocked out
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rhyme knocked out

	When Sourav Ganguly hit those gigantic sixes in the blistering innings of 88 against the Deccan Chargers on Thursday night, he hit more than the cricket ball out of the park. A huge hoarding at a New Alipore traffic island was removed under cover of darkness about the same time.         
	The hoarding had been put up by a cricket lovers group of the locality and attacked Bengals most loved sportsman. It had a picture of an old man in kurta-pyjama with a walking stick on whom Souravs face had been superimposed. The accompanying rhyme, turning Dada into dadubhai (grandfather), urged Kolkata Knight Riders boss Shah Rukh Khan to drop Sourav.         
	Those who put up the hoarding also staged a protest on Thursday for the benefit of TV channels. That was before the match, before the Prince of Calcutta blew all reason out of the rhyme with his captains knock  the hoarding was thrown out under its impact too.         
	But Calcutta, which does not take criticism of Dada well, is still smarting. Says Sumanta Ghosh, a salesman at a neighbouring chemist shop The Sangam: No man should be belittled like this. Jewellery designer Nilanjanaa Chakraborty is outraged that people can stoop to public slander. Says former womens cricket captain Srirupa Bose: Let Sourav keep playing like this. We will find out who those boys are, she said.         
	Dada himself has laughed off the agitation. Now all eyes are on the Eden Gardens, where the KKR is playing Kings XI Punjab on Sunday.         
	Make biz, not war                   Studio21 at Dover Terrace recently hosted the first edition of The Sapphire Quarterly Art Series. Performances by Paramita Saha (Four Point Something, picture above) and Ankita Dutta Gupta (Emotica) apart, there was a talk by Kalamandalam Piyal on ldquo;body alignment rdquo; and Natyashastra.

	India need not worry too much regarding the threat from China, feels Walter Andersen, the associate director of South Asia Studies Program at Johns Hopkins University. Andersen was in the city recently to attend a symposium organised by International Centre Calcutta on Indias foreign relations and security.         
	More than India, China needs a good relationship between the two emerging economies of the world. War will be the last thing on their mind as it will completely throttle the economic development, said Andersen, while discussing the issue with Indian experts. Andersen also feels that the tension between India and China over Tibet will settle down soon and Dalai Lama will be a key factor in the process.                    
	A different parlour  
	Long before the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) began to think of reviving the abandoned gas crematorium behind the Mullickbazar cemetery, one of the custodians of this Christian burial ground had an audience with a high-ranking CMC official. The former had come with a proposal for setting up a funeral parlour on the premises of the abandoned crematorium once used by Brahmos as well. Unfortunately, the only parlour that the official was familiar with was the kind where both men and women go for grooming. So he wondered aloud why the burial board executive wanted to open a beauty parlour in grounds associated with death and decay.         
	The CMC official had heard neither of Baba Mustafa from the Arabian Nights nor of the intricate art of embalming and cadavers looking their best with a little help from the make-up artist.

	A 34-year-old labourer died and three were injured after being buried under a mound of soil and mud while working on a sewerage project at Baligori in New Town on Wednesday morning.         
	The labourer killed was identified as Ataur Sheikh, a resident of Lalgola in Murshidabad.         
	I, along with Ataur, Pathik Sheikh, Kamu Sheikh and another labourer whom I did not know, went down about 19ft below the road surface to lay a pipe, said Md Rafikul Islam, who is working on the Hidco project.        
	Suddenly the wood planks that were holding back the soil and mud we had dug up, gave way and the debris collapsed on us. I managed to climb to safety but the others were trapped, added Islam.         
	Three of the trapped labourers were rescued. By the time Ataur was brought out from under the debris, he had died.        
	Police said they were looking for the labour contractor and officials of the agency executing the project.        
	Labourers demonstrated in the area demanding compensation for Ataurs family.

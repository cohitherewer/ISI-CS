                      Colours of life                    The artists of The Blue Sky came together with the intention to exchange views and ideas and gain inspiration from interaction with those who share the same passion. Thus united by their love for art, the group presents its sixth annual exhibition, showcasing works that reflect life in all its aspects. Featuring paintings and woodcuts, it brings to the fore works that are an echo of contemporary social mores and habits. Some works, however, bear a trace of nostalgia about an era of simplicity and innocence that is now lost forever. Naturescapes, too, depict sylvan, pastoral scenes that articulate a fondness for rural life as opposed to life in the city. Changing human relationships are dealt with great subtlety; they indicate conflicts, contradictions, lack of inter-personal connections, as also the need for tolerance, understanding and reconciliation. Participants: Subrata Pal (a painting by him appears here), Milanendu Mondal, Dilip Sasmal, Sushanta Dutta, Pravat Chandra Sen and Shyam Sundar Mukherjee.

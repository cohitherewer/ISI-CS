          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta police have tightened security across the city in the wake of the shooting near Jama Masjid in New Delhi and the upcoming Ayodhya verdict.         
	Security will be boosted in malls, hotels, religious places, multiplexes and crowded marketplaces. The Delhi incident on Sunday, the Ayodhya verdict next Friday and the Presidents stay in the city from Tuesday to Thursday have prompted us to increase security measures, joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim said.        
	Star hotels have been asked to thoroughly check the visitors cars and baggage of all customers. Security camera footage should be monitored 24x7, Shamim added.        
	The ongoing Asian volleyball championship at Netaji Indoor Stadium, in which the Pakistani team is taking part, has also contributed to the security step-up.        
	The decisions were taken in an emergency meeting on Sunday. The security of foreign tourists topped the agenda of Sundays meeting.        
	Two Taiwan nationals were injured in the Delhi shooting on Sunday.        
	According to sources, the cops have asked railways to bolster security at the Howrah and Sealdah stations and on suburban trains.        
	More plainclothesmen have been deployed on the road. We have asked the officers-in-charge of the 48 police stations to be more alert. Anti-rowdy section officers have been asked to submit hourly reports, said Shamim.        
	Checking on long distance buses and hotels in central Calcutta started on Sunday night.

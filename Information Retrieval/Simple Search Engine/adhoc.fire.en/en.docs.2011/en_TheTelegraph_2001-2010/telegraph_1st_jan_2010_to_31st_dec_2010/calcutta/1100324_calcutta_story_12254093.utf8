                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Safety net of arms breaks free fall

	Caught 4, missed 3.         
	Thats the scorecard for Ranjan Bhuniya and six others who climbed to the roof of Peter Cat and tried to catch those who jumped down from the fourth and fifth floor balconies of the burning Stephen Court on Tuesday afternoon.        
	I could have saved more lives. I kept on asking shop owners for bedsheets or nets but no one gave us anything. The traders were all busy saving the goods in their shops. We had to rely on our hands, said Bhuniya, a resident of the area who works in a shop in Vardaan Market.        
	Bhuniya was having a cold drink near Stephen Court during his lunch break when the building caught fire. Seven of us climbed up pipes to the terrace and formed a net with our arms to catch those who were jumping off the building, he said.        
	We were able to catch the first two women who jumped down and started feeling very confident. We asked firemen and cops to come up and help us but they said they did not have ladders, Bhuniya added.        
	The third person to jump, a heavy woman, crashed to the floor through the arms of the five.        
	Her teeth pierced my hand as she fell and broke her jaw. We dont know if she is alive. Others got her down from the terrace and took her to hospital, said Bhuniya.        
	One of the men, ITC employee Asutosh Kumar, said Bhuniya and the woman would not have suffered injuries had the cops, firemen, residents or traders arranged for a mattress.        
	A girl and a man who screamed and panicked jumped to the wrong spot. We could not reach them, said Bhuniya sitting outside Flurys, devastated after seeing people die in front of his eyes.        
	I had not seen so much blood and death in my entire life. I can never forgive myself for not being able to save those men and women who were depending on us to catch them, he added.        
	Shaun, a steward at Peter Cat, was another of the catchers. He came out of the restaurant around 2.20pm and saw smoke billowing out of the fourth floor of Stephen Court.         
	Three men jumped from the third floor to the terrace of Peter Cat. They sustained severe head injuries. Three of us brought them down and rushed them to hospital.

										      SANJAY MANDAL      AARGH! AIRPORT - TT for City                                    More than 200 damaged trolleys lie dumped in front of the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport police station                 Around 200 new trolleys are lying locked-up in a glass room in   the international terminal building for the past 12 months                With a serious demand-supply mismatch, passengers struggle to find trolleys that roll right.

	Desperately seeking a trolley that rolls right at the Calcutta airport? Dont waste your time near the exit or entry gates.        
	For, 200-plus trolleys, in various stages of disrepair, lie dumped in front of the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport police station. And nearly 200 brand new trolleys are lying locked-up in a room in the international terminal building for the past 12 months.        
	Whats stopping the damaged trolleys from being repaired and returned to the fleet? Or, whats stopping the ready-to-roll trolleys from leaving their glass prison?        
	The answer lies at the door of Citu, say airport officials.        
	The muscle-flexing trade union wing of the CPM has not only taken the lead in blocking the airports path to privatisation and modernisation, it has also managed to scare one trolley contractor away, keep other operators at bay and exploit passengers in need of that basic tool for travel.        
	Five years ago, a private company was given the contract to operate trolleys. The operator would pay the airport authorities a fee per trolley and the contract wages to the 80-odd trolley retrievers.        
	These retrievers, most owing allegiance to Citu, deliberately do not retrieve used trolleys and even intentionally damage trolleys, said airport sources, to widen the gap between demand and supply.        
	So, enter trolley touts. When flights arrive or depart during peak hours, the Citu-backed men corner the trolleys and demand a fee for the use of a trolley, said an official.        
	We regularly receive complaints from passengers about touts demanding money to provide trolleys, said an airport official. Recently, two passengers complained that touts in the arrival area asked for Rs 500 for a trolley.         
	When the trolley operator wanted to take action against some trolley retrievers, Citu leaders at the airport blocked the move and even forced the operator to double their wages. Since then, the operator has adopted a hands-off approach and even refused to use the new trolleys, said an official.        
	What about getting a new contractor? No one is willing to risk the writ of Citu, said the airport authorities. Any contractor would want to replace the existing staff as they do no work and harass passengers. Citu wont allow that and so no operator will come forward, said a source.        
	On Saturday, the authorities asked the trolley contractor to continue for a week while they hunted for a new one. From next week, there will be no trolley operator at the airport, warned an official.        
	Kali Ghosh, the state Citu general secretary, rubbished all charges.         
	The allegations are all false. If anybody has faced any problem, they can inform us and we will take up the matter with the airports Citu leaders, he told Metro.                    
	There are 2,500 trolleys at Calcutta airport, which anyway is inadequate. On an average, we have 13,000 passengers every day. So we need at least 5,000 trolleys, said an airport official.        
	Nearly 30 per cent of the trolleys are out of action  several of which Metro traced to the dump in front of the airport police station  and another lot is invariably missing in action, lying scattered at the parking lot or departure lounge. So, for all practical purposes, hardly 1,300 trolleys are operational at any given time and that triggers an acute shortage, an official said.        
	What about all those 200-odd new trolleys the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had purchased around a year ago?        
	By then, the private operator had decided it could not function in the Citu regime and refused to make the new trolleys operational. So, the trolleys remain under lock and key.        
	Try telling that to frequent fliers like oncologist Subir Ganguly. When he arrived at Calcutta airport from Delhi a few days ago, he suffered some serious trolley trauma.        
	The flight landed at 5.30pm and I couldnt find a single trolley near the conveyor belt. When I asked the airport staff, they gave me a blank look. I searched across the terminal building and find one in the departure lounge nearly half an hour later, he said.        
	If only the oncologist had known where to look at the terminally-ill airport  for trolleys unusable or unused.

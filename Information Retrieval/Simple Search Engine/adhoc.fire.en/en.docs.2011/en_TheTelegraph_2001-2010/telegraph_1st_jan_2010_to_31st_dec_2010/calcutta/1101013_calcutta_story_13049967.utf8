                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Puja for the young at heart goes platinum             SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI                          Amaan Ali Khan ushered in the Maddox Square pujas platinum year with a two-hour performance on Tuesday evening.

	Abhijit Dutta has a problem this Puja. For the past 28 years, he has been spending his Ashtami evenings at Maddox Square with his gang from school. Thats been their Puja ritual, something their wives have also been convinced  bribed or browbeaten  not to disrupt. But this time, his 15-year-old daughter plans to spend Ashtami evening with her friends at Maddox Square.        
	For that one evening a year, we become like teenagers again. I really dont want my daughter to see her Baba and kakus in vintage form. Should I tell her to change her plans or shift ours to Navami? wonders Dutta, a 42-year-old marketing manager by year and a Maddox Square addict by Puja.        
	Thats the power of Maddox Square  it makes teenagers out of grown men and it makes teenaged girls all grown-up.        
	And this year, the destination puja off Ballygunge Circular Road turns 75.        
	In keeping with its for-the-young-and-young-at-heart identity, the pujas platinum year was ushered in on Panchami evening by the sarod strings of Amaan Ali Khan.        
	According to Subir Mitra, who has been associated with the puja for five decades, Amaan was an obvious choice for the shubha suchana (auspicious beginning). Amaan is the most talented sarod player of the young generation. And Maddox Square is all about youth  even old men turn young here, laughed the silver-haired man from Maddox.        
	Had the son of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan heard of the Maddox Square magic earlier? Last year I was passing by during Puja and someone told me this was the most prestigious pandal in Calcutta. I am honoured to play here, also because my music is the best way I can pay my tribute to Ma Durga Im not good with words, smiled Amaan, upping the pujas cool quotient in a blue silk kurta, black embroidered uttariya on one shoulder.        
	Earlier in the evening, looking at the hectic Panchami pace of the nip-and-tuck army at work on the sprawling 6,500sq ft pandal, it was difficult to imagine that the Maddox Square puja didnt even begin at Maddox Square. In 1935, the puja by the Ballygunge Durga Puja Samiti was held in a house. From the second year, the puja shifted to the greens, and eventually redefined the landscape of Durga Puja in south Calcutta.        
	Pujo-te Maddox ashbo na? came the surprised reply when a bunch of little big schoolgirls from Garia were asked why they had chosen to drop by at the pandal on Tuesday. Another group  a little older  was more matter of fact. Maddox Square is a must-be destination on Ashtami evening. Today we just felt like a pre-adda session, said Madhurima Saha, a second-year student of Asutosh College and a second-generation Maddox Square devotee.         
	Old-timers speak fondly of the years before celebrity-dom too. Ours was always a traditional para puja. We became the talking point in 1985, when we celebrated our golden jubilee. That was the first time Asian Paints awarded the Sharad Samman and we won. Things have been different since then, said Mitra.                          
	In Mitras childhood memories of the puja, the protima was not ekchala, nor was the Goddess decked out in daak-er saaj. We adopted the ekchala model in 1960, the 25th year of the puja. In keeping with the silver jubilee theme, the daak-er saaj was silver. In 1985, the colour changed to golden, which we have continued.        
	But for 30-year-old Supratim Bhattacharya, its the jibonto protimas (live beauties) that are the bigger draw. I have to admit that I have seen the most beautiful girls at Maddox Square, he smiled sheepishly, even as his friends hooted him out. Hes been looking for love at Maddox Square for the past 12 years. No luck so far, quipped a friend.        
	If Maddox Square is synonymous with all-night addas and reunion ground for long-lost friends, for many its also the pull of tradition. Our purohit, Amal Chattopadhyay (fondly called Pinu Thakur by one and all), I must say, is quite portly. But he dances for an hour before the deity during evening arati on the Puja days. Many come just to watch him, pointed out a member of the organising committee.         
	And for 24-year-old Abhirup Chatterjee, who has worked for the puja ever since he can remember, its the para feeling that brings him home from Mumbai every autumn.

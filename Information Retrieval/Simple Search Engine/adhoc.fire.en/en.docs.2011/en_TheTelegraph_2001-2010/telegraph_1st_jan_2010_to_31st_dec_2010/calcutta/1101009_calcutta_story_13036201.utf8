                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Twin heists at retail stores 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Thieves broke into two retail outlets at Phoolbagan and Kankurgachhi on Thursday night and walked away with cash totalling over Rs 2.5 lakh.        
	The bigger heist occurred at a Koutons showroom in Kankurgachhi where a gang stole Rs 1.85 lakh. The theft came to light on Friday morning when the staff turned up to open the store.        
	The money stolen was the proceeds of Wednesday and Thursday. Wednesdays collection was lying in the store as Thursday was bank holiday because of Mahalaya, said Indrajit Nag, a partner of the showroom.        
	Subrata Karmakar, a cashier at the store, sensed something amiss at 9.45am when he found the shops shutters bent. He rushed in and searched the drawers but could not find the cash, added Nag.        
	The shop employs 26 people. It was around 10pm when the last employee left the shop on Thursday.        
	In the other incident, around Rs 52,000 was stolen from a Reebok store on CIT Road in Phoolbagan.        
	Police suspect the thieves had sneaked in someone after slightly bending the bottom of the shutter.        
	The shop closed on Thursday around 9.30pm.We store shoes and garments but not a single item was stolen. Only the cash is gone, store manager Ranjit Das said.        
	Officers from the detective department who visited the stores feel local youths were behind the thefts.        
	In both shops, the shutters had locks on the two sides but there was none in the middle. Thieves seem to have bent the shutters after thrusting a rod in the middle. We appeal to all shop owners to put a lock in the centre as well, said an officer.

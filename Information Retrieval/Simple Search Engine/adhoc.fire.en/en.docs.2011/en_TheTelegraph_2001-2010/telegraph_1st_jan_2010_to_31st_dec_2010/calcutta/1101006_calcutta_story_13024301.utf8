                      Urban images                    In tune with the notion that art is an imitation of life, contemporary city-based artists have developed a style that reflects the troubles and confusions of life in the city. Full of typically urban imagery, the works reinforce their statements through contradiction. Extend Beyond, the ongoing group show by five artists, displays a melange of moods and expressions that is essentially urbane. The works present disjointed sketches of life in an attempt to literally transcribe the constant antithesis and discontinuity that are very much a part of it. Ashis Chakraborty paints everyday images, laced with a hint of satire. Santanu Mitra dwells on the concept of violence and its impact on the daily life of the common man. Sumantra Mukherjee expresses his despair at the predicament of modern youth with their absurd mannerisms. While Chinmay Mukherjees multi-layered impressions are symbolic of social decadence, Puspen Roys figurative works betray nostalgia for the past and hope for the future.                    Event: An exhibition of new works by a group of five artists When: Till October 12 (except Sunday and holidays); 11 am - 7 pm; Monday, 3 pm - 7 pm Where: Studio21, 17L Dover Terrace, Ph: 24866735

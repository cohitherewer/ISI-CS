                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      2 dead in daylight battle
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A battle with bombs and bullets between two gangs in Chitpur left two men dead and four injured on Tuesday morning.        
	The windshields of several lorries were smashed during the two-hour battle between the gangs led by Afzal and Afsar.         
	As the situation spiralled out of control, senior officers from Lalbazar as well as Rapid Action Force personnel rushed to the site.        
	Officers said Afzal and Afsar were old rivals, each taking turn in calling the shots over loading and unloading of materials at the Chitpur railway yard and parking of trucks on Cossipore Road.        
	Trouble started brewing a few days ago when Afsar was hit by a speeding vehicle. His gang-members alleged that the mishap had been plotted by Afzal, who wanted to get rid of his rival.        
	On Tuesday morning, some of Afsars men went to an area controlled by Afzal and smashed the windscreens of several trucks.        
	Afsars men retaliated immediately. Both sides fired and threw bombs at each other. That was around 9.10am, when many of us were preparing to leave for our offices, said a resident.        
	A bomb landed on Akbar Ali, one of Afzals associates. He died on the spot. Minutes later, a bullet hit Mohammed Ekram, one of Afsars men. He died while being taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.        
	Shops immediately downed their shutters and people scurried to safety.        
	The area was deserted by 9.30am, by when four persons had been injured.        
	We have detained 34 people. Efforts are on to track down the remaining culprits, said Biswarup Ghosh, the deputy commissioner of police, north.

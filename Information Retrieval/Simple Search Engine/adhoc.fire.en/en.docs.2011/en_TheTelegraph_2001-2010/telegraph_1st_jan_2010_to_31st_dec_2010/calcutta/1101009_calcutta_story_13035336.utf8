	The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, will arrive in Calcutta, the first stop in his two-week mission of goodwill in India, on Saturday morning.         
	The highest-ranking non-royal in the UK will spend three days in the city. He will be accompanied by the Bishop of Pontefract, Tony Robinson, the archbishops personal chaplain, press officer, secretary for international development and others. The team will put up at The Oberoi Grand.         
	Williams is the principal leader of the Church of England and the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion apart from being a member of the House of Lords.        
	He will tour Mother House on Saturday. A reception dinner at St Johns Diocesan Girls High School, where the archbishop will unveil a memorial plaque, will follow.        
	On Sunday, the archbishop will attend a Eucharist service at St Peters Church in Behala, have lunch at Oxford Mission and attend a thanksgiving service at St Pauls Cathedral.         
	On Monday, Williams, a scholar in theology, will attend a contextual theology seminar at Bishops College before leaving for Ranchi. He will return to the city on October 13 for a tour of Serampore College.        
	The archbishops wife, Jane Williams, who was born and brought up in Thiruvananthapuram, will join him during the latter half of his trip in south India.

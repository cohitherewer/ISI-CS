          OUR BUREAU                           ONLY THE LONELY: One of the three final-year engineering students of Jadavpur University who were allowed by the students union to write supplementary papers sits alone in an exam hall on Friday.

	A CPM-perfected coercion technique cloaked in peaceful protest was used to maximum effect by engineering students on the Jadavpur University campus on Friday, preventing the entire first and third-year batches from writing their semester exams.        
	The Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu) carried out its threat to boycott the exams despite the authorities warning students that they stood to lose a year if they didnt turn up for the semester tests.         
	Those who did try entering the exam halls on both the Jadavpur and Salt Lake campuses were forced to back off by the sight of union members squatting in front of those buildings. It was, as a third-year student pointed out, a form of coercion without appearing so.         
	The official union line was, of course, that the boycott was a spontaneous one.         
	Fetsu has called for the boycott to pressure the university authorities into withdrawing an FIR against 35 students who had clashed with police while trying to prevent chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee from leaving the campus on November 9.         
	Officials said only three examinees wrote Fridays papers. All three are final-year students sitting for their supplementary examinations, which apparently exempts them from Fetsus writ.         
	This is the first time that not a single student could write a semester exam on the first day, said a senior university official.         
	So would the exams be postponed now? University officials declared that the twin semester tests would run their course as scheduled.        
	Fetsu leaders insisted that the boycott would continue. Manmatha Ray, a fourth-year student, said: The vice-chancellor had claimed only around 100 students wouldnt turn up, but not one out of the 1,600-odd students in the two batches wrote the exams. We are confident about the boycott continuing till the end, he added.        
	Many students were in wait-and-watch mode in the vicinity of their departments through the morning, hoping for a breakthrough that never came. We had come prepared to write the first days exam, just in case the boycott call was withdrawn at the last moment, said a third-year student of the electronics engineering department.        
	In many ways, the mood among the students was like that of Calcuttans on a bandh day  some staying back home fearing trouble, a few ready to take a chance and venturing out and the rest happy to enjoy an unscheduled holiday.         
	A section of guardians who had accompanied their wards to the campus later filed a written complaint with the vice-chancellor about students being prevented from entering the exam halls.        
	The second-semester exams are scheduled to start on Saturday.        
	Fetsu members are trying to convince those apprehensive about losing an academic year that a continued spontaneous boycott would force the authorities to blink.        
	An SMS campaign is apparently underway to convince everyone to voluntarily boycott the exams. The authorities will be forced to conduct a re-examination or a special examination, said a Fetsu member.        
	A supplementary in even one paper during the four-year engineering course disqualifies a student from passing with honours. In 2008, the entire graduating batch didnt pass with honours because they had boycotted a semester test in 2005 to protest the executive councils recommendation to expel five students on charges of indiscipline.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hopes charred in chaotic end   Short-lived joy of job

	Pompa Chatterjee, Ruhi Parveen and Bhagyashree Dhali were not just close friends but also had their fate twined.        
	The three joined Microsys Technical Enterprises at Stephen Court together three days ago and none could escape the blaze that had engulfed the Park Street landmark building on Tuesday afternoon.        
	They were so happy after getting the job but the joy proved short-lived, cried Bhagyashrees mother Prabhati Dhali, a resident of the New Market area. The only child of her widowed mother, the 19-year-old took up the job to support Prabhati.        
	Pompa called up friend Suman Haldar, an engineer, around 2.14pm on Tuesday saying a blaze had engulfed the fourth floor of Stephen Court. She was crying for help. Her voice was cracking. She spoke to me for over five minutes, saying the office was dark and had been filled with black fumes, recalled Suman.        
	Aami aar bachbo na, the 21-year-old murmured over her cellphone after Suman repeatedly asked her to rush out of the building. Father Debasish Chatterjee, a Bombay-based musician, said Pompa had called him on Tuesday morning asking when he would visit Calcutta next.        
	Ruhis father Iqbal Hussain was yet to come to terms with the death of his 20-year-old younger daughter. I had spent everything on educating Ruhi and her sister Farha. Ruhi wanted to work and be on her own, said the Topsia resident, unable to fight back tears.        
	Sayan Sengupta, another victim of the killer blaze, was the life of any party. The ever-smiling commerce graduate from City College was a film and music buff who loved hanging out with friends, took part in para pujas and attended live concerts. Everything that any 22-year-old loves to do.        
	On March 16, Sayan also cracked his second job: he switched to Microsys Technical Enterprises as sales executive from Wipro. The Black Sabbath and Fossils fan was happy about this change.         
	On March 23, Sayan left his home at Central Park in Jadavpur for work without any forewarning of the disaster. Almost 14 hours later, his charred body arrived at the Emergency of SSKM Hospital.        
	Mainak Mukherjee, a friend of Sayans and his immediate boss, Agnivo Bose, got news of the fire in the building almost as soon as it started. I reached the spot around 2pm. Agnivo had come out of the building but he told me that eight Microsys employees  who opted to go down the buildings main staircase  were missing, including Shonai (Sayans pet name). We were all trying to call Shonai but could not get through to him, recalled Mainak.        
	Father Sanjay Sengupta, a businessman who was on tour in Malda, had been trying to get in touch with his elder son, but to no avail.

                      Creativity and national duty                    The income tax collected by Government of India is ploughed back for national development. In other words, taxes paid by the public help create and build a nation involving multi-dimensional creative energies. Thus, it was considered appropriate to begin the Departments 150 years celebrations with an art workshop featuring leading names of the Indian art scene. Based on the theme, Building the Nation through Income Tax, the two-day workshop was held on July 12 and 13. Over 30 eminent artists, including Amitabha Sengupta, Anita Roy Choudhury, Asit Poddar, Dhiraj Choudhury, Dwijen Gupta, Dipali Bhattacharjee, Jogen Chowdhury, Niranjan Pradhan, Prokash Karmakar, Partha Pratim Deb, Sunil Das, Shyamashree Basu, Suman Chowdhury, Tapas Sarkar, Tarak Garai and Wasim Kapoor took part in it. The paintings and sculptures created at the workshop have been put on show at a two-day exhibition, ending today. The workshop-cum-exhibition has been curated by Dhiraj Choudhury. Thereafter, on All India Income Tax Day (July 24), Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee will inaugurate an exhibition of these paintings and sculptures works at the AIFACS, New Delhi, to be followed by similar exhibitions in other metropolitan cities.

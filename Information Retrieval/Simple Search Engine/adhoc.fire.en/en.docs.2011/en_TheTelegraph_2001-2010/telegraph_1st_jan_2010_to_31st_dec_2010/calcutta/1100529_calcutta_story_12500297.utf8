The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Relief over CBSE grades
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Relief over CBSE grades
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The results of CBSE Class X board examinations drew many smiles and a few frowns from students on Friday as the board for the first time replaced marks with grades.        
	The move by the Central Board of Secondary Education was aimed at reducing stress and anxiety among students and guardians.         
	Most students appeared relieved. I was confident of scoring A1 in most of the subjects. I had no tension about whether I would score 91 per cent or 95 per cent, smiled Kunal Pathak of Apeejay School, Salt Lake.        
	Under the new system, students are awarded grades on a nine-point scale for each subject. The grade point when multiplied by 9.5 gives an approximate percentage in the subject.        
	Rita Chatterjee, the principal of Apeejay School, said: The grading system has put an end to unhealthy competition. Sometimes a child can go into depression if somebody else scores even 0.5 per cent more than him or her.         
	Those expecting high scores, however, seemed to be missing their moment under the spotlight. Thirteen girls from Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, who secured A1 grades (91 to 100 per cent marks) in all subjects were unhappy as they were unable to find out if they had scored full marks in any subject.        
	I think we should be awarded numerical marks along with grades, said a student of BD Memorial School.        
	The practice of declaring a student failed has also been discontinued by the board from this year.         
	Those securing grade D (33 to 40 per cent) and above in all subjects are eligible for admission to Class XI. Students with E1 and E2 grades (21 and below) will be allowed to take additional tests to improve their performance.

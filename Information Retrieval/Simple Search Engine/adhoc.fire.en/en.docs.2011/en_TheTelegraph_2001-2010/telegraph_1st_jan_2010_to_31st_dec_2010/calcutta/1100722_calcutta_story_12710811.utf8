The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The sari saga, at home amp; on stage
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      The sari saga, at home amp; on stage
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE AND SAIONEE CHAKRABORTY                          Mamata at home before the rally. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	When Mamata Banerjee breezed in at 1.45pm on a muggy Wednesday afternoon to rule the martyrs day stage, her sea of supporters at Esplanade rose as one and Sharbari Datta sat up and took notice in her Broad Street home.        
	Quite an unusual choice for Mamata Banerjee, the designer later told Metro, about the Trinamul leaders eye-catching sari on the big day.        
	I have never seen her in anything but a Dhanekhali but from what I could gather on TV, she chose an Orissa cotton mixed with silk drape, a typical Orissa weave. The narrow temple border was greenish-mustard.....The sari is very fashionable and elegant.        
	The designer would have found Mamata in a trademark crumpled Dhanekhali at home hours before emerging elegant at Esplanade. At 11.15am, she appeared at the door of 30B Harish Chatterjee Street to meet the family members of those who had died on July 21, 1993. That was her first martyrs day uniform.                        Mamata on stage at the rally. (Amit Datta)    
	A Dhanekhali draped in gharoa (homely) style with a white base and chiruni dure (comb pattern). The bi-colour border with a traditional naksha was a broad one in black and Prussian blue, is how Dutta described it.        
	At 1.25pm, Mamata rushed off in a black Santro draped in what lakhs of her supporters would see  and salute  her in. Was it a brand new one? No, said a family member, she has worn it once or twice in Delhi before.        
	At 4.40pm, Mamata breezed back home in the sari, only to emerge less than 30 minutes later in her morning Dhanekhali to greet supporters and stride into her office.        
	Her sari saga wore on.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fatal fall for zoo chimp
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fatal fall for zoo chimp
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A file picture of Jessy                                  
	A female chimpanzee of Alipore zoo swinging from one tree to another suffered a fatal fall on Thursday afternoon.        
	The post-mortem revealed that 22-year-old Jessy, who was brought from England along with her partner Teju in 1997, had suffered lung and liver injuries in the rare fall.        
	It was an unfortunate incident. Her right lung was ruptured and the liver, too, was damaged, said zoo director Raju Das. A chimp usually lives for 25-30 years.        
	With Jessys death, the zoo now has three chimps left  Teju, Babu and Rani.        
	An official said this was the first instance at the zoo of a primate falling to its death while swinging from one tree to another. Jessys death is strange because tree-hopping is as natural for primates as swimming is for fish, said an official.        
	Director Das said Jessy was physically fit. She only had a wound on her left shoulder which resulted from bites by her partner. The injury was being treated.        
	Jessy was buried on the zoo premises in the evening. The body was hurriedly removed from the spot where Jessy fell to ensure that the other chimps, who were in their respective enclosures, did not get wind of it, said an official.        
	A doctor at the zoo said chimps, usually violent and aggressive, would become depressed when they lost their partners.        
	Visitors were not around when Jessy fell as the zoo remains closed on Thursday for the authorities to examine the animals and inspect the enclosures.        
	The zoo management was in the dock recently following the death of an injured elephant calf that was brought from Danton in West Midnapore after it got separated from its herd.

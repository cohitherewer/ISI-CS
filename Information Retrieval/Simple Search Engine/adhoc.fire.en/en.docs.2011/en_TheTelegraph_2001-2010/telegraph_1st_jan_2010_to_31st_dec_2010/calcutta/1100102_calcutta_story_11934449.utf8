The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fairs, plays and eye-openers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          Fairs, plays and eye-openers

	Paromita Naskar had never watched street theatre before. The Class VII student of Bagha Jatin Girls High School loved the staging of Dushtu Bagh by childrens theatre group Jhalapala, from Dum Dum.         
	For Nikhil Dassani, a Class VI student of Don Bosco Park Circus, the stall on ways of identifying fake medicines was an eye-opener.         
	Paromita and Nikhil were attending Bal Vividha, a festival on diverse approaches to learning, organised at Birla Industrial Technological Museum, along with NGOs Development Research Communication and Services Centre and Save the Children Fund, from December 3 to 6.         
	Inaugurated by actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty, it packed in a host of activities for children, including a fair, plays and workshops. It began with a discussion on education for sustainable development.         
	Dushtu Bagh, staged on December 4, was based on the fable of the caged tiger who is set free by a kind brahmin. But the tiger, in turn, tries to attack his rescuer. The festival also saw the staging of Asamajik, a play on ragging, by the Sabuj Pran group.         
	Nikhil was part of an educational trip by his school. The fair was my favourite part. I visited all the stalls, he said. He enjoyed origami, puppet-making with rags, decorative items made from discarded objects and a picture collage of old Calcutta.         
	Paromitas friend, Juhi Roy Chowdhury, was taken up by the fertiliser, Vermicompost, which uses live earthworms. I had no idea that the lowly earthworm also makes a good fertiliser, she said.         
	The school curriculum cannot fulfil all the requirements of a child. Education through demonstration, in the form of experiments, arouses interest in kids, said Chandita Mukherjee, the director of Mumbai-based organisation Comet Media Foundation. It came up with the idea of a theme-based educational festival almost a decade ago.         
	The festival also included workshops on subjects like public speaking and packing healthy tiffin for kids, targeted towards parents and children. I learned a lot from the workshop on project-based learning. I will try to implement some of the suggestions in my school, said Nandini Mondol, a geography teacher at Aditya Academy, Shyamnagar.

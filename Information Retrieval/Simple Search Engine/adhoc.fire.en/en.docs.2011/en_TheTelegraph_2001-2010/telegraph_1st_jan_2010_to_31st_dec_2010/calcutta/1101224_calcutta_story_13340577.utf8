          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A Calcutta High Court division bench on Thursday asked state chief secretary Samar Ghosh to file an affidavit within three weeks stating the steps the government was taking to run the Forensic Science Laboratory in Belgachhia properly.        
	Chief Justice J. Patel and Justice A.K. Roy passed the order after laboratory director Dhurjati Prasad Sengupta told the bench that more than 8,500 viscera tests were pending as there werent enough workers to carry them out. The sanctioned strength of subordinate staff is 112 but 56 posts are lying vacant. There are 61 posts of report officers, of which 29 are lying vacant, said the director.        
	Cops said investigation of thousands of cases is getting delayed because of the pending viscera tests. Viscera samples in important cases are tested before the pending ones.

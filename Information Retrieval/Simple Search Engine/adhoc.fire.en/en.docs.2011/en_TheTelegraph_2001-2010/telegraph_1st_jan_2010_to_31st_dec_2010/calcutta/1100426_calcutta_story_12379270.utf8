          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The police top brass doesnt have a complete list of illegal structures more than a month after the Stephen Court blaze as two deputy commissioners have not yet responded to an order from Lalbazar issued in the first week of April.        
	The Park Street tragedy that claimed 43 lives had prompted additional commissioner (I) K. Harirajan to write to all five divisional DCs and seek lists of illegal structures.        
	The DCs in charge of north and eastern suburban divisions have not yet complied with their seniors order while the list sent by DC (south) Supratim Sarkar has been dubbed flawed by the brass.        
	Sarkars list has not mentioned the names of the persons who own or occupy the illegal structures. There were only the names of the masons who built the structures, said an officer who refused to be named.        
	Sarkar was unavailable for comment, so was DC (eastern suburban division) Pallab Kanti Ghosh. Bishwarup Ghosh, DC (north), said his list would be sent in a couple of days.        
	The DCs in charge of central and port divisions are the only ones who have sent proper lists to the headquarters.        
	When asked about Sarkars faulty list, Harirajan said: This is a departmental issue and I wont discuss it.        
	Asked what the police had planned to do with the list of illegal structures, the additional commissioner said: I am yet to receive the lists from all divisions. Once they reach us, we will act according to law.        
	A meeting after the Stephen Court fire revealed that of the 400 illegal structures the cops had alerted the civic body about, only 70 had been demolished. The rest still stand. The CMC has not even sought our help in tearing down the buildings, said another officer.        
	In 2009, the police has sent a list of 350 unauthorised buildings to the CMC. We were shocked to learn that not even 30 structures were pulled down, the officer added.        
	Harirajan said the police were ready to assist the civic body in its drive against illegal construction. Now it depends on the CMC....

                      Maid of honour                    The latest in-house production by Spandan, Sakubai is a poignant and powerful play that celebrates the grit and moral strength of the downtrodden, neglected and needy women of our society who must fight against odds in their daily struggle for survival. Its eponymous protagonist Sakubai is the ubiquitous working-woman, who hails from the lowest rung of the social ladder. She is projected as the good old kaamwali bai, an indispensable figure in the average Indian household. She is a woman who puts on a brave face despite the troubles that come her way. She finds solace in managing her mistress household efficiently while narrating the story of her life to the audience. Violated, dispossessed and uprooted, she has experienced grave trials and tribulations in her personal life. However, her powers of endurance, her sense of humour, her innate courage and integrity ultimately triumph in this highly-charged script, which also displays a wide range of emotions, reactions, moods and situations. Drama: Nadira Zaheer Babbar. Adapted and directed by Ashok Singh. Solo performance: Renu Roy.                    Event: Play in Hindi, Sakubai, produced by Spandan

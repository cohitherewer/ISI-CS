The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Salt Lake wards realigned
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Salt Lake wards realigned
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state election commission on Friday published the delimitation details for the Salt Lake municipal elections, tentatively scheduled for end-May. The changes could force prominent township leaders to switch wards.         
	Two new wards have been carved out of the 23 in the township as part of the delimitation process. The numbers of all the existing wards have changed.        
	According to the election rules, eight seats must be reserved for women and three for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe candidates, including one reserved for women. The reservation list is likely to be prepared by next week, said a senior election commission official.        
	Since reservation depends on the numbers of the wards, several councillors apprehend that they might have to contest from areas different from where they were elected.         
	The election commission had declared that the Salt Lake wards needed to be resized and two wards added to factor in the increase in population. It had also asked Bidhannagar Municipality to prepare a draft list.        
	The ruling Left Front board submitted the list to the election commission on February 9. Trinamul Congress councillors had termed the list unscientific and partisan.        
	We did not implement a single recommendation of the municipality in terms of ward numbering and ward boundary. The list was prepared keeping in mind the population, dwelling pattern, geography and economic considerations, said a commission official.        
	Left Front councillors expressed dissatisfaction with the list. We had numbered the wards according to the election commission guidelines, said Biswajiban Majumder, the municipality chairman.        
	The Trinamul hailed the election commissions list as the first step towards victory.

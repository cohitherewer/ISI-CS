The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Grown trees to replace cut ones
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Grown trees to replace cut ones
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A grown tree being planted at Kasba. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	A 15ft tall tree that had been cut off was, for the first time, replaced with two others of almost the same height as well as saplings in the city on Wednesday.        
	Bhupinder Pal Singh had cut down the Krishnachura in front of his Kasba shop on Tuesday after taking permission from the civic body. Under the supervision of civic experts, he planted two mature Krishnachuras around the spot where the felled tree once stood.        
	Saplings planted in the city often die because of various reasons. Grown trees have a better chance of survival, said an environmentalist.         
	The tree had been damaged last year and was posing a threat to pedestrians. While giving me permission to cut it, the CMC asked me to plant trees of similar size in addition to saplings, said Singh.        
	We will promote compensatory planting of mature trees. This is in addition to planting saplings as directed by the forest department (five times the trees cut), said Debasish Kumar, mayoral council member (parks and gardens).        
	Compensatory planting of mature trees is practised in states like Uttar Pradesh but had never been tried in Bengal, said Somenath Mukherjee, the conservator of forests.

	Anisha Agarwala slept in fits and starts on Tuesday night. I dreamt that my house was on fire and I was running for my life, said the Class VIII student of Loreto House, a stones throw from the scarred Stephen Court, on Wednesday.         
	A day after the fire, many of the schoolkids were still in shock. I dont know when I will be able to go to Flurys again, mumbled Anisha.         
	The mood at Loreto House was sombre on Wednesday. One girl started sobbing that she had seen a man falling down. There was so much panic. I saw swarms of people coming towards our school down Middleton Row, recalled Tanvi Kejriwal, another Class VIII student.         
	The girls started their day with a prayer for the victims of Tuesdays tragedy. Attendance was low and those who came entered through the Middleton Street gate.         
	I didnt send my daughter to school because I didnt want her to see the gutted building and the closed outlets that we visit so often. I am afraid this incident will have a deep psychological impact on her since she is associated with Park Street so closely, rued the mother of a Loreto House student.         
	The scene was much the same at Loreto College, housed on the same campus.         
	A student of communicative English, Inez Jordan, said Tuesdays tragic scenes were constantly haunting her. Whatever I am doing  be it studying, eating or sleeping  the image of a woman falling to her death keeps coming back to me.         
	The girls of the Young Womens Christian Association, located right beside Stephen Court, had left on Tuesday. On Wednesday, a guard said a quarter of the occupants had returned. My mother insists that I return to Jamshedpur, said Debanjali Sengupta, a first-year student of Goenka College.         
	Our friends used to envy us that we live in one of the most coveted parts of Calcutta. But that has exposed us to a most horrifying experience, said her roommate, Anmona Chadiha.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      VIPs amp; watchers will Basu on
                                          
	The most powerful man in the country offering all possible medical help to a retired government employee praying for the recovery of his idol  Jyoti Basus battle has drawn a cross-section of visitors.        
	The former Bengal chief minister was admitted to AMRI Hospitals on January 1 and has been on the ventilator from early on January 6.        
	Metro kept vigil outside the Salt Lake hospital on Thursday to spot a steady stream of visitors and onlookers, VVIPs and passersby.        
	Prime Minister        
	Manmohan Singh reached AMRI just after 1pm, accompanied by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The rest of the convoy stopped outside, while the car carrying the PM and the CM went into the emergency section. He was inside for around 20 minutes, taking stock of Basus condition.        
	Finance minister        
	Pranab Mukherjee came with the PM but in a different car. He too stayed for around 20 minutes. Mum was the word.        
	Driver-cum-devotee        
	For Arun Sengupta, 50, Jyoti Basu is god. And he has been blessed with the chance to drive his god around for 20 years. Waiting quietly outside the hospital, Basus driver hasnt given up hope.        
	The last time I drove him was during the Bidhannagar Mela in 2009. Since he could not walk he sat in the car and I drove him around the ground. He was very nostalgic. I am hopeful that this year too I will drive him to the Mela, said Sengupta, fighting back tears.        
	Diehard fan        
	Suborno Kanti Banerjees world has revolved around his idol for decades. I have never missed any of Jyoti Basus public programmes, claims the retired central government employee, whose claim to fame among friends has been his ability to mimic the former chief ministers voice.        
	For the past few days, the 67-year-old resident of Patipukur in north Calcutta has been coming to the Salt Lake hospital to enquire about his condition and pray for his recovery. But he is beginning to lose hope. One has to go. That is the norm of nature, Suborno said on Thursday, choking on his words.        
	Left leaders        
	Brinda Karat was early to arrive, late to leave. There is nothing new to say, she said when asked about Basus medical condition. Her husband, Prakash Karat, joined her after Manmohan Singh had come and gone. The CPM general secretary didnt say a word.        
	Sitaram Yechury arrived in the morning and left only after Prakash Karat arrived. Jyotibabus condition is critical but stable, said Yechury.        
	Biman Bose followed Wednesdays script, urging people not to spread rumours. His condition has neither improved nor deteriorated, said the Left Front chairman.        
	Others included Shyamal Chakraborty, Mohd Salim, Benoy Konar, Rabin Deb, A.B. Bardhan and Manik Sarkar. Also seen was ex-Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee.        
	Opposition        
	Mamata Banerjee did not show up. Dinesh Trivedi was the Trinamul representative in the afternoon. As the health minister (of state) I am available 24 hours for any help that is required. Let me assure you that we are ready to bring in any medical expert if there is a requirement, he said.        
	In the evening, Saugata Roy paid a visit. I spoke to the doctors and his condition is the same, said the minister of state for urban development.        
	Family        
	Son Chandan Basu arrived before the PM and stayed on. His condition is neither improving nor deteriorating.... There is no question of moving him to AIIMS, he stressed.        
	Plus        
	From (acting) Bengal governor Devanand Konwar to Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi to CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya, there was a trickle of high-profile visitors.

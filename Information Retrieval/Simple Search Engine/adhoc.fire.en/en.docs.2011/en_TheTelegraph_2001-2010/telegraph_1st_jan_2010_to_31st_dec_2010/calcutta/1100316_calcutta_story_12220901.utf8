                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Car plan   at airport
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Vehicles approaching the domestic terminal of the airport would be divided into four lanes to prevent traffic congestion, under a plan to be put in place by the end of the week.        
	The two lanes closest to the terminal would be reserved for cars dropping off fliers. These vehicles would not be allowed to stop outside the arrival gate of the terminal.        
	The lane farthest from the terminal would be for cars picking up fliers. These vehicles would have to proceed to the car park. The preliminary plan suggests that fliers arriving at the airport would have to walk to the parking area to get into their cars.

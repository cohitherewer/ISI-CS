The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | ISI pact with UK campus
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      ISI pact with UK campus
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Indian Statistical Institute has entered into a research collaboration with the London School of Economics that will allow scholars to visit the British institute and participate in research projects.        
	Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee on Sunday announced the tie-up on the ISIs Calcutta campus. The pact will generate theoretical and empirical inputs for policies that will help economic planning in India, he added.         
	The agreement was signed in London on November 29 by Bimal Kumar Roy, director, ISI, and Andrew Farrell, director (finance and facilities), London School of Economics.        
	We are still working on the details but the tie-up will definitely allow ISI researchers, including those from Calcutta, to travel to LSE and conduct research with scholars there. This will give our researchers global exposure and increase their knowledge, Roy told Metro.         
	He felt the endeavour would increase the visibility of ISI students on the global arena.        
	Roy said this was the first formal tie-up between an Indian institute and the LSE, which is going to contribute Euro 100,000 for this research collaboration.        
	Mukherjee, who is the chairman of the council of the ISI, announced the association while declaring a tie-up between the institute and Tezpur University in Assam for starting a north-eastern centre of the ISI.        
	The centre will operate out of the Tezpur University campus for the next three years. It will then shift to a permanent 70-acre campus, to be built on land provided by the Assam government.        
	The finance minister said academic activities at the north-eastern centre would start from the coming academic year.        
	Roy said the ISI would initially offer a one-year postgraduate diploma in statistical methods with applications at the north-eastern centre.

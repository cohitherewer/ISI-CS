The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Land victims blame cops
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Land victims blame cops
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The Mondal family of Rajarhat has put down police inaction as a principal reason behind the suicide of Prankrishna Mondal, who was allegedly duped by a cartel of land brokers and buyers.        
	The 79-year-old mans body was found hanging by the branch of a mango tree in his orchard adjoining Action Area III of Rajarhat on Wednesday morning.         
	My father was cheated in a land deal. We had lodged a complaint with New Town police station in December 2009 (general diary no. 608) about the forgery, but the cops did not take any action. My father had lost all hope and so he took his life, Chittaranjan Mondal, the elder son of Prankrishna, told Metro on Thursday afternoon.        
	The general diary had apparently accused Nirbhoy Merchant Pvt Ltd of cheating Prankrishna into signing a sale deed for an 18-acre plot in Baligori Mouza when he thought he was signing the sale deed for a one-cottah plot at Chakpachuria Mouza.        
	We had followed up with the police but they did not carry out any investigation, said Chittaranjan, waiting at the RG Kar hospital morgue for his fathers body.         
	According to the rulebook, the cops should have drawn up an FIR on the basis of the complaint and checked with the land reforms department about the ownership of the plot in question.        
	If the company was found guilty of duping the old man, the company and its officials could have been booked for cheating and forgery. The probe could have been done in less than two weeks, said a lawyer of the Barasat court.        
	With the cops not initiating any probe, the Mondal family moved the Barasat court after one-and-a-half months to prevent the company from taking possession of the land, around 4km down an arterial road from the Action Area I stretch of the Rajarhat Expressway.        
	The family had obtained an injunction on the use of the property by the buyers and we had told them to inform us in case of any trouble or violation of the court order, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, refuting allegations of police inaction.        
	According to him, New Town police station has started a probe to check the veracity of the abetment charge levelled against Nirbhoy and its officials. Till late on Thursday, the cops could not contact any official of the company.

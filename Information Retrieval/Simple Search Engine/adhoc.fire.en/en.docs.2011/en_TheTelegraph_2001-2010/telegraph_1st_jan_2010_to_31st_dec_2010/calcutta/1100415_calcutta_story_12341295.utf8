The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Price spoiler on Poila
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Price spoiler on Poila
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                            
	Poila Baisakh has provided another upward push to the skyrocketing prices of fruits, flowers, vegetables and sweets in the city.         
	The Poila Baisakh menu is basically vegetarian. Since the Bengali New Year Day is auspicious for traders, they worship Ganesha and Lakshmi and distribute sweets. Hence, the prices of vegetables, flowers, fruits and sweets have gone up, said Taraknath Trivedi, the president of the Federation of Traders Organisations of Burrabazar.         
	Prices of vegetables, fruits and sweets have gone up between 20 and 60 per cent, he added.         
	According to shoppers, prices of sweets have gone up by Rs 1-2 per piece.         
	Prices of apples, grapes, bananas and cucumbers have gone up by 50 per cent since Sunday, said traders.        
	Garlands of jasmine and tube rose, sold for Rs 60 a dozen at the Mullickghat wholesale flower market last week, were priced Rs 20 each in flower shops across the city on Wednesday.         
	Even without Poila Baisakh, prices of most items are fluctuating daily. I have no idea about the reason behind the instability in prices, Shankar Gupta, a trader in New Market.

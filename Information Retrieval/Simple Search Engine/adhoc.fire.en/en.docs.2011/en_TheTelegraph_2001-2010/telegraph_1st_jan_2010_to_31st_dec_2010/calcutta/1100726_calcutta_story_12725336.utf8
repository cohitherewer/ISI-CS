The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll list deadline extended
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Poll list deadline extended
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The deadline for revision of electoral rolls has been extended from July 23 to July 30.        
	The decision was taken by the Election Commission of India, said Bengals chief electoral officer Sunil Gupta.        
	Sources said delay by election officials and low turnout of voters during the first fortnight of roll revision led to the extension of the deadline.         
	Metro had reported on Wednesday that state and central government employees deployed for the revision of rolls in the city had been turning up at least an hour and a half late on an average since the process started on July 9.        
	The extension is welcome. A fortnight is very little for addition, deletion and correction of names in the electoral rolls of a state, said an election official.        
	The revision of electoral rolls includes addition and deletion of names and making other necessary changes to the list.        
	More than 3 lakh employees from various government departments have been withdrawn from normal duty to revise the electoral rolls in around 60,000 centres across the state.        
	Each centre has an electoral registration officer heading the team. The officer will hand out registration forms and issue receipts on submission of the forms between 11am and 4pm from Mondays to Saturdays and between 10am and 5pm on Sundays.        
	Article 326 of the Constitution and Section 19 of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1950, states that a person must be at least 18 years of age on the first day of January of the year in which the list is being revised to enrol his name.

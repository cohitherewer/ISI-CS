          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 20-year-old man was arrested on Sunday after a German woman accused him and his friends of abusing her in a Lindsay Street bar on Saturday night.        
	Monty Shaw, who lives in Nilmony Halder Lane near New Market, and his friends had allegedly abused the complainant and another German woman during a tiff.         
	We have started a case of insulting the modesty of a woman through verbal abuse and arrested a youth. We are looking for his friends, said an officer of New Market police station.         
	Witnesses said the two visitors had a face-off with another group of youths moments before the incident. Around 9.30pm, a youth from that group fell on one of the women while handing over her purse, which had dropped on the floor. She complained, sparking a heated exchange.        
	Minutes after the first group walked out, a member of the second group of youths passed some comments. One of the women then lodged a complaint, said an officer.         
	By the time the cops turned up at the bar, the second group had left. Shaw was arrested from his residence later.        
	nFire: A fire broke out in a maze of electric wires near Lords Bakery on Prince Anwar Shah Road on Monday. Two tenders doused the flames.

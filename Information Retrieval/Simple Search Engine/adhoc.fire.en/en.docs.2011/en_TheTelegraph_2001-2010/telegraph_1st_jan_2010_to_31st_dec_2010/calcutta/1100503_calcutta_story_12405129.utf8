	The locksmith who allegedly killed 70-year-old widow Basanti Biswas in her Santoshpur flat on Friday has identified himself as Mohin Sheikh. The 35-year-old told the cops that he was a resident of Usti in South 24-Parganas. Investigators said on Sunday that he had not divulged any significant information.

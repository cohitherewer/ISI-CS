	Strains of Auld Lang Syne and Purano shei diner katha intermingled on Tagores birth anniversary in Shri Shikshayatans staging of Chakravyuh, about the fateful consequences of parents forcing their children to take part in reality shows and trying to live their dreams through them.         
	The MP Birla trophy, in its 16th edition this year, saw eight city schools competing on May 9 in Masquerade, the one-act play competition organised by South Point High School from the endowment of MP Birla Smarak Kosh at GD Birla Sabhagar.         
	Other events organised as part of South Points initiative included Perceptum, an inter-school creative writing competition, Q-Point, a quiz contest, and Satrangi, a singing competition.         
	The purpose behind the events is to give talented youngsters a chance and to provide them with a platform to showcase their talents, said principal Jayati Solomon.         
	The plays, a mix of originals and adaptations, were varied in subject matter. While Tota Kahini, by National High School for Girls, was a jab at the education system under an inefficient kings rule, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy (LSA) staged Life for Rent, about drug addiction among youngsters.         
	The effort that the teams put in was evident, said Jhuma Das, who had come to watch her daughter Chumkis performance in Tota Kahini.        
	Paraj Mathur of Birla High School for Boys was selected the best actor for his performance in Its A Mad, Mad World, about the insides of a lunatic asylum.         
	Harsha Chhatri from National High School for Girls was selected the best actress for her role as a wisecracking court jester who overhears the attempts of the other courtiers trying to educate a parrot. Though I felt a little nervous before my performance, I was more confident on stage, she smiled.        
	South Points The City Which Forgot Its Name won the first prize and a cash award of Rs 12,000 for their adaptation of Salman Rushdies Haroun and the Sea of Stories.         
	Birla High School for Boys came second, winning a cash award of Rs 8,000, while Shri Shikshayatan came third and won an award of Rs 5,000.         
	Delhi Public School, Mega City, won the Judges Choice award, for their play En-Rapport-In Harmony that showed how students struggle to survive in an unfriendly educational system.         
	As a nod to Tagores birth anniversary, Satrangi had an additional round, Gitanjali. The winners were The Heritage, South Point and Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan.        
	In Q-Point, the winners were South Point, Birla High School for Boys and La Martiniere for Girls. The winning teams received cash awards of Rs 12,000, Rs 8,000 and Rs 5,000, respectively.

	Bard rsquo;s Day  
	The junior section of Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, celebrated Rabindra Jayanti on May 6, with students participating in programmes including an extract from Tagore rsquo;s dance drama Chandalika. Teachers spoke to the tots about the induction of Tagore rsquo;s songs, Jana gana and Amar shonar Bangla, as the national anthems of India and Bangladesh.  
	Freedom amp; the child  
	The Rabindra Jayanti celebrations by Class V students of Birla High School for Boys on May 6 saw students put up an ensemble of song, dance, elocution and drama at the Vidya Mandir auditorium. The actors depicted the importance of freedom in a child rsquo;s life and the monotony of discipline in dramatisations of poems like Banabash. The day ended with inmates of old age home Kalyan Ashram, who had been invited for the programme, singing some of Tagore rsquo;s songs.

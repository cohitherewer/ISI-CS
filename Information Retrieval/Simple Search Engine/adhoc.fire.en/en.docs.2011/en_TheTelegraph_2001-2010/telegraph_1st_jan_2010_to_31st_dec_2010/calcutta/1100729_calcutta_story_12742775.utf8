The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tech tour for mall security
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tech tour for mall security
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta police on Wednesday convened a meeting of mall owners to introduce them to a computer programme that allows users to go on a virtual tour of a shopping complex.        
	The software, which facilitates rescue operations and reduces reaction time in an emergency, is in use at some malls in Mumbai.        
	Images of the parts of a mall depicting details like gates, windows and fire exits, are stitched together by the programme and stored so that users can take a virtual tour of the premises. This allows one to chalk out a plan of operation in a mall without making rounds of it, said joint police commissioner Vineet Goyel.        
	The software can be of immense help during any emergency like a fire or even in a hostage situation, he added.        
	At the Lalbazar meeting, representatives of a Mumbai-based software company demonstrated how the programme works.        
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti and municipal commissioner Arnab Roy attended the meeting along with representatives of the management of 17 malls.         
	Senior officers said while mere installation of the software would not enhance security in any way, it could be used to save lives in an emergency.         
	 Representatives of the mall owners raised questions about the cost of installation of the software and whether cops would help in any way in installing it.        
	Commissioner Chakrabarti urged the mall owners to consider using the technology.         
	The idea is unique. But there are unanswered questions about the cost of installation and post-sales service, said a mall owner after the meeting.

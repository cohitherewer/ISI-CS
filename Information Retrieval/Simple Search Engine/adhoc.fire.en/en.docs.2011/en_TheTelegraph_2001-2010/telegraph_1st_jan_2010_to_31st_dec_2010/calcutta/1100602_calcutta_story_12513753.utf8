The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Winds of change to cool Writers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Winds of change to cool Writers
          DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY      
	Split air-conditioners may yet achieve what the threat of strict punishment has failed to do: boost attendance at Writers Buildings.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta announced on a sultry Tuesday that the whole of Writers would soon be wired for cool comfort, giving in to employee protests that spread from floor to floor across the four-storeyed seat of power where files go cold irrespective of the weather.        
	We have taken note of the problems being faced by employees in working without air-conditioning in summer. Writers is more congested than it was some years ago, and that is adding to the heat, said Dasgupta, whose first-floor department witnessed a no-AC-no-work flash strike in the morning.         
	Employees of the correctional services department on the third floor, who had staged a demonstration last Wednesday demanding ACs, did a repeat later in the day.        
	The agitation for air-conditioning had begun early last month with PWD employees trooping out of their offices and refusing to return unless their offices were fitted with ACs. The strike apparently drew PWD minister Kshiti Goswamis sympathy, who promptly got five 1.5 ton split ACs installed in the three rooms where his team sits.        
	If the PWD employees are working in air-conditioned offices, why should we be suffering? demanded a judicial department employee on the same floor as the Celsius rose a notch above normal at 36.2 degrees maximum and humidity hovered between 62 and 88 per cent.        
	Minister Dasgupta insisted that the decision to install ACs in all offices at Writers in phases was not a knee-jerk reaction to Tuesdays protests. We have had this in mind for quite some time, he said.        
	Chief secretary Ardhendu Sen and home secretary Samar Ghosh had gone around Writers while the city was voting in the municipal polls on Sunday to gauge the heat on different floors and draw up an air-conditioning plan, sources said.        
	PWD minister Goswami said he would speak to CESC officials on Wednesday to find out the technical implications of installing ACs in all the offices. I am told two large rooms are required for a transformer, which is difficult to find in Writers. Moreover, the entire wiring would need to be changed, he added.         
	Goswami met representatives of a private company dealing in air-conditioning equipment on Tuesday to seek their suggestions.         
	Finance minister Dasgupta said the cost of air-conditioning Writers would be huge but declined to cite a figure. I have asked my officials to draw up an estimate, he added.        
	So would air-conditioning finally solve the problem of low attendance and poor work culture at Writers? The attendance rule that came into effect last year has long been forgotten. ACs might make employees stay in office but can it make them work? The cool air might just lull them to sleep better, smiled a retired Writers employee.        
	The general secretary of the Left-affiliated State Co-ordination Committee, Ananta Banerjee, said: We are opposed to such luxuries in principle but ACs will make it easier to work in summer.        
	His counterpart in the Trinamul-backed Federation of Secretariat Employees, Sanket Chakraborty, slammed the government for making employees suffer for 34 years and said they would believe the ACs when they saw them.        
	The Trinamul of course would not like the Left to claim credit for any winds of change blowing in Writers.              
	THE AC EFFECT        
	1) Can push up attendance        
	2) Can boost time spent in office        
	3) Can reduce number and duration of tea and cigarette breaks        
	4) Can rob employees of one pet grouse        
	5) Can ensure sounder sleep in office

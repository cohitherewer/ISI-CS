  - Trinamul and CPM race to felicitate CWG winners while their teammate copes with injury alone         RITH BASU                        Mamata Banerjee with Commonwealth Games medal winners at the felicitation organised by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation last week. Picture by Pradip Sanyal				                                       
	A race has begun in the city after the curtain came down on the Commonwealth Games in Delhi. The Trinamul Congress and the CPM are the runners in this race and the young players who did us proud in the games the batons, being passed on from one felicitation stage to another.        
	Ninety per cent of the many felicitations attended by the games medal winners have been organised or patronised by leaders of either Trinamul or the CPM. Heres a running commentary of the felicitation race.        
	Date war        
	In this pre-election season of first-time felicitations  like the one for Santosh Trophy footballers  table tennis player Poulomi Ghatak, who won a silver and a bronze in the CWG, came to know from a newspaper on October 21 that the state government would felicitate her and her teammates on November 2.         
	Trinamul negated the governments first-mover advantage by announcing a CMC programme on October 28.         
	Heres a list of felicitations with political colour.        
	October 21: Trinamul-run Siliguri Municipal Corporation felicitates local boy Subhajit Saha, who won the mens doubles gold and mens team bronze.         
	Score: Trinamul 1  CPM 0        
	October 25: Siliguri MLA and minister Asok Bhattacharya felicitates Subhajit  on behalf of the sports and youth welfare department, Darjeeling district and Siliguri-Jalpaiguri Development Authority.        
	Score: Trinamul 1  CPM 1        
	October 26: Indian Railways felicitates its employees who won medals in the CWG in Delhi.        
	Score: Trinamul 2  CPM 1        
	October 28: The CMC felicitates CWG medal-winners from Bengal and other homegrown sports stars.        
	Score: Trinamul 3  CPM 1        
	November 2: West Bengal government to felicitate CWG medallists from Bengal        
	Score: Trinamul 3  CPM 2        
	November 2: A pro-Left TV channel to felicitate CWG medallists from Bengal.        
	Score: Trinamul 3  CPM 3         
	CWG 2010 medallists Subhajit and Soumyadeep Roy were part of the team that won gold at CWG 2006 in Melbourne. The womens team, which included Poulomi and Mouma Das, had won the bronze then.        
	None of the paddlers remembers being felicitated.        
	Money matters        
	The state government has promised Rs 5 lakh for gold, Rs 3 lakh for silver and Rs 2 lakh for bronze.         
	CMC pays Rs 5 lakh for gold, Rs 4 lakh for silver and Rs 3 lakh for bronze at Town Hall on Sunday.        
	Score: Trinamul 1  CPM 0        
	Everyone knows that everything turns into political rivalry in this state. For once, this is to our advantage. I dont mind if there are more felicitations and more money for us. We (sportspersons) have limited shelf life, so we can do with a golden period like this, said a medal winner.        
	Fishing beyond        
	Along with the CWG medal winners, the CMC felicitated swimmer sisters Rashmi and Richa Sharma (Rashmi crossed the English Channel thrice; she also crossed the Gibraltar Strait with her sister in 2009), disabled athlete Prabir Sarkar (Para-Olympics long jumper, six-time national champion who won silver in the Busan Asiad) and Amrita Das (crossed the English Channel earlier this year). They were given Rs 2 lakh each.         
	These sportspersons have been doing a great job over the years and have not got their due, so we thought we should felicitate them as well. We carefully chose deserving candidates, said mayor Sovan Chatterjee.         
	On November 2, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will felicitate only the CWG medal winners at Rabindra Sadan.        
	Score: Trinamul 1  CPM 0        
	The challenge        
	Lorte parle lorun, dhorte parle dhorun (fight us if you can, catch us if you can), Mamata had thundered during her speech at Town Hall on Thursday, addressing an invisible adversary at a programme to salute sporting excellence.         
	Vision thakle mission thake, aar na hole inaction thake (If you have vision, then you will have a mission, otherwise there is only inaction), she added, trying to merge politics with sports.        
	Score: Trinamul 1  CPM 0        
	Power play         
	Both parties sought to play down the election connection of the felicitations.        
	The mayor claimed the prize money, inviting players other than CWG medallists and holding felicitations three days before the state government had nothing to do with politics.        
	Sports minister Kanti Ganguly said: We had announced the prize money and the date of the felicitation on Sashthi, October 13, and have not changed plans since. If everyone else is also giving the players prizes, it is good for them.        
	Players point        
	The long-neglected sports stars are enjoying their moment in the sun.        
	Its good that we are finally getting attention and accolades. We have a felicitation to attend almost every day. This is quite overwhelming, said Mouma.         
	This recognition will definitely motivate us ahead of the Asian Games (starting in Guangzhou, China, on November 12), said archer Dola Banerjee.

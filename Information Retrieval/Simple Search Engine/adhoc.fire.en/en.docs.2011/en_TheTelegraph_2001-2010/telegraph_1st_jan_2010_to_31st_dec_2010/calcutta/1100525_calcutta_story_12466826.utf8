The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Map hurdle in key projects 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Map hurdle in key projects 
          SUBHAJOY ROY                          The VIP Road-EM Bypass flyover is one of the projects delayed by lack of a map of underground utilities                                  
	Lack of detailed maps showing the layout of cables and pipes under the ground is delaying several big-ticket projects in the city.        
	Construction of flyovers on Vivekananda Road and between VIP Road and the EM Bypass, laying of drainage lines under the Calcutta Environmental Improvement Project (CEIP) and East-West Metro are some of the projects delayed by the absence of maps of underground utilities.        
	Engineers feel they could have completed these projects quicker if they knew where exactly electricity, telephone and broadband lines and drainage, water and gas pipes were below the ground.        
	One of the major reasons behind projects getting delayed is the unavailability of detailed underground utility maps, said a senior official of CEIP.        
	According to engineers, the maps that are available are not detailed enough. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) gave us a map of the brick sewer under Vivekananda Road. Many of the links to individual houses were not on the map, said an engineer working on the 2.2km-long flyover from the Girish Park crossing.         
	We had to dig trial trenches to locate the utilities under the ground before starting work. With a detailed underground utilities map in hand, we could have saved at least a month and a half, added the engineer.         
	The CEIP project on Biren Roy Road (West) in Behala was delayed by 18 months as the underground utility maps available did not have the required information, said a CEIP official.         
	We started the project in mid-2006 and wanted to finish it within 18 months. There were many electricity and water lines under the road. CESC gave us a detailed map of the high-tension line transmitting electricity between 6KV and 132KV. But the low-tension lines, between 220volt and 440volt, were not clearly shown. Similarly, we had no information about the water pipes under the road, added the official.        
	The project set to connect the eastern and the western fringes of the city  the 14.5km-long East-West Metro from Sector V to Howarh Maidan  faces a similar hurdle.        
	The problem is not new. When we had worked for the Metro Railway project in the 1980s, we didnt get any underground utility map, said an official of Afcons Infrastructure Ltd, which has bagged the work on the stretch between Central and Howrah Maidan stations.        
	This time too we asked the water and drainage departments of the CMC for a map of the underground utilities during the tender process last year, but they couldnt give us one, added the official.        
	Nearly 9km of the project, including six stations, will be underground.        
	However, Calcutta Metro Railway Corporation, the consortium looking after the East-West Metro project, denied any delay. We did not face any problem regarding underground utilities, said Tarun Kumar, the chief engineer (civil) of the consortium.        
	The civic authorities admitted to the problem. The CMC had received a UK grant for its capacity building programme in 2006.        
	A part of the grant was for drawing a map of underground and other utilities using the geographical information system (GIS), said a senior CMC official.        
	In the GIS, a satellite picture is first taken and then physically verified. We have been able to complete physical verification in wards 1 to 30. The company that had been awarded the tender decided not to do the work for the rest of the wards, said the official.        
	The underground utility maps can be readied only after satellite images are physically verified in all the wards. It is difficult to say when the map would be ready, added the official.

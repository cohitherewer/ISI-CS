The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Oil spills as barge drowns
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Oil spills as barge drowns
          JAYANTA BASU                               
	A pusher tug, a small barge that propels a bigger vessel, drowned in the Hooghly near Prinsep Ghat on Friday night, releasing oil into the river.        
	Attempts to salvage barge Bhagadutta, owned by the Assam government, might start from Monday, Calcutta Port Trust officials said.        
	The barge drowned near Prinsep Ghat and the Man o War jetty, upstream to Vidyasagar Setu. We have located the exact point of the wreck, which is away from the navigation channel, said a port trust official.        
	The River Traffic Police, which inspected the spot first after being alerted by the barge crew, have informed the state pollution board that a huge amount of oil was seen floating in the water.        
	The port trust official ruled out any large-scale damage to the riverine eco-system, but the pollution control board, which has collected water samples for test, was not so certain.        
	We can comment on the impact of the oil spill on the environment only after analysing the samples, said Shyamal Adhikary, a senior engineer of the board who supervised an inquiry into the effect of the leak.        
	Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the pollution control board, said: As there has been a spill, there is bound to be some pollution in the river which can affect the aquatic life. We can discuss about remedial action after the test report comes.

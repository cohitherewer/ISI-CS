The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain-a-day month fails monsoon test
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rain-a-day month fails monsoon test

	Calcutta is in the red on the monsoon meter despite a sprinkling of rain almost every day over the past month.         
	According to the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, it has rained on 25 out of 35 days this season but not enough to make for a normal monsoon month.         
	On 17 of these days, the Met office recorded less than 5mm of rain. July has been the bigger contributor to the deficit than June with as many as 14 days of less than 5mm of rain.        
	Even last monsoon, the worst for Calcutta in 37 years, July was the wettest month of the season. The total rainfall was 388.1mm with 20 rainy days. This July, we have already had 14 rain days but only 92.3mm of rain, a Met official said.        
	The July average for Calcutta on the rain gauge is 331.8mm over 16.8 rainy days. Going by this trend, the city should have received around 350mm of rain since the onset of monsoon on June 13, but the count reads 313.1mm.         
	Usually, the city receives nearly 260mm of rain over 12 rainy days in June. But with over 80mm of pre-monsoon showers before the onset of the season, the June performance was satisfactory. July has been disappointing so far, said an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Delhi.         
	The July figures are likely to look dismal even if it pours for the remainder of the month, according to a scientist of the National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting in Noida. There has been so little rain in the first fortnight of July that even if it rains normally in the second half, the total rainfall in Calcutta this month is likely to be below par, he said.        
	So wont a dismal July also spoil the end-of-the-season statistics? Two months of possible heavy rain still lie ahead. So it might even out, the official said.        
	The monsoon usually lasts till the first week of October in the city with over 1,400mm of rain and around 65 rainy days over the entire season.        
	The monsoon hit town five days behind schedule this year. Although it has rained frequently since, not a single day has yet been a washout.         
	An official at the Alipore centre said the mismatch between the number of rain days and the total rainfall recorded this year was a queer phenomenon but not uncommon in the city. It cant be labelled an abnormality, he insisted, but failed to explain why.

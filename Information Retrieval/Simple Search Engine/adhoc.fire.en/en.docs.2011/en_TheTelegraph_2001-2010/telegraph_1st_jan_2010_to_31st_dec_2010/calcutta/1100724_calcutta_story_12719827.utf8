The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Courts counsel to all on caning   Sound counsel, say principals
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Courts counsel to all on caning     - Chief Justice asks government to submit report on dealing with children          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Teachers and parents need psychological counselling as much as schoolchildren scarred by corporal punishment in the name of enforcing discipline, Calcutta High Court said on Friday.        
	Speak to psychologists, formulate schemes for counselling of teachers, students and parents and submit a report in two weeks. After going through the report, this court will issue its next order. In the modern world, everyone needs counselling, Chief Justice J.N. Patel told government lawyer Pratik Dhar on Friday during a hearing in a case filed by Tapas Bhanja, a crusader against corporal punishment.        
	Petitioner Bhanja, also a lawyer, had accused the state government of doing little to implement suggestions by experts that counselling be made mandatory on campus so that discipline could be maintained without resorting to corporal punishment.        
	Chief Justice Patel pointed out that in the US, children were encouraged to even drag their parents to court if they were physically assaulted for anything. If these parents are found guilty, they are imprisoned for a maximum of two years.         
	Sunirmal Chakravarthi, the principal of La Martiniere for Boys who became embroiled in a row over corporal punishment after Class VIII student Rouvanjit Rawla committed suicide, hailed the court order as the way forward.        
	Our school already has counsellors who speak to students and their parents. We have recently also developed a study group comprising counsellors, teachers and parents to formulate an ethic of conduct for the students, added Chakravarthi.        
	Rouvanjits father Ajay Rawla has filed a police case saying that his son committed suicide on February 12 because he felt humiliated at being caned by principal Chakravarthi four days earlier.        
	Rita Chatterjee, the principal of Apeejay School, said it was sad that separate laws needed to be framed to keep children from being physically punished. She underlined the need for counselling at every level, of teachers, parents and children, and insisted that was the only thing that would work.                                
	In our school, parents are free to meet the school counsellors on Fridays. The counsellors, in turn, call them up and ask them to come down if they feel the need, said Chatterjee.         
	The original petition against caning in schools was filed in 2004, based on which a division bench ordered the state government to circulate a notice to all schools announcing a ban on corporal punishment.         
	Lawyer Bhanja has been contesting the implementation of the order over the past six years, citing specific instances of violation. He has also been arguing in court that the principals of many schools havent even received a communiqu from the government.        
	The issue of counselling came up for the first time on June 11 this year, when the court ordered that each school appoint a counsellor to advise students who were otherwise unmanageable.        
	In 2008, Babli Ghosh, a Class V student of Andal Girls High School, died after a duster hurled at her by a teacher hit her on the head. The same year, eight-year-old Iftesham Chowdhury went into coma and died after a teacher allegedly slapped her so hard that her head rammed against a wall.        
	But it wasnt until Rouvanjits suicide in February  and principal Chakravrthi admitting to caning him  that corporal punishment became a bigger issue than it has been over the past six years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | AC maam in rival hot seat
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      AC maam in rival hot seat
          JHINUK MAZUMDAR AND SUBHAJOY ROY                              
	Presidency asked Amita Chatterjee, who and Jadavpur University spoke of AC maam who was brilliant in class lectures.        
	Relief, that we are a university finally, and pride that Presidency needed a touch of JU in its new avatar, coursed through the rival institutions on Tuesday evening.        
	Sourav Roy of Presidency wrote whos she when a friend texted him the news of Chatterjees appointment. Wiser after watching the breaking news on STAR Ananda, a friend pitched in with the answer: philo prof at JU.        
	As the chime of change grew louder, wishes got wings on the College Street campus. Better labs and libraries, faster administration, a revamped exam system a postgraduate course in stats, we want a lot from her, said Satarupa Mukherjee of statistics.        
	The students of sociology hoped Presidency would offer courses like journalism and mass communication.        
	But from physiology to physics, political science to philosophy, there was one request for the VC from the College Street campus: Please rise above all the politics.         
	No party should be able to influence her. She should be a pro-student VC, said Soumita Majumdar of history.        
	Saikat Bhattacharya of physics would have preferred someone from outside Bengal to ensure there was no scope of the incumbent bearing a political stamp, but he is happy that Presidency has a VC at last.        
	Students of the philosophy department of JU, where Presidencys first VC spent 31 years as a teacher, said the diligent and thorough classroom lecturer was always so accessible beyond the classroom.        
	Attending her classes used to be an experience, said Rajesh Basu, a second-year postgraduate student of JU. AC maam never limited her lectures to the syllabus. She always gave the big picture.        
	Besides being the head of philosophy, Chatterjee  who retired on September 30  was the co-ordinator of the universitys Centre for Cognitive Science. She is a good administrator apart from being an excellent academic, said Piyali Palit, the present head of philosophy at JU.        
	Glad that Presidency is getting a JU prop to reclaim its former glory? Obviously, she is more JU than Presidency, said Rajesh. His smile said it all.

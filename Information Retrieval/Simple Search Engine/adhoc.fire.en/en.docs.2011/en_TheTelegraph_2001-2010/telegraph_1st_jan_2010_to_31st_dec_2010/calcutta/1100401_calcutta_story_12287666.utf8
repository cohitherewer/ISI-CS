The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU at Delhi door over row
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CU at Delhi door over row
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta University on Wednesday wrote to the human resource development ministry requesting it to issue a notification declaring its three-year BTech course equivalent to the four-year ones offered by other institutes.        
	CUs Rashbehari Shiksha Prangan (popularly known as Rajabazar Science College), where the three-year BTech course is taught, has been been on the boil following an agitation by students over the decision of some private firms and government undertakings not to recruit from the campus.        
	Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said DVC, Power Development Corporation and the railway were among the government undertakings refusing to recruit CU BTech students on the ground that the course is of three years.        
	The agitating students over the past three days have not allowed teachers and other employees to enter the campus, demanding that the authorities persuade the PSUs to recruit CU BTech students.        
	We have accepted some of the students demands. They have promised to withdraw their agitation tomorrow, said Das.        
	The state government, Das added, had issued a notification on December 30 declaring the three-year BTech course equivalent to the more common four-year courses.        
	We have now appealed to the human resource development ministry to issue a similar order so our students are not denied jobs by central government undertakings.        
	The students demanded that the authorities sent teams  comprising teachers, students and senior officials  to recruiters and explain to them that the BTech course is as valid as any other course as it had been approved by University Grants Commission and the All India Council of Technical Education.        
	Weve accepted the demand and our teams will visit public sector units as well as private firms, said Das.        
	Amit Roy, the secretary of CUs science and technology faculty, had on Tuesday ruled out extending the duration of the course. The duration of our course is three years because only those who have BSc honours degrees can study BTech at CU. At other institutes, students can apply for BTech after passing Plus-II.        
	We cannot fill up placement forms of several companies online because the managements are not accepting our three-year course, said Debabrata Deb, a final-year student of chemical technology. There is no permanent placement cell. Teachers organise placement on the basis of their contacts, alleged another student.

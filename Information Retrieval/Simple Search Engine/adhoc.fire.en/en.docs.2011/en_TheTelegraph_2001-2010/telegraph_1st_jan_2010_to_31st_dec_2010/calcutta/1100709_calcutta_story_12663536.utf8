           Brewing nothing: The report Coffee and cigarettes, April 19, took us back to the delightful days of Indian Coffee House  a rendezvous of intellectuals, students, writers and artists. But the article does not describe contemporary adda at the Coffee House. I visited the place recently but found it full of idlers from Calcutta University and Presidency College indulging in gossip or romance over coffee for hours. The quality of their conversation was dismal. This really was disheartening. I congratulate the staff and patrons of the Coffee House on their golden jubilee with the hope that they would succeed in restoring their past glory.   
	Sukumar Ghosh, Mukundapur                          
	Apropos the report Sports and arts in Madhyamik, May 1, it is heartening to learn that the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education will introduce co-scholastic activities such as sports, dance, drama, music, arts, debate and creative writing in its curriculum.                           
	But one essential area the board president has missed in the curriculum is yoga. Currently, it is noticed that qualities such as fortitude and steadfastness are lacking in young learners. Inclusion of yoga in the school syllabi can help students cope with such problems.           
	The proposed plan, if implemented properly, would broaden the platform of learning. Even a few decades ago, students did not have opportunities to pick up co-curricular activities alongside their academic pursuits. They had to take up such courses in private.           
	It should be remembered that plans and proposals are not enough. Now the schools should concentrate on building adequate infrastructure to make a success of the proposal.           
	Ratan Kumar Halder,
  Behala                       
	Apropos the report Hawker Raj gets govt identity, April 21, I was shocked to know that urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya has announced giving formal recognition to hawkers by issuing them identity cards. The same Left Front had once launched Operation Sunshine to clear pavements of hawkers. There are no words to condemn the attempt by Bhattacharya. Issuing identity cards and legalising hawkers is nothing but an excuse to seek votes for the Assembly elections next year. It is surprising that the Opposition parties are keeping mum on the issue.             
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur                     
	If the footpaths are given away to hawkers and peddlers then pedestrians will have to descend on carriageways for walking. Accidents will increase and traffic will be slowed down. Besides this, it is under the footpaths that all the city utilities have the supply lines laid out  of telephone, electricity, gas and filtered water, for the benefit of city dwellers. In case of fault repairs or other work, the occupants will oppose the utility carrying out the work. Obviously citizens will suffer directly in that case. How can the city fathers come up with a solution for that?           
	Asit Kumar Bhattacharya,
  Salt Lake                               
	Apropos the photograph on April 20 showing two out of three members of a family riding a motorcycle without helmets, this is a habit with almost all motorcyclists with pillion-riders although helmets are compulsory for both. The phenomenon is common to all cities, small towns and villages. The men in uniform practically do very little either to enforce the law or curb the break-neck speed of the motorcyclists.             
	Prahlad Agarwala,
  Majdia, Nadia                               
	Apropos the report New Town pipe dream, May 3, as was anticipated the land-owners want better compensation for the land that HIDCO wants to acquire especially because the flats are being sold for crores of rupees.             
	The government must keep in mind how land for Vedic Village was acquired by coercing, threatening or even infesting the plots with sand and bricks to render them infertile before grabbing them from the hapless and poor villagers. The state government must compensate the land-losers satisfactorily and also provide them with jobs.           
	A.S. Mehta,
  New Alipore                               
	Apropos the report Paper mix-up triggers JEE jitters, April 19, it is shocking that negligence and careless attitude of the authorities and observers of the examinations are not only restricted to Madhyamik and HS. It has now extended to an entrance examination like the JEE. There is no excuse for making the examinees at Howrahs Andul Grammya Hitakari Girls High School wait for 40 minutes because the JEE question papers had been switched with Calcutta Universitys Part III papers.             
	The delayed start of JEE at this Howrah school was caused by carelessness for which neither the examination authorities nor police would accept responsibility.           
	Interestingly, the authorities didnt realise that the wrong trunk had been brought to the centre even after the key failed to fit into the lock.           
	In my view, stern action must be taken against those who are found guilty. Otherwise, examination authorities would continue to play with students careers.           
	Atif Ayaz,
  Serampore, Hooghly                               
	Apropos the report Distress baby gets SSKM shock, May 5, I would like to ask why every case of foreign body removal from the trachea or bronchus has to come to SSKM? The procedure should have been done in Burdwan Medical College itself.             
	This shows that a medical college hospital does not have a bronchoscope. I am sure they have ENT professors or cardio-thoracic surgeon. This procedure can be done by any doctor who has had training in bronchoscopy. This shows that the students are not getting proper training in this procedure in any of the medical colleges, especially the postgraduates. I wonder how the medical college got its IMC recognition!           
	Why was the child not attended to by the senior doctors in SSKM on the first day itself? This is an emergency procedure and should have been done by the senior ENT specialist on call that day. One does not need to have a junior doctor around for bronchoscopy. The OT nurses and attendants are there to help.           
	One cannot blame the junior doctors all the time. They learn from their seniors who should lead by example.           
	S. Kumar,
  Address not given                               
	Apropos the report HS marks in numbers and figures, April 24, the decision of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education to issue marksheets showing the marks obtained by the candidate in each subject in words as well as in figures from this year is quite reasonable. Marks indicated in figures can easily be tampered with.             
	The authenticity of the marks obtained increases when they are shown in both words and figures. Some foreign institutes, therefore, ask for marksheets carrying marks both in words and figures.           
	In all important documents this practice is followed. A cheque is not generally valid unless the amount is written both in words and figures.           
	If the authorities consider scrapping the JEE examination then the marks shown in the Class XII examination marksheets will get much more importance in the matter of selection of candidates for admission to professional courses. So the proposed measure will definitely get support from all quarters.           
	It may, however, be considered whether the marks should be indicated without using the words thousand, hundred etc. as we see in railway tickets. For example, 321 is shown as three two one.           
	B.N. Bose,
  Dum Dum Park                               
	The report Code of surrender to graffiti gangs, May 7, marked a return of poll graffiti despite a ban on painting them on walls of houses without the consent of the owners. No party is free from the taint although the act is considered irresponsible and is punishable by law. The joint commissioner of police (headquarters) Jawed Shamim has promised action on receipt of complaints to this effect. But, going by experience, such promises remain on paper with muscle-flexing campaigners enjoying unwritten licence to do what they are bent upon doing. One hopes some day the authorities would put the law into effect and book the offenders to bring relief to the disgruntled, hapless house-owners who are having to cleanse the defaced walls now that the polls are over.             
	P.B. Saha,
  Salt Lake                               
	The article Flow of high-fives and beer for 4-1 on the front page of Metro dated June 28 erroneously mentions Berlin as the match venue for Englands 5-1 drubbing of Germany in 2001. The match was played in Munich.       Letters on reports appearing   in Metro may be sent to:

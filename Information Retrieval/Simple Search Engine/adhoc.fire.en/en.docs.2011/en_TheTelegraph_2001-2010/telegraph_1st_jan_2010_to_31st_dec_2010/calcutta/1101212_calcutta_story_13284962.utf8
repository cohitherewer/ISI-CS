The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Adopted by Calcutta
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Adopted by Calcutta
                              Kulbhushan Kharbanda in Sakharam Binder. (Bishwarup Dutta)                            
	I feel I cant talk, Im not articulate. Give me the lines and Im a different person, says Kulbhushan Kharbanda when asked why despite his long career in films, he is rarely seen in interviews.         
	Dressed in corduroys and a loose shirt, with a few days of stubble on his face, the 69-year-old Kharbanda looks relaxed in one of the theatre spaces at Padatiks office building on AJC Bose Road. Kharbanda is no stranger to the city.         
	I came to Calcutta in 1972-73 and stayed here till 1975 before moving to Mumbai. Its a lovely place. They talk about a man adopting a city, but in my case it felt like Calcutta adopted me, says Kharbanda, who is back in the city to act in Sakharam Binder, a play that was directed by Shyamanand Jalan. It was performed as part of a programme in Jalans memory organised by Padatik on December 4.         
	Kharbanda, who has just completed a German and French project, remembers his director-friend fondly. We opened Padatik with Gidhade. Shyamanand directed it and I was a part of the cast, he recalls. But after moving to Mumbai, he did little theatre, except when he came back in the Nineties when Jalan revived Sakharam Binder, which was first staged in 1973.         
	I am a lazy person. I need someone like Shyamanand to push me, he says. Not very familiar with Calcutta auditoriums today, he is all praise for the auditoriums back then. I performed in Kala Mandir and then in 1991 at Gyan Manch and the Academy of Fine Arts. The acoustics are very good and Calcutta always had very good technical people, he says.         
	The actor who has proven his mettle in both art-house movies like Mandi and Arth and commercial films like Shaan and Border, refuses to get drawn into the debate of art versus commercial cinema.         
	An actor is an actor. Directors are more rigid. A Manmohan Desai cant make a Satyajit Ray kind of movie and a Ray cant make a Desai kind of a movie. Actors have to just understand the genre and deliver, he says.         
	He likes the changes that Bollywood is going through. Bound scripts have started coming in. Earlier we used to be narrated the story. I really like the kind of films that some of the young directors are making. I have worked with their fathers, he says with a smile.         
	The length of the role doesnt bother him. Or why he has almost never been a hero. I have always been a character actor, he says.

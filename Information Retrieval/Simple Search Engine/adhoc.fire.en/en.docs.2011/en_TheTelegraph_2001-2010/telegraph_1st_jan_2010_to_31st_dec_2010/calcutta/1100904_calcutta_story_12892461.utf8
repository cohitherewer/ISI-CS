The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Jheel assault on official
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Jheel assault on official
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Alleged Trinamul Congress activists, led by MLA Arup Biswas, dragged a fisheries department official by his collar to the edge of Bikramgarh Jheel and threatened to drown him when he went to inspect the south Calcutta water body on Friday morning.        
	The Trinamul activists have been resisting attempts by the owner of a plot, Raza Hossain, to erect a fence on the ground that the land had been illegally reclaimed from the water body behind the South City residential estate.        
	The high court, however, has upheld Hossains right to the plot.        
	Councillor Biswas denied the allegation of manhandling Bijon Mondal, the zonal deputy director of the fisheries department. Our party supporters had only demonstrated before him and the issue was settled after he gave an undertaking that his department would take action against landfill, Biswas said.        
	Fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda asked Mondal to survey the jheel after learning about residents resistance to Hossains attempt to fence his plot.        
	I was surveying the water body when a group of Trinamul activists, led by local MLA Arup Biswas, surrounded me and started abusing and heckling me.... They dragged me by my collar and one of them even tried to push me into the jheel.        
	Mondal was then allegedly confined in a room for two-and-a-half hours. They let me go after I wrote on a piece of paper that our department will act against illegal landfill, recalled Mondal.        
	Nanda said his department was no longer the custodian of the jheel. The civic body took over the upkeep of the water body on March 26, 2003.        
	The issue also came up in the high court during the day, with Justice Pranab Chattopadhyay observing that peoples representatives should refrain from organising mass movements before realising the import of the order.        
	Judges cannot hold press conferences and clarify their orders. It is the duty of peoples representatives to know details of court orders, Justice Chattopadhyay said.        
	This court never said that a building could be constructed on the plot even if it is part of a water body or without the civic body sanctioning the plan. Why arent the agitators moving appeals against the order? Why are they taking the law into their hands? the judge wondered.        
	The judge also wondered why did Jadavpur police station not help the land-owner in erecting the fence. The police lawyer submitted there would have been bloodshed had cops helped Hossain fence the plot.

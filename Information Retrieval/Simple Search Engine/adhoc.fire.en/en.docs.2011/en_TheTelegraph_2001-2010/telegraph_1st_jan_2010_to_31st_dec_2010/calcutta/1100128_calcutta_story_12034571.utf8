          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Lips were sealed and brows furrowed on Wednesday afternoon at the Burrabazar outlet where the Haldiram success story was scripted.         
	The 40-odd employees in the 100-seater restaurant and the adjoining wholesale store had heard that owner Prabhu Shankar Agarwal had been found guilty of hiring a hitman to kill a tea-stall owner who had refused to vacate a plot.        
	Everybody is very scared. Will this store close down? Will all of us lose our jobs? We have no idea, said a middle-aged employee on condition of anonymity, standing outside the two-storeyed building.        
	His comment mirrored the mood in the other Haldiram Prabhuji outlets in the city.        
	Prabhu Shankars grandfather had started the business in Bikaner, Rajasthan, in the 1930s. His son Rameshwar opened the Burrabazar store in the late-1950s. The small bhujia shop was always popular but its name became a brand only after Prabhu Shankar took over the reins, said a veteran employee.         
	Today, our production units work round-the-clock. During festivals, we struggle to meet the demand. The franchises are spread across the state, said another employee.        
	Prabhu Shankar, who fostered the franchises and the state-wide distribution network, developed an interest in real estate along the way.        
	He parted ways with his brothers Ashok and Mahesh, who later opened Pratik Foods on Chowringhee. According to insiders, the bone of contention was Prabhu Shankars desire to invest the profits from the confectionery business in real estate.

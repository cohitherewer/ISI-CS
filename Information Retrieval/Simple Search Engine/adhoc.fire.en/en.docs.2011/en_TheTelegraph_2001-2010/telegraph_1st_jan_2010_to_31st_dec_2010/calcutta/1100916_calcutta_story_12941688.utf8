The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SC notice for Sourav plot
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      SC notice for Sourav plot
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT IN NEW DELHI                          Sourav Ganguly                                  
	The Supreme Court has issued notices to three senior state government officials over the allotment of a Salt Lake plot to Sourav Ganguly for setting up a school.        
	The bench of justices G.S. Singhvi and Asok Kumar Ganguly issued the notices on Monday to the secretary and principal secretary of the urban development department and the secretary of the law department following a plea by an NGO challenging the legality of the allotment.        
	The state will have to reply to the notices within eight weeks.        
	The bench did not award any interim relief or issue a notice to Ganguly, whose counsel U.U. Lalit and Rana Mukherjee assured the court that status quo on the plot would be maintained till the case was disposed of.        
	The NGO, Humanity, moved the apex court after the high court had on April 12 dismissed its petition seeking cancellation of the allotment of CA 222 to the former Team India skipper.        
	we are of the view that the allotment of plot CA 222 in favour of (Ganguly) was not vitiated by illegality, arbitrariness or mala fide, merely because an advertisement was not placed specifically inviting applications for the plot, the high court had held.        
	The appeal filed by the Salt Lake-based NGO stated that Ganguly had initially been given BF 158, a 48-cottah plot, where he wanted to set up an ICSE school. The cricketer was selected over 19 other interested parties, the petitioner had alleged.        
	But Ganguly later wrote to urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya seeking a bigger plot, because ICSE rules mandated a minimum of 60 cottahs for a school.        
	The petition also claimed that the second plot  CA 222  was allotted to him in a very clandestine manner and handed over to him before he surrendered the first.        
	Besides, the second plot is earmarked for a college in the master plan. The urban development department... allotted the said land to Sourav Ganguly despite the fact that there are two other English-medium schools nearby, the petition said.

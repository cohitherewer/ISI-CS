The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Medical cell, howzat?
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Medical cell, howzat?
          KINSUK BASU                                            
	Gautam Gambhirs injury  from a rising Morne Morkel delivery  and his subsequent removal to a private clinic from Eden Gardens on Monday afternoon has revealed some hard truths.        
	Not about the gaps in Gambhirs defensive technique but those in the medical cell of the Cricket Association of Bengal.        
	Set up in the mid-80s, the medical cell today is a residue of the facilities that were put in place at the inception. Insiders of the cell  housed on the first floor of the Club House  confirmed that the infrastructure was just not up to international standards.        
	There is no denying that the facilities need to be upgraded. For any pain management, time is a very important factor and the faster you intervene, the greater and better are the chances of healing, said Sunil Thakur, one of the key consultants of the CABs medical cell.        
	Thakur was present at Eden when Gambhir was packed off for an MRI scan to a private facility some 6km away as the on-ground medical cell is not equipped to conduct an MRI or CT scan.        
	High on the list of whats missing at the medical cell  which boasts over seven specialists, all on call  are permanent nurses.        
	During any match, explained Asit Chatterjee, the chairman of the medical cell, nurses are brought in if and when required from either a state-run or a private hospital.        
	A peek into the first-aid room, parting the green curtains on Monday, revealed a small cubicle with a few medicines on a cupboard and a small bottle labelled lotion, but with a pair of scissors inside. Under the cupboard were rows of bags.        
	The physiotherapy room was no different. Inside the small cubicle there was only one machine  short wave diathermy, that sends waves through the muscles to the bones. A small traction hung from one end of a trolley. The adjoining X-ray room is just as frugal and uninspiring.        
	The favourite ground of cricketers from around the world that will be hosting a series of IPL matches within weeks and World Cup matches within a year surely deserves better (see box).        
	We have decided to get a new ambulance soon that would be fitted with all modern gadgets. But thats not really a problem as during any match we usually get one from a private hospital, smiled cell chairman Chatterjee.        
	Clearly, medical matters at Eden Gardens need much more than just a bandage, unlike Gambhirs left arm.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      15 injured in school poll clash
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Fifteen men, including four cops, were injured in a clash between supporters of the Congress-Trinamul combine and the CPM following the election to the managing committee of a Howrah school on Monday.        
	The clash broke out soon after it was announced that the CPM and the opposition alliance had won three seats each in the managing committee of Bankra Badamtala Girls High School. For the past 25 years, the CPM had won the election uncontested.        
	Police arrested 40 persons and clamped Section 144 of the CrPC to control the situation.        
	Trinamul leaders alleged that CPM cadres had ransacked the houses of two of their supporters and beat them up. The CPM denied the allegation and claimed that Trinamul was trying to terrorise people in the area.        
	The police said Congress-Trinamul supporters had ransacked two CPM offices to avenge the attack on their supporters. They also attacked cops and damaged one of their jeeps.        
	On December 18, Swapan Koley, an SFI supporter and second-year BCom student of Prabhu Jagabandhu College in Andul, had been killed allegedly by Trinamul supporters when he went to file nomination papers for the students union election of his college.        
	At least five political clashes have taken place in Bankra in the past two years.

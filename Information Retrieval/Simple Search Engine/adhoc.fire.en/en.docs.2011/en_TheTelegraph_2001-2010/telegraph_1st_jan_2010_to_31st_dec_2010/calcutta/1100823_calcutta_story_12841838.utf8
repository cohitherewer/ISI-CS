          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three men were arrested in a flat near City Centre 2 in connection with a betting racket on Sunday afternoon.         
	The three, who run a garment business, were allegedly busy taking calls from their clients when policemen barged into the rented flat.        
	People were calling the trio to place bets on the outcome and several other aspects of Sundays one-day international match between India and Sri Lanka. We seized eight cellphones, one television set, two cordless phones, one digital voice recorder and a few thousand rupees in cash from the flat, said an officer of New Town police station.        
	Officers are interrogating the three. We are trying to track down the other members of the betting racket, said the superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, Rahul Srivastav.        
	Rajkumar Agarwal, one of the accused, rented the flat five months ago.         
	The flat used to be locked most of the time. We had information that Agarwal, who lives in Howrah, and his Dum Dum-based friends Narayan Chowdhury and Lakshman Prasad used to visit the flat on days when cricket or soccer matches were scheduled, said an officer.        
	Since India and Sri Lanka were to clash on Sunday, the police had asked their sources to watch out for the trio.        
	Residents of the building that houses the flat told investigators that the three used to visit the flat regularly during the football World Cup and sometimes used to stay the night.We have found out that the three had links with another betting group active in the Burrabazar and Girish Park areas. We have shared this information with Calcutta police, added the officer.        
	The detective department of the city police had arrested several people involved in betting from the two city pockets over the past few years.        
	We are examining the cellphone numbers stored in the eight handsets. We will interrogate the owner of each number, said Srivastav.

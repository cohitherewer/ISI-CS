The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | She battles brothel for love
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      She battles brothel for love
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Pooja Bhatt in Mahesh Bhatts Sadak (1991) fights the system to flee the brothel and be with the man she loves, Sanjay Dutt                                  
	A sex worker desperate to break free for the sake of love was thrown a lifeline on Wednesday by Calcutta High Court which directed police to investigate her complaint and submit a report within a week.        
	The 25-year-old sex worker of Durga Charan Mitra Road, under Burtolla police station, alleged that some people involved in the flesh trade were not allowing her to leave the brothel and marry the man she loved.        
	She added in her complaint that those shackling her were not handing over the gold ornaments and other valuables that she had earned in the eight years in the trade that she had been forced to enter.        
	She is a victim of circumstances. Now she wants to break free and lead a normal life with the man she is in love with, pleaded her counsel.        
	The police should have come to her rescue, but unfortunately they have not responded to her repeated pleas. Now the court should ask them to act so that my client can be saved from the goons running the sex racket in the Burtolla area, he added.        
	The lawyer appearing for the state, however, claimed that the local police station had received the womans complaint and was looking into the matter.         
	Justice Dipankar Dutta then gave seven days to the Burtolla police to complete the investigation and file a report in court.        
	The womans counsel informed the high court on Wednesday that his client was kidnapped by some criminals from her residence in a village in Punjab and brought to Calcutta. She was barely 15 years old then.        
	The teenager was brought to central Calcutta and kept at a place for more than two years. Then her kidnappers forced her to become a sex worker.        
	Her youthful beauty and charm drew clients from near and far, allowing the men who had brought her into the trade to make a lot of money at her cost, said the lawyer.        
	The lawyer also told the court that her clients were rich, and they would gift her ornaments, saris and valuable cosmetic items.        
	She has said that she has gold ornaments weighing about 4,000 gram (worth close to Rs 66 lakh) and many other valuables. Those running the sex racket had kept all that with them and not handed over anything to my client, the lawyer claimed.        
	He also alleged that she had repeatedly filed complaints with Burtolla police station urging the officers to help her leave the area and settle down.        
	It is a fact that her lover is an unemployed man. But according to my client he was been very kind to her and she will be happy to marry him and be with him, the lawyer told the court.        
	The woman feels that once she reclaims the ornaments and valuables that rightfully belong to her, she can start a new life. Her counsel urged the court to intervene and save her client from the clutches of the flesh trade mafia.        
	This could become a significant case for so many women trapped in the red-light areas dotting the city. If the police are forced to act, the woman is rescued and allowed to set up home, it would give hope to many, said an activist working to stop trafficking.

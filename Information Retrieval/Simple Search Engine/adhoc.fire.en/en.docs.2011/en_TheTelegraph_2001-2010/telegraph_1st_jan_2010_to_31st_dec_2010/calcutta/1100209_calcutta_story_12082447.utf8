	Two groups of hoodlums went on the rampage in Ballygunge and Sodepur on Monday, terrorising traders and assaulting policemen.        
	Around 1.30pm, about a dozen men armed with revolvers raided Uttarpara Bazar, near Ballygunge railway siding, and hurled several bombs. They left the area after 15-20 minutes.        
	Most traders ran away and no one was injured, said policemen.         
	According to cops, the men are extortionists and were trying to terrorise traders.        
	Despite several complaints, the police have not taken action against local criminals. We are living in fear as they often extort money from us, said a trader.         
	In the morning, about 25 youths stopped a police jeep on Madhyamgram-Sodepur Road and set it on fire. The mob also beat up three constables.        
	The police said the men were associated with illegal liquor trade in the area. RAF personnel had to fire teargas shells to bring the situation under control.        
	We have been conducting raids over the past fortnight and have shut down a dozen illegal liquor shops. It was a revenge attack, said an officer.         
	A trader who witnessed the incident said the youths were shouting slogans decrying the polices failure to maintain law and order in the area.         
	Traffic was disrupted for several hours.        
	District police superintendent Rahul Srivastava said three youths were arrested in this connection.

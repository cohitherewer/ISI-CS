The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | True spirit of Puja: a vow to make Calcutta a model city
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      True spirit of Puja: a vow to make Calcutta a model city
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Barisha Youth Club members exult on receiving the Model Puja 2010 plaque and cheque from Prosenjit at Vidya Mandir on Monday                Barisha Tarun Tirtha members pose for the camera on being awarded Five Star Puja status by Prosenjit                Prosenjit hands over a cheque to Five Star Puja Olabibitola   Sarbojanin Durgotsab of Howrah.

	As an overcast sky hung over Monday evening, singer Subhomita quite fittingly broke into E ki gobhir bani elo ghono megher aral dhore on the Vidya Mandir stage. And the bani (message) at the awards ceremony for the eighth edition of CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja (TSP) 2010 was clear enough  a thumping re-affirmation of the pledge to present Calcutta with a safe, happy and meaningful Puja.         
	The best message came from a member of Barisha Youth Club, crowned Model Puja 2010. Let us vow to make Calcutta a model city, he urged, after being handed over a cheque for Rs 50,000 by Tollywood star Prosenjit and CESC executive director Dilip Sen.        
	The moment of the evening came when a ragtag group strolled up to the stage. Ramesh Dutta Street Sarbojanin, a modest puja in the Rambagan area of central Calcutta that joined the TSP movement this year, was being saluted as the Puja That Cares. The area is peopled by dwellers of a slum and a red-light district between which it is sandwiched.        
	We had not dared to enter any contest so far, club secretary Shankar Sarkar had confided to Metro during the TSP briefing a month ago. On Monday evening, trophy in hand, Sarkar was an emotional man.         
	We had started a coaching centre with 10 kids in 1992 so that they are not forced to follow in their parents footsteps. Today, the centre handholds 543 children, many of whom were present to bask in the thunderous applause.        
	Taking home the True to Tradition trophy and a cheque for Rs 30,000, one of the twin awards presented in association with The Bengal, was Shibmandir Sarbojanin for staying rooted to the essence of Durga Puja.         
	It was perhaps fitting that TSP gave a platform to a traditional art on the verge of extinction. Harbola took centrestage with Subhendu Biswas and his student Swapan Dutta entertaining the crowd.        
	But nothing excited the packed auditorium more than Prosenjits presence. The actor walked in sporting a black kurta and trendy denims and Lakshmi Dey, a puja organiser, lost her voice.        
	The star presence even brought Somnath Banerjee of Olabibitola Sarbojanin to his knees. The Howrah resident was seen kneeling in front of the stage, focused on a job far removed from his priesthood duties  clicking his hero.        
	Banerjee soon got a chance to get closer to the star as he walked up on stage with his neighbours to receive the Five Star Puja trophy. So did members of Barisha Tarun Tirtha, the other Five Star awardee.         
	As the crowd settled down, Prosenjit extended festive greetings to all. Theres so much cruelty, pain and sorrow all over the world. I pray to Goddess Durga to bring peace and joy in our lives, he said.         
	While CESCs Dilip Samajpati presented the Two Star awards, Dr Debal Sen, cardiologist and critical care expert, gave away the prizes to Three and Four Star Puja winners like Hatkhola Gossain Para.        
	Durga Puja has become so crowded that a movement like this was needed to nudge organisers into providing visitors with basic amenities like toilets and drinking water, said 73-year-old Gorachand Goswami, still at the helm of the 73-year-old puja.        
	Enjoying the proceedings with a contended look were members of 41 Palli Sarbojanin. Winners of the Model Puja crown in 2007, they felt they were good enough to be coaches on the TSP field. The puja, along with Model Puja 2008 Tridhara Sammilani and multiple-edition finalist Manicktalla Chaltabagan Lohapatti, were ceremoniously inducted into the TSP Hall of Fame.        
	The greatest gift of this movement has been an increase in social awareness. There is less emphasis on display of opulence and greater evidence of social responsibility, summed up CESCs Sen.        
	TSP 2010 was partnered by CESC, Calcutta police, West Bengal Fire Services, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Pollution Control Board, The Bengal and others.

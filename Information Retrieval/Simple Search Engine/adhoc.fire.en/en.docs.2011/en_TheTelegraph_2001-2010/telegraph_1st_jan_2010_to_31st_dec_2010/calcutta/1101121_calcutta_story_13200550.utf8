The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A building in currency 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A building in currency 
                              World Heritage Week at Currency Building. (Aranya Sen)                            
	Currency Building in Dalhousie Square has at long last been thrown open to the public. The occasion is World Heritage Week that ends on November 25. The stately building that once served as the Reserve Bank had been partially demolished by the Central Public Works Department, which was supposed to look after it, in the hope that a highrise building will come up there. But for once, timely action was taken and its destruction was stopped mid-way. For years it remained in ruins and a jungle of parasites came up all over the magnificent Italianate structure. The same thing had happened after the fire in the equally grand Mackinnon Mackenzie Building  parasites thrived all over it before the promoter vandalised it again. For some unknown reason, work has stopped there.         
	A few years ago, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had taken over Currency Building, and although it still looked shabby outside, work was quietly going on inside. Once one walks into the courtyard one can still see the sky above. The atrium above it was destroyed. But the interiors have been cleaned, and a photo exhibition of heritage structures under the ASI is being held there now. The section on the structures in Bengal and Calcutta is quite interesting, although quite predictably, the captions were written by someone innocent of the English lexicon. The display is also quite slipshod, but one is touched by the ASIs concern for history. Surprisingly, the exhibition is drawing a goodly number of viewers.         
	The ASI apparently has plans to rebuild the demolished sections. But first things first  the shabby exterior needs to be cleaned up. Perhaps the building should be left the way it is now  as a relic of a once-grand piece of architecture  as they often do in the West. It should serve as a reminder of the time when heritage structures were being mindlessly pulled down. Not that it would act a deterrent, but at least it would raise our level of awareness.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rawla asked to pay school fee
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rawla asked to pay school fee
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	La Martiniere for Boys on Wednesday sent a notice about payment of fees to the father of Rouvanjit Rawla, who committed suicide on February 12, four days after being caned in school.         
	Ajay Rawla said this was the second time in three months that he had received a system-generated mail and text message about school fees. This is heartless and exceedingly careless of the school. What are they charging me for? he said.        
	Rawla had received an email from the school on June 2, five days before he lodged a complaint against the principal and four teachers accusing them of mental and physical torture of Rouvanjit, leading to his death.         
	The SMS on June 2 informed Rawla that Rs 9,525 would be debited from his account. On Wednesday, the amount was Rs 6,225.        
	In June, when Rawla had reported the matter to the school authorities, they blamed it on a technical fault. How can the same thing happen again? wondered Rawla.         
	According to the school, the company to which the work has been outsourced was asked to make the necessary corrections. But a data entry error had put Rawlas contact details next to another students name.        
	I personally went to the company and saw that the error was corrected. We regret causing pain to Rouvanjits family but it was a technical error, said Supriyo Dhar, the secretary to the board of governors of La Martiniere.        
	The school also sent a letter to Rawla apologising for the error.

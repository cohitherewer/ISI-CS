The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Evening rush on fun street
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Evening rush on fun street

	Park Street played Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde on Sunday  boring during the day and boisterous after dark.        
	Calcuttas busy fun street, where Sundays are synonymous with queues outside restaurants at lunchtime, was deserted in the afternoon with many of the popular food stops closed. Those that were open had empty chairs to show with waiters huddled in corners.        
	The party places would come alive a few hours later. After 5pm, to be precise, when the election-time booze ban was lifted.        
	During lunch hours, though, Park Street could have been mistaken for a bandh-hit stretch  the pavements were empty and few cars whizzed past.        
	Is it supposed to be so empty? asked Natalya, a 24-year-old backpacker from Iceland, as she walked past the downed shutters of McDonalds and Olympia Pub. She did not know that the sale of alcohol had been prohibited since Saturday afternoon.         
	What Natalya and her friends might have done, something that a few other foreigners actually did, was to make the most of the occasion and enjoy a laidback meal at Flurys, a rarity on the other 51 Sundays of the year.        
	There were no queues for the Peter Cat Cello Kebab either or the Mocambo Chicken a la Kiev and if one did not notice the security guard behind the door, one could have concluded Bar-B-Q had not opened for lunch.        
	All this changed in a hurry though. Music World opened doors as soon as polling ended at 3pm and McDonalds turned the lights on around 5.30. By 7pm the famous Sunday Park Street clamour was back. The pavements were buzzing with ice-cream vendors, magazine sellers and roll munchers.        
	By 8pm, all parking spots had been taken and families stood in queues outside Mocambo and Magnolia, Kwality and KFC.        
	We voted in the morning and are now eating out in the evening, said 20-year-old Vivek Sonthalia before walking into McDonalds.        
	Some restaurants like Oly Pub and Peiping, however, decided to keep the dead poll spirit alive and did not open in the evening.

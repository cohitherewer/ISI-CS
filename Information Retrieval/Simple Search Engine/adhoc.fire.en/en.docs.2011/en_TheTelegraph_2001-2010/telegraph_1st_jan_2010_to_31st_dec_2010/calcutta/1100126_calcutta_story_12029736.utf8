  - Three-hour protest prompts promise of wedding party probe          OUR BUREAU                                                          Liquor bottles and leftovers (top) and a makeshift chullah at Botanic Garden on Monday. (Gopal Senapati)      
	Indian Botanic Garden cut a sorry picture on Monday with liquor bottles and leftovers littering the greens and officials fumbling for answers as morning walkers demanded to know who had authorised Sundays illegal wedding feast.        
	Green activist Subhash Dutta reached the 273-acre campus in his track pants at 7.30am and mobilised support for an impromptu sit-in protest that grew in strength as the morning wore on. By 10.30am, more than 50 morning walkers were part of the campaign, forcing deputy director Sheu Kumar to step out of his office and conduct a survey.        
	Is this the Indian Botanic Garden or a bar? Isnt anybody accountable for this? asked Dutta, pointing to one of the empty bottles lying on the lawn near the cafeteria.        
	Kumar promptly promised an inquiry, just as joint director G.S. Giri had done on Sunday. Right now I do not even know whether this was a marriage reception or a picnic. An inquiry will be instituted into the allegation that a wedding party was held on this lawn, he said.        
	[For the sake of inquiry, Metro offers to send Kumar the invitation card for Sundays marriage reception.]         
	Sumantra Bagchi, a real estate player with a supposedly strong CPM connection, had hosted his wedding reception on the greens adjacent to the cafeteria allegedly without official permission. The 1,000-odd invitees were asked to bring along their invitation cards, which mentioned that they neednt pay the gate fee of Rs 10.        
	The cafeteria owner who was given the catering contract cooked food in the open and laid out the buffet spread under decorated shades next to the seating arena, where lawn umbrellas were put up for the guests. Liquor was served, too.        
	Dutta said he found around 15 empty liquor bottles on the lawn when he walked in on Monday morning. Cigarette butts, plastic cups and leftover food were also strewn all over the place. I will inform Calcutta High Court about the blatant violation of rules, he added.        
	Botanic garden has two picnic arenas but cooking, alcohol and the use of plastic cups and plates are banned.        
	 Duttas eyes also fell on a partially burnt bamboo grove near the cafeteria, though it couldnt be confirmed whether the wedding party had anything to do with it.        
	Samarjit Mandal, the president of the Botanic Garden Daily Walkers Association, said Bagchi couldnt have hosted his wedding reception there without the knowledge  and consent  of senior officials. The botanic garden authorities couldnt have been unaware of the fact that a marriage reception would be held because the decorations were done a day in advance.         
	The director-general of forests, Dilip Kumar, said he came to know about the incident from newspapers. The probe will reveal whether permission was sought, and given, for the wedding party, he added.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Best seats in the house for big show

	Victoria House, the real seat of power in the city, provided the best seats in the house for Wednesdays Mamata show that highlighted the shift in power in the state.        
	The six-storeyed heritage building that houses the CESC headquarters was the backdrop of the stage opposite the Tipu Sultan mosque from which Mamata Banerjee and other Trinamul Congress leaders addressed the lakhs who had gathered on the road.        
	The main entrance of the building, which faces Chowringhee, and the main cash office gate on Bentinck Street were cordoned off for security reasons.        
	As a result, Victoria House remained inaccessible to most visitors, including those who wanted to pay power bills.        
	The cash office had a light day. The visitors registers had few names to show.                    
	Those who braved it to work underwent a thorough scan before reaching the front door manned by private security.        
	I had to show my identity card to policemen and Trinamul supporters to enter office, said a CESC employee.        
	Tin barricades with collapsible gates were constructed at the Bentinck Street-Waterloo Street crossing, in front of Aliah restaurant, making the Income Tax Building, Paradise cinema and several establishments out of bounds for the public.        
	Victoria House, built in 1933 and named after Victoria Street in London, was also cut off by a similar barricade. The tall and wide windows along its staircase presented an eyeful for those inside.        
	Look, there is Madan Mitra in a green kurta. Didi must be coming now, said a woman looking out of a window, playing the spot-the-leader game.        
	The upper floors offered an even better view, unobstructed by the foliage. The best view was from the roof, where even the employees were not allowed. Policemen stood guard on the terrace and filmed the four-hour meeting for security reasons.        
	The Victoria House gallery was abuzz when Mamata got off a black Santro at 1.34pm and walked to the dais, surrounded by flashbulbs.        
	At the CESC headquarters, people craned their necks for a glimpse of the chief minister in waiting as she strode around the stage during the meeting.        
	The sedans at the main gate were missing on Wednesday, including the most eye-catching of them, CESC vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenkas BMW. Sources said he chose to work out of Duncan House in Dalhousie, where many RPG Enterprises companies have their offices.        
	Not all could follow the boss. Even though no special instructions were issued to employees, many arrived early to avoid getting stuck.        
	Returning home was a tall order for most, especially the executives used to the travelling in their air-conditioned cars. Many had to walk half a kilometre to reach their vehicles as their parking spots were occupied by netas, supporters, hawkers and cops.

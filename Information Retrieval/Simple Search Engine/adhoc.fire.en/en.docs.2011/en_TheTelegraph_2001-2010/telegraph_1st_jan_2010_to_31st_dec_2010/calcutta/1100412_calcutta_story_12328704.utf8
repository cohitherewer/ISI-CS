The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Deb in Rajarhat rant 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Deb in Rajarhat rant 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        Gautam Deb at the Rajarhat programme. (Bishwarup Dutta)       
	Housing minister Gautam Deb on Sunday lashed out at Mamata Banerjee for holding up New Towns development, two weeks after claiming that the Trinamul chief had agreed to help the government end the Rajarhat land row.        
	I do not understand why Mamata Banerjee and her party are creating problems for New Town.... Even her partymen are benefiting from the work generated in Rajarhat. If she wants, resistance in a couple of pockets can be neutralised immediately, Deb said at a programme to lay the foundation stone for a 10-lane, 5km thoroughfare connecting New Town to National Highway 34 in Madhyamgram.        
	On February 25, Deb had claimed that Mamata had verbally agreed to help the government resolve the land impasse in Rajarhats Chhapna mouza that was holding up electrification of large parts of the township.        
	But Mamata rubbished the claim virtually calling the power centre of Rajarhat a liar, prompting Deb to label the Trinamul leaders politics unhealthy and uncivilised.        
	Chhapna villagers, backed by Trinamul, are demanding more compensation to part with their land for the installation of three poles that will supply power to Action Areas II and III of the township.        
	On Sunday, the housing minister said: I have tried to speak to her many times in an attempt to find an amicable solution but to no avail. When I call her up, she sometimes speaks, sometimes she does not. I am yet to receive a reply to a 13-page letter I wrote to her seeking her cooperation (on New Town).        
	More than Rs 2,000 crore has been spent on the township. Something needs to be done soon.

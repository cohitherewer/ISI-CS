The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Steel house for slayer of evil
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Steel house for slayer of evil
  - Puja organisers shift to metal as safety overrides cost          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                          Steel frames support clay pieces depicting human figures on a door at the Tangra Gholpara puja. (Sudeshna Banerjee)                                        
	Pandal designers in town are singing a new tune as they start building a home for the goddess this Puja  bamboo may be beautiful but steel is safer.        
	Art and engineering have combined to create easier to assemble and structurally stronger steel scaffolds for around half-a-dozen pandals so far.         
	This is a major leap in the structural security of pandals, said Debashis Datta, a senior manager of the Institute for Steel Development amp; Growth (Insdag) that has been promoting the use of steel among puja organisers.         
	Insdag, a public-private venture steered by the ministry of steel, had first promoted metal as an alternative to bamboo frames in pandals by designing and sponsoring a couple of them in 2002 and 2003.         
	This year, Tridhara Sammilani on Manoharpukur Road is one of those going for all all-steel structure, using 3mm pipes to create a canopy of steel for the goddess.                           
	The pandal roof will resemble the mythic serpent Ananta Nags hood. A net of steel pipes bent to meet at specific points will make up the hood while transparent polycarbonate sheets will fill the gaps, theme-maker Dipak Ghosh told Metro.         
	Bamboo poles have made way for metal and coir ropes have replaced welded joints at a few more pandals that have opted for safety and convenience over tradition.        
	Those shifting to steel this year include Tangra Gholpara Sarbojanin. The perfection of the upturned circular hemisphere that we have created at the entrance would have been impossible with bamboo poles, which can neither be bent nor are uniform, said artist Subhashis Chakraborty.         
	The sturdiness of steel will also allow him to put gigantic clay pitchers and potters wheels atop the pandal. Installation is taking less time than it would with bamboo, added Chakraborty.         
	Ballygunge Cultural Association has also joined the list this year, while Suruchi Sangha of New Alipore will be using steel selectively as the organisers feel not all aspects of their theme can be executed using metal pipes.         
	The one big hurdle, of course, is the cost factor. Our pandal would cost Rs 1.2 lakh, double of last year. We are going ahead with it as this is our diamond jubilee year, said Anjan Ukil of Ballygunge Cultural Association.        
	Ghosh estimates that his budget would increase by 30 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll job caravan rolls into CU 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Poll job caravan rolls into CU 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Coming soon to a university near you: the great pre-poll recruitment fair.        
	A flurry of recruitment by the Left Front in what could be the fag end of a 33-year reign is set to give Calcutta University all the teachers it needed over the past decade but never had.        
	Up for grabs are as many as 228 teaching posts, including prestigious chairs that have been vacant for between four and 10 years. University officials confirmed on Monday that the syndicate, the highest policy-making body, would soon advertise the vacancies, comprising almost a third of the total sanctioned teaching posts.        
	This is the first time in the universitys 153-year history that vacant teaching posts in all departments will be advertised together. In fact, we have not seen recruitment on this scale before, said a senior teacher who did not wish to be named.        
	The recruitment drive, which will put a nearly Rs 15-crore salary burden on the exchequer, is in keeping with the job bonanza unleashed by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government after the Lok Sabha poll setback last year. The state cabinet has already approved the creation of over 60,000 teaching posts in schools and colleges.         
	It has also opened the floodgates for recruitment to the manpower-starved police department. Around 3,500 constables are set to join the state police and another 1,500 will be added to Calcutta police over the next few months. The Eastern Frontier Rifles will get 250 additional personnel.        
	In government departments, 1,693 posts are to be created and 4,716 vacancies filled up before the Assembly elections next year.        
	University registrar Basab Chaudhuri insisted that the recruitment drive was a routine one but did confirm that the vacant posts would be filled up as early as possible.        
	So is there a directive from Writers Buildings to speed up the process? We have decided to fill up all the vacancies at one go based on the new teacher selection criteria fixed by the UGC following the implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations, Chaudhuri told Metro.         
	For Calcutta University, the biggest challenge is to find suitable candidates for the vacant teaching posts at short notice.        
	The government was in a hurry to upgrade Presidency to a university before the polls and now it is in a hurry to fill up the vacant posts at CU. But you cant step out with a shopping bag and get 228 deserving candidates for teaching posts, said a senior university official.        
	The high-profile vacancies include the Ramtanu Lahiri, Rabindranath Tagore and Sarat Chandra professors in the Bengali department, Khaira professor in physics, Rashbehari Ghosh professor in applied mathematics and applied physics, Munshi Premchand professor in Hindi, Nilratan Sircar professor in zoology, Ambedkar chair in anthropology, Subhas Chandra Bose professor in political science and Asutosh professor in pure mathematics.        
	Of the 228 vacancies to be filled up, 61 are posts of professors, 53 of associate professors and 114 of assistant professors.        
	Advertisements seeking applications from suitable candidates for all these posts will be posted on the universitys website.        
	An official of the universitys recruitment wing said advertisements seeking applications for some of the 228 vacancies had been published earlier, but nobody was selected. The authorities kept the posts vacant citing the unavailability of suitable candidates, he added.        
	Students said they were worried about undeserving candidates making the cut if the government insisted that all the vacant posts be filled up in a hurry.        
	How can the authorities find suitable candidates in so many fields in such a short time? It will be a shame if politics takes precedence over academic excellence, said a student of physics.         
	TEACHING POSTS: 228        
	PROFESSORS: 61        
	ASSOCIATE PROFESSORS: 53        
	ASSISTANT PROFESSORS: 114        
	Chairs include: Rabindranath Tagore and Sarat Chandra professors in Bengali; Munshi Premchand professor in Hindi; Nilratan Sircar professor in zoology, Ambedkar chair in anthropology; Subhas Chandra Bose professor in political science and more

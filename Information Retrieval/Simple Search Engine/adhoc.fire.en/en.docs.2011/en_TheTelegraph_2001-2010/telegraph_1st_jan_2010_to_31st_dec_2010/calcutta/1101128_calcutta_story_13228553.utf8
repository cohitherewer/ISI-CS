	Jamini Roy has been hailed as one of the first Indian artists with a modernist sensibility who went back to the traditional pata paintings in search of an Indian identity.         
	Sona Dutta, a curator of the South Asia collection at the British Museum in London, has written a book titled Urban Patua, The Art of Jamini Roy, in which she narrates and analyses how a middle-class Bengali artist trained in the European tradition rejected fashionable trends prevailing in Calcutta art circles and brought the pictorial impact of indigenous artists into his own practice.         
	This at a time when Indian visual arts and sculpture were systematically denigrated in the West, and later the Bengal School was trying to create a pan-Asian style using the wash technique and by introducing Oriental motifs. Jamini Roy looked back at the crafts that were still alive in the villages, the terracotta temples of Bengal and Kalighat patas as well.         
	He, as Dutta said, brought these out of their original context and created highly contrived and sophisticated images. His paintings were Indian not in theme but in their technique and perception. There was a new emphasis on rhythm, she said, and Roy completed his mother and child painting in six sure and unwavering strokes. This signalled the advent of modern art in India.         
	Dutta also dwelt on how the poet Bishnu De and John Irwin, the head of Indian art at the Victoria amp; Albert Museum in London, promoted Roys art. While Dutta is a fluent speaker, she threw no new light on Roys art.         
	Her book, published by Marg, features works by Roy. It was launched at Oxford Bookstore on Friday evening.                   Avirook Sen

	Avirook Sens Looking for America tries to go beyond the familiar to discover a country many have not seen.        
	The seeds of the book were planted in my mind when I was in the US in 2002 for work, about the time of the first anniversary of 9/11. I was sitting with a friend in Brooklyn and he told me how the morning after 9/11 he had found this burnt fragment of an office memo on his terrace, said Sen, a journalist for 20 years.         
	In May 2008 I went back for a month. I saw roads in disrepair, people losing jobs, malls closing. The big election was also around the corner and I felt that I should be back to capture America during that election and the recession, he added.         
	He went back again in September, travelled, spoke to people, tried to link the places with popular culture. The book, published by HarperCollins India, was released in the city on November 19 by US consul-general Beth Payne at the American Center library. Payne also read excerpts from the book.         
	Sen insisted that while writing the book, the journalist was kept firmly away. If I was doing a purely reporting job, the book wouldnt have been this. But the journalist in him was puritanical about accuracy.         
	The same attention to detail was given to choosing the cover. I wanted an iconic American thing, said the writer who finally chose the image of a Campbells soup can. He was asked how much Campbell soup he had in the US. I stopped at the first can, he shot back.        
	His next book will be fiction, set in Calcutta, said the Gurgaon-based Sen, whose hometown is Calcutta.

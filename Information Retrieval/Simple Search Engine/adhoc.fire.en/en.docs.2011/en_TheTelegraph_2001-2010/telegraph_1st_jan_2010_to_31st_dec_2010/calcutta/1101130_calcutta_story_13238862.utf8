  - Herd booked, not rallyists        TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          A police vehicle intercepts a herd of goats near Chandni Chowk Metro station on Monday morning for disrupting rush-hour traffic on CR Avenue, around 200 metres from where the Left Front held a traffic-choker rally.   (Pictures by Sanat Kr. Sinha)                  Higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhury addresses the Left Front teachers rally on Monday.				                                                         
	Calcutta police sheepishly rounded up a herd of goats and their minders for holding up traffic on Monday while letting the two-legged rally brigade choke the city centre.        
	Five men were shepherding the 200-strong herd of goats back to Tiretta Bazar after grazing them on the Maidan in the morning when the police intercepted them on CR Avenue and charged them with trespassing on a thoroughfare under Section 66 and Clause 4 of the Calcutta Police Act.         
	The arrests coincided with the Left Fronts sixth traffic-choker rally in as many days along with a procession by the Trinamul-backed Madrasah Students Union that culminated in a congregation on Rani Rashmoni Avenue.        
	The goats were moving along CR Avenue when we intercepted them near Chandni Chowk. The five goatherds were arrested but the goats were returned to their owners after they reported at the police station later in the day, said an officer at Bowbazar police station.        
	But the goats, who would probably have been better off saying baa baa to speeches at the Metro Channel rally than heading home during rush hour, got their revenge.         
	As the goatherds were being questioned, the four-legged army waiting outside started chewing on everything within reach  motorbike seat covers, chair upholstery, even official documents piled up in the process section just across the stairs of the police station.  
	Such was the commotion outside the police station that officers had no hesitation in letting the goats go with their owners as soon as the custodians arrived from Tiretta Bazar.         
	For the five goatherds, the only chance of a reprieve could come when they are produced in court.         
	Lawyers said all five would probably be freed by the court on Tuesday as Section 66 of the Calcutta Police Act is a bailable one.               
	We have been allotted areas on the Maidan for grazing and we pay a fee to the army for that. We were never arrested for herding cattle through a street before, complained one of the goatherds.        
	An officer said the goats were rounded up and their minders arrested in accordance with a special order by the joint commissioner of police (traffic) to take suitable action against those letting animals loose on thoroughfares.         
	So are Calcutta streets set to be rid of stray cattle, if not the traffic-choker rally brigade? Animals cannot be allowed to roam free on the roads as that is dangerous both for them and human traffic, joint commissioner of police (traffic) Vineet Goyal said.        
	According to police rules, cattle can be herded through city roads only before sunrise and after sunset.                     
	Debasish Chakraborty of Compassionate Crusaders Trust, an animal rights group, said he would be happier if the police proved their impartiality by showing the same strictness when it came to removing human impediments.         
	Benazir Suraiya of PETA India said her organisation was all for banishing animals from thoroughfares to save them from harm, but wouldnt say whether the law should be applicable also to those who impinge on our freedom of movement. Goats should not be walking the city streets. Many end up getting hit by cars, argued Benazir.

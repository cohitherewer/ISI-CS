  - Death of young footballer rings alarm bells          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Fewer people have fallen prey to dengue in the city compared with last year but preventive measures and timely treatment of the disease remain vital as the death of a young footballer has shown.        
	According to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), 93 dengue cases were detected between January and August, against 120 during the same period last year.        
	No case of haemorrhagic dengue has been detected this year and no one has died of the disease in the CMC area so far, said a civic official on Friday.         
	Tollygunge Agragami footballer Ashesh Das, who died of dengue on Wednesday night, lived in Maslandapur in North 24-Parganas. The 25-year-old had high fever for a week but, according to club coach Ranjan Chowdhury, was reluctant to get treated. He had been first admitted to Habra State General Hospital and then to a private hospital in Barasat, where he died.        
	Since dengue virus is associated with other infections, one should be extremely careful. The overlapping of infections make things complicated, said Amitabha Nandi, the director of the Centre of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, Calcutta.        
	A person suffering from fever with symptoms of dengue should immediately go to a physician and get blood tests done, added Nandi.         
	Dengue manifests as fever accompanied by headache, muscle and joint pain, pain in the eyes and rashes. A haemorrhagic rash characterised by bright red pinpoint spots might appear later. Gastritis, along with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, is another symptom.         
	In case of haemorrhagic dengue, a patients platelet count falls. If the platelet count dips below 10,000 cu/mm, there is a chance of bleeding and one needs immediate transfusion of platelets, said critical care expert Subrata Maitra.         
	Secondary bacterial infection, which accompanies dengue, can be fatal if left untreated, Maitra added.         
	According to experts, people must not allow water to accumulate in their neighbourhood, must sleep in mosquito nets and avoid mosquito bites during the day. The dengue season stretches till November, said a health department official.

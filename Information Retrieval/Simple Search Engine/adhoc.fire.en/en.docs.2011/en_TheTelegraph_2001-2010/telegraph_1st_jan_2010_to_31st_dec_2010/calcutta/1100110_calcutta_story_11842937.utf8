The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rip Van Winkle in new Delhi
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rip Van Winkle in new Delhi
										      SAJNI MUKHERJI      Autumn Flush                        Flyovers and the Metro rail have changed the face of New Delhi (PTI)				                           
	I was in Delhi recently or the National Capital Region as it now pompously refers to itself. It seems amazing that I lived and worked in these parts in the 1970s. JNU left the old National Academy of Administration campus during my stay there and moved backwards and up the hill. Friends had just started moving to the palatial quarters there. I thought I knew the area like the back of my hand. While I normally resist most of the stereotypes of aging, when I return to south Delhi now I feel a close kinship with Rip Van Winkle.        
	Rip Van Winkle as you know was this feckless lazy person who had to find ways to escape from a wife who naturally wished him to be less so. On one such occasion he found a secret nook, fell asleep there and woke up 20 years later.         
	There is a wish fulfilment dream in this story somewhere that I do not wish to address at this point in time. The problem when he woke up was that everything had changed so much that he did not know where he was and worse, no one knew who he was either. If a married daughter hadnt taken him in, he would have had nowhere to go.         
	Unlike Rip I have been in and out of Delhi these many years and cannot claim to have been asleep throughout. However I wake up afresh to the bewildering changes in the urban landscape each time and feel utterly lost: new flyovers, bus corridors, the Delhi Metro construction make me lose my bearings.         
	Across the Yamuna things are even more confusing. Where there were fields before, and only melons to be bought in summer, there are now thickly peopled housing enclaves, miniature forests lining the road, office complexes, more flyovers, a bewildering range of supermarkets and malls. Most often the approach to these glitzy places is over unmade roads and walking paths, terrifying if you are a little wobbly on your legs.         
	An expensive restaurant where you go all dressed up has hurdles from the size of a pea to those the size of a boulder. You hold on for dear life to any young person or orthopaedic equipment handy all the way in.        
	With the great and controversial Commonwealth Games ahead, the frenzy is overwhelming: residential flats, hotel spaces are being prepared at a hectic pace, not just for the sportsmen but all the ancillary groups who will be in attendance. The dust, cement and other toxic stuff in the atmosphere is deadly. Dont go anywhere near Delhi if you suffer from asthma or other bronchial condition.         
	With so many roads barricaded or reduced in size to carry on the construction work, the traffic is awful. We renamed August Kranti Marg Klanti Marg because we spent so much time on it.        
	But having had my whinge about the place let me say I was most impressed by the changes in the transport system, which will be wholly in place by the time the Games begin. Every new bus has a flexible ramp to allow wheelchair or orthopaedic walker access, every train station on the Metro is equipped with escalators or elevators and also ramps to every compartment.         
	This was heartening to see. Perhaps some enterprising person/s in the HRD ministry, the transport authorities, and the Railways could run an orientation or refresher course for conductors and operators on the right code of behaviour towards those in need of such facilities, whether elderly, disabled or both.         
	Theoretically a disabled person is allowed free access to all public vehicles. However at a public hearing for women with disabilities held on the Jadavpur University campus a couple of years ago, we heard many such unfortunate women complain about the jeers and jibes they are regularly subjected to by conductors on public transport, if they stop for them at all. Of course they spoke about transport operators in West Bengal. My wish fulfilment dream would be the institution of such courses and such vehicles everywhere in the country.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Do-it-now prod for go-slow projects
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Do-it-now prod for go-slow projects
                                          
	Calcutta police are desperate to reclaim some dug-up and barricaded thoroughfares, setting a monsoon deadline for civic agencies to speed up go-slow projects that have slammed the brakes on traffic. Metro visits the project sites to identify the problem points.              
	Rawdon Street-AJC Bose Road crossing        
	The construction of a ramp on the northern side of the AJC Bose Road flyover has blocked this key intersection for months, forcing traffic diversions that trigger snarls along the arteries.         
	The HRBC, which had started by sealing off a small portion of the thoroughfare, has now extended the barricades till the western flank, beyond Mouchak.        
	Impact: Buses and other heavy vehicles are currently barred from entering AJC Bose Road, along the La Martiniere schools, beyond Rawdon Street.        
	With another stretch being barricaded, this route might soon become out of bounds for even smaller vehicles. South-bound vehicles coming via the Mullickbazar-Park Street crossing would also run into heavy snarls.        
	AJC Bose Road in front of Creek Row        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has barricaded a portion near the intersection for rehabilitation of sewers.         
	Impact: Movement of vehicles towards Sealdah from Entally crossing takes a beating with the road space reduced to less than half near the site. Cars headed towards Creek Row from AJC Bose Road have been barred from taking a right turn. Vehicles heading north from Entally would bear the brunt of the monsoon slush.                
	APC Roy Road between Rajabazar and Prachi        
	The CMC has blocked the middle of the thoroughfare to lay a sewer line.        
	Impact: Sealdah-bound buses dont face problems because there is a dedicated bus bay but cars jostle for space beside the barricade. The traffic mess gets worse when classes give over at the nearby Victoria Institution.                
	APC Roy Road near the intersection with Kalachand Sanyal Lane        
	As you cross Khanna and move towards Shyambazar, the entire eastern flank is a sewer in progress. Work officially began on October 22 last year and was supposed to be completed in 90 days.        
	Impact: Vehicles emerging from Kalachand Sanyal Lane are unsighted by the barricades. Construction activity has even choked the drains, say residents of the area.              
	Surya Sen Street        
	Work on the sewer near the intersection with Raja Rammohan Sarani started on December 12 and was to be completed within 90 days but the stretch is still blocked.        
	Impact: Traffic crawls down Surya Sen Street because the barricaded sewer is in the middle. Rain makes the road slippery with slush.              
	Copspeak: We need to clear these roads fast. Work cant go on endlessly, says deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Banerjee.        
	CMCspeak: I am not aware of any letter (from Lalbazar). We need to take stock of the work thats underway before deciding whether it can be expedited, says mayoral council member Firhad Hakim.        
	HRBCspeak: We have permission to carry out work till December 2010. Its not feasible to throw open the stretch near Rawdon Street, says vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee.

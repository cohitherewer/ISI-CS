	Two thefts were reported on the outskirts of the city on Friday.        
	Gold ornaments of about 70 grams, silver utensils and cash were stolen from a Kali temple in Balitikuri in Howrah around Thursday midnight. The temple priest, Swarna Chakraborty, discovered the theft early on Friday.        
	Besides the jewellery and utensils the thieves stole the money that was kept in the donation box, said Chakraborty.        
	Residents said it was the second theft in the temple in the last two years. They blocked the road in front of the temple from 6am to 7am protesting police inaction. Officers of Jagacha police station said they were looking into the matter.        
	Another early morning robbery was reported from Titagarh on Friday. Eight armed men broke into the house of Iqbal Alam, a contractor, and fled with cash and jewellery worth about Rs 2 lakh.        
	The thieves, wearing black masks, woke him up at gunpoint around 2am, said Alam. They took the keys of the cupboard and decamped with cash and jewellery that I had bought a few days ago for Id, he added.        
	The thieves locked the Alam family inside a room and left with the booty that also included electronic gadgets like a CD player and three mobile phones. Neighbours rescued the Alams after hearing their cries. Officers of Titagar police station suspect a local gang is behind the theft.

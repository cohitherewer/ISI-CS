                                 Grim slim: Regarding the report Size-zero craze gives parents   sleepless nights, September 14, I agree that teenagers often seem too   conscious about their figure. While girls are going overboard with their diet plans to get a figure like Shilpa Shetty (picture above) or Bipasha   Basu, even boys are losing sleep over putting on weight. However,   I dont agree with the view that working parents hardly get a chance to look after their kids eating habits.			   Neera Fogla, Maniktala     
	After reading the report Woof and wag under viral attack, September 9, I was impressed that Metro cares about our best friends  dogs.             
	Weather conditions have a severe impact on pets and since they cannot tell us what is bothering them, it is our responsibility to take care of them.           
	I have seen many people keep pets but they do not bother to take them to the vet. Some dont even maintain proper sanitary conditions for their dogs at home.           
	Monideepa Dutta, Kasba                       
	In Bengal we need new leaders, preferably young, dynamic and motivational, with a clear vision about the strengths of the state. We are often conscious about our rights but forget our duties. We must talk less and work hard to uplift the brand image of Bengal (Buddha hires a brand guru, September 10).             
	But we must remember that sectoral transformation is underway and more and more people from disadvantageous sections are being excluded from the development process. Inclusion must be done seriously to avoid division of people between haves and have-nots. Otherwise we are bound to face the problem of growth-without-development. West Bengal will shine but our Paschim Banga will lag behind.

	I beg to differ with adman Prahlad Kakkars statement (Lets talk brand Bengal  at Writers, June 25) that Bengalis are a race who like to argue, are snobbish and portray themselves as culturally superior.           
	We, as a race, really like to argue because its the only way the common man can be heard in todays world. We are snobs because we have a rich history of people who worked for India both before and after Independence  Amartya Sen, Mohammed Yunus (Bangladeshi Bengali), Pranab Mukherjee and Jyoti Basu, to name just a few.           
	Speaking of the dying Coffee House and a waning intelligentsia, I would like to ask Mr Kakkar: have you ever read books by Bengali writers of the 21st century?           
	Last but not the least, football. Do you know that in this nation of 120 crore people, we are a breed apart, a people that regularly fill up the stadiums whenever there is a football match?           
	Rahul Chakravarty, Address not given           
	Its a bit tragic that things have come to such a pass that we need to requisition the expertise of a foreign national to resurrect our own image, culture, heritage and identity!           
	Sceptics may find a tacit electoral compulsion behind such a massive image-building endeavour. But the way our state and its people are being portrayed in other parts of our own country (let alone overseas), it is for ourselves to see where our snobbery, opportunism and our tendency to enrich every other people with our treasured wisdom have led us.           
	Our suicidal acts, coupled with the vested interest, nepotism and negative attitudes of some have given Bengal the brand of a standstill state.           
	It is for brand consultant Wally Olins to decide the course of action. But there has to be a consensus within the political fraternity that we would never ever indulge in any other bandh for any reason, whatsoever.           
	Indranil Banerjee, Dunlop           
	Prahlad Kakkars said: theres no industry left in Bengal with driving the Tatas out.           
	The question is: who drove them out? Definitely not Mamata Banerjee. Even if her Singur agitation had not happened, the Tatas would have left sooner or later, given the virulent brand of trade unionism prevalent in Bengal.           
	It wont be surprising if Buddhas showpiece IT industry also follows suit. No effort towards building Brand Bengal will work without a thorough overhaul of work ethics, work culture and accountability in the state.           
	Amit Dutt, Keyatala Road           
	If you dont love your brand, if you do not rely on your brand, if you do not trust your brand then how will you build the image of that brand ? Our leaders love their party, not their state. And that is Bengals biggest problem.           
	Moreover, who will create the brand identity for Bengal? A great professional and brand builder like Wally Olins who does not have any idea of Bengal or its social and political situations? And if, by chance, some positive plan comes out, who will implement it? This state government? This exercise is nothing but a wastage of public money.           
	Mrityunjoy Chatterjee, Address not given    
	Health becomes a major worry for those who feast on fast food and street food every now and then.             
	It was shocking to read how street food poses a serious threat because of the poisonous colours used (Colour culprit in street food faves, September 14). Kudos to Metro for exposing the practice and making us aware of the ill-effects of having such food items. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation needs to be more vigilant in this regard and should instruct food inspectors to curb the sale of sub-standard food.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Son suspect in engineer murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A septuagenarian former PWD engineer was found strangulated and bludgeoned to death with his mentally challenged engineer son sitting next to him in their Sinthee home on Wednesday evening.         
	Preliminary investigation suggests Hiralal Mukherjee, 76, was killed by his son. We have detained him, said deputy commissioner (north) Biswarup Ghosh. The accused, Bhaskar, had studied engineering at Jadavpur University.         
	Hiralals wife Mukul, 70, was rescued from a small room on the roof of the two-storey building, where Bhaskar had apparently locked her up.        
	Hiralals screams for help alerted neighbours on Wednesday evening. They called the police. When personnel from Sinthee police station reached the 5/48/1 Dum Dum Road house, the old man was lying lifeless.         
	Investigating officers found strangulation marks on Hiralals throat and a wound in his head that probably resulted from a blow with a blunt weapon.         
	An officer said Hiralal was strangulated with a towel and then hit on the head. The towel apparently used by the killer was lying next to the body.        
	Mukul is also mentally challenged. She kept reciting Tagores poetry and quoting the Bhagwad Gita when we reached her. She had done her masters in Bengali. She even told us that her daughter had died of diarrhoea in 2009 but that needs to be verified, said an officer.         
	Electrocuted: Sujit Chakrabarty died of electrocution while he was fitting a lamp inside a Kali Puja pandal in Agarpara on Tuesday night. Police said the 27-year-old electrician was working without switching off the line. He was declared dead on arrival at Balaram Seva Mandir.         
	Found hanging: Aurobindo Biswas, 28, was found hanging from the ceiling of the staircase of Beliaghata ID Hospital, where he was undergoing treatment, on Monday. He died later.

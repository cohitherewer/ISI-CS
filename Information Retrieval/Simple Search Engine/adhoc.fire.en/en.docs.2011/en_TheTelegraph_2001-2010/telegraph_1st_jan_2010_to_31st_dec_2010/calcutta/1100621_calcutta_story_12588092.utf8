                      Music and world unity                    Music is perhaps one of the few forces that brings the world together even in this age of terror, chaos and violence. Folk music, the mother of all forms, has given birth to various genres of music, including classical forms. To celebrate World Music Day, You amp; I... presents a concert that will explore and discover in a way, perhaps never attempted before, how the different genres are linked to and influenced by one another. It is an opportunity for true music connoisseurs to learn how songs of the Bengal soil are related to Hindustani classical ragas, or how a Bengali folk song can trace its roots to a Carnatic classical thillana. It depicts how an opera can echo the same emotions of a thumri of Varanasi and how Tagores lyrics were ignited by a dhrupad. It is, ultimately, a programme that seeks to forge friendship and universal brotherhood through music. Participants: Sraboni Sen (Tagore songs), Lopamudra Mitra (Bengali folk songs), Mohua Das (Western classical), Bertie Da Silva (English pop and country songs), Nipobithi Ghosh (English, African and Bavarian folk songs), Kartick Das Baul (baul songs), and You amp; I... membersSoumyajit Das (vocals) and Sourendro Mullick (piano). West Bengal Governor M.K. Narayanan will be the chief guest and light the lamp of world unity.                  Event: Concert to mark World Music Day When: Today; 6.30 pm onwards Where: G.D.

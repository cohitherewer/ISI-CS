The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teen body in tank
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Teen body in tank
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The decomposed body of a 17-year-old student was found in the septic tank of his friends house, a stones throw from his own home, in Sonarpur on Monday.        
	Abhijit Biswas, who studied in Class XI, was last seen going to school on December 8. Preliminary investigation suggests he was strangulated and then the body was dumped in the tank.        
	The 17-year-old in whose house the body was found and another resident of the area, 21-year-old Rabin Sardar, were detained in this connection.         
	Cops suspect the murder was the fallout of an alleged affair between Rabin and Abhijits sister. Rabin probably asked the detained teenager to call Abhijit to his place and then murdered him, said an officer.         
	A foul smell from the house of the detained teenager, who was Abhijits classmate till last year, prompted the residents to alert policemen.        
	We are awaiting the post-mortem report, said L.N. Meena, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police.

					      Todays question: Should annual exams give way to continuous evaluation through unit tests?                    Students write a paper for ICSE in a central Calcutta school

	Continuous and comprehensive evaluation gives students enough opportunity to prepare their lessons. Students will have to study in detail as the syllabus of unit tests would only be a few chapters. But despite the merits of the continuous evaluation system, it cannot replace the annual examination. The annual exam is the only test where students are asked to write answers worth 90 or 100 marks at one go. They have to give descriptive answers along with short notes and objective questions. So a teacher gets plenty of opportunity to judge a students preparedness and grasp of each subject. Besides, students also have to memorise the entire syllabus taught throughout the year. I think annual exams and unit tests should go hand in hand.                  INDRANIL SANYAL, 
  Dhakuria									      
	Unit tests must be reduced to a considerable extent. The evaluation pattern should consist of four examinations at periodic intervals  two unit tests at six months interval and two major examinations, like half-yearly and annual, at a six-month frequency. This will allow students to breathe easy and have time to prepare for the tests. Annual exams should be the final yardstick to evaluate a students performance. The marks obtained in the unit tests must be added to the annual marks at the year-end.                   AMAR RAY,
  Rishra,									      
	Continuous evaluation through unit tests is a unique way to prepare and test students. It helps them study each subject in detail. But after getting used to objective questions in unit tests it becomes difficult for the students to answer descriptive questions. The scope of including broad questions is limited in unit tests. Therefore students find it difficult to answer descriptive questions in annual examinations. Teachers also cannot provide suitable guidelines because they are busy through the year setting question papers and evaluating answer scripts.                   SOMESH NANDI,

	The continuous evaluation system would be fruitful if accompanied by revision tests at regular intervals. This would enable a student to study each chapter properly. In my school life, I remember leaving out more than one chapter during annual exams or scanning through chapters very quickly on the night before the exam. With unit tests I think every student will be able to cover the whole syllabus at a slower pace. One should be judged on how much he has learned and understood from a chapter instead of how much marks he has got in the exam.                BABITA SINGHAL, 
  Howrah									      
	Continuous evaluation of the students through unit tests is necessary. It not only lessens the burden on the examinee but also brings out his true ability. It is obviously better than the system of annual exams.                KAUSIK BAG, 
  Narendrapur									      
	Unit tests must be implemented up to the higher secondary standard in schools. Half-yearly, annual or semester-type exams allow students merely a months preparation, but unit tests engage students in studies continually through the year. The tests also make a student aware of his/her lack of knowledge in the subject and give opportunity to prepare again.                 HEMJIT PAUL, 
  Behala									      
	Since unit tests are conducted on a few chapters of a subject, students find it easier to prepare thoroughly. It helps them develop a clear concept of the subject. In case of annual exams students get tensed because of the huge syllabus. That affects their performance. Considering the benefits from a students point of view, I feel only a certain percentage of the annual exam should be reflected in the total evaluation, the rest should be judged by performance in the unit tests.                 CHIRAG MANDAL, 
  Belur									      
	The present system of unit tests throughout the year, with an annual exam rounding it off, is absolutely perfect. There is really no need of scrapping the annual exam as it tests the students over a vast syllabus which the unit tests do not. Moreover, with the Madhyamik exams still to be tackled students must not lose their habit of writing exams based on the full syllabus. But if the government goes for a radical change in the system and scraps the Class X Board exam then the idea of doing away with the annual exams might not be bad.                AMRITA MALLIK,

	Continuous evaluation through unit tests can never replace or substitute annual exams in schools. Annual exams mark a step towards future studies and career, it is synonymous with promotion to a new class and new books. It pressures students to study hard so that the overall results are satisfactory. Continuous unit tests fail to impose this pressure on students. In the absence of annual exams it will be like playing scores of international cricket tournaments without the World Cup!                BASUDEB BHATTACHARYA, 
  Salt Lake									      
	Unit test is a farce in any class and with 45 to 55 students sitting huddled together and whispering answers to each other and copying from each others books. Doing away with the annual examination completely and replacing it with unit tests will not be in the larger academic interests of students. I feel that unit tests should be continued along with the two terminal examinations and then the annual exam. In the annual exam, question papers should be set on each subject covering the whole course without repeating the questions set in the unit tests and terminal tests.                ROHINI MOHAN, 
  Address not mentioned									      
	Annual exams, half-yearly exams or term-end exams are all horrors to the mediocre student. Unit tests are a non-stop method of making them study properly. They can make students brighter, smarter and more confident.                NAREN SEN, 
  Ramrajatala, Howrah									      
	Annual exams and unit tests are co-related. Instant success encourages the child to do better. Unit tests can also help the teachers and guardians assess the students performance and ability. The annual exams, on the other hand, make students retain and produce the whole years studies within a stipulated time. It can also be noted that annual exams should complement unit tests and should not be done away with altogether.            
	ASMITA GUPTA,
  Dum Dum    Annual exams are conducted to test a students overall development. If they are substituted by unit tests students may start taking their education lightly. Annual exams are like a passport to higher education. A students attitude towards studies may be affected if annual exams are replaced by unit tests.         
	TITAS GHOSH,

	It is difficult to answer in yes or no because continuous evaluation through unit tests has its benefits. Unit tests help students keep up with the lessons taught in school regularly. It thus prevents the night-long mugging up immediately before final exams and in the process helps reduce stress on the day of the term-end exam. But unit tests also increase the pressure of studies as students have to keep preparing for numerous tests and projects without a break.             RATHIN CHATTERJEE, 
  Dum Dum									      
	I believe unit tests and annual exams are equally important for the students as they prevent them from neglecting their studies and make them attend classes regularly. If a student fails to appear in the annual exam the unit test results help him get promotion to the next class.                  B.N. BOSE, 
  Dum Dum Park									      
	Annual exams create panic among students. Moreover, extra expenses on papers and other materials utilised in annual exams could also be saved. Unit tests would be a better option.                RIZWANA BEGUM,
  Salt Lake									      
	I think it is always better to evaluate a student through unit tests. This way, the student as well as the teachers can know for sure whether things are going well. A student will know whether he has understood the subject well. If he finds he has failed to do well in the test then he can quickly rectify his mistakes. And the teachers will know which student requires more attention. Annual exams do not give one any scope to redeem oneself.

	We do not have annual exams in our school. We report three times in a year but the evaluation is continuous. Even for the final term we make reports based on cumulative assessment. If there is an annual exam, children study only for a few days before that. Continuous evaluation makes for better learning.    
	Malini Bhagat
  Principal, Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School  
	I do not like the word examination as it creates stress on the child. I feel there should not be any test for the primary section and periodic assessment can be done of class work. Class VI onwards 60 per cent of the assessment can be based on classwork and there can be a 40-mark test at the year-end so that children can get used to both systems.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Classes few, exams many
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Classes few, exams many
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Students of Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri College agitated throughout Monday to protest the loss of classes because of the campus serving as a centre for Calcutta University exams over the past five months.         
	The protesters gheraoed principal Priyatosh Khan for several hours, organised demonstrations and boycotted classes to demand that the universitys LlB examinations, scheduled to begin on Tuesday, are not held in the Prince Anwar Shah Road college.         
	The LlB exams are supposed to be held on the campus between 10am and 5pm till September 23. Classes usually remain suspended in the college during university exams.        
	After nearly five months, normal classes had resumed in our college on August 3. Since April, the university authorities had held BA, BSc and BCom Part I, Part II and Part III examinations in our college, said Sounak Roy Choudhury, a leader of the Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad, which led the agitation.        
	Classes for BA, BSc and BCom general degree courses are held at Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri College between 10am and 5pm. Classes of Jogesh Chandra Choudhury Law College are held on the campus in the morning.        
	How can our teachers complete our syllabi if the college is used as an exam venue so often? We are the ones who will suffer if this continues, said an agitator. They wanted Khan to ensure that normal classes are held in the college during the LlB exams. Only two classrooms will be needed for it. So we will hold normal classes in the rest of the classrooms, said Khan.        
	Debashis Biswas, the universitys controller of examinations said it had no problems with the arrangement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Where wrong is right: D-I-Y guide to flouting rules and getting away with it
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Where wrong is right: D-I-Y guide to flouting rules and getting away with it
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	When in Calcutta, be-illegal-buy-illegal.        
	If you are a trader eyeing prime commercial space that you cant afford, consider buying a prime piece of pavement instead in the buy-one-get-an-identity-card-free pre-election sale.        
	If you are a transport operator saddled with a poison-spewing vehicle that you need to replace, why not get that illegal piece of junk declared roadworthy for a few thousand rupees instead of spending a few lakhs on a new one?        
	If you have inherited an old, litigated property to which you want to add floors, just take the illegal build-first-sanction-later route.        
	Metro draws up a D-I-Y (do-it-yourself) to go from street legal to illegal in 60 seconds to 60 days, depending on cash and clout.              
	If you are a hawker        
	Select a spot, set up shop and wait. A couple of cops will arrive sooner rather than later and ask you the standard question: Dont you know this is illegal?        
	The cops will drag you to the nearest police station, where an officer will threaten you with lock-up time if you are spotted inconveniencing pedestrians again. Read between the lines and the message is: Stay put but dont act smart.        
	The next day, a plainclothes messenger from the police station will visit you to say that he can try convincing borobabu (the officer-in-charge) if you are willing to pay the fee. How much? Rs 100 to Rs 1,000 per day, depending on which pavement you are doing business from.        
	Lalbazar comes calling next, with a rate card of Rs 75-100 per day. Then the political tout, who will ask you to visit the local party office or the hawker union. The pavement space is finally yours after you pay a non-refundable deposit, or caution money, ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 2 lakh.        
	If all this is too much trouble, a local tout can do everything on your behalf for a few thousand rupees extra. The pavement will still be profitable for the hawker because other than the average payout of Rs 250 per day, he has no other establishment cost, says Shaktiman Ghosh of the Hawkers Sangram Samiti.                
	If you are about to add an illegal floor         
	Your best bet for a pre-approved illegal extension is to directly meet the local councillor or his or her key person with the proposal. The advice would invariably be to go ahead.        
	A municipal inspector will visit you, check the plan and quote a service fee based on the size of the extension. The fee is meant to ensure that the stop-work notice reaches you only after you finish your construction.        
	The notice will also summon you to the civic body office, where a borough executive will formally forward your case for a hearing. Finally, an officially penalty will be fixed for you to pay along with a certain amount under the table. Congratulations, your illegal floor has just been regularised in the books.               
	If you need a fire-safe seal on your tinderbox        
	Welcome to the countrys only fire department functioning under a ministry, which presides over more violations of fire-safety norms than in any other city.        
	The average bribe for a fire-safety seal on a warehouse that stores inflammable material or a workshop in a residential area is upwards of Rs 20,000 per inspection. The revised rule that highrises and commercial establishments need to annually renew their fire-safety certificates  the period earlier varied from a year to five years  means more money must flow down the hose when your time for the annual visit comes.         
	According to officials, there are at least 10 fires in the city every week, almost 95 per cent of those triggered by violation of safety standards.        
	Long live, Nandram.                
	If you need a false certificate of roadworthiness         
	Drive down to the public vehicles department in Beltola, where palms are waiting to be greased through an army of touts who will mob you. Ki lagbe, dada? Licence, fitness certificate jaa achhe shob kore debo (What do you want? Will get everything done), is the refrain from the tout brigade.        
	According to an official, touts rule the roost in Beltola. They have manipulated the system in such a way that nobody can get any work done by bypassing them. Even if you manage to initiate the process, the officials will harass you so much that you will be left with no other option but to go to a tout, he adds.         
	The system benefits transport operators the most, helping them procure certificates of roadworthiness for a rickety goods van for as little as Rs 2,000 and an old bus for around Rs 4,500. Thats cheap for a licence to pollute.         
	If you own a banned auto        
	Put your foot back on the pedal to pollution after putting a few rupees in the policemans pocket.        
	Two-stroke autos are not only back on the streets of the city, they are threatening to outnumber the green, LPG-run ones in some areas. The katatel dens that were shut following the two-stroke ban are also back in business in many places, including Santoshpur, Jora Bridge, Kabardanga, Behala and Chanditala.         
	The price for this new lease of life for the two-stroke brigade is just a few hundred rupees per month, which is to be shared by the police and transport officials. And dont forget your donation to the autorickshaw union that has stood by you through this short-lived ban.        
	As for those who invested in new LPG autos thinking that the ban would be enforced, green is now only the colour of envy.               
	If you own a pool car         
	Relax until at least the elections next year because there is no sign of the government being in any hurry to regulate the business of ferrying more than 20,000 children to and from school every day.         
	Transport minister Ranjit Kundu may have set the ball rolling for licensing of pool cars last November but only around 1,100 of the 5,000 car owners in the city had applied for permits till March 31. A mere 15 of them have since received offer letters.         
	With the rules for licensing still cloaked in ambiguity and enforcement non-existent, pool car operators have nothing to fear  thats for the parents of schoolgoing children to feel.

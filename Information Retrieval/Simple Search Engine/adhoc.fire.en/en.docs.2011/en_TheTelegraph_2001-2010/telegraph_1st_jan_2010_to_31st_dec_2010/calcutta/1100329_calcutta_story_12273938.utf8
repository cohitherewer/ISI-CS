          AMIT UKIL                                              Ramshankar Prasad Sinha       
	Ramshankar Prasad Sinha, the arrested assistant of the Stephen Court manager, was a key mover behind shady deals linked with the address, according to residents.        
	Sinha, better known as Shankar, is the elder son of Sinhji, the original head durwan of Stephen Court.        
	Shankar says he was born on the premises about 60 years ago and was employed as pump operator of Stephen Court Ltd when he was 20. Over the years, he became the don of 18A Park Street, said several residents who have spent decades in the charred building.        
	Shankar had a hand in everything nefarious, from claiming a cut from each new tenant to helping create space that could be rented out without sanctions. He had a nexus with the owners and was sort of a don of Stephen Court, said dental surgeon Rajeev Butta, who grew up in Block III and now has a chamber there.        
	Shankar kept his eyes and ears open in the initial years. With the entry of Ranglal Bagaria (grandfather of co-owner Sanjay) in the mid-1950s as the lessee, the 32 flats in the four blocks of Stephen Court (with an average floor space of 3,500sq ft each) started being divided and sub-let, said Lalit Malhotra, whose father was the first Indian to move in as a tenant in 1948.         
	The surrogate ownership of floor space that followed, first the four original floors and then the illegal fifth and sixth floors, was replicated on a smaller scale by Shankar. He converted garage space into shops and the area around the spiral staircases at the back in two of the blocks to get additional floor space, said Butta. Tea stalls and eateries sprouted on the premises and vehicles from outside were allowed to park overnight in the garages.        
	Shankar allegedly blocked rainwater pipes and drains to create entrances for illegal shops in the parking lot. The water accumulates, especially during monsoon, leading to a stench and breeding of mosquitoes, said Lalits wife Rama Malhotra.        
	The managers assistant also used to collect money from the tenants for various maintenance work even though his employers used to pay him for the purpose every month. But he would not spend the entire amount and leave the job half-finished, she said.        
	Over the years, Shankar employed a large number of people from his native village in Bihar as plumbers, electricians and sweepers. He became a workers leader. The management was happy as long as there was no Stephen Court employees union. They just had to keep Shankar happy, Butta said.

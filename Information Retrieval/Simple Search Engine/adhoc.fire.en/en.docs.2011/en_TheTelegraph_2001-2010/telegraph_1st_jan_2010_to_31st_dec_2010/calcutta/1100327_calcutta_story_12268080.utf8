The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Samaritan sisters ease police woes
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Samaritan sisters ease police woes
          SUBHAJOY ROY                          Seher Nayeem and (right) Rachita Sahgal. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	Cousins Rachita Sahgal and Seher Nayeem came to Park Street on Friday hoping to be first in line to enter ravaged Stephen Court. Their turn never came, but they made sure many of those who lost everything in the blaze could go in and find something to salvage.        
	We came here around 7am but were told that we would be allowed in only a couple of hours later. We went back and came again around 9am, only to find a different task awaiting us, said Rachita, whose parents own an apartment in Stephen Court.        
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti apparently decided around 11am that someone from Stephen Court should help the cops manage the queue of residents anxious to go in after a three-day vigil, and the responsibility fell on Rachita and Sehers shoulders.        
	The cousins, both in their forties, spent the next few hours drawing up a list and convincing residents that those from the higher floors that bore the brunt of the blaze be allowed to go in first. Only two persons from a family were allowed in for half-an-hour each.         
	There was chaos at first with everyone demanding to be let in first. So we decided to compile a list of people who were waiting outside, based on which floor their apartments were on, said the New Delhi-based Rachita, who was on a flight to her hometown immediately after hearing about the Stephen Court tragedy.        
	My grandfather bought a flat here in 1948. My parents have lived here whenever they have been in Calcutta, and I did so till I got married in 1990, said Rachita.         
	Her cousin, who stays in Rawdon Street with her family, spent 20 years in Stephen Court. I lived there till I got married. My parents have been in Stephen Court for 56 years, said Seher.         
	Mother Rani Khanna, 74, was with Seher outside Stephen Court, eager to know whether flat number 11 on the second floor, which the two families share, was affected in any way.        
	So what prompted Rachita and Seher to put others above themselves on the day the gates to Stephen Court were opened for the first time since Tuesdays devastation?        
	We have been standing outside Stephen Court for the last three days. So we understood the mental state of all the people who came on Friday, especially those whose homes have been gutted, said Seher.        
	Her cousin said some residents were agitated on hearing about the time limit. We knew that those whose houses were on the top floors would be the most agitated. So we allowed them in first. They have lost almost everything, added Rachita.        
	The police admitted that it would have been difficult to maintain order without the duos help. The residents were restive after three days of waiting. They would react angrily to whatever the police said. We felt things would be better if we could involve some residents of the building, and the two ladies were of immense help, said an officer.         
	But the duo, who guided nearly 35 residents into the building, were left out of the list in the bargain. We waited till 2.30pm for our turn to come. But we were told that we would have to wait another day, said Seher.        
	The cousins hope to be first off the blocks on Saturday morning.        
	What residents saw        
	Champa Shah, staying at a relatives place in Alipore: We could not spend much time inside and rushed out with whatever valuables we could retrieve from the sixth-floor flat because of the stench of burnt objects and corpses.        
	Sunila Shah, staying with relatives in Hatibagan: The first thing we retrieved from our fifth-floor flat were idols of Lakshmi and Ganeshji. We also collected ornaments, clothes and my grand-daughters books. Some items were missing.        
	Pannalal Golcha, staying at a relatives place on Middleton Row: Everything has been destroyed in our fifth-floor flat except a steel almirah. Documents and jewellery stored in it have survived the blaze.                    WITH INPUTS FROM IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

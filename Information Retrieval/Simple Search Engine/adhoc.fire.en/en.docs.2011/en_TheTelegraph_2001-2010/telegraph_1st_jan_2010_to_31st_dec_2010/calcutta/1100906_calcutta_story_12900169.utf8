The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain of bottles in political clash
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rain of bottles in political clash
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Cops at the site of Sundays clash. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Malapara in Jorabagan turned into a battlefield on Sunday as supporters of the Congress and the Trinamul Congress hurled soda bottles and bricks at each other for over three hours.         
	According to cops, trouble started when some men, who support Trinamul, made fun of a group of Congress supporters who had turned up at Jorabagan police station to demand the release of a youth arrested on Saturday night.         
	Suddenly, about 20 people standing on opposite sides of the road outside the police station started throwing soda bottles and bricks. Nobody could understand what was happening but everybody ran for cover, said Madhuri Singh, a resident of the area who was buying groceries from a shop at the time.        
	At one point, it seemed it was raining bottles. Even we had to run for cover. Only after additional men reached the spot could we control the situation, said an officer of the police station.        
	The root of the clash lay in an argument on Saturday evening. While drinking near a temple in Malapara, a local youth had slapped another one. Because they happened to support separate parties, the matter turned serious, said a resident.        
	Hela Pappu, the Congress supporter who was allegedly slapped, went to the neighbouring locality where he lives and returned with some youths to the scene of the dispute. They allegedly attacked the other group, made up of Trinamul supporters.        
	The police arrived at the spot half an hour later and restored order. Soon after, residents blocked Jadu Nath Mullick Road blaming a youth named Pappu Singh for the clash and demanding his arrest. Singh was picked up at night.         
	Hela Pappu and his associates were demonstrating at the police station on Sunday morning seeking Singhs release when members of the other group allegedly teased them. We have arrested 11 people in connection with the violence, said Biswarup Ghosh, the deputy commissioner (north division).

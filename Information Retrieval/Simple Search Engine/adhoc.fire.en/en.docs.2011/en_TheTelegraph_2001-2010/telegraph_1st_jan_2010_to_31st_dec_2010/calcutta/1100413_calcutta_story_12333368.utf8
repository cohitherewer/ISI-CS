The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | High-noon nudge to schools
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      High-noon nudge to schools
  - Time respite for tots        OUR BUREAU                          A little boy quenches his thirst with a helping hand from his mother while the other waits for his turn on a sweltering Monday afternoon. Picture by Aranya Sen                                              
	The government has asked all state-aided primary schools to ring the closing bell by noon from Tuesday till the end of the month to spare tiny tots the twin torment of heat and power cuts.        
	The decision, taken on Monday, could be extended to students of state-aided secondary schools depending on the Celsius readings over the next few days and a review of the situation by the school education department.        
	As of now, no state-aided school should be stretching its primary classes beyond noon till April 30. A circular has been sent to the district primary councils, directing them to ensure that schools hold only morning classes for primary students, said Dibyen Mukherjee, the director of school education.        
	Private schools in the city are also considering rescheduling their timings if the weather stays oppressive.        
	We have already installed a generator to give our students a respite from the power cuts. But we might need to change the school timings as well if the 40-plus wave continues, said Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School.        
	Many schools that started their new academic sessions last week are, however, reluctant to shrink study time.        
	Summer vacations are due next month, and curtailing classes now would mean playing catch-up for the rest of the year. It wont be possible for our teachers to complete the syllabus within the stipulated time if classes are suspended for a prolonged period, said Nabarun Dey, the principal of Central Modern School in north Calcutta.        
	But Dey did hold out hope for heat-struck students, saying he wouldnt rule out altering the school timings if there is no sign of relief in the next few days.        
	Like last year, most private institutions might ultimately opt for early starts to minimise the impact of the heat on students. Little children are more susceptible to dehydration and heat-related illnesses than the rest. So you have to make allowances for them, if not for the higher classes, said a teacher of a south Calcutta school.         
	Parent Pooja Singhania got a taste of what lies ahead on Monday. My son, who studies in Class III, returned from school feeling weak and dizzy. He was also suffering from stomach cramps. Our family doctor said it was a case of heat-induced exhaustion, she said.        
	So will Pooja send her child to school if Tuesday is just as hot?        
	I do hope that my sons school changes the timings or declares a holiday till this unbearable phase of heat and power cuts ends, she said.        
	Keya Sinha, the principal of Vivekananda Mission School, said her staff was trying to keep students from stepping out in the heat to play. Children insist on playing outdoors even if the sun is blazing, not realising that they could fall sick. But we try to keep them indoors as much as possible.         
	Vivekananda Mission School might consider advancing its summer holidays if a Norwester or rain doesnt lower temperatures by next week.         
	Calcutta had faced four abnormal spells of heat last year, including one in June that forced the government to declare all primary, secondary and higher secondary institutions in the state closed for three days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU results turn focus on seat crunch
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CU results turn focus on seat crunch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Around 98 per cent of the examinees have cleared Calcutta Universitys BA, BSc and BCom Part III (honours) exams, the impressive figure bringing into focus once again the seat crunch in the institutes postgraduate courses.        
	Of the 36,600 students who passed the exams, the results of which were declared on Thursday, 4,022 have scored first-class marks (60 per cent or more).        
	In contrast, there are only around 5,000 postgraduate seats in CU in the arts, science and commerce streams and another 1,000 in the 18 colleges running masters courses.        
	This years pass percentages in the honours category are 99.43, 97.95 and 97.89 in arts, science and commerce, respectively. In 2009, the figures were marginally higher  99.68, 99.35 and 99.34 per cent.        
	There is a marginal drop in the pass percentage compared with last year, but the overall performance is extremely good in all three streams, Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of the university, said after the results were announced.        
	The official, in the same breath, also hinted at the flip side of such performance, saying: Like last year, many high-scorers might not be able to get a berth in the postgraduate course of their choice.        
	Too many applicants vying for too few postgraduate seats have prompted the university to consider asking the affiliated colleges to upgrade their infrastructure and teaching standards and open masters courses.                                
	The crisis, however, has prompted a large number of students to seek admissions in postgraduate courses in institutes of other states such as JNU, Delhi University and Benaras Hindu University. Realising the crisis I had applied in JNU. I am happy that I have been able to manage a seat there, said a BA (honours) student of Presidency College.         
	The upward trend in success not being new, the university, fearing the crisis of seats even this year, has already held inspection in seven colleges for granting them autonomy to run postgraduate courses from this year.        
	Nearly 18 colleges including some of the reputed ones like Presidency, Bethune, Brabourne, Scottish Church, Maulana Azad and of course St Xaviers, which was once a CU affiliate is now an autonomous college, run postgraduate courses at present.        
	There are however, large number colleges under CU which are ill-equipped and do not have the facilities to even offer the undergraduate courses properly.        
	In order to run postgraduate courses, an institution needs to have adequate numbers of qualified teachers. Those wanting to run masters programme in science must have laboratories equipped with modern instruments and gadgets, libraries with collection of large number of reference books and most importantly research facilities.        
	 We understand that considering the increasing number of students passing the undergraduate exams every year, opening masters programmes in as many colleges as possible can be the easiest solution for the university to cope with the seat crunch. But the university should be cautious before allowing any ill-equipped college to run postgraduate courses, said a senior teacher of CUs Rajabazar Science College.         
	Chatterjee, however, said that they were aware of the problem and they are granting permissions to colleges to run postgraduate courses after a rigorous screening process.        
	 Since the demand for postgraduate seats is increasing, we are regularly keeping in touch with the colleges and advising them to ask for suggestion from us for upgrading their facilities, said Chatterjee.         
	The University Grants Commission (UGC) offers a number of schemes for upgrading of colleges. CU authorities are assisting the colleges to make it easier for them to avail such grants from UGC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chief justice in empty court
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Chief justice in empty court
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court Chief Justice M.S. Shah refused to leave his courtroom on Tuesday afternoon following a sudden decision by lawyers to abstain from proceedings to mourn the death of a colleague.        
	Chief Justice Shah was in his seat from 2pm to 3.30pm without a single lawyer turning up to argue a case.        
	Members of the courts bar association met during recess and passed a resolution to stay away from the courtrooms for the rest of the day. Two other lawyers organisations  Bar Library Club and Incorporate Law Society  also made similar decisions.        
	After recess, as the judges were returning to their courtroom, a group of lawyers told them about their decision. All the judges, except Chief Justice Shah, left their courtrooms. The chief justice declared that he would not accept the sudden decision by the lawyers.        
	The incident, the second of its kind, has tarnished the dignity of the court. The lawyers had recently boycotted the chief justices court after he refused to allow the court proceedings to be suspended after recess to mourn the death of a lawyer, said Saradindu Biswas, a senior advocate and a member of the executive committee of the state bar council.         
	The chief justice feels that a lawyers death should not be mourned by grossly hampering the functioning of the court. He has said lawyers could abstain from proceedings for an hour after 3.30pm to mourn a colleagues death, said a senior official.        
	The chief justice also wants lawyers to follow a norm for the process, added the official.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      NRS tree fell defies tender amp; contract
          JAYANTA BASU                           Chopped tree trunks at NRS Medical College and Hospital. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	The felling of 30-odd trees for beautification of a pond at NRS Medical College amp; Hospital was in violation of the conditions laid down in the tender and the agreement with a private contractor.        
	Clause 22 in the tender document released on October 10, 2009, stated: No trees in the bank areas of the lake to be cut in the process of beautification.        
	Clause 14 in the agreement between NRS and SK Raha amp; Co, the contractor that bagged the tender, read: The second party (SK Raha amp; Co) should not cut any trees in the bank areas of the lake during the process of beautification. The agreement was signed on December 24, 2009.        
	Copies of both the tender and the agreement are in possession of Metro.        
	Hospital superintendent Laxmikanta Ghosh, who signed the contract on behalf of NRS, later sought forest departments permission to fell trees.        
	Ghosh refused to comment as the matter was sub judice (a few bidders have moved court) but a forest department official said an inspection revealed that around 30 trees had been hacked though permission was given to fell only 19.        
	Green activist Subhash Datta said the hospital authorities had sought permission to fell trees because they later enhanced the scale of the project. As part of the beautification project, there are plans to set up a building housing a cafeteria, restaurant and milk bar. The tender stated the building would spread across 615sq ft but in the contract the figure was changed to around 4,000sq ft.         
	As for billboards, the tender had set a ceiling of 150sq ft. But in the contract there are provisions for one billboard of 1,400sq ft and six smaller hoardings of 300sq ft each.        
	Senior government officials are unanimous that such gross deviation violated the Indian Contract Act and tender norms.         
	The green activists also alleged that the forest department had erred in granting permission to the hospital to cut trees.        
	The West Bengal Trees (Protection amp; Conservation in non-forest areas) Act, 2006, states felling of trees can be allowed only for valid reasons. Here, the permission was granted even though the hospital itself had ruled out felling trees for the execution of the project. The conditions in the tender and the contract suggest that tree felling was not needed for the project, said Dutta.        
	Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the pollution control board, said an inquiry would be ordered.

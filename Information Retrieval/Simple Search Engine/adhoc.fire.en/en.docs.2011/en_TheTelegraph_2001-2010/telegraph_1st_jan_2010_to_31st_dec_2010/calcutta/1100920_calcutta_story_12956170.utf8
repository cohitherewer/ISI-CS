                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Core team to re-brand Bengal
          MOHUA DAS                                              
	Team Wally Olins has taken guard for Mission Bengal.        
	The first runs were scored on Friday when the steering committee that will drive the Brand Bengal project was formed under the chairmanship of Ardhendu Sen.        
	The chief secretary met members of Saffron Brand Consultants, Olinss company, for a two-day brainstorming at Writers to identify key members for the committee and to discuss the roles and responsibilities of the government.         
	Brand guru Olins, responsible for the positioning of London for Olympics 2012, has been appointed by the state government for a project to create a brand idea and brand identity for Bengal.        
	The fees for the project at this stage is Rs 1 crore that the government will pay Team Olins for strategy and recommendations.         
	The steering committee, that will meet Saffron Brand Consultants every 15 days, will be headed by the chief secretary and include nine other secretaries and principal secretaries from various departments (see box).        
	We met the secretaries of the various departments who will be on board. We made the same presentation that we had made to the chief minister and the finance minister when we had met them in June. It was to make them understand the purpose of the project and the role each one will play, Avik Chattopadhyay, the CEO of Saffron Brand Consultants, India, told Metro.        
	We also discussed how we will go about doing our own audit in different parts of the state. We want to meet and observe a cross-section of people and organisations starting from panchayats and primary health care units to successful entrepreneurs in order to understand how Bengal is contributing to their growth and development and what has made them stay on in this state, added Chattopadhyay.        
	Niloy Ghosh, the special secretary of information and cultural affairs, said they would facilitate such meetings for Saffron.        
	We have already started our fieldwork with multiple teams in north, south and central Bengal. We will share all our deductions during the fortnightly meetings. The steering committee will act as a sounding board and give us their inputs since itll eventually be they who will execute the activation, said Chattopadhyay.        
	And how involved will Olins  the man who has branded Poland, Spain and Rio de Janeiro, besides being adviser to Orange, Prudential, Forte Hotels, Coca-Cola, Renault, Volkswagen and Tata over five decades  be in Brand Bengal.        
	Wally will be present at crucial meetings whenever some important strategies need to be decided upon, assured Chattopadhyay.

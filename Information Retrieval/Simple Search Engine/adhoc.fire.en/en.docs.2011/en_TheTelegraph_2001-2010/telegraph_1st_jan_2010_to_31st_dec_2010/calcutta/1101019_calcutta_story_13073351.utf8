The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puja 10: smile amp; scowl
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Puja 10: smile amp; scowl

	METRO RAIL        
	Puja rakes: 526 (2010)         
	Puja rakes: 520 (2009)         
	Footfall: 15.11 lakh (2010)         
	Footfall: 14.79 lakh (2009)               
	Schedules went haywire on Saptami mainly because of overcrowding, which led to late closing of doors and delays caused by the AC rakes. Things looked up from Ashtami with better crowd management  RPF personnel were deployed as pushers at stations to allow doors to close. Delays were less on Navami and Dashami.         
	RAINFALL        
	The skies darkened on Saptami afternoon and poured 24mm rain between 3.30pm and 5.30pm because of a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal. As revellers braced for a washout, the weather gods cleaned up their act. But on Navami, the city received 10.5mm rain between 4.30 and 6pm.         
	TRAFFIC        
	A 2,000-strong contingent from Calcutta traffic police manned the streets with over 700 trainee sergeants and constables from the police training school in Barrackpore. Puja-eve was terrible, the Puja daytime traffic was slow but the night-time traffic was better managed. At one end of town CR Avenue was a crawl, at another Gariahat was bad.        
	PANDAL TRENDS        
	Tagore was trendy this Puja. From Pally Mangal Samity, opposite South City Mall, which erected a fibreglass statue of the poet to EC Block in Salt Lake, where a 65ft bajra came up inspired by Tagores Sonar Tari, to Deshapriya Palli in Duttabad that built Rabindra Palli, organisers made the most of Rabindranaths 150th birth anniversary hoopla. Tagore also made his mark on Puja lighting. From College Square to Ekdalia Evergreen, the bard shone as bright as the other pop pick  Paul, The Octopus, of World Cup fame.        
	A dominant theme was peace, from anti-terror messages to quotes from Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Teresa.        
	Puja also went hi-tech this year with solar lights at many pandals, Bluetooth facilities at Manicktala Chaltabagan-Lohapatty, an elevator for the elderly at FD Block in Salt Lake and an AC pandal in BG Block.         
	FASHION METER        
	Calcutta disappointed on the fashion scale this year. Or maybe the fashionista stayed home or at the apartment puja. At pandals, the hangover of Deepika Padukones contrast leggings and tunic from Love Aaj Kal was dominant, often with not-quite-flattering results. The fabric ranged from silk to velvet  heavy and uncomfortable during the sultry-wet puja. Bling ruled, with crystals, sequins and all things shiny seen on almost every kurti, sari or dress. Western clothes stole a march over the traditional. Dresses went one-shouldered, cropped or strapless, often an eyesore.            
	STAR TREK        
	Bipasha Basu was the starriest visitor as she flew in on Navami and headed for her parar puja, Sharadiya Sammilani Ekdalia (picture right by Aranya Sen). Vidya Balan was the resident Bolly star this Puja, here to shoot for Sujoy Ghoshs Kahaani. The judges line-up at The Telegraph Puja events turned up the glamour quotient with Swastika Mukherjee, Paoli Dam and Locket Chatterjee. TV stars like Tina Dutta (Uttaran) and Natasha Sharma (Na Aana Is Des Laado) ruled the Dandiya floor at Nicco Park and Swabhumi.        
	SPECIAL EVENTS        
	With 270 pujas participating in CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja, and apartment complexes busy with The Telegraph Hand In Hand and Festival of Joy programmes, there was a lot on the festive platter. Barisha Youth Club was crowned Model Puja in the True Spirit category, while Jal Vayu Vihar bagged Festival of Joys Model Apartment Puja.        
	IMMERSION        
	Conducted without chaos thanks to massive police and civic bandobast at 11 ghats. The deadline is Tuesday night.

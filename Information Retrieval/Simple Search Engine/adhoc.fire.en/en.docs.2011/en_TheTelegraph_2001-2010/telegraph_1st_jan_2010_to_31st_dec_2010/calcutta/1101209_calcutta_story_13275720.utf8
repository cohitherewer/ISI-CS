The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Marks belie suicide motive
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Marks belie suicide motive
          OUR BUREAU                           Swastik Banerjee                                  
	The mystery over Class XII student Swastik Banerjees motive for suicide deepened a day after his fatal fall from a mall with his school revealing that he had scored 80-plus in the math paper that he was supposedly worried about.        
	We checked his (pre-board math) paper this morning and found out that he had scored above 80 per cent, Anushree Ghosh, the principal of Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, told Metro.        
	Police had quoted head boy Swastiks father Supriyo Banerjee as saying that the 18-year-old, who wrote his pre-board math exam on Monday, had appeared a little down since returning from school that day. The observation triggered speculation about Swastik being so depressed over his performance in the test that he jumped to his death from the fourth-floor car park of the Mani Square mall the next afternoon.        
	Teachers at Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, said studies couldnt have weighed Swastik down because he was a consistently good student with a 9.5 out of 10 in the last chemistry unit test.         
	So if not academic worries, what could have driven the elocutionist who could charm everyone with his speech to end his life? Close friends and classmates recalled that midway through Class XI, Swastik became a little silent.        
	In Class XI, Swastik had enrolled for the engineering coaching class in school. But he stopped attending classes in September, a friend said.        
	At Mani Square, mall officials faced questions about why those monitoring live CCTV footage couldnt spot Swastik going up to the car park to jump to his death. We have 180 CCTVs and two guards monitoring the footage. But they need to constantly shift screens so that the entire area is covered. Unfortunately, the car park area was not on the screen when the incident occurred, a security official said.

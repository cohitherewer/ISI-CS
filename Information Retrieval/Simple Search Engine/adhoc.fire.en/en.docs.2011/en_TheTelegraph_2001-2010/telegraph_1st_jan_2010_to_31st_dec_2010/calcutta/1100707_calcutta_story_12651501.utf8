The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Free and flowing, in life as in soccer
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Free and flowing, in life as in soccer
          SUBHRO SAHA                          ACHTUNG! SPAIN: The cheer squad in an Alipore house during Germanys 4-1 defeat of England in the round of 16. Picture by Aranya Sen                                  
	A new brand of German soccer seems to have taken stoicism out of the Germans.        
	In just three weeks, life has gone from ernsthaft (serious) and ordnung (order) to a spontaneous expression of joy for the citys small German community, revelling in the free-flowing soccer and World Cup success of an unusual German team.        
	I agree with Franz Beckenbauer (Cup-winning player and coach) that the new outlook is responsible for our remarkable showing in South Africa. Flowing moves and immaculate control are not generally associated with north European teams; these are more southern traits, says deputy consul-general Klaus Tesch.        
	Tesch feels the likes of Mesut Oezil, Lucas Podolski, Sami Khedira and Jerome Boateng in this multi-cultural team have brought to the pitch diverse forms of expression, resulting in fluid football that is generally not associated with Germany.         
	Max Mueller Bhavan director Reimar Volker applauds the football federation  DfB  for investing in youth and a multi-ethnic squad that is not only about a new kind of soccer but also a new Germany.        
	Sports, education and culture can bring a society together, and when I look at somebody like the Brazilian-born Cacau in this German national team, I feel this is a new dawn in Germany, says Volker.        
	For many Germans in town, the 4-0 drubbing of Argentina in the quarters still seems like a dream. Its almost too good to be true, and I am still pinching myself. My brothers are very much into football back home, and even they were stunned by the scoreline, smiles Andrea Fischboeck, vice-consul in the citys German consulate.        
	So is she gung-ho about the midnight semi-final against Spain, which she intends watching in the Max Mueller Bhavan audi?        
	It will be a very tough match, but I think we will just nick itMaybe zwei-eins (2-1) after extra-time, predicts Andrea.        
	Come Wednesday midnight, Auf gehts (just do it) Deutschland might not only be Andrea and Cos war cry but also that of many soccer-crazy Calcuttans floored by the beautiful German game.

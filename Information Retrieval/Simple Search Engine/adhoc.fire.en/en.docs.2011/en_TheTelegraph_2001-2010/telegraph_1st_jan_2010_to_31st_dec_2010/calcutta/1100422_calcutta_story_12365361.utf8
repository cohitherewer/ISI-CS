The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Classroom don in library hot seat   Moment is right for renaissance
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Classroom don in library hot seat     - New director picks three areas of focus to turn National Library around          CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA                          Swapan Chakravorty in his Bhasha Bhavan office of National Library on Wednesday afternoon. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                                        
	At his farewell function at the English department of Jadavpur University students had put together a video on Swapan Chakravorty, who was leaving the university for three years to take over as the director of National Library.        
	The video featured Chakravorty, eminent scholar of the literature of early modern Europe whose knowledge left many sophomores perfectly intimidated, and later dazzled, morphed as the Don, the Marlon Brando variety. There was a rendition of the Godfather theme song as well. Chakravorty feels students call him the Don not for his intellectual ability alone.        
	The wraparound dark glasses he wears contribute too, he says. The appointment of Chakravorty, Swapanda to his students, much revered and loved, is expected to turn things around at National Library.         
	There is something else that is apt about the appointment: the man who taught students everything from Renaissance drama to 18th century prose (non-fiction) to textual theory to John Locke to Virgil is also a book history expert.        
	But books are not all that Chakravorty, who joined on April 17, is dealing with now. In his new office on the fourth floor of Bhasha Bhavan at the library he is getting used to signing his name in Hindi: several documents arrive written in Hindi. As do streams of people with problems that have nothing to do with the written word.The important thing is not to lose focus, says Chakravorty.        
	Three areas crucial to the modernisation of the library need attention. Upgrade of ICT (information and communication technology) is the first. The library could do with much more technology: even the directors room doesnt have a Net connection yet. There is not one in the adjacent rooms either.                    
	Yet technology, predictably, is the key to the major changes that the library is trying to bring about. It is also crucial to the other areas that Chakravorty feels need attention: procurement of online journals, and the giant project: digitisation of the entire National Library catalogue.        
	If the catalogue is available online, readers everywhere, members, non-members, will be able to know of the librarys holdings. The digitisation of the catalogue will need the library to be networked. The catalogue will come with bibliographical data. It will be possible to find out, more easily than now, how many books were published in India in a year. National Library is a depository library: a copy of every book published in India has to deposited here.        
	Chakravorty is serious about the completion of this project, which began some time ago, but will not put a deadline to it. The library has been outsourcing help. The employees have accepted outsourcing for tasks such as cleaning and security, but other jobs remain contentious. I shall have to look into the matter case by case, Chakravorty says.         
	These are huge tasks. But Chakravorty feels that this is the right moment, things are changing. The Union ministry of culture, which oversees the library, is generous with funds and understanding.        
	Meanwhile, there are files and files. When he does have the time to look up, Chakravorty says what he misses about the university is its stimulus: especially the young minds.

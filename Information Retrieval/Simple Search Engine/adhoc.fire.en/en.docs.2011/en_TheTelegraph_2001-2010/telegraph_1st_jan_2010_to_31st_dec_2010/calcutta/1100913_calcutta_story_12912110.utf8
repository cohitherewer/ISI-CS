The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pre-poll plan to axe property tax
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pre-poll plan to axe property tax
  - Cost logic shapes lolly for residents        DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                        Modern local taxation started in: 1793  Total property tax revenue 2009-10: Rs 452.67cr   (with arrears)  Assessed properties: 452,454  Residential: 408,677  Annual tax up to Rs 600: 278,865 houses  Revenue from residential buildings: Rs 75cr  Expenditure on tax collection: Rs 45cr      
	The four-month-old Trinamul Congress-administered civic board is toying with the idea of doing away with property tax as a sop for over 4.55 lakh residents, reducing administrative expenditure at the cost of losing revenue.        
	Armed with the logic of high administrative and collection costs in realising tax from residential properties, the civic board is busy clearing the decks for a formal announcement of the populist plan. Given the going tax rates, the decision will cost the Calcutta Municipal Corporation coffers over Rs 75 crore every year.        
	Sources in the CMC headquarters told Metro that the pecuniary arithmetic and the political cost-benefit analysis of the proposed move were being worked out.        
	Since a major tax reform after a gap of 75 years is imminent, we are exploring various citizen-friendly options. It is too early to comment on what we will offer, said mayor Sovan Chatterjee. If implemented, the annual savings of house owners in Calcutta would range from Rs 300 to Rs 12,000.        
	As the existing notional rent value system for tax assessment had kept the collections depressed for years, the earlier board wanted to replace it with a unit area tax assessment method, based on the location of the building and its area. The Trinamul board has pressed the pause button on unit area taxation as the new method might result in a higher tax burden on citizens in some areas.        
	The plan is to abolish property tax on all residential buildings. This will be one of the best gifts to Calcuttans, said a civic body insider.         
	The civic board is keeping its excuses ready, knowing that questions would be asked. Abolition of property tax on residential buildings may apparently seem an impossible proposition but in reality it is not so. The revenue loss will be much less than what might be feared, said municipal commissioner Arnab Roy, commenting on its viability.        
	According to CMC records, out of a collection of Rs 452 crore as property tax, residential buildings contribute around Rs 75 crore. With over 1,500 employees in 19 collection centres, the civic body spends around Rs 45 crore to maintain the administrative and collection infrastructure.         
	A similar logic was offered when the Haryana government abolished house tax two years ago. It was forced to reintroduce the tax earlier this month to be eligible to use central funds sanctioned under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.         
	The save-costs-lose-tax logic is flawed, said public finance expert M. Govinda Rao, the director of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.         
	One cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater. The civic bodies should try to bring down the compliance cost and improve the collection process with the use of latest technology, said Rao, a member of the economic advisory council to the Prime Minister.         
	The Bangalore municipal corporation, said Rao, followed this principle and it helped the civic body to raise its property tax collections from around Rs 400 crore in 2007 to over Rs 1,200 crore in just three years. By using GIS maps and shifting to an online payment system, the civic bodies can significantly increase their earnings and reduce the cost of collection, added Rao.        
	The Trinamul civic board is planning to force the state government to share a part of the revenue from motor vehicles tax, reintroduce trade licence fees and demand higher grants from the Centre.        
	A city-based economist expressed his doubts. There is a link between tax payment and service delivery. In most cases, people do not get services even after paying taxes. If the tax is done away with, how will the civic body deliver?        
	With the Assembly poll months away, these questions remain unanswered at the civic headquarters. Does anybody care about good economics? summed up Rao.

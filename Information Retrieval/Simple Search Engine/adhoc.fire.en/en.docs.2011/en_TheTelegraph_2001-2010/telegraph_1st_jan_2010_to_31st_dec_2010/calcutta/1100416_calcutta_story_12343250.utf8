	A mob of more than 100 dragged a teenaged girl out of her Sonarpur home on Thursday and shaved her head because a boy she had spurned committed suicide.         
	According to witnesses, the mob comprised neighbours of the girl who lived with her mother at Khurigachi on the southern fringes of the city. The girls other family members live elsewhere.         
	The teenager, who appeared for Madhyamik this year, was dragged out of her rented home on the ground floor of a two-storeyed building around 6am and taken to a nearby pond, where a couple of neighbours shaved half her head.         
	She was crying surrounded by about 120 people, including scores of women, who were jeering and laughing, said a witness.         
	The girl and her mother locked their home and left around 10am.         
	Neighbours ganged up against the girl following the suicide of Dibakar Das, in his mid-20s, on Tuesday night.        
	According to residents, the two recently broke up after a relationship of about a year.        
	On Tuesday evening Das had gone to the girls house. She refused to speak and shut the door on his face, said a member of Santi Sangha, a local club. Hours later, Das hanged himself from the ceiling of his house. The youth used to live with his parents and younger brother.         
	Residents claimed the girl and her mother misbehaved with a female cousin of Das on Thursday morning, sparking the assault.        
	Dibakars cousin had gone to the girls house to figure out what could have led to his suicide. But the girl misbehaved with her, alleged the club member.         
	According to him, the assault on the girl was an expression of residents anger against the family. No complaint was lodged with the police by the girls family till late on Thursday.         
	The girl said she would not lodge a complaint since she did not want to drag the matter further.        
	I have already been insulted a great deal. I dont want to stay in the locality any longer, she said.         
	Senior officials of South 24-Parganas district administration promised to look into the matter. I will ask the police to probe the matter, said Khalil Ahmed, the district magistrate.

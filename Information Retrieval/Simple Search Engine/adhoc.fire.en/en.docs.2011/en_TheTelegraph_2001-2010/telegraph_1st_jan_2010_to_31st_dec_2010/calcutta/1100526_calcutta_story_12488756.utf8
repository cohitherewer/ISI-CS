                      Rekindling the spirit of the rebel poet                    In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a champion of human-kind, known for his wily intelligence, who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to mortals. Zeus then punished him for his crime by having him bound to a rock eternally while an eagle consumed his liver everyday. Bengali poet, musician and revolutionary Kazi Nazrul Islam, the quintessential Bidrohi Kobi (Rebel Poet), is our own version of Prometheus who pioneered poetic works espousing intense spiritual rebellion against fascism and oppression. The poet who wrote I am the burning volcano in the bosom of the earth,/ I am the wild fire of the woods,/ I am Hells mad terrific sea of wrath!/ I ride on the wings of lightning with joy and profundity, I scatter misery and fear all around, /I bring earthquakes on this world! / I am the rebel eternal,/ I raise my head beyond this world,/ High, ever erect and alone! (English translation by Kabir Choudhary) was thrown behind bars as he assailed the British Raj and preached revolution through his works. While in prison, Nazrul wrote Rajbandir Jabanbandi (Deposition of a political prisoner). He opposed all bigotry, including religious and gender. His vast gamut of writings includes short stories, novels and essays, but is best-known for his poems, in which he pioneered new forms such as Bengali ghazals. Nazrul wrote and composed music for his nearly 4,000 songs, collectively known as Nazrulgeeti, which are widely popular today. On the occasion of the poets 111th birth anniversary, Rabindra Sadan and the Information amp; Cultural Affairs Department, Government of West Bengal jointly host a four-day festival of Nazrulgeeti, recitation of Nazruls poems, beginning with the conferring of Nazrul Smriti Purashkar this evening.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HC orders action against SDO
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HC orders action against SDO
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday directed the principal secretary (education) to take action against the Alipore SDO for not starting proceedings against the teacher-in-charge of Calcutta Blind School, who is accused of misappropriation of funds.        
	The principal secretary (education) is directed to place the SDO, Alipore, under suspension for gross insubordination and/or initiate departmental action against him, Justice Tapen Sen ruled.        
	Teachers of the school moved a petition in February, alleging that they were not getting their salaries because of embezzlement by teacher-in-charge Shyamal Mondal. Justice D. Dutta, who heard the case, formed a panel headed by SDO Mukesh Singh to probe the charges.        
	On Thursday, the teachers moved a second plea, before Justice Sen, saying the panel did not act against Mondal even after finding him guilty. The SDO also ignored an order of the director of mass education to act against the headmaster, said the teachers lawyer. The state lawyer said Singh was unsure whether he could act against the headmaster. Justice Sen asked the principal secretary (education) to move against the SDO.

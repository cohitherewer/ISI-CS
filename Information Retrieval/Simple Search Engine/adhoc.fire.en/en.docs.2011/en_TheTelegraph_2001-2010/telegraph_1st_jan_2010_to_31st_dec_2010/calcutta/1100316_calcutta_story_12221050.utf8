                Around 20 SFI supporters ransacked the West Bengal University of Animal and Fishery Sciences at Belgachhia and gheraoed vice-chancellor Chandra Shekhar Chakraborty on Monday evening after the organisation lost all 15 seats in the students union election. Trinamul Chhatra Parishad reportedly won all the seats. Though the results will be officially declared on Tuesday, the students got to know them today, said D.K. Dey, the universitys dean and registrar.    Jewellery worth Rs 3 lakh was stolen from the flat of Fahmi Rahman on Ibrahim Road in Ekbalpore on Sunday evening. Police said nobody was home when the theft occurred.    A centipede was found in a large bowl of dal at SSKM Hospital on Monday morning. Rabin Mullick, an employee of the central kitchen, saw the insect while taking the bowl to the new casualty block and alerted the authorities. The dal was thrown away.    The bail petitions of Raju Sonkar, Gopal Tiwari and Manoj Sharma  all sentenced for life along with bhujia baron Prabhu Shankar Agarwal  were rejected by the division bench of Justice D.P. Sengupta and Justice Pravat Kumar De of the high court on Monday. Arun Khandelwal, the fifth accused in the case, did not move for bail on Monday.    The state environment department has issued an order banning the use of diesel generators not conforming to the standards laid down in a 2002 notification of the Union environment and forest ministry. The notification mentions that diesel generators with an in-built pollution control system can be used. The order has given a one-year deadline (till February 2011) to get the old generators replaced.    A 12-year-old ragpicker was seriously injured when a crude bomb in a garbage dump at Sealdanga in Howrah exploded on Monday afternoon. Mohammad Ibrahim was admitted to the district hospital.    Blockades disrupted traffic at three places in the city on Monday. A group of Intuc members blocked Central Garden Reach Road in Watgunge for 20 minutes from 11.40am to protest price hike.   UCI supporters blocked the College Street-MG Road crossing for 15 minutes from 2.10pm on the same issue. Both blockades were withdrawn after police intervened. Autorickshaw drivers blocked Prince Anwar Shah Road in front of Dhaka Kalibari for 30 minutes around noon to protest high-handed behaviour of the police.

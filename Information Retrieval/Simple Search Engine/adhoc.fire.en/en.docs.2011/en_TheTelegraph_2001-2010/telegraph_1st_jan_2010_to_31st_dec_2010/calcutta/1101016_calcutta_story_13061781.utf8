The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seven stops on festive spirit trek
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Seven stops on festive spirit trek
										                        Swastika Mukherjee makes merry Puja music to the beats of Chad Cummins and Jogen Chowdhury at Barisha Tarun Tirtha            Swastika and Jogen Chowdhury offer anjali at Olabibitola Sarbojanin            (From left) Debajyoti Mishra, Jogen Chowdhury, Swastika and Dr Debal Sen at Kashi Bose Lane

	The vehicles carrying the judges  artist Jogen Chowdhury, actress Swastika Mukherjee, Dr Debal Sen, composer Debajyoti Mishra, American Center director Chad P. Cummins and CESC senior manager (customer relations) Dilip Samajpati  had barely crossed over to Howrah from Calcutta when two carloads of organising committee members and volunteers of Olabibitola Sarbojanin arrived to escort them to the pandal.        
	As the convoy made its way through the narrow, meandering streets west of the river, the committee members would occasionally break into loud cheers.         
	At the pandal, based on the theme bangla-r putul, volunteers stood at the entrance with bouquets to welcome the guests. Swastikas entry invited more than a few sighs.         
	I saw her, I saw Swastika Mukherjee. She looks even more beautiful in real life than on screen, gushed Baishali Guchhait, a student of Class XII.                   
	Swastika seemed as pleased with the surroundings as with the attention. Its open and spacious, the actress said even as some fans reached out to touch her.         
	The organisers tried hard to rein in the crowd that had crammed into the pandal, but nobody would budge. At least they have the aparajita garland here, remarked Dr Sen, scanning the decorations.                   
	He and fellow judge Chad Cummins then started discussing the similarities between faiths while the rest did a recce of the pandal.         
	Cummins liked the concept of the pandal but was disappointed at not being able to spend more time checking whether the puja had met all the requirements of the True Spirit awards.         
	The judges soon made their way out and went into a huddle. The consensus was that crowd and traffic management needed to improve. The plus points of the puja were the electricity and fire management systems. Olabibitola also scored high on medical facilities with a doctor being present at the pandal for emergencies.         
	For energy conservation, the puja has used LEDs this year. The judges liked the idol, too.        
	Barisha Youth Club        
	The small pandal depicts the theme universal mother. Women from the locality ululated as Swastika entered. The beats of the dhak and the chanting of the mantra by the priests created the perfect Ashtami ambience. The judges made a leisurely round of the premises accompanied by some of the organisers.        
	I would be quaking in my shoes if I were in their place. I would be afraid of being quizzed by judges, said Dr Sen. But the organisers did not have anything to fear. Fire-safety measures, electricity source, waste management system, help desk and drinking water and toilet facilities were all in place.        
	When the organisers switched off the power supply on being asked to by one of the judges, the emergency lights came on immediately. First-aid and ambulance were readily available. There was also an area for the elderly to rest. LEDs have been used for illumination to conserve electricity.        
	Its very spacious, said Mishra. Chowdhury agreed but Swastika was not entirely happy. I do not think there is any connection between the theme and the presentation. Also it is a little cramped, she said.         
	Barisha Tarun Tirtha        
	The puja is paying homage to the Maithili poet, Vidyapati. Maithili artwork and scriptures adorn the pandal. Items that were common in Mithila (now parts of Bihar and Nepal), such as rope made of grass, have been used to set up the pandal. The goddess looks serene and peaceful and the asura is depicted as surrendering to her.        
	Olabibitola till now is the winner in terms of organisation but I like this idol the best, said Swastika before picking up the kanshi to accompany Cummins and Chowdhury, who were playing the dhak.        
	The organisers have installed closed-circuit television cameras for security and made enough arrangements for firefighting. Traffic and crowd management seemed good, though the judges wondered whether the puja drew a really big crowd.        
	The use of eco-friendly material and the absence of plastic were the other pluses, as were the help desk with emergency numbers displayed and a ramp to facilitate movement of those bound to wheelchairs.        
	The puja had donated the prize money it had won as a Three Star puja in 2009 to a man who needed it for his daughters wedding.         
	Santoshpur Lake Pally        
	The puja impressed Chowdhury with its old-school idol and colour-coordinated pandal. Bits of blue tiles have been stuck on the walls and the floor to create the effect of water.        
	The approach to the idol, constructed with bamboo sticks lined up against one another, drew flak. The organisers claimed that the option was eco-friendly and complemented the look of the pandal but visitors found the heels of their shoes getting stuck between gaps in the sticks.        
	One such visitor, Mina Das of Garia, fell and sprained her ankle. She was quickly ushered into the air-conditioned clinic next to the mandap, where an ointment was applied and a crepe bandage tied on her leg. The clinic has two beds, an oxygen cylinder, a wheelchair and an ambulance. A doctor mans it round the clock.         
	Only energy-saving LEDs have been used to illuminate the puja and four security cameras are monitoring the premises, said a puja committee member. An armed security guard was keeping a watch on the crowd from atop a watchtower.         
	Unlike the other pujas, volunteers  in canary yellow T-shirts  were conspicuous.         
	Mudiali Club         
	The organisers have installed a heat sensor on the ceiling above the idol. In case of an unnatural rise in temperature, the sensor will set off alarms both inside the pandal and at the enquiry desk.        
	Organisers claimed fibreglass and other materials used to build the pandal had been treated with chemicals and were no longer inflammable.         
	I find this pandal claustrophobic. Crowd management could have been better, said Mishra. According to the organisers, visitors are not allowed to proceed beyond a point in the mandap when the crowd swells.         
	Safety features include two ambulances, a wheelchair and a first-aid box. A doctor, however, is available only after dusk. The organisers were not able to set up a gents toilet and pointed to a pay-and-use toilet nearby as an alternative. There were not enough waste bins around, especially during bhog distribution. But then visitors preferred to dump their bhog plates on the road instead of waste bins.

	Swastika loved this colourful puja where the caste system is depicted using dolls. The safety standards are just as impressive as the aesthetics.        
	For starters, the puja is on the main road and the traffic outside would have been chaotic had it not been for the 16 volunteers who were helping policemen manage vehicles and pedestrians. Since the entrance and exits are narrow, visitors were being ushered inside in batches of 30.         
	The pandal is made with a type of grass that has been treated to prevent fire, said a member of the puja committee, who proved his point by trying to set a blade of grass on fire.         
	While women visitors can use the hired chemical toilet behind the pandal, there is no arrangement for men. The first-aid counter, set up on the main road, is open only after dark. The puja has a wheelchair for the disabled but no ramp to help them skip the stairs. The emergency exits are not located conveniently either.         
	Kashi Bose Lane        
	The pandal is on a spacious field that can accommodate hundreds comfortably. A narrow path that leads to it is reserved for senior citizens and the differently-abled.         
	The puja does not have emergency lights. It takes a few minutes to switch on a generator after a power cut. But for those minutes the visitors would be in pitch darkness, said Samajpati.        
	The organisers lost points since they had covered the field with sand to build the pandal, thereby destroying the grass. They could have covered the field with a wooden plank instead, added Samajpati.         
	To spread the joy, the organisers painted the buildings of either side of the pandal to make the entire neighbourhood look colourful.

										      BRIEF  LIVES                        A ship in troubled waters near Sandheads in the 19th century				                           
	This weeks Brief Lives is about not one, but three lives, and somewhat doomed ones at that. Together, they encompass what must have been one of the most jinxed occupations in 19th century Calcutta, that of the superintendent of the Bengal Military Orphan Press.         
	This lugubriously named organisation arose out of a charitable body of the same name, which in turn was founded towards the end of the 18th century. As its name makes clear, the task of the organisation was to provide for orphaned or deserted children of British soldiers in India.        
	Printing began to emerge as a viable livelihood in early 19th century Calcutta, and the society duly established a press whose chief task was to train the first-ever cadre of press-workers in South Asia.         
	The post of its first superintendent was filled by one G.H. Huttmann, who had earlier been in charge of a missionary printing press in Malacca, in the1820s.         
	It is not clear precisely when he arrived in Calcutta, but we do know of his marriage to Mary Ann Elsey of London, in December 1826. Mrs Huttmann passed away in 1831, and after a years mourning, Huttmann married Mary, widow of the late Capt. E.E. Isaac. In 1843, a son was born to the couple. These bare chronicles of births, deaths and marriages bear testimony to the brevity of European lives under tropical skies.         
	Shortly after the birth of his son, Huttmann was thrown off the back of a horse and killed. He was succeeded by W. Ridsdale, but he too died an unnatural death, drowning off the Sandheads. This should have set warning bells ringing but if they did, they were unheeded by the next incumbent, F. Carberry. On 25 July, 1856 the Bengal Hurkaru reported mournfully:        
	There is a report about town, and we fear it is but too well founded, of the death by drowning of Mr. F. Carberry, Superintendent of the Orphan Press. It is said that he was crossing the river in a dingee, at dusk on Wednesday evening last. He had his palkee on board, and four bearers. The boat came in contact with the chain-cable of the steamer Manchester, and at once upset. It is said that Mr. Carberry and two of the three boatmen were drowned, but that his four bearers escaped.         
	These bearers can give no very exact account of Mr. Carberry as they took little notice of him in the hurry and confusion of the moment, and while having to struggle for their own lives. One of them says that Mr. Carberry caught hold of an oar. The office of Superintendent of the Orphan Press is rather an ill-fated one.        
	Such was the fate of the first three unfortunate superintendents of the Bengali Military Orphan Press. Brief Lives is unaware whether there was a fourth, and whether he died peacefully in bed.       Abhijit Gupta

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Subsidence near Moulali
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Subsidence near Moulali
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The cave-in on Dr Suresh Sarkar Road. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	A part of Dr Suresh Sarkar Road in central Calcutta that had subsided on Tuesday caved in again on Friday morning.        
	The subsidence  around 5 feet in length and breadth  created a crater 6ft deep in front of the National Institute for Behavioural Sciences, near the Moulali crossing.        
	Civic officials blamed the subsidence on a leak in an underground water pipe. Water seeping from the pipe softened the earth, resulting in the cave-in. The leak has been repaired, said an official in the water supply department of the civic body.        
	Moulali-bound traffic was disrupted as one-third of the road was blocked.        
	A policeman should have been posted on the stretch today. All vehicles are trying to move fast, creating snarls, said a man running a shop on the road.        
	 Trains stranded: Several long-distance trains of South Eastern Railway to and from Calcutta were stranded because of a demonstration at Barabhum station on the Adra-Chandil section and at Madhukunda station on the Adra-Asansol section in Adra division on Friday morning.        
	 Flights delayed: A snag in the communication system led to delayed departure of five Jet Airways and JetLite flights from the city on Friday morning.

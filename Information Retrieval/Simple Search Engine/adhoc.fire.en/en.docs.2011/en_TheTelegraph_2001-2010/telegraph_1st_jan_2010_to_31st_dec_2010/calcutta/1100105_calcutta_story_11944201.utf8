The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | From adversity to verse
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          From adversity to verse

	Class VIII student Sourjo Sinha is confined to his wheelchair because of motor skills disorder. But his imagination is not limited by his handicap.         
	Sixteen-year-old Mahua Kispoto suffers from a speech disorder and has difficulty holding a pen. But that does not stop her turning her thoughts into verse.         
	Both Sourjo and Mahua, students of Akshar, suffer from cerebral palsy. Both have contributed to The Unstretched Realm, a collection of 100 poems by regular and special students from classes II to X of Akshar.        
	At the launch of the selection on December 11 at the schools Diamond Harbour Road address, friends lent a hand and for many like Mahua, their voices, for reading out the poems. It all began a year ago when some of the teachers at Akshar attended a poetry-writing workshop by a former teacher at the school. While we learnt of different forms of verse, like haiku, clerihew and cinquain, we also encouraged the students to write poetry in the classroom, recalls English teacher Piyali Gupta, one of the coordinators of the book.         
	When the children began to come up with striking pieces, the school decided to publish them in the form of a book.        
	US consul-general Beth Payne attended the launch, along with quizmaster Barry OBrien. An integrated orchestra, comprising both regular and special students, performed at the inauguration.         
	Seeing their work published is a big boost to the kids self-esteem. They know that they are not treated as special but as equals, said Neena Singh, the executive director of Akshar.         
	The poems capture different moods  from the agony of searching for a lost brother in the Mumbai blasts, a young mans love for his dog to mourning the destruction of the earth. I started composing verse since last year when I joined Akshar. I will keep writing, assured Sourjo.         
	The children have already started submitting poems for next years book, said Gupta.        
	Whats on your mind this week  
	Unfair fairness  
	It is unfortunate that many women speak about the importance of womens liberation, but extol in the same breath the virtues of the fairness cream to improve ones appearance.         
	The idea of a cream to lighten a womans complexion suggests that dark skin is a negative attribute. It is a commodification of women, who are seen as products who must be made attractive so that they are marketable for the male population. Despite education and economic independence, are we still so insecure that we must alter ourselves to suit someone elses tastes?

	Womens own        
	A woman plays so many parts in her life: that of a daughter, sister, wife and later, mother. Yet, in many parts of our country, the birth of a girl child is still viewed as cause for shame.         
	 On one hand, we speak of our countrys progress in the fields of industry, yet on the other, practices like female infanticide, sati and child marriage are prevalent even today. Women grow up knowing that they are always vulnerable to crimes like rape and eve-teasing.         
	Few dare to raise their voice against these, for the fear of repercussion is stronger than the will to protest. Why should this be so, when it is a proven fact that women are in no way less than men?         
	 It is time that we learnt to speak up for ourselves, instead of waiting for someone to take up our cause.

										      BRIEF LIVES                        James Silk Buckingham				                           
	In the history of the Calcutta press, the name of James Silk Buckingham is all but forgotten. An intrepid traveller and a friend of Raja Rammohun Roy, he had the misfortune of being expelled not once, but twice from India, first from Bombay and then from Calcutta.         
	Prior to his second expulsion, he gave much grief to the East India Company in his capacity as editor of the Calcutta Review, thereby joining the honourable ranks of Charles Augustus Hickey as pressmen who had fallen foul of the Company.        
	James Silk Buckingham (1786-1855) was born near Falmouth and went to sea at the tender age of nine. Within a year he was captured as a prisoner-of-war and was confined for several months in Corunna in Spain.         
	Before he was 11, James had marched several hundred miles barefoot through Spain and Portugal with other POWs. Such an experience should have quenched most peoples thirst for travel, but with Buckingham it had exactly the opposite effect. He travelled to the West Indies, the two Americas, the Mediterranean and finally found himself in Egypt where he was asked by the Pasha, Mohammad Ali, to explore the possibility of re-opening the ancient canal which formerly connected the Red Sea with the Mediterranean. This somewhat unlikely enterprise led to a series of extraordinary adventures too complex to relate here.         
	In 1814-15, Buckingham was asked by English merchants in Egypt to undertake a voyage to India via the Red Sea route. This task was done, but merchants in India showed no inclination to trade with Egypt.         
	On landing in Bombay, Buckingham was given marching orders by a somewhat regretful Evan Nepean, the governor of Madras, since he had set foot on Indian soil without a licence. But in 1815, he was to return to Bombay in a new guise, this time as the envoy of Mohammad Ali. Though he once again failed to promote commerce between India and Egypt, Buckingham was given the command of the Imam of Muscats frigate, in which post he remained for three years.        
	Buckingham set foot in Calcutta in June 1818, where he resigned his command on being asked to traffic slaves from Zanzibar. At the instance of a local merchant, he assumed the editorship of the Calcutta Review, and by all accounts, conducted the paper along bold and vigorous lines.        
	But his outspokenness got him into trouble with the Company and while he was tolerated during the regime of Hastings (not Warren but the Earl of Moira) a senior Company official, John Adam, swore that he would get rid of Buckingham even if he became governor-general for one day.         
	His opportunity came in 1823 when Moira left, and Amherst was yet to assume office. Following an article by Buckingham criticising a decision by Adam to confer a sinecure on the editor of the John Bull, he was forthwith ordered to leave Bengal, plunging his family into overnight penury.         
	Despite many attempts to return to Calcutta, James Silk Buckingham continued to be considered persona non grata for the rest of his life by a vengeful Company.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stephen-stung firemen clock swift response
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stephen-stung firemen clock swift response
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The police ambulance on Jhowtala Road. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Case 1: A small fire broke out inside the meter box on the ground floor of a three-storeyed building at 85 Jhowtala Road in Karaya. Two tenders and an ambulance of Calcutta police turned up within 10 minutes. The fire was doused soon after.        
	Case II: Panic spread among the residents of a four-storey building in Bhowanipore after the meter box on the ground floor, which houses a nursing home, caught fire. Firemen reached the spot in 15 minutes but the blaze had been doused by then.        
	The promptness of firemen on Thursday afternoon came as a pleasant surprise to a city still haunted by the Stephen Court disaster that claimed 43 lives.        
	Its good to see firemen are finally acting fast. We only hope quick response time becomes a permanent feature of the department, said Akram Ahmed, a resident of Jhowtala Road.        
	The electric meter on the ground floor of the Jhowtala Road building, which houses a restaurant, caught fire at 3pm. The first tender reached the spot at 3.12pm followed by another in three minutes. A police ambulance, too, arrived a little later.        
	The electric meter on the ground floor of the Bhowanipore building caught fire around 2.30pm. As smoke started billowing out, neighbours rushed seven patients admitted to the nursing home in the building to SSKM Hospital.        
	The fire was doused a little before the firemen arrived. Later, a CESC team inspected the meter and disconnected the supply, said an officer of Bhowanipore police station. The response time was unbelievable in both incidents, agreed an officer at Lalbazar.

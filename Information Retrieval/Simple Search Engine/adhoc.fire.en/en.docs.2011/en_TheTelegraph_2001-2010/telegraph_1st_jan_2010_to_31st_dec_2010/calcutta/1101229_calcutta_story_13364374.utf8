          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Biju Kumar Gupta was getting richer by lakhs posing as a banker to customers and a customer to bankers till his luck ran out on Monday when he was picked up by police from his Baguiati house.        
	The cops had long been on his trail, armed with CCTV footage that showed him fleecing customers of five banks on the pretext of helping them.        
	The 42-year-old, who studied up to Class V but was fluent in English, would enter a bank in a suit. Bank employees thought he was a well heeled customer while Gupta would introduce himself to customers as a senior bank official, said a detective department officer.        
	Gupta would approach a customer filling up a deposit slip and earn his confidence by spotting an error or two in the form. Then he would offer to deposit the money himself.        
	After the unsuspecting customer handed the cash to Gupta, he would move around in front of the counters for some time before slipping out, the officer added.        
	He also targeted people who withdrew money, offering to check whether the notes were genuine or not. He would pick a few Rs 500 or Rs 1,000 notes, tell the customer they were fake and volunteer to get them replaced. Seconds later he would be out of sight with the notes, the officer said.        
	Sleuths said Gupta had made around Rs 2 lakh  between July and October  from the five banks whose CCTV footage helped them identify the accused. He had been arrested earlier, too, for fleecing a customer of Rs 15 lakh in 2005 in a similar manner.        
	He had jumped bail in the case and was mentioned as an absconder in the chargesheet. The cops came to know while probing the last five cases that he had been staying with a woman in the Baguiati house.        
	After making some money, Gupta would visit Mumbai and stay in star hotels. He would return only after running out of cash, said joint commissioner (crime) Damayanti Sen.        
	Gupta has been remanded in police custody till January 5.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fast and feast take toll on teen health
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fast and feast take toll on teen health
          JHINUK MAZUMDAR AND RITH BASU                      Students often end up eating unhealthy in trying to emulate size zero celebrities like Kareena Kapoor          Teenaged schoolchildren desperate to sport the lean look   are skipping their square   meals and surviving on fast   food, only to end up putting on   weight instead of shedding it. 				   As confused teenagers vac  illate between the extremes of   fasting and fast food, many   city schools are being forced to   lay down guidelines to healthy   living and even hire experts to   conduct classes on nutrition.  We are very worried over   girls fainting in school be  cause they have not eaten any  thing in the morning. Worse,   they later gorge on chips and   cold drinks to keep hunger   away, which adds to the weight   problem, said Basanti   Biswas, the principal of Cal  cutta Girls High School.  Institutions like Bharatiya   Vidya Bhavan, Birla High   School for Girls, Mahadevi   Birla Girls Higher Secondary   School, Sri Shikshayatan   School, Apeejay School and   Calcutta Girls routinely re  port instances of students feel  ing giddy in class, throwing   up, suffering from lapses in   concentration, or collapsing   during the morning assembly. 				   Some of them may look   plump  according to teachers   at St James and Calcutta Girls,   60-65 per cent of their students   are on the heavier side  but   are far from nourished and   healthy. Its a disturbing food   habit that starry-eyed   teenagers pick up without re  alising the consequences. A   student in this category will   have a disordered eating pat  tern that will upset his or her   metabolism, said a doctor. 				   According to principals,   most children are misin  formed about what, when   and how they need to eat. We   have heard of gymnasium in  structors telling children that   a banana or a mango is a no-no   if they want to lose weight,   which is ridiculous, said Rita   Chatterjee, the principal of   Apeejay School. 
    Swashrit Society, a Delhi-  based NGO, uses games and   quizzes to spread nutritional   awareness among 12,000 stu  dents of five city schools. The   aim is to teach children what   to eat and how much, said   Sauravi Chakraborty, the sup  port head of the NGO.
    Calcutta Girls recently had   a no-junk food week during   which parents and their chil  dren were asked to adhere to a   specific menu and calorie in  take, based on their individual   weight. Its an experiment we   intend continuing, said prin  cipal Biswas. 
    Apeejay School has replaced cold drinks with juices   and salads in its canteen,   while Shri Shikshayatan   School stresses the value of   healthy food through an orien  tation programme. 
    Apurba Ghosh, the direc  tor of the Institute of Child   Health, said the incidence of   anorexia nervosa (charac  terised by low body weight,   poor appetite and an obsessive   fear of fat) and bulimia (an   eating disorder that includes   bingeing, followed by compen  satory behaviour like forced   vomiting) had increased   among teenagers in the city. 
    Girls, especially, feel inad  equate after seeing reed-thin   celebrities. Diet control soon   turns into a psychiatric prob  lem. The patient might see a   thin girl in the mirror, but in   her mind she is fat. The weigh  ing machine then holds no   meaning for her, he warned.  Bulimia can even kill. A   patients hand and feet become   cold, body hair starts to appear   because of hormonal changes,   the heart rate goes down, the   fat around various body or  gans dries up, and the teeth   start to rot, said Ghosh.  School authorities blame   parental indulgence and neg  lect in equal measure for the   unhealthy eating habits of chil  dren. I want to create aware  ness among parents so that   they review what kind of food   they are giving their children,   said Malini Bhagat, principal,   Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher   Secondary School.

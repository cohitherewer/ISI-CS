          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police on Monday arrested two pool-car drivers on the charge of hatching a plan to kidnap a three-year-old girl by engaging the familys 13-year-old domestic help.        
	The drivers were arrested in front of an English-medium school in Gariahat where the child, Priyanjali Sengupta, studies. The help was arrested on Sunday.        
	Nabin Naskar, 23, and Bablu Kuti, 35, were picked up when they reached the school with children in their pool cars. The duo admitted that they had plotted to abduct the child, a Sonarpur resident, for ransom, said Damayanti Sen, the joint commissioner, crime.        
	Priyanjalis parents  Priyam, an employee of the Indian Chamber of Commerce, and wife Reshmi  had hired the help a few days ago. A probe revealed that the help, who would accompany Priyanjali to school and back home in a pool car, had developed an affair with Nabin.        
	The maid allegedly told the police that Nabin had promised to marry her but said a lot of money would be needed to start a new life.        
	Nabin floated the plan to kidnap Priyanjali for money. The maid agreed to the proposal, said an officer. The maid was caught after she stole the cellphone of the mother of a classmate of Priyanjali. Nabin asked her to steal the phone as without it they could not communicate, an officer said.

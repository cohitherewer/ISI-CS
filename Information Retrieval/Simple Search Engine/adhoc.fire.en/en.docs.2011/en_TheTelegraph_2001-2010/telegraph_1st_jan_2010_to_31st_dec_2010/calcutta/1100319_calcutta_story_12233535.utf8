The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Health cradle in crisis
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Health cradle in crisis
          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children has been stripped of a postgraduate diploma course that was producing junior doctors without accreditation for 32 years, leaving Bengals lone paediatric referral institution staring at a potential manpower crisis.         
	The Medical Council of India (MCI) recently wrote to the health department, saying that the unaccredited post-graduate diploma course in child health offered by two institutes  BC Roy childrens hospital in Kankurgachhi and Chittaranjan Seva Sadan in Hazra  must be discontinued from this academic year.         
	The directive, coinciding with health minister Surjya Kanta Mishras grand plan to increase MBBS seats in state-run medical colleges by around 700, is apparently the result of the health department dilly-dallying over seeking MCI recognition for the postgraduate course.         
	The course was being run till 2009 with special permission. When the MCI finally put its foot down last year, the health department requested for another year, which was granted. But there will be no admissions this year, said Prabir Kumar Deb, the vice-chancellor of the West Bengal University of Health Sciences.         
	The director of medical education, S.N. Banerjee, claimed that the government had since fast-tracked the process of accreditation and that a team of experts would conduct an inspection of the two institutes very soon.         
	But why didnt the government act during the three decades that this diploma course was being run without recognition anywhere outside Bengal?        
	Sources at Swastha Bhavan said health department officials knew what was coming for at least a year  if not three decades  but sat on the issue.        
	Even if the MCI gives the green signal this year, the earliest that these two hospitals could start offering the course again would be the 2011-12 academic session. What that means for BC Roy childrens hospital is a possible shortage of junior doctors, the backbone of any government healthcare institution.         
	The 360-bed BC Roy hospital presently has 11 senior doctors  professors, associate and assistant professors, and resident medical officers and 37 junior doctors or post-graduate trainees. The hospital is invariably packed with patients far exceeding its capacity.        
	Three years ago, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had announced plans to merge BC Roy childrens hospital with BC Roy Polio Clinic and Hospital for Crippled Children to form one of the largest paediatric institutes in the country. Like many other grand proposals, that file is gathering dust at Swastha Bhavan.        
	A detailed project proposal is being prepared. It is in the primary stage, rambled an official, reinforcing the belief that Bengals healthcare system is terminally ill.

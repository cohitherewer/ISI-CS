The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Speed-up runway hits slowdown   Taxiway ready but not for takeoff
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Speed-up runway hits slowdown     - Ready for take-off six months ago, taxiway to ease congestion awaits nod          SANJAY MANDAL                                    
	Fliers frustrated by traffic chaos on the road to the airport are now having to contend with congestion on the runway as well. Flights have been taking 30 to 40 minutes longer than scheduled to take off and land during the morning and evening peak hours because a new taxiway meant to speed up things has been lying unused.        
	Airport sources blamed the Directorate General of Civil Aviation for Taxiway K  one of two new additions that cost Rs 17 crore to build  remaining unused despite being ready for opening six months ago. Calcutta airport being a licensed aerodrome, the addition of any facility or change in infrastructure requires the DGCAs approval. But they are sitting on our application, an official said.        
	The safety assessment report for Taxiway K, on the northern side, was sent to Delhi before last winter but the airport authorities havent heard from the headquarters since. A DGCA official said from New Delhi that safety assessments at airports were being conducted one by one and that Calcuttas turn will come soon.         
	The new taxiways on either side of the original four links between the primary and secondary runways are expected to reduce taxiing time to around eight minutes once these are operational.                           
	An aircraft usually takes around 15 minutes to complete the taxiing-to-takeoff cycle in a no-traffic situation.        
	With both new taxiways still not operational and the number of flights increasing, runway delays during the morning and evening peak hours have increased, said a Calcutta-based pilot.         
	Flights are delayed up to 40 minutes on an average between 9 and 11am and from 4 to 6pm. Eight to nine aircraft are scheduled for takeoff in a 15-minute span during peak hours. The runways also handle an equal number of arrivals over the same period.        
	The secondary runway at Calcutta being much shorter than the primary one, the four existing links are quite far from the point on the main runway where an aircraft starts its run for takeoff. After entering the main runway through one of those links, an aircraft now needs to go back around 1,600m to reach the starting point, which adds to the congestion during peak hours.        
	The taxiway on the northern side is meant to enable aircraft to take off from the point it enters the primary runway via the extended portion of the secondary runway, thus saving a lot of time. It is ready and we only need a formal safety clearance to open it, said airport director R. Srinivasan.        
	The rapid-exit taxiway at the southern end is meant to enable landing aircraft to quickly vacate the runway.        
	The rapid-exit taxiway missed the March 31 deadline but is almost ready. But it looks like getting the DGCAs approval will take time, said an official. This taxiway is angled in such a way that an aircraft need not come to a near-halt to take a turn and vacate the runway.        
	Calcutta airport has spent around Rs 10 crore on the extension of the secondary runway and a 230m link with the primary runway.        
	The Airports Authority of India recently wrote to the state government to shift a mosque from the edge of the runway, as it poses a safety threat. The mosque, around 25m high, is directly in the path of aircraft landing on the secondary runway.

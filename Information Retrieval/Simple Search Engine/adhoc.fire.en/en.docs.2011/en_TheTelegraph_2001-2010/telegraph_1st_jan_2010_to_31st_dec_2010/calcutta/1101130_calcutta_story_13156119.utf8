          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Street children whom cops have taken off the street and put into informal classrooms will soon have a fun way to learn lessons.        
	Calcutta polices Nabadisha project that works towards improving health and education of street children has joined hands with the Seagull Foundation for the Arts to organise storytelling sessions for them.        
	These children are not used to formal education and often come from difficult backgrounds. Listening to stories is a fun way of learning and it doesnt even feel like learning, said Megha Malhotra, the co-ordinator of the Peace Works project run by Seagull.        
	The stories told at the sessions will have messages on tolerance, compassion, gender issues and will also deal with conflict. The stories will help children cope with their lives better.        
	There will be stress on variety, with the stories ranging from those written by established authors to real-life experiences of storytellers.        
	We are building up a base of volunteers. They can be of any age. All they need is a passion for storytelling. People can speak about their own experiences that the children can relate to, said Malhotra.        
	The storytelling sessions will initially be held at two Nabadisha centres daily. Later, such sessions may be started at all the centres. The sessions will either be held in the morning or the afternoon, depending on when their formal training is being conducted.        
	We already use a lot of informal teaching methods with these children and we have had some success stories but the overall reach is extensive, said Sanjay Singh, the additional commissioner of police (armed police).        
	Nabadisha covers over 2,500 street and slum children across 35 centres under 42 police stations.Storytelling can often turn into interactive sessions which help these children build confidence and brush up their communication skills, said Malhotra.        
	The project is set to take-off by the end of this year.

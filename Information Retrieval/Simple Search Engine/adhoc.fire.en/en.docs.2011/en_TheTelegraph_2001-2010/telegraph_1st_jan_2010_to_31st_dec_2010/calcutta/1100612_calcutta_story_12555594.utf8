The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | School stands by corrective steps
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      School stands by corrective steps
  - Silence broken on Rawla and Smart        CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                    
	Four days after its principal and four teachers were accused of administering corporal punishment and driving a Class VIII student to suicide, the La Martiniere for Boys authorities admitted there are times when children need to be corrected and helped for which some corrective measures have to be taken.        
	A statement issued by Supriyo Dhar, the secretary to the board of governors, on Friday stressed that its dignified silence must not be seen as an acceptance of the accusations levelled at the school, but hinted at  and justified  the occasional use of corporal punishment to discipline the boys.        
	It is important for the school to ensure that there is an environment conducive to learning and often corrective measures have to be taken to ensure that this environment is not vitiated in the interest of the larger student community of the school.        
	The press release also touched upon Sanjay Smart, a teacher who allegedly denied promotion to Class IV boy Srijan Banerjee after his father refused to give him a laptop as bribe. Smart was arrested on May 17 for extortion and criminal intimidation and is now in judicial custody.        
	The teacher concerned is now under suspension.        
	The school finds itself at the receiving end of a police probe following the abetment-to-suicide charge slapped against five teachers by Ajay Rawla, father of Rouvanjit who was found hanging in his Alipore home on February 12.        
	An independent probe by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights has already found corporal punishment to be a regular affair on the Loudon Street campus.        
	Ashok Agarwal, who led the probe team and is finalising the report recommending radical changes in the way the school is run, reacted sharply to the statement.            
	SCHOOL SAYS 
  ldquo;There are times when children need to be corrected and helped. Often corrective measures have to be taken. rdquo;
  (statement issued by secretary to the board of governors)  
	COMPLAINANT SAYS
  ldquo;This is a confession on the part of the school. rdquo;
  (Ajay Rawla, father of Rouvanjit who died on Feb.12)  
	PROBE CHIEF SAYS
  ldquo;Authorities who condone this (corrective measures) do not have the moral or legal right to run a school. rdquo;
  (Ashok Agarwal, appointed by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights)  
	EX-BOARD MEMBER SAYS
  ldquo;Corporal punishment can in no way be justified. rdquo;
  (Neil O rsquo;Brien, who was dropped for opposing caning and other wrongdoings)      
	How can a school say that corrective measures have to be taken? Authorities who condone this do not have the moral or legal right to run a school, Agarwal told Metro from Delhi late on Friday.        
	The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009 empowers the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights to supervise proper implementation of the legislation, including addressing complaints of corporal punishment in schools.        
	Regarding Rouvanjit, who was caned by principal Chakravarthi four days before he committed suicide, the schools statement regretted the loss of a young life but clarified that the attempt to hold the school entirely responsible was misplaced.        
	This is a confession on the part of the school, said Ajay Rawla. They have admitted that it is not entirely their fault so it means they are accepting they are in some way responsible. Now it is up to the police to find out how far they are responsible.        
	As for Sanjay Smart, the statement claimed that the school had started proceedings and handed over Smart to the police.        
	But police sources said the teacher was absconding after a complaint was filed by Srijans father Partha Pratim Banerjee  who had also accused the principal of shielding the teacher  and he was finally located without help from the school authorities.        
	Banerjee said: I had filed the complaint on April 2. Why wasnt he suspended immediately, before his arrest on May 17? But if he has been finally suspended, they have realised their mistake.

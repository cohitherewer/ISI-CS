                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Trio go blank on Bypass mishap
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE AND SUBHAJOY ROY                             (Top) Pranay Suri, who was driving the Lancer that was mounted by a truck and (above) the mangled car. (Amit Datta)                                 
	Pranay Suri, the Ballygunge boy who was at the wheel of the Mitsubishi Lancer that was mounted by a truck on the Bypass early on Sunday, cant recollect anything about the mishap except a big bang turning life into a blur.        
	We had gone for dinner at Silver Spring (on the EM Bypass) and were driving back home when something rammed into the car from the side with a big bangthen I became unconscious, Pranay, who lost his younger sibling Akshay and two friends in the crash, told Metro on Monday.        
	When he regained consciousness, 21-year-old Pranay, who is studying animation at filmmaker Subhash Ghais Whistling Woods institute in Mumbai, called his father Urmesh Suri at their Ballygunge Circular Road home. Urmesh and wife Niru reached the accident spot  near Moilakhal culvert, between Silver Spring and the Parama rotary  within 15 minutes on a motorcycle.        
	The cops had moved Pranay and Tushar Hegde (a Mumbai boy studying in Bangalore) to hospital by then. My wife accompanied Meggna (Ray Singh), Akshay and Zafar (Ahmed Khan) to Ruby Hospital in another vehicle. I followed on a motorcycle after putting their friend Satyabhama (Mitra), who I suspected was already dead, in another vehicle, recalled Urmesh, who owns an advertising agency.        
	Akshay and Zafar were declared brought dead at Ruby General Hospital.         
	We lost our younger son while Pranay is not only nursing physical injuries but also numbed by shock. I dont know how we will all get over this, said Urmesh, whose red Mitsubishi Lancer his elder son was driving.        
	Doctors said Pranay was the luckiest of the six who were in the car, escaping with a nasal bone fracture, a shoulder injury and some soft-tissue damage. Meggna, a student of Class XII at La Martiniere for Girls, is undergoing treatment at Ruby for head avulsions and blunt trauma.         
	Like Pranay, she remembers little of how the accident occurred. I was dozing off when I heard a bang. Then I felt an excruciating pain in my headI dont remember anything else, murmured Meggna, her head bandaged and voice barely audible as she lay on her bed in an executive cabin.         
	For Tushar, who suffered head and hand injuries, the only good news was the arrival of his father Nityanand Hegde from Mumbai. I really dont remember how the mishap happened. I dont ever want to talk about it either, said Tushar, who had come to Calcutta to meet his schoolmate Akshay.         
	Doctors at Life Line Nursing Home on Wood Street, where Tushar was admitted, said the student of Jain International School in Bangalore regained consciousness only late on Sunday.         
	The driver and helper of the truck involved in the accident were absconding till late on Monday. Police have approached the public vehicles department to trace the owner of the vehicle, which was apparently speeding down the wrong flank. We have booked the driver under Section 279 (rash and negligent driving) and Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC, said an officer at Tiljala police station.         
	Investigators are yet to question any of the three survivors to find out how the accident occurred. We are told they are not yet in a position to talk, the officer added.

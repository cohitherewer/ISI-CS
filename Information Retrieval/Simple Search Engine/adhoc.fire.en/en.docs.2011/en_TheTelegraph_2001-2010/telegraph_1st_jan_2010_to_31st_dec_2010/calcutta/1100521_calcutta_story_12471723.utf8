The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 30 students injured 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      30 students injured 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          An injured student in hospital on Thursday. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	A councillor in Howrah allegedly stormed into a school with her supporters on Thursday, triggering a stampede that injured around 30 students, six of whom had to be hospitalised.         
	Police said the authorities of Howrah Shiksha Sadan had accused Sweta Singh, the councillor of ward 29 of the Howrah Municipal Corporation, of trying to pressure them into admitting five students recommended by her.        
	The councillor came with 50 to 60 supporters around 1.30pm, shouting slogans. The children panicked and started running in all directions. Nearly 30 were injured and six among them fell unconscious. They were taken to Howrah District Hospital, where they were administered oxygen and saline drip, said an employee of the school, which is located in ward 27.         
	Headmistress Durga Vyas said Singh had visited her office on Tuesday and threatened her with dire consequences if she failed to admit the five by Wednesday.         
	But the students failed to meet the admission criteria of our school. I refused to succumb to Singhs pressure and admit the students, said Vyas.        
	If we flout our admission rules because of the councillor, many more people might approach us with similar demands, she added.         
	The councillor denied leading a procession into the school. She alleged that the school often demanded money to admit students.         
	Since I protest such practices, the school brought a false charge against me, said Singh.

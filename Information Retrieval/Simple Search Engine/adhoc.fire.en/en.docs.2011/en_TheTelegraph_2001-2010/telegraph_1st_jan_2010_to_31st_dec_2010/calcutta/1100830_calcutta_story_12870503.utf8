The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Runway scare probe grounds two officials
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Runway scare probe grounds two officials
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Two air traffic control officials at the city airport have been benched after a probe found them responsible for a near-collision on the runway on August 3.        
	The duo would be allowed to resume duty only after they go through a corrective training.        
	City-based officials of the directorate general of civil aviation have conducted the probe and sent the report to the headquarters in Delhi. The two ATC officials have been taken off the roster. They will be asked to join a corrective training once a formal order comes from Delhi, said a senior airport official.        
	A Jet Airways plane carrying 154 passengers from Bangkok was approaching the airport for landing when the pilot noticed another aircraft about to taxi for take-off from the same runway.        
	In a split-second decision, the pilot aborted landing and remained airborne till the other aircraft, Air Indias Calcutta-Delhi-London flight, took off.        
	The Air India flight was to take off earlier. Its departure was delayed because of a last-minute change in the flight plan by the ATC, said H.N. Mishra, the DGCAs air safety officer for the east and northeast.        
	Before a flight leaves, the ATC hands over to the pilot a flight plan containing details of the height, speed and direction of the aircraft after take-off. The pilot feeds the information to the aircrafts flight management system.        
	The Air India pilot was given a plan that had to be changed as a Jet Airways flight had taken off a few minutes before that. The pilot had to spend a few extra minutes on the runway to feed the revised information to the flight management system, said Mishra.        
	A senior official said the ATC could have conveyed the changed plan to the Air India pilot before he entered the runway. That would have kept the runway free.        
	The Jet Airways flight from Bangkok was approaching the airport for landing while the Air India pilot was re-programming his flight management system.        
	Sources said the ATC had told the Jet pilot that landing clearance would be given in a few seconds. The Jet pilot then spotted the Air India aircraft on the runway. He aborted the landing, and remained air-borne and made a fresh approach after the runway was cleared, said an official.

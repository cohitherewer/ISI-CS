	The Rabindra Rachanabali at home does not give you the complete picture of what Rabindranath Tagore wrote or thought. Dont blame your buy because nor do any of his standalone texts in the market. For, the Bard kept revising a work through his life.        
	To understand Tagore and his mind better, a software called Pathantar has been developed. It can compare the variant readings of a work line by line and so help create the first complete critical hypertext for Tagore, or any author writing in Bengali. Pathantar was launched in course of the Rabindra Jayanti celebrations at Jadavpur University (JU) on Monday. It is a first in any Indian language.        
	In Tagores case, manually comparing the multiple versions of each text would take a lifetimes work for more than 100 people, so vast is his oeuvre. That is why taking the computers help becomes essential, says Prof Sukanta Chaudhuri, the director of JUs School of Cultural Texts and Records.        
	He cites the play Raktakarabi of which about 10-12 manuscripts exist and the novel Gora for which the serialised form in Prabashi magazine is vastly different from what appeared later as a book. Tagore has deleted scenes, omitted characters and even changed endings in course of revisions of his works, points out Chaudhuri.        
	What is available in print is usually the text of a single edition. It is wrong to say one particular edition is the correct one. Tagores mind and heart were evolving as were his spelling practices, adds the professor of English.        
	Chaudhuri and his team have chosen Bisarjan, of which eight authoritative texts exist, to put the software to test. Tagore revised Bisarjan eight times between 1890 and 1939. Huge differences exist among the eight, the longest being three to four times the shortest, he explains.        
	The texts have to be keyed in but the more laborious, error-prone and specialised job of comparing variants can be done by the software. Tagore scholars and readers will, however, have to wait a while for Pathantar. The idea is scholarly access but it will take some weeks to fine-tune the software, says Chaudhuri.                          
	Once fine-tuned, will the software be sold? We may bring out CDs or upload it on the university website. Other institutes may take the work forward in collaboration with us, says Chaudhuri.        
	JUs School of Education Technology developed the interface for the product, work on which started in 2005 but was slowed by lack of funds.        
	Next step, a collaboration with Rabindra Bhavan, Visva-Bharati, which is the repository of most of Tagore manuscripts and printed editions.        
	They have forwarded us the manuscripts of the volumes Manasi and Sonar Tari. But unless we receive more funds, whether we can proceed further is a big question, says Chaudhuri.        
	Poet Sankha Ghosh, who had single-handedly traced the publishing history of Tagores work for the Bengal governments 125th anniversary edition of Rabindra Rachanabali, hails the initiative. A hypertext would be most useful for scholars as it puts all variants at their fingertips on a single screen.

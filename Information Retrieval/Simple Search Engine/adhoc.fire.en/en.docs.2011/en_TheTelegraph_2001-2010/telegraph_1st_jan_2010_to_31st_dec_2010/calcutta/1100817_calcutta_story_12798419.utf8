The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | For the record, LPs get a new spin   Price no bar for nostalgia 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      For the record, LPs get a new spin
  - Pre-Walkman generation renews romance with vinyl after two decades           SUBHRO SAHA                          YESTERDAY ONCE MORE: A customer contemplates buying an LP record at Music World. (Aranya Sen)                                        
	Adman Abeer Chakravarty picked up the new Jimmy Hendrix release Valleys of Neptune on vinyl in the US but Led Zeppelins Mothership in a 4-LP box set on the racks of a Calcutta store left him zapped.        
	 It was wonderful to touch and feel long-playing records of my favourite classic rock acts in a Calcutta outlet (Music World on Park Street) again, Chakravarty, a record collector who recently gifted himself a Denon turntable, told Metro.        
	Music buffs across town  mostly the pre-Walkman generation  are delighted to be able to renew their romantic rendezvous with the LP record after nearly two decades of divorce. But unlike the old, scratched records sold off the Free School Street and College Street pavements, vinyl is now a premium-priced collectors item not suited for every pocket.        
	For those sold on nostalgia, price seems to be no bar for vinyls second coming. Last year, 2.5 million albums were sold worldwide on vinyl, up 33 per cent from 2008, the longest sales leap since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking retail sales in 1991.         
	In Calcutta, more than 70 per cent of the limited stocks at Music World disappeared off the racks in less than a month.         
	 We had procured limited stocks because we were unsure about how customers would react to the price tag, said Lohor Sanyal, the senior manager of operations (east) at Music World.         
	The Park Street outlet of the chain is the only store picked by EMI Virgin  the first label off the blocks in the record resurrection project  to retail vinyl in the city.                                      
	Sanyal said the store had since placed fresh orders to cope with the demand. By September, we hope to have a separate section for vinyl, complete with turntables and stylus, he added.        
	By then, other labels like Universal and Sony BMG are set to join the record rush.        
	So would the prices come down with competition?         
	The pricing may seem high but that is also because some of these releases on LP are unique. For example, Pink Floyds Dark Side of The Moon LP (Rs 2,025) is a special edition that comes with posters not available in the CD format. The Led Zeppelin Mothership box set (Rs 6,995) comes specially packaged and mastered at half speed only on vinyl release, said T. Suresh, the country head of EMI Virgin.        
	Likewise, The Beatles ONE LP set (Rs 3,995) is being marketed as a collectors piece because of the posters and artist cards that come with it.        
	The titles released on vinyl by EMI Virgin range from classics like Fleetwood Macs Rumours, Eagles Hotel California and The Beatles albums to contemporary sounds like the Arctic Monkeys Humbug, Animal Collectives Merriweather Post Pavilion, Radioheads Pablo Honey and Norah Joness The Fall.        
	In fact, the first LP record to sell in our store was Norah Jones The Fall (Rs 795), which led us to believe that the return of the record would not only enthuse the 40-plus customer but the young music fan as well. We have been vindicated since, smiled Music Worlds Sanyal.        
	Sanjay Dixit, the national sales manager for EMI Virgin, is confident that the quality-conscious consumer would lap up records despite the pocket pinch.        
	Our half-speed mastering technique allows twice as much time for the cutting stylus to cut every possible detail and delicate groove modulation, resulting in LPs where you can hear details and nuances in your favourite music that you had never heard before. Thus, resulting audiophile LPs can sound much closer to the original recording in comparison to standard CDs, insisted Dixit.         
	For vinyl disc die-hards like Abeer Chakravarty, not having to wait for their next overseas trip to buy one is reason enough to record some cheer for now.

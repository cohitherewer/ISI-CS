The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City braces for forced shutdown   Students and fliers grounded
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City braces for forced shutdown

	Left Front chairman Biman Boses assurance to allow smooth passage to those braving the bandh on Tuesday and trying to get to work has not even reached  or convinced  his governments transport minister.        
	Ranjit Kundu said at Writers Buildings on Monday that buses and trams would hit the road only if drivers and conductors reported for duty. I cannot give any assurance. It totally depends on the employees. I dont feel any extra arrangements need to be made, he said.        
	What about Boses claim that special arrangements would be made for those reaching railway stations and airports? I am not aware of that, said the minister.        
	The brothers Chakrabarti, though, were on the same page on bandh-eve. Police commissioner Gautam Mohan promised proper arrangements. In every bandh we try to maintain normalcy, he said.        
	His elder brother and state chief secretary Asok Mohan said: We will make all arrangements for those who want to come to office or open shop. Would the Writers army show up? If anybody resides within a specified distance he or she must report for work. If anybody reports after 11am a days casual leave will be deducted. And what was the reporting-for-duty distance? I am not sure, but its around 5km.        
	The Writers workforce is unlikely to rue a workday lost in the protest against price rise but lakhs of students of various undergraduate and postgraduate courses would be hit hard by the bandh throwing exam schedules haywire. The BA and BSc Part-III honours exam under Calcutta University has been pushed back from Tuesday to May 2, a Sunday, while the revised dates for the remaining exams will be announced later.        
	It is difficult to conduct an exam on a Sunday but we are helpless. The result schedule is bound to be disrupted because of the postponement, said a senior official of the university. The Part-III results must be declared before July as many students apply for postgraduate courses in other states and countries.        
	Postgraduate and undergraduate students of Jadavpur University will also suffer with the bandh pushing back exams.                    
	All the exams slated for Tuesday have been postponed, said a senior official of JU. The revised dates will be announced within a day or two, he added.        
	Some schools students will be in a quandary with their institutions leaving it to the parents. Calcutta Girls High School, Calcutta Boys, La Martiniere for Girls and Boys are among those asking parents to take a call about sending their wards to school. The likes of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, Apeejay School in Park Street and Salt Lake, Birla High School for Boys and Girls, South Point, Delhi Public School, Megacity and Ruby Park have played it safe and declared a holiday.        
	Like school campuses, the Calcutta airport will wear a deserted look for most of Tuesday with 50-plus flights cancelled. No flights will operate between 6am and 6pm. Some flights will operate before 6am, said an airport official.        
	It will be impossible to operate flights as the ground handling staff of the airlines will not come to work. Also, passengers and crew would have a tough time reaching the airport, added Vijay Matta, the chairman of the Airlines Operators Committee.        
	Among the international flights deferred to the evening are Calcutta-Dubai Emirates and Calcutta-Kuala Lumpur Air Asia. Jet Airways has cancelled its Bangkok flight.        
	Airport officials said 17 flights of Jet Airways, 13 of IndiGo, 10 of Kingfisher, around 10 of SpiceJet and one Air India flight (to Kathmandu) have been cancelled. Jet Airways will operate five flights before 6am, to Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Guwahati and Dhaka. IndiGo will operate three flights to Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.        
	Metro Rail would run provided there are no obstructions at stations by bandh supporters. The frequency of services will be decided depending upon passenger flow, said a Metro official.        
	Railway officials said all suburban and long-distance trains would be operating, provided there are no obstructions on the tracks.        
	Police claimed elaborate arrangements with around 3,000 additional personnel deployed in and around the city, and pickets at important crossings.

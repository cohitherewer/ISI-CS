The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hostel as wedding host
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hostel as wedding host
										      Onthespot - National Medical College Girls rsquo; Hostel                        Revelry continued till late at a marriage function held in the National Medical College girls hostel compound on December 13 as second-year MBBS students prepared for an exam				                           
	The compound of the Calcutta National Medical College girls hostel is doubling as a free venue for social dos, much to the inconvenience of students.        
	While the principal of the college cites humanitarian grounds for allowing the marriage parties and other programmes, students complain of music blaring from loudspeakers till dawn and drunks making a din.        
	A marriage ceremony was on when Metro visited the compound on December 13. The organiser was the groom, a Hatibagan resident who is neither an employee of the college or the hostel.         
	The inmates of the hostel, particularly those in the second year, had to suffer because an MBBS exam was scheduled the following day.        
	A large pandal was erected on the campus after taking necessary permission from the authorities. The revelry continued till dawn the next day.         
	Principal R.N. Chattopadyay said: Social functions are held on the campus. I know it is not proper to allow that but where will the poor people hold their functions? If a durwan or a sweeper requests permission to use the grounds for his relatives social functions, how can I refuse him?         
	Urmila Rawat, a sweeper at the hostel, said: It was the marriage function of our sweeper Bijoy Rawats nephew, who lives in Hatibagan.        
	Most employees of the girls hostel refused comment. I have no idea whether a marriage ceremony was held here on December 13 because it was a Sunday, my off day, said the hostel housekeeper, Maya Kundu.        
	Others said the principal was a figurehead with no control over Group D employees.        
	The principal is helpless. He is forced to give permission because the union leaders actually allow this. The principal only provides a rubber stamp, said an employee of the girls hostel on condition of anonymity.         
	Students complained about the round-the-year nuisance.        
	We sometimes feel insecure. But who will we lodge a complaint to if the authority gives them permission? asked Sushmita Naskar, a second year student.        
	Intern Sanchita Banerjee, said: The principal doesnt always know about the programmes held here. What is disturbing is that even if we lodge a complaint, there is no redress.         
	Monalisa Mandal, a first-year student, said: On the night of a programme, hundreds of outsiders assemble here and park their cars and two-wheelers. Since it is a girls hostel, the two gates are supposed to close after eight in the evening. But on the night of a programme, both gates remain open all night. There are durwans but they are ineffective. The programmes not only disturb us but compromises our security as well.        
	Are the authorities listening to the students?        
	Talat Salahuddin

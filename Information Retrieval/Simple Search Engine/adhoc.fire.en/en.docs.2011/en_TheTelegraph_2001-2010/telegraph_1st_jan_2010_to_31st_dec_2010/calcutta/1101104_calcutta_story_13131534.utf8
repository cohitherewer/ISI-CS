The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Way below the basic mark
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Way below the basic mark
          SUBRATA MAITRA                                            
	Calcutta airport, compared with other metro airports in the country, is in a dilapidated state.        
	Lack of foresight and planning on the part of the authorities is all too evident at the domestic terminal because the flights have increased but the facilities have not improved.        
	Basic cleanliness is way below any standard. The toilets, walls, floors  there are stains everywhere and it gives the feel of a railway station.        
	The passenger-seating arrangements are inadequate at both the domestic and international terminals.        
	The international terminal building of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport is in bad shape and in my experience, it can accommodate passengers for only two flights at a time.        
	While taking international flights from the terminal, I have often seen that if more than two flights are departing within a short span, then there is utter congestion at the registered luggage X-ray, immigration and other counters.        
	The aerobridge was introduced a few years back with a lot of fanfare but Ive hardly ever got to use the aerobridge while boarding a flight.        
	The new international terminal of Delhi airport has impressed me quite a lot. Similarly, the domestic terminal in Delhi has also undergone huge improvement in the past few years but Calcutta is lagging far behind.        
	Even the airports main approach road VIP Road  once supposed to be the best with a boulevard down the middle and waterbodies on both sides, has degenerated into a clogged road with highrises built on the waterbodies over the last three decades.        
	The new approach road through Rajarhat New Town is a welcome relief to some extent although both ends are clogged with traffic, near Kaikhali and Chingrihata.        
	Approaching the airport from the Jessore Road side is a nightmare. I strongly feel flyovers from both ends of Jessore Road can be the only solution to the traffic problem as I hardly see any chance of road expansion there because of encroachment.         
	While the plane is descending, I feel delighted to see the greenerypaddy fields, waterbodies, coconut trees  around the airport. However, as soon as I enter the arrival terminal, I feel choked because of the dirt, pandemonium and traffic congestion. Lack of orderliness plagues every corner of the airport.        
	In my childhood days, during the mid-60s, all the important international airlines used to touchdown in Calcutta. But now I feel sad that barring a few, all have left. As a proud Calcuttan, I dream that our airport will improve one day and well have better facilities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | College autonomy mission on last lap
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      College autonomy mission on last lap
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, Belur, is set to become Bengals fourth autonomous college and the third institution run by the monastic order to be granted freedom from Calcutta University.        
	The University Grants Commission (UGC) is scheduled to conduct its final inspection of the college on May 18 and announce the outcome within a fortnight.        
	We had sent our final proposal for autonomy in March. Responding to our proposal, the UGC has agreed to conduct a final inspection. As things stand, we should be able admit students to our first-year undergraduate courses for the 2010-11 academic session in July as an autonomous institution, Swami Tyagarupananda, the principal of the Howrah-based institution, told Metro.        
	Representatives of the state government and Calcutta University will be present during the inspection, though both have already given their clearance for autonomy to Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira.        
	Once the UGC announces the outcome of the final inspection, the report will be placed before the Calcutta University Syndicate. The mission-run college will be formally declared an autonomous institution after the syndicate approves the UGCs decision, said a senior official of the higher education department.        
	An autonomous college can frame its own syllabi, conduct examinations and award degrees. Marksheets and certificates issued by the institution bear its seal as well as that of the university. St Xaviers was the first college in the state to be granted autonomy, in 2006.         
	Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, set up 69 years ago, was declared a centre of excellence by the UGC in February this year. As and when autonomy comes, it will join the ranks of Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, and Ramakrishna Mission Sikshamandir, a BEd college in Belur, as independent institutions.         
	Four other Calcutta University affiliates  the government-controlled Lady Brabourne College, Bethune College and Maulana Azad College, and the state-aided Bijoy Krishna Girls College in Howrah  have been declared centres of excellence this year, making them eligible to apply for autonomy.        
	But sources said none of these four colleges had even started preparing the ground for autonomy. We cannot even apply for autonomy until we get the state governments green signal, said the principal of one of the state-controlled colleges in the list.        
	Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira was pushing for autonomy even before earning the tag of centre of excellence.

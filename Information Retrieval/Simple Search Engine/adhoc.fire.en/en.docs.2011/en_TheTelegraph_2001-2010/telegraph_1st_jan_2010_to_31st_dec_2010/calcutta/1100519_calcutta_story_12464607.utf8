                      Capturing eternal beauty        With his love for the outdoors and an eye for observing the natural world, Siddharth began his romance with photography in the early 1990s when he spent some years in the UK. The Scottish highlands, the rolling meadows and the autumnal shades of the English countryside prompted him to capture their beauty. Back in India, the sylvan surroundings of North Bengal rsquo;s tea gardens and wildlife sanctuaries provided him an excellent opportunity to hone his photographic skills. A subsequent stint in Brussels in his professional capacity gave him an ideal opportunity to explore Europe through his lens. Even at his current residence in south Calcutta, his naturalist rsquo;s eye has captured an amazing variety of bird life. Refusing to call himself a photographer, Siddharth insists that he merely captures images that he finds thrilling and that appeal to his mind rsquo;s eye. Moments, the ongoing show of his photographs on nature and wildlife, bears testimony to his uncanny knack of being at the right place at the right time to capture images of stunning, eternal beauty.

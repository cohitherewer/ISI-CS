                      Dreams and imagination                    Katayun Saklats solo exhibition of current works, Continuing to Dream, is a lovely mix of light, colour, myth and fantasy. Saklat is a stained-glass artist and she has painted with oils on canvas these backlit windows with colour-saturated decorative panes. Featuring some of her recent works in a range of styles, her paintings are profoundly personal expressions that capture magical moments and tell delightful stories. The paintings, which are of desolate churches, have for their only denizens stray dogs, leaping cats and even owls, adding a touch of mystery to these images with jewel colours. Even more strange is the lone boy lama with the third eye lost in his dreams and fantasy world. The blaze of light leaves a lasting impression. There is also a series on still-life, where she has depicted familiar items of domestic use. In her paintings inspired by the architecture of Diu, the angular compositons are quite interesting. Here, too, she uses bright hues that soften the geometry of the structures. Another unique feature of the ongoing show is Saklats series depicting some senior artists. Created as a tribute to them, she has used familiar images painted by these artists in an innovative manner.

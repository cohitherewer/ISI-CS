										      HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF   XMAS EVE mdash; A METRO GUIDE                                    
	JUST CHILL        
	The weatherman says Xmas Eve will be cold, windy and dry, with the mercury likely to touch 13 degrees Celsius. Bundle up or burn the dance floor!               
	Dress it up        
	For Her, bright is right this Xmas. Think purples, reds, fluorescent pinks. Opt for red carpet dressing  bright colours, glamour and jewel tones  or go trendy with above-the-knee dresses teamed with sheer full-length socks and strappy sandals. The mid-calf length dress is big too, says fashion designer Anupama Dayal.        
	For Him, the focus is on the trousers. Pair a neutral shirt and jacket with a trouser that has a tiny print, checks or a pop colour splash.                         
	Make-up         
	Play up either your eyes or your lips, is the word from make-up artist Clint Fernandes. While pinks and reds are the hues for your puckers, the smoky-eyed look continues to rule this season. For a burst of colour to your eyes, try greens, blues and purples. If a glossy mouth is Clints choice by day, matte mouth is the night pick. Look no further than Aishwarya in Guzaarish for inspiration.              
	Accessories        
	If youve splurged on a classic LBD, pair it with a nice neckpiece, suggests jewellery designer Eina Ahluwalia. A pop-hued semi-precious stone item is perfect for a touch of colour. The layered look is also in, she says. So, throw in a couple of cuffs or neckpieces and turn heads.         
	where        
	Head for the social clubs across town to party in style.                        
	music n moves        
	DJ Akashs picks for Xmas Eve: Sheila ki jawani from Tees Maar Khan, Munni badnaam hui from Dabangg, Yamla Pagla Deewana title track, Thats my name by Akcent, Dynamite by Taio Cruz, Club cant handle me by Flo Rida.        
	As for magic moves, the flavour of the season is street jazz hip-hop. These steps are high-energy and fast-paced and go well with Bollywood numbers, says choreographer Vishal Kanoi. This year, we received a lot of queries from elderly couples on ballroom dances and waltz, says Kanoi. Youngsters, you have competition on the dance floor!                         
	Sip and bite        
	Expect live counters with Indian and Oriental grills at the clubs with Seekh Kebab, Pomfret Kebab or Tawa Keema on offer. Or go for Continental classics like roast duck, turkey and pork chops. Some clubs are serving up Japanese fare, teppanyaki and yakitori. Wash it down with traditional cocktails like Manhattan, Singapore Swing, Fresh Strawberry Margarita or Mojito. Mixologist Irfan Ahmed suggests: If you are outdoors, stick to Xmas warmers like mulled wine, eggnog and brandynog.                               Mark Zuckerberg and Saina Nehwal      
	Talking points         
	Partying in or out, be sure to know that:  
	 2G is about cellular service, not lingerie size  
	 Dolly (Bindra) is not a sheep, shes the wolf in Bigg Boss        
	 Mark Zuckerberg is the founder of Facebook and The Social Network is his story        
	 Saina, not Sania, is the female face of Indian sport              
	If not partying         
	 Stroll down a dazzling Park Street, have a bite at Flurys (open till midnight) and head for the candlelight service and midnight mass at St Pauls Cathedral, 11pm to 1am.        
	 Head for a plex and catch Akshay-Katrinas Tees Maar Khan or Johnny Depp-Angelina Jolies The Tourist or Rituparno Ghoshs debut as an actor in the first tale of gay love in Tollywood, Arekti Premer Golpo.

	The additional district judge of Alipore court on Friday convicted four men for the murder of homemaker Mamoni Das, 32, and her friend Gopalika De, 30, in Kasba in 2005. The punishment will be announced on Saturday.        
	Naba Kumar Ghosh, Triloki Nath Shaw, Raj Kumar Shaw, Biswanath Dutta, Mohammad Kalachand and Mohammad Shamim were arrested for the twin murders. Justice Partha Pratim Roy acquitted Shamim and held the others guilty. The bodies were found buried in an abandoned factory in Kasba.         
	Triloki, who had an affair with Mamoni, slit Gopalikas throat after learning that he had become close to the homemaker. Triloki shot Mamoni six months later after learning that she was having an affair.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mayor skips water talk with minister 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mayor skips water talk with minister 
          OUR BUREAU                            Sovan Chatterjee and (below) Asok Bhattacharya                                            
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee on Wednesday skipped a meeting with the urban development minister that was supposed to discuss, among other things, the recent water crisis in large parts of south Calcutta.        
	The mayor has to learn to rise above politics. Development projects cant be stalled for politics, fumed minister Asok Bhattacharya, who chaired the meeting at Writers Buildings.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation had sent a team led by municipal commissioner Arnab Roy, but the minister felt the talks would mean little in the mayors absence.        
	Snags in the Garden Reach waterworks have frequently been leaving vast stretches of south Calcutta dry over the past few months. Even the mayors own backyard, Behala, had complained about lack of water during Puja.        
	Trinamul sources said the mayor, nicknamed Jal Sovan because of his stint as mayoral council member in charge of water in an earlier board, could not have attended the meeting even if he had wanted to. There are strict instructions from Didi (Mamata Banerjee) not to attend any government programme, a party general secretary said.        
	Sovan had started his mayoral tenure with a meeting with the urban development minister, raising hopes of a united bid to improve the citys condition. But Mamata had reprimanded him for meeting the CPM leader.        
	He has learnt his lesson, said a Trinamul leader. Sovan hasnt since attended a single meeting with Asok, despite several calls.        
	Asked about his absence on Wednesday, the mayor told Metro: This is our partys stand. We wont sit with them (CPM representatives).         
	Chatterjee claimed the Writers meeting wasnt supposed to discuss the water problem. Would he have gone had water been on the agenda? His emphatic reply: No.        
	Although Garden Reach waterworks is run by a state government agency, Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority, the distribution of water in the city is the CMCs responsibility.         
	It was a very important meeting. I had sent a letter to the mayor asking him to join us here. He wrote back saying he was preoccupied, Bhattacharya said. Let Didi (Mamata) be there, but he (the mayor) also has to work with the dada, bhai, bon, the CPM and the Congress.        
	The meeting reviewed the construction of a 15-million gallon water treatment plant and other renovation projects.

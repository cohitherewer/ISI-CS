The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | High court seal on Ray house order
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      High court seal on Ray house order
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Satyajit Ray                                  
	The high court green bench on Friday declined to overrule the state pollution control boards decision to shut down an illegal factory in the Garpar Road building where Satyajit Ray once lived.        
	The bench of Chief Justice M.S. Shah and Justice K.J. Sengupta, however, asked the board to give the owners of the factory a hearing.        
	Factory owner Jaynidhi Rajbir Surana had moved the court, challenging the validity of the boards closure notice.         
	The building at 100A Garpar Road was constructed in 1914 by Satyajit Rays grandfather Upendrakishore Raychowdhury. Ray was born and had spent his early childhood in the building.        
	The civic body had declared the building a heritage structure a few years back.        
	Residents had lodged a complaint with the board last year alleging that the factory, on the ground floor of the building, was polluting the area.        
	On March 3, the board had slapped a showcause notice on the factory owner and asked him to appear for a hearing on April 10.         
	The company sent an unauthorised person. So my client directed the owner to shut down the factory in 15 days, said the lawyer representing the board.        
	The petitioners advocate claimed that his client was not given a proper hearing.         
	A board official said the company owner would be given a fresh hearing next week.

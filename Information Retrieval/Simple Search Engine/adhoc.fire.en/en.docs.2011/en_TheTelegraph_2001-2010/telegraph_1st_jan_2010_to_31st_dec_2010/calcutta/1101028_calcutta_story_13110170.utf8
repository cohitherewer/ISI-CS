The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Holiday lesson in hill horror   First check, then double check
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Holiday lesson in hill horror     - Need for planning dawns on tourists back from blizzard-hit Himachal          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                                   
	Debabrata Chatterjee has realised the importance of pre-holiday homework the hard way  after being caught in a blizzard at Rohtang Pass and being forced to trek 18km through a snow desert.        
	Lesson number 1 is that its essential to check the weather forecast instead of depending entirely on word of mouth, said the Uttarpara resident, relieved at coming out of his Himalayan misadventure unscathed.        
	Public relations executive Debabrata, 43, is not the only adventurous traveller in town to have been humbled by the vagaries of hill weather this holiday season.        
	From the cloudburst in Ladakh and the landslides in rain-hit Uttarakhand to the blizzard in Himachal Pradesh last week, tourists from Bengal seem to have borne the brunt of natures fury primarily because most didnt bother with the basics of holiday planning.        
	A dream holiday can end up being a horror trip if you go to a particular destination at the wrong time. People from Bengal love travelling but their enthusiasm is seldom matched by proper planning. Some are totally ignorant about weather conditions and the dos and donts of a particular place, said a tour operator.        
	Many of those who have come back wiser from their weather-hit trips to the hills this year were apparently misguided by travel agencies.        
	The tour operators behind the Himachal trips last week had ostensibly ignored a warning  posted on various websites  that it was unsafe to travel to high altitudes after October 15.                                
	Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India, admitted that not all tour operators were above board but said that tourists must also be careful about who they approach.        
	You cannot set up a travel agency with just a desk and a chair. Travel agents and tour operators are selling a service and they need to fulfil certain requirements. Unfortunately, many of the tour agencies in the city lack the necessary expertise, he added.        
	The Bengal government is now planning to draw up a set of guidelines on when, where and who to go with on holidays. Chief secretary Samar Ghosh announced last weekend that a similar advisory would be drawn up for tour operators.        
	But will just an advisory prevent the wanderlust-struck traveller from heading for the hills during the season of landslides or canter towards the coast during the monsoon when the seas are turbulent?        
	A blizzard or a cloudburst can strike without warning but knowing the conditions would certainly help. You should also check whether it is advisable to take an elderly person or a child with you, said Bishan Samaddar, who has travelled extensively in India and abroad.        
	Several of those caught in the Rohtang Pass blizzard were elderly people, including one aged above 80. Some of them suffered injuries while sliding down the slopes after their vehicles got stuck in snow.        
	So where does the traveller start while planning his next trip? The first thing is to check the credentials of the tour operator. Then double check the information given by the operator, said Punjabi.

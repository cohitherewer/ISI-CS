                      Excerpts from life        A cheetah sitting comfortably on a four-poster bed, looking like he is more at home there than the forest, shown in a painting in the background  a funny yet ironic statement on deforestation. Passages, the ongoing solo painting exhibition by Sunil Chandra Pal, deals with many such important concepts and problems by highlighting them in an extraordinary way. The artists strength lies in his inanimate studies, executed in a style that is distinctively his own. His works reflect a contemporary flavour and have a strange, surreal effect as layers of paint merge to form defined forms. Achieving amazing watercolour effects on canvas while working with acrylic medium, Pals paintings have a photographic exactness and definition that give them an impression of stark reality. Viewing things from a different perspective while depicting snapshots of life, his images continue to occupy our minds long after we have actually viewed them. His art amuses us yet, at the same time, it also makes us think. Curator: Reshmi Chatterjee.

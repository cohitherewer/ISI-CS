	Heramba Chandra College was shut down indefinitely on Friday following disturbance by outsiders who want candidates recommended by them to be admitted in the first-year. The college authorities have not lodged a police complaint.        
	For the past few days, outsiders claiming to be student leaders have been demanding that candidates recommended by them be admitted. After we refused to do so, they damaged college property. In a meeting with the board of governors, we decided to close the college indefinitely, said principal Khagen Adhikary.        
	Admissions, which were to end on Saturday, have also been postponed indefinitely.        
	Transport strike: Transport minister Ranjit Kundu said at Writers Buildings on Friday that the state government would ply buses if transport operators carried out their threat of a three-day strike from August 10. We appeal to transport owners to withdraw the strike, he said.        
	Killed: A truck collided with a mini-truck on Andul Road on Friday morning. Ramji Mahato, the 28-year-old driver of the mini-truck, was killed. The cleaner of the mini-truck was injured.

	Roadblock: Traffic on the Barrackpore-Barasat Road remained suspended for five hours from 10am on Friday after Forward Bloc activists blocked the road demanding power supply to nearby villages and employment for local youths in the office of West Bengal State University coming up in the area.        
	Theft: Gold plated silver ornaments of Rs 15,000 were stolen from a Kali temple in Tollygunge on Friday morning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Principals at CM door for security
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Principals at CM door for security
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Representatives of a CPM-backed organisation of college principals met the chief minister on Tuesday afternoon, demanding adequate campus security for their colleagues.        
	We apprised the chief minister of the recent incidents of physical and mental torture of principals. The situation has come to such a pass that teachers are now reluctant to become principal, said Anjan Sengupta, the general secretary of Nikhil Banga Adhyakhya Parishad, who led the five-member delegation.        
	The chief minister, Sengupta said, assured the delegation of proper security on campus and urged principals not to compromise on merit during admission.        
	He said we must ensure that outsiders dont enter college premises. He also stressed the need to ensure that only merit is considered for admission, said Sengupta.        
	In recent months, principals have been attacked at Heramba Chandra, South Calcutta Law, Sammilani, New Alipore and Rashtraguru Surendranath colleges.        
	Pump failure: People living in Behala, Garia, Garden Reach and some other parts of south Calcutta may face water shortage during Puja because of malfunctioning of pumps at Garden Reach water works. The pumps capacity has come down from 65 million gallons a day to 35 million gallons. An official said the situation might improve from Wednesday evening.        
	Complaints: A group D employee of Calcutta Medical College lodged a police complaint on Tuesday, alleging that a junior doctor, Shib Shankar Pal, had assaulted him after some water spilled on the intern.        
	The doctor, too, filed a complaint stating that Anil Das, the group D employee, had thrown acid at him.

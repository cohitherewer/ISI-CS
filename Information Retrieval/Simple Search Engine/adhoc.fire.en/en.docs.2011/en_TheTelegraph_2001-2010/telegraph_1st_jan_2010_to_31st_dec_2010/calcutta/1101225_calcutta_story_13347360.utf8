	A film festival was organised by Ankur, the advocacy group of the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP), to mark World Disability Day on December 3. Its theme was disability rights and bringing the disabled into the mainstream.         
	Through this festival, we want to make people aware of the specific needs of the disabled, said Subhra Chatterjee, the IICP deputy director.         
	Five short films were screened, following which there was an interaction with guests like actor Dhritiman Chaterji, persons with disabilities and schoolchildren.         
	The idea of hosting a film festival took shape when VSA, an international organisation on arts and disability which is affiliated to the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts, wanted the IICP to screen a film, Motion Disabled.         
	The film was screened on World Disability Day in different countries. Instead of screening just one film, we drew up a plan to organise a film festival, added Chatterjee.         
	Motion Disabled, filmed by Simon Mckeown and produced by VSA, records the movements of 14 physically-challenged people. Other films screened included Jayabrato Chatterjees This is my India, a 12-minute film on changing public perceptions on disability; a film by Trinayani, one by the National Trust and another one by CII. If we are successful in convincing even 10 or 15 per cent of our viewers, we will have changed the perceptions of quite a few, said Reena Sen, executive director, IICP.         
	The discussion that followed was dominated by wheelchair-bound Madhuri Kapoor, a commerce graduate who started her journey in the organisation as a student and is now a trainer in the IICP.         
	Training remains incomplete unless there is scope for enrichment, she said.         
	Her observation was echoed by Asif Iqbal, who is visually challenged. When I first got through to Pricewaterhouse Coopers, life was not easy. I was not given any responsibility for the first nine months. They kept sidelining me. But then I proved myself and soon, I was leading a team of three.        
	Though the need to sensitise people is necessary, acceptance has also increased. Now malls have ramps and companies recruit people with disabilities, said 27-year-old Sayan Deb Mukherjee.         
	The pulse of the awareness drive was caught by Class XI student Srijan Uzir of St Josephs College, Bowbazar. The focus should be on the children, as its easier to mould them.              
	Diffrent strokes, diffrent folks

	The canvas was a splash of colours and it stood out among other works of art. The artist, Anikesh Gupta from Akshar school, explained that it was his depiction of Mars.         
	His digital art series was a big hit at an exhibition organised at The Harrington Street Arts Centre. Bilderbuchillustrationen, an exhibition on childrens book illustrations, was put up at the gallery in association with the Calcutta chapter of Max Mueller Bhavan from December 6 to 19. Also on display were the works of young artists with special needs from Akshar, the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy and an NGO, Shuktara.         
	Through this inclusive art exhibition, we wanted to tell the world that some of these children may be impaired or slow learners but they are a storehouse of talent otherwise, said Kavneet Khullar, the owner of the gallery.         
	From Rainy Day to Phuchka Wala Akshar student Malvika Kalanis crayon works reflected the simple things of daily life. Such events help children come out of their shell. This is the first time my daughter participated in an art exhibition. She is so encouraged that she wants to be an artist later on, says Mamta Kalani, the eight-year-olds mother.        
	So does Anikesh, who is also a keen musician. He spends a couple of hours regularly before the computer creatively expressing whatever comes to his mind. His work is usually bright, cheerful and a riot of colours  a reflection of his persona.        
	Sixteen-year-old Subhojit Chatterjee of IICP prefers drawing animals like a turtle, owl and fish instead.         
	Not that he is very fond of animals. In fact, he does not draw much at home. I was surprised to find he took such a keen interest in art in school. He loves to copy faces too, says his mother Kaberi.         
	Other participants like Biswajit Majumdar and Madhuri Kapur from the IICP were also much appreciated for their work.         
	These kids live in a world of their own. They often dont realise how much their work is being praised. They draw because they want to, adds Kaberi.        
	Workshops on childrens illustrations and on animation were also organised on the sidelines during the exhibition

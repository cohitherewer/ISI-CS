                      Tryst with game and glamour                    Golf is the closest game to the game we call life. You get bad breaks from good shots; you get good breaks from bad shots - but you have to play the ball where it lies  Bobby Jones        As the saying goes, it takes hundreds of good golf shots to gain confidence, but only one bad one to lose it, but the indomitable Calcuttans spirit cant be dampened by a couple of messy shots and it was evident again this year as soon as the four-day mega golfing event of the city, The Telegraph Cup Golf 2010, was announced. This year, 360 entries were received for the event which were then divided into 90 teams. Hosted by KKN, in association with Senbo and Ballantine, the four-day golf tournament has a steady line-up of both pros and amateurs who are all set to wield their irons on the RCGCs plush undulating greens. Steeped in history, this event has been played since 1906. The scoring format for the Cup has been decided to be a scratch-stroke-play competition with players in different handicap categories being permitted to discard their poorest holes. Each team has four players but not less than three, and the three best scores will count towards the team aggregate. Participants from Assam and Jamshedpur are giving the Cup a distinct eastern India flavour. The prize distribution ceremony will be held at The Oberoi Grand on Friday at 8.30 pm. The concluding evenings bash has been planned to set the mood swinging with city-band Colours and DJ Akash performing live for the guests.

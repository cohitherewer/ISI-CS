                      In search of hope and happiness                    Set in a rehabilitation centre, Rangakarmees first multi-lingual play, Bhor, is about a group of young boys and their struggle against addiction. Somu, Bunty, Rana and GK are four childhood friends who have become addicted to drugs due to social, personal or economic reasons. However, it is more than a play about disease and suffering. The play is about the spiritual awakening of these youth from melancholy, desolation and despair. Lonely, forsaken and uncared for, they yearn for love and affection. It captures a few subtle moments and frequent mood swings of the addicts, who desperately want to recover from their wretched condition. The play is also about human relationships. It is about the claustrophobia that affects the youth of contemporary society and their struggle against it. Bhor is, ultimately, about the dawn of this struggle. Script, design and direction: Usha Ganguli.                  Event: Bhor, a multi-lingual play produced by Rangakarmee When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Kala Mandir

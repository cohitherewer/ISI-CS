                      Colours of life        When Dr Farida Zaman paints a picture, she first thinks of its intended atmosphere, which then suggests the colours. She does not add colour to her works through any conscious, predetermined decision; they come to her naturally once she has decided upon the atmosphere of her composition. She favours acrylic not merely because it dries quickly, but because it is most suitable to the humid climate of Bangladesh. Yet, in terms of line, colour and form, her works are romantic and individualistic, a means of escape from the anarchy of life. Through her works, she has created a unique world with fish, nets, fishermen, their families and boats. The blend of the familiar and the unfamiliar in her work gives it a distinctive, enigmatic quality. She has been hailed by critics for reaching into the heart of the turmoil of everyday life, and clarifying it for us. At her ongoing solo show, her works bear clear influences of the powerful traditions of her nations folk art, which add significantly to their dynamism. Hosted by Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR Calcutta, in association with Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts, Dhaka.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schools test knowledge on the bard
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          Schools test knowledge on the bard
  - SANTINIKETAN SOJOURN, PORING OVER BOOKS TO GLEAN TIPS ON TAGORE          Jhinuk Mazumdar                          Participants at the inter-school quiz contest on Rabindranath Tagore at Kala Mandir on July 3. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                        
	Some went off to Santiniketan for more knowledge while others spent hours reading up. The participants of the inter-school quiz on Rabindranath Tagore left no stones unturned to learn all they could about the bard.        
	Organised by St Johns Diocesan School at Kala Mandir on July 3, the quiz saw 43 teams participating in the preliminary rounds and 10 finalists competing for the first three positions. In the end, DPS New Town took away the trophy, followed by National Gems School and the hosts. Barry OBrien hosted the quiz.        
	To know more about Tagore, the participants from St Johns Diocesan School took off to Santiniketan. We visited both his home and Visva-Bharati. The curator also helped us with some reference matter, said Sayantani Ghosh Hazra from the host school. The visit stood them in good stead, for when a picture of Kala Bhavan (the centre for visual arts in Santiniketan) was shown in one of the rounds, the girls recognised it and earned valuable points.         
	Equally well prepared, South Point High School was quick to answer that Tagore became editor of the new edition of Bengali magazine Banga Darshan in 1901, while DPS New Town, scored a quick one when they replied that Nilmani Thakur had laid the foundation of Jorasanko Thakurbari.         
	There were six rounds in all  two direct ones, a crossword, an audio-visual and the final buzzer round. Biswanath Dasgupta, the creative director of TTIS (The Telegraph in Schools), provided interesting tidbits on Tagore in between the question-answer session. He informed the participants that English educationist CF Andrews was a bridge between Gandhi and Tagore.         
	He spoke about Gyanadanandini Devi, a great influence on Tagore. The way the sari is worn today was started by her, Dasgupta added. He also pointed out that the Baitalik dal, a group of singers based in Santiniketan, sing Rabindrasangeet during morning walks.         
	The visual round threw light on the current trends. A remixed version of the Rabindrasangeet Pagla hawa (from the film The Bong Connection) was shown and the students were asked to name the music director, Neel Dutt. We came to know facts about Tagore that go beyond history books, said Souvik Banik of National Gems.         
	The other finalists were The Heritage, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, Scottish Church Collegiate School, Vivekananda Mission,Joka, St Thomas School for Boys, Kidderpore, and Gokhale Memorial. The award for the best quizzer went to Aniket De of DPS, New Town.        
	Tribute to Keller           
	Ramakrishna Mission Blind Boys Academy, Narendrapur, celebrated the 128th birth anniversary of Helen Keller, along with Amway Opportunity Foundation (AOF) on June 28. Keller overcame visual and hearing impairment to become an author, political activist and lecturer.         
	AOF, the corporate social responsibility arm of Amway, made the day memorable for the students with a variety of contests based on the life of Helen Keller, including skits, songs, music, recitation and elocution. The visually challenged students competed with sighted kids from neighbouring schools.         
	Integration of the visually challenged into the mainstream is important. It is through such occasions that this can be made possible, said S.B. Pattanayak, the secretary of the Academy.

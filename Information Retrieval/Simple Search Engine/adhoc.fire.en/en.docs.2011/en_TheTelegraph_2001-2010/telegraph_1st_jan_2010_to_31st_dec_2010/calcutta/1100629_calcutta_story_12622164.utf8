          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Over 5,000 rounds of cartridges were found in a vehicle that was intercepted near Sovabazar Metro Railway station on Monday afternoon for violating traffic rules.        
	The driver of the vehicle plying through CR Avenue did not slow down at the Sovabazar crossing though the signal was red for traffic, said Rajeev Kumar, the additional commissioner of police in charge of the Special Task Force.        
	Four men inside the Patna-registered Qualis fled when traffic cops tried to stop it. A search revealed the cache of ammunition.        
	Till late on Monday, police failed to trace the intended recipients of the bullets.         
	The bullets were for different types of arms. Some bore the stamp of an ammunition factory in Pune, said an officer. Records with Bihar police show a woman had bought the vehicle. We have asked them to track down the cars owner, said the officer.        
	An STF team reached the spot around 6.40pm and took the vehicle to Lalbazar.

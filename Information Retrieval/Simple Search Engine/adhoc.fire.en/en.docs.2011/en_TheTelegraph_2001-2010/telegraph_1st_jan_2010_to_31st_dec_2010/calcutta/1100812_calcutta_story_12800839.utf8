          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police on Wednesday launched a hunt for a 20-year-old woman who had introduced Lesley Rebecca to the landlady of the Thakurpukur flat where she was found dead on Sunday.         
	Around a year-and-a-half back, one Mrs Rosario vacated the one-room flat. The landlady, Namita Chowdhury, was looking for another tenant when this young woman brought Rebecca to Chowdhury, introducing her as a colleague from the call centre where she apparently worked, said an officer.         
	The officer added that the young woman was Rosarios granddaughter. If we can trace Rosario, we would be able to find out about her granddaughter too. Its an important lead since this woman can throw light on Rebecca and tell us if she really worked somewhere, the officer said.         
	The police met the mother of Rebeccas husband Evan  who is absconding  again at her Ekbalpore home on Wednesday and got to know about a young man who was in regular touch with her son.         
	We have learnt about a youth who was in regular touch with Evan and even got his telephone number. We spoke to this man in Bangalore and he admitted to knowing Evan. But he said he was not in touch with Evan now, the officer said.

                Bollywood producer Boney Kapoor on Friday urged producers in Bengal to unite against a copyright amendment act that allows a films lyricist and music director to become the co-owner of the movie, apart from being entitled to royalty for life.   We are not against royalty but the new act means that a producer, who invests his money in a film, will have to seek a no-objection certificate from the lyricist and music director before selling the satellite, audio or any other rights of his film. We are asking the producers of Bengal to unite against this, Kapoor said while addressing a gathering of Tollywood producers at the Chowringhee office of EIMPA (Eastern India Motion Picture Association), on behalf of the Film Federation of India.    The transport department will levy a cess of 10 per cent on the road tax paid by owners of commercial vehicles in the state. The cess will be effective from January 1. The cess will not exceed Rs 1,200, said transport minister   anjit Kundu.    Shobhana Chatterjee Dutta, a resident of Delhi, fell ill on the Sealdah-bound Rajdhani Express early on Friday and died hours later in Calcutta. Railway officials said the 74-year-old had complained of chest pain while the train was approaching Mughalsarai. Doctors gave her medicines and asked her not to travel further. But her family disagreed. After the train reached Sealdah, she was admitted to BR Singh Hospital, where she died.    The high court on Friday said the banquet hall maintained by S.P. Baglas Saltee Group at Salt Lake Central Park was illegal. The court ordered the Bidhannagar municipality to dismantle the hall and file an FIR against Bagla.    Police recovered 35 bombs from an abandoned house in Howrah on Friday. Akhilesh Chaturvedi, the additional superintendent of police (rural), said more raids would be conducted in the area.

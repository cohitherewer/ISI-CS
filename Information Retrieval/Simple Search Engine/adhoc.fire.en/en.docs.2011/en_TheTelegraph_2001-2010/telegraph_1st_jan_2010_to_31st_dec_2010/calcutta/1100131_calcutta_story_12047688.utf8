The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Perfect 10: the rhythm of life
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Perfect 10: the rhythm of life
										      AUTUMN FLUSH                                          
	Deep inside me is an unknown dancer keeping perfect rhythm to the constant beat of a mridangam. Through laughter and tears, the jewels on the forehead also seem to dance to the self same rhythms. The ecstasy of this dance runs through life and death, in freedom and bondage, by day and by night. I rush joyfully to become one with this wave.        
	The other day I was invited to the monthly meeting of an interesting group of women. Wives of IAS officers (some retired, some still in service), they appear to have thrown inhibitions to the winds like the Red Hat Societies based on Jenny Josephs famous poem. When I am old, I shall wear purple/ With a red hat that doesnt go and doesnt suit me...making up for the sobriety of my youth...        
	Their average age is around 62 but it could be a lot less. Most of them have worked: in hospitals, schools, colleges or elsewhere and they refuse to let any stereotypes of aging get to them. They have been and are good mothers to their children, most of whom live away now, and good wives.        
	When I arrived, there was the cheery excitement of a girls school or college green room: a merry exchange of costume jewellery, at least three of them possibly as decked out as they have not been since their wedding day many decades earlier. The theme colour for the day was black and I saw some of the most elegant black saris I have ever seen.         
	The evenings festivities began with a witty anthem mainly in Bengali but with a vigorously articulated line in Hindi: Yeh dil mange more more more.         
	This was followed by a dance performed by two members of the group. I have seen this one often at school functions and on TV. It is usually done by very young girls decked out in saris with flowers in their hair. If you check it out on YouTube you will get just such a girl or group of girls performing the dance.         
	Momo chittey niti nritye... got a new level of meaning with the performance I saw that evening. Rabindranath had clearly written of a timeless urge. It was great to see these 60-plus women dancing to it with equal grace and fervour.         
	A quick break for tea and dalmut was followed by another solo dance and more songs (Rabindrasangeet and Adhunik and recent Hindi film hits like Yeh ishq haye, baithe bithaye, jannat dikhaye haan... from Jab We Met, picture above). Supper followed: simple, extremely well cooked food followed by more singing.         
	They came prepared with the words on scraps of paper. They might never make it to the stage in Rabindra Sadan but the enthusiasm and enjoyment were striking: they did not just enjoy singing or dancing. They enjoyed doing it together and for each other.        
	The gang often goes to the cinema and on picnics. Shopping together is another favourite occupation. They exchange simple well-chosen gifts. We were each given a Chinese teacup on this occasion. They meet for each others birthdays and the birthday girl is given a performance of music and dance. They desert their husbands on these occasions: it is me time with a difference.         
	I noted how appreciative they were of each others talents, aspirations and core competence. They have built themselves into a terrific support group that will stand them in good stead as time goes on.        
	They call themselves Aamra Dos (We Ten). I was delighted to be an honorary Ekadashi on that occasion. I hope they will continue to dance and sing into the sunset together.

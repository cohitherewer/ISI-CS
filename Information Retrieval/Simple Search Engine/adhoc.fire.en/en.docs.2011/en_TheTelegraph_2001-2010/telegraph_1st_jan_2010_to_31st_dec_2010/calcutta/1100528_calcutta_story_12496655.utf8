The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | ATM strike to hit dozen banks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      ATM strike to hit dozen banks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	The state-wide ATM strike on Friday and Saturday is likely to keep the ATMs of a dozen banks closed, but PSU and private banks like State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are not on the list.         
	Bengal Provincial Bank Employees Association had called an ATM strike at 19 banks on May 28, 29 and June 2 to protest the non-payment of minimum wages to contract employees at ATMs.        
	Seven of the 19 banks have either paid or agreed to ensure the payment of minimum wages of Rs 212 per day, as notified by the central government, to contracted employees at ATMs. Till Thursday afternoon, 12 banks have not got in touch with us. So we have decided to go ahead with our strike at the ATMs of these 12 banks, said Rajen Nagar, the general secretary of the association.         
	The 12 banks are Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, UCO Bank, Punjab National Bank, United Bank of India, Central Bank of India, Union Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, Vijaya Bank, Bank of Rajasthan, Dhanalakshmi Bank and Yes Bank. ATMs of other banks, including State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, are likely to function as usual.         
	Customers of the strike-affected banks can use ATMs of other banks to withdraw up to Rs 5,000 per day. Three such withdrawals are permitted in a month.        
	We have instructed our district-level bodies to ensure that no one forcibly shuts down ATMs of banks that have started paying minimum wages to contracted employees or have agreed to do so, said Nagar. If the 12 banks and those that have promised to pay minimum wages fail to do so, we would shut down their ATMs again on June 2, he added.

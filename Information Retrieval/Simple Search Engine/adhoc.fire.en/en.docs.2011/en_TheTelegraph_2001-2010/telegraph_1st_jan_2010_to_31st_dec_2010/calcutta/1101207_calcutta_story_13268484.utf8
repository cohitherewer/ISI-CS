The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Heavy vessels stuck at port
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Heavy vessels stuck at port
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An adrift cargo ship that had met with a mishap and excessive siltation at Hooghly Point, about 50 km from the city, prevented heavy vessels from leaving or entering the city port on Monday.         
	Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) sources said three vessels at the port had cancelled their voyage and two inbound ships were stuck at the Sandheads, 232km from the city, waiting for the depth of the navigation channel to increase.        
	A few vessels with light cargo, however, could operate, sources said.        
	Tiger Spring, which was damaged in a collision with another vessel on November 23, had drifted towards the middle of the channel. It has been pushed towards the bank and anchored, port trust chairman M.L. Meena told Metro on Monday.         
	Two inbound vessels could not enter the port because of problems with navigability. We are working on a war footing to dredge the channel and hope the situation will become normal by Tuesday, said Meena.        
	The depth of the navigation channel at the Hooghly Point is varying between 1.7 and 2.6 metres, against the normal range of 3-4 metres.        
	The channel, with five imaginary tracks for vessels to move, cannot be negotiated now because of heavy siltation and the drifting of Tiger Spring. At one point the depth is so less that vessels can run aground. The width, too, is not enough because of the stranded vessel, said a pilot.         
	Two days ago, a barge had run aground at the Hooghly Point because of siltation.        
	Tiger Spring, which was moving out of Calcutta port, had developed a snag and collided with Green Valley that was approaching the port.        
	While Green Valley was taken to Diamond Harbour for repairs, Tiger Spring had to be anchored at the Hooghly Point because of the damage it suffered. The ship has been stuck there since.        
	A Dutch firm has been appointed to salvage the ship. The cargo of Tiger Spring cannot be offloaded as there is no heavy crane around. A high-capacity crane is expected to arrive from Singapore by the middle of the month, a CPT official said.        
	Once the cargo is offloaded, the damaged part of the vessel will be afloat and repairs can be taken up.        
	Till that happens, sailing down the silt-choked channel will remain risky, warned an official.                                
	However, till then, the vessel has become a constant problem for traffic movement through the silt-choked narrow channel. CPT officials said the channel is around 225 metre wide as against an average width of 300 metres for the Hooghly.        
	Current movement around the Tiger Spring has aggravated the shoaling which is a common phenomenon this time of the year, a CPT official said.         
	Ends              
	On Monday, a team of CPT officials worked till late in the evening to push the vessel back to the shore. CPT has also taken up dredging operation at the point on a war footing.                           
	According to sources, three vessels with light cargo could move out of Calcutta port but three others cancelled journeys. On an average, seven to eight ships enter and exit the port everyday.

  - Trust talks follow boost for annexe        OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT IN NEW DELHI                                    
	The apex court has rapped Calcutta High Court for rejecting a plea by Victoria Memorial for permission to erect a building in the compound without citing reasons.        
	The high court arrived at the conclusion that if construction is permitted it would not only adversely affect the ambience of the monument but would be detrimental to the present structure. However, it has been reached without giving any plausible reason whatsoever, a two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan has observed in the order.        
	The Supreme Court had on March 9 set aside the high court order and allowed the Memorial authorities to go ahead with their annexe plan. The detailed order was made available later.        
	The apex court pointed out that the proposal to erect the annexe, to be partly funded by the London-based Calcutta Tercentenary Trust, was not opposed by the pollution control board, civic body or the superintending archaeologist of the Archeological Survey of India (Calcutta circle).        
	The anti-annexe lobby had claimed that the structure would obstruct the view of the Memorial. But the Supreme Court brushed aside the objection on the ground that the annexe would be 10m high while the height of the Memorial was more than 50 metres.        
	The high court failed to appreciate that the proposed building would be designed with great care, ensuring that the construction would not disturb the existing landscape and would be in consonance with the existing ambience and... architecture..., the court said.

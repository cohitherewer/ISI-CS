                The high court on Thursday refused to restrain the city civic body from implementing a public beneficiary project of laying a pipe between the Palta water treatment plant and the Tallah tank. The 22.3km pipe, to be laid under BT Road at a cost of Rs 30.5 crore, will boost the water distribution network of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Two traders, whose establishments are on BT Road, sought a restraining order from the court on the ground that the pipe-laying work would affect their businesses.

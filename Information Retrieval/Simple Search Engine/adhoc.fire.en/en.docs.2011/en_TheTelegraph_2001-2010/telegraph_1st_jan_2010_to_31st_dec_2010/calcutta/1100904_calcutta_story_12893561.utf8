The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puja fire meet fizzle
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Puja fire meet fizzle
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A meeting convened on Friday to raise awareness about fire safety norms among puja organisers ended up being a candid confession session by fire services officials on the inadequacies of their department.        
	We are unable to buy equipment or even set up fire stations as the finance department is still to clear our proposals, rued R.P.S. Kahlon, the principal secretary of the fire and emergency services department.        
	Why only puja? We have limited capacity in terms of manpower for all major events, which is why we need your full co-operation, he pleaded, seated next to fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee at the St Thomas Day School hall on Free School Street.        
	The farcical fire briefing prompted one of the bemused puja organisers to stand up and ask minister Chatterjee what service his department would provide if it lacked manpower and equipment.         
	You dont have enough vehicles, you dont have drivers either. How can a department that needs help be of any help to others? demanded Brojo Ballav Ghosh of the Tallah Pally puja committee.        
	The minister tried to wriggle out of the confession trap by accusing Ghosh of making political statements, but the 100-odd organisers wouldnt let him off the hook. Have you convened this meeting to tell us what to do or what you cannot do? chided a member of the audience.        
	With the meeting not going according to the script, sometime actor Chatterjee fumbled his lines before managing a feeble whats wrong in admitting to a crisis?        
	As the chuckles died down, an embarrassed official hurriedly read out a list of temporary fire stations to be set up for Durga puja, including one each at Lake Town, Behala, Tollygunge, Topsia, Muchipara, Watgunge, Metiabruz and Amherst Street.        
	We will start inspecting the puja pandals from October 4 to ensure that the organisers get adequate time to make changes, if necessary, said D.P. Biswas, the additional director-general of fire services.         
	The process of issuing fire certificates is scheduled to start on September 14.

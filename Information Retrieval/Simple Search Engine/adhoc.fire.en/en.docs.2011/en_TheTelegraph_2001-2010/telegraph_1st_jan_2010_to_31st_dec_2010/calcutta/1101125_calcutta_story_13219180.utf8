                      Creative quest for harmony                    Paintings, installations and sculptures make up Anupama Jains solo exhibition, Equilibrium. When people have been unable to balance their greed with restraint or counteract their prejudice with justice, the natural state of equilibrium gives place to chaos. Similarly, in nature, an excess of any one element or force creates disharmony and destruction. This concept is the guiding force behind my work today. The myriad of shapes, colours and lines in my work are symbolic of the disparate and often conflicting forces and elements that constitute any dynamic system. They come together in my work, balanced against one another, to create an aesthetic whole  thus representing the ability of all the elements and forces of the universe to coexist in harmonious equilibrium. It is also expressive of my struggle to achieve my own internal equilibrium  my journey of self-discovery, explains the artist. Acrylic, mixed media and collage, wood, sand and paint, metal, photography, screen-print and paint, laser engraving, stoneware clay and bronze have been used in her creations. To be inaugurated by Shuvaprasanna today at 5.30 pm.

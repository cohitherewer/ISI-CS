The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Course row at tech varsity
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Course row at tech varsity
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) witnessed a ruckus on Thursday when about 110 former bachelor in optometry students barged into the office of registrar Rafiqul Islam and allegedly threw chairs at him and two other officials demanding that they be ensured government jobs.        
	The former students, who have all completed the universitys three-year B.Optometry course, however, claimed that they were beaten up by non-teaching employees on the Salt Lake campus.        
	The protesters can work as optometrist in private clinics, but not in government hospitals because the WBUT course does not have the Medical Council of India approval.        
	The West Bengal University of Health runs an optometry course approved by the MCI.        
	We are doing the same job as optometrists in government hospitals. But we are not allowed to work there, said Soumya Majumder, one of the protesters.        
	Ours is a technical university and our optometry course deals with technical aspects of the subject. We cannot force another organisation to recognise our course, said registrar Islam, who expressed shock at the way the ex-students behaved. The authorities later lodged an FIR against them with Bidhannagar (North) police station.        
	The former students said they had first wanted to meet higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri but were denied an audience.        
	They later met WBUT vice-chancellor Sabyasachi Sengupta, who apparently asked them to meet the registrar.

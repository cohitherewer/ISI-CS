The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Eye on sky for elusive Norwester 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Eye on sky for elusive Norwester

	Calcutta is creeping up the national Celsius charts with its summer saviour, the Norwester, playing truant and relief nowhere on the radar for another 10 days.        
	We had expected four to six Norwesters in March against the usual two to three but there was none. No wonder the city has had such a prolonged spell of above-normal minimum temperatures, said O.P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of an independent Met agency in New Delhi.        
	The bad news  good news for KKR match nights at Eden, though  is that there are no Norwesters in sight for the next couple of weeks, by which time temperatures could rise by a couple of more degrees, warned the weatherman.        
	According to data available with the India Meteorological Department, Calcutta is now in the league of hottest places of the heartland (see graphic) with the last 10 days of March pushing up the citys heat quotient by several notches.        
	Maximum temperatures have since settled down to hover around a degree above normal but minimum temperatures have been three to five degrees above normal on most days over the past week, which explains the high discomfort factor.        
	An abnormally high minimum temperature ensures that the average daytime temperature doesnt dip lower, explained Sharma.        
	Mondays minimum temperature of 27.5 degrees Celsius was four degrees above normal.        
	The Celsius surge in north, central and eastern India, especially the heat wave-like conditions in neighbouring Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa, have not allowed temperatures to normalise in south Bengal over the last week, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	But why are Norwesters proving to be elusive? Incursion of abundant moisture from the Bay of Bengal is a prerequisite for Norwester activity. In the absence of significant atmospheric formations over the Bay, moisture inflow has not been substantial so far, said Sharma.        
	The absence of adequate moisture in the air was evident in Mondays humidity reading, which dipped to 56 per cent.        
	Conditions are unlikely to change within the first half of April. Thunderstorm activity aided by Norwesters is likely to be seen only after April 15, added Sharma.        
	Experts from other agencies corroborated that assessment, saying relief from the swelter was still at least another week away. Relief, if any, will not come Calcuttas way unless there is a sudden formation over the Bay that brings in abundant moisture to accelerate Norwester activity, said a senior scientist of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida.        
	A single Norwester usually brings temperatures down for two to three days in the city and its neighbourhood.

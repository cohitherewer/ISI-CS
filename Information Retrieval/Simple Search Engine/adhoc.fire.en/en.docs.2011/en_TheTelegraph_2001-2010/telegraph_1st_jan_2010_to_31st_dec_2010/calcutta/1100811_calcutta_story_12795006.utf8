The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Watch out for signals in auto mode
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Watch out for signals in auto mode
          OUR BUREAU                                       
	The citys traffic signalling system will fast-forward to the future next week as part of a trial run for the fully automated system that is set to take over crossroads control from the cops in November.        
	Lalbazars decision to go automatic at almost all signals comes within two weeks of Metro reporting how shoddy  and slow  implementation of the high-tech Area Traffic Control (ATC) system was doing more harm than good to the citys traffic.        
	We have asked all 14 traffic guards to run the signals in auto mode from next week. It will help us work out a traffic-flow chart that works best for the city, Banibrata Basu, the special commissioner of police (II), told Metro.        
	But how is an automated system possible without even half the network  144 out of 247 signals  being covered by the sensor-based smart signalling system?        
	In places under the ambit of the Area Traffic Control network, the devices will decide the duration of the signals. Elsewhere, traffic cops are working out pre-fixed signal timings based on readings and analysis of traffic flow through this week, said Basu.        
	Traffic guards have been noting down the approximate time required to clear traffic along a stretch of road at a particular time of day since the start of the week in preparation for the run that will start next Monday and be monitored for glitches.        
	The existing system can also be automated by keying in the required settings in the control grid. What it cannot do is read traffic movement and change the settings according to need like the Area Traffic Control system.         
	For commuters and motorists, the bad news is that next weeks run in automatic mode has the potential to throw traffic haywire.        
	Any transition comes with teething problems and switching to a fully automated traffic signalling system is no exception. Citizens need to bear with us because ultimately the system will benefit them, said a senior officer.        
	Metro had reported on July 29 how technical lapses in implementing the switchover under the Area Traffic Control system had led to lights malfunctioning at various signals. The Entally to Alipore stretch of AJC Bose Road, Rawdon Street, Hungerford Street and Camac Street were the worst hit.        
	What happens to the existing flaws? The Kerala-based company (Keltron) entrusted with converting 103 signals to fully automated mode is still at work. Daily situation reports from various traffic guards will help us decide how to rectify the glitches. We might even choose a different company to upgrade the remaining 144 signals, said special commissioner Basu.

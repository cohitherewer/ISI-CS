The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pass the buck for power cut
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pass the buck for power cut

	Calcutta suffered a Celsius rise and a megawatt dip for the third consecutive day on Wednesday with little hope of a respite from either the Norwester-starved sky or the coal-deficient power units.        
	Areas served by CESC faced loadshedding for up to two hours while those under the state-run West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd suffered staggered power cuts for around six hours, adding to the agony of a 38.4 degrees Celsius day.         
	As Calcutta sweated and fretted over the heat and the long hours of loadshedding, government agencies accused one another of being responsible for the reduced power generation. Metro tries to get to the bottom of the power blame game.        
	The problem: Snags in the coal-supply chain are responsible for generation units performing below capacity.         
	According to officials of the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd (WBPDCL), supply from Coal India Ltd has dipped so much that its generation units are performing up to 40 per cent below capacity.         
	The blame game: Both CESC and the state-owned distribution company accuse WBPDCL of doing little to solve the perennial coal shortage at its units.         
	 We need to import some power but supply has been inconsistent for three years now because of the same reason, said a CESC spokesperson.        
	The WBPDCL accused Coal India Ltd of not doing anything to normalise coal supply. Coal India Ltd pointed a finger at Eastern Railway, saying transportation problems were responsible for the demand-supply mismatch.        
	 What can we do if Eastern Railway cant provide the required number of rakes? We are sitting on 63 million tonne of coal, said a company official.        
	Eastern Railway dismissed the allegation as baseless. We have provided as many rakes as they (Coal India Ltd) have asked for. We are in no way to blame for the power crisis, an official said.        
	The victim: Almost everyone living in the city endured a power cut on Wednesday with areas under the state distribution network bearing the brunt.        
	 We have endured power cuts for around six hours every day for three days now. The power situation has never been good in summer but I cant recall the last time the city had to suffer so many hours of loadshedding every day, said Garia resident Baikuntha Pal, 52.        
	Higher Secondary examinees suffered the most despite CESC promising a glitch-free exam season.        
	The forecast: Thursday could be worse for Calcutta with the coal shortage far from resolved and the weatherman warning of a humid and uncomfortable day, with the maximum temperature hovering around 39 degrees Celsius.

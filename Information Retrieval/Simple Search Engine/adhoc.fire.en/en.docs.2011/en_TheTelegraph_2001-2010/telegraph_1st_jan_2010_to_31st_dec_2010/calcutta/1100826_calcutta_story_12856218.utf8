                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stephen catch flown in
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Key Stephen Court blaze accused Sanjay Bagaria, who was arrested in Uttar Pradeshs Saharanpur on Tuesday, was flown to Calcutta on Wednesday evening.        
	The director of Stephen Court Limited, which holds the lease of the Park Street landmark where 43 people were killed in a blaze on March 23, will be produced in Bankshall court on Thursday.        
	Sources said state lawyers would seek police remand for Bagaria.        
	We need to know why Bagaria and the two other directors of the company  Sushil Sureka and Pradip More  didnt turn up that day and help firemen and police during the rescue operation. Many lives could have been saved had they come, said Damayanti Sen, joint police commissioner, crime.        
	Bagarias lawyer Milon Mukherjee said he would challenge his clients arrest in the court.         
	The police have claimed that they had probed all aspects before submitting the chargesheet. Then how can the arrest be justified?        
	Bagaria and the other two directors went missing on March 23. Sureka and More are still absconding. Hours after Bagarias arrest, a Supreme Court division bench rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Sureka.        
	The police have lodged a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against Stephen Court Limited and filed a chargesheet against the three directors, the liftman of the building, Jayprakash Singh, and caretakers Ramprakash Singh and Tarun Bagadia.        
	Ramprakash and Jayprakash are in custody while Bagadia is out on bail.        
	Sleuths said they would like to know from Bagaria whether anyone other than the liftman had the key to the terrace door.        
	As many as 17 bodies were found on the stairs leading to the locked terrace. If the keys were available, these lives could have been saved, said an officer investigating the case.        
	The 12-member S.N. Roy Committee formed after the Stephen Court fire has blamed the owners of 18 Park Street as well as the tenants for negligence and lack of basic fire-fighting facilities in the building that houses the likes of Peter Cat, Flurys and Music World apart from offices and residential flats.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nandan frowns on gay love story
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Nandan frowns on gay love story
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Rituparno Ghosh and Indraneil Sengupta in Aarekti Premer Galpo                                  
	No homosexuality please, this is Nandan.        
	Nilanjan Chatterjee, Nandans culture cop, has taken it upon himself to scan the aesthetic value of all films arriving at the door of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees favourite haunt before deciding for Calcutta what it should  and should not  watch.        
	Nandans CEO and director has turned a beady eye on Kaushik Gangulys Aarekti Premer Galpo, which revolves around a gay film-maker played by Rituparno Ghosh, and refused to release the film without a preview.         
	All films are previewed by me. Members of our preview committee are too busy, so I have taken on the responsibility of previewing and deciding which films are to be screened at Nandan. Homosexuality is a new subject in films and I need to go through it thoroughly to see how it has been dealt with, Chatterjee told Metro.        
	So what if Aarekti Premer Galpo (Just Another Love Story) was a part of the Indian Panorama at the 41st International Film Festival of India in Goa? Or that it was one of the three films, along with Goutam Ghoses Moner Manush, representing India in the Competition section? Or that it picked up the Special Jury Award (Silver Peacock) for, as jury member Revathy put it, its fearless and honest portrayal of a sensitive issue like homosexuality?        
	Stung by Chatterjees stand, the makers of Aarekti Premer Galpo have decided to withdraw their film from the Nandan release queue. We wont submit a preview copy. It is extremely insulting after the recognition given by the central government. It has also been passed by the censor board, said Ganguly.        
	Chatterjee refused to back down. Im not bothered about what the central government has acknowledged. The censor board checks for scenes that show frontal sex or violence, while we preview films for their aesthetic value. Why just a Silver Peacock, even if it had won a Golden Bear, we would have asked for a preview. Thats the rule at Nandan.        
	Try telling that to Rituparno Ghosh, who debuts as an actor in Aarekti Premer Galpo, and he retorts: But who at Nandan will judge the aesthetics of the film? And what are those standards of aesthetics?        
	His outrage found echo in the fraternity. Ive never heard of a rule like this. None of my Feluda films or Hitlist had to go through a preview at Nandan, said Sandip Ray.        
	According to a former Nandan official, a preview committee was formed to examine the commercial viability of a film, given the number of screening requests. The Nandan director cannot ask for the preview for any kind of art policing. Thats the task of the board of certification.        
	Director Suman Mukhopadhyay, whose Herbert was shown the door in 2006 because of its alleged wrong message to the masses, said: The problem with Nandan is that it doesnt have any agenda. It has its own discrepancies and contradictions.        
	The fact that Nandan is squeamish about screening a film on homosexuality will not go down with many. Nandans stance is very hypocritical. First, a retrospective of Pedro Almodovar, whose films deal with alternative sexuality, was screened at Nandan during a film festival. Second, the Left Front was the only political group to support the repealing of Section 377. This (opposition to Aarekti Premer Galpo) is unexpected from a film centre touted as progressive, said Anindya Hazra, founder of Pratyay Gender Trust, a sexuality and human rights advocacy group.        
	Does Nandan have the right to play super censor? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Slog overs for Holly-Tolly   Holly-Tolly interlude in Bolly show
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Slog overs for Holly-Tolly   Holly-Tolly 
          PRATIM D. GUPTA AND KUSHALI NAG                            (Top) The Hurt Locker; The Japanese Wife                                      
	At a time when Lalit Modi is losing a friend every hour, two women from two parts of the world should be sending him an IOU  Aparna Sen and Kathryn Bigelow.        
	For, it is Modis IPL 3  a potent cocktail of cricket and controversy  that has kept Bollywood at bay and allowed Hollywoods best and Tollywoods biggest to hog screen space in the city.        
	In the last weekend of the league, and the last days before Bollywood finally goes Housefull again with Sajid Khans multi-starrer, Sens The Japanese Wife is going strong and Holly has a rare release count of four.        
	Theres The Hurt Locker, the six-Oscar-winning Kathryn Bigelow film, the George Clooney biggie Up in the Air, the Denzel Washington-starrer The Book of Eli and the Renee Zellweger rom com New in Town.        
	We are accused of not bringing good English films to Calcutta so here they are, said Captain Virendra Marya of INOX. Now hopefully the city will show its passion for Hollywood films and come and fill up the halls.        
	The initial response has been good with The Hurt Locker being the front-runner this weekend. Its such a welcome relief, says musician Neel Dutt. I have watched some of these films on DVD but to watch it on the big screen is the real thing. First Green Zone and now thesethings are finally looking up.        
	The Bolly slowdown courtesy IPL 3 has also helped the Rs 5 crore Japanese Wife. I dont know how my film would have done if there was a big Bollywood release like 3 Idiots, said Sen. I am sure the box-office performance would have been affected....But I think the film has touched a chord among the audience. I havent met one person who has not liked the film.        
	In its second week the Rahul Bose-Raima-Sen-starrer held on to its average occupancy of 80 per cent at the multiplexes.                          
	The spirited response to The Japanese Wife  a combination of the TINA (there is no alternative) factor and brand Aparna Sen  should also prompt the plexes to take Tolly releases a tad more seriously even when Bolly is back.        
	We are very happy with The Japanese Wife. It is a niche film and yet the occupancy is very encouraging. The word-of-mouth publicity has been great and the convenient show timings have helped. We will keep that in mind for future Bengali releases, said Marya.        
	While it would take a record run and more at the box office for The Japanese Wife to recover costs, at least the film wasnt blown away by a Bolly biggie. You can feel that theres a renewed interest in Bengali films, added a source at the Fame plexes. We hope that some of the sensible films coming up can keep the interest going.        
	Mumbai-based trade analysts confirm that the seven-week IPL season has spelt doom for Bolly movies and a boon for regional and Holly releases. Marathi films in this period have done well and so its understandable why a good Bengali film has drawn the crowds, said Amod Mehra.         
	Hollywood of course has taken its time coming to Calcutta. While Up in the Air released months ago in Mumbai and Delhi, The Hurt Locker arrived in the other metros two weeks back and The Book of Eli around a month ago. Calcutta got lucky with Up in the Air because the prints dont normally float around that long, said a local distributor.        
	But both Holly and Tolly films will have to beat the IPL final on their home ground, with the plexes expecting a healthy turnout on Sunday evening to watch Sachin Tendulkar vs Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the final showdown.        
	After that, the big Bollywood party resumes with Housefull, Kites, Raajneeti and Raavan up for release in the coming Fridays. So it will soon be business (read: Bolly) as usual at the plexes.

	The oldest Indian Institute of Management is gearing up to celebrate its journey into its 50th year.        
	IIM Calcutta, which started its journey in 1961, will begin its golden jubilee celebrations next week.        
	It is not just a celebration of the coming of age of IIM Calcutta but of the IIM system as a whole. For us, it is time to look back at what we have achieved and aim for a far greater impact in the future, said Sougata Ray, the dean (programme initiatives) of the institute.        
	The jubilee will be celebrated from November 14, 2010, to November 14, 2012, bringing together teachers and students past and present.        
	First up will be a three-day event from next Sunday that will include a two-day convention on management education in India and a discussion on IIMC50: The Past, Present and Future.         
	The directors of the IIMs and other management schools in India and abroad, academicians, industry leaders and IIM Calcutta professors and alumni will deliberate on issues facing management schools and the way forward.        
	Purandeshwari, the junior central minister for HRD, will inaugurate the meet. Governor M.K. Narayanan will be the chief guest at the concluding session of the two-day convention.        
	We will honour retired faculty members, past directors, current faculty members and employees who have served the institute over a long time and contributed significantly, said Ray.        
	A number of international conferences, workshops and seminars are being planned between November 2010 and February 2011 as part of the jubilee celebrations.         
	There will be an international marketing conference from December 27 to 29, 2010, and international finance conference from January 9 to 12, 2011, and strategic management society paper development workshop from February 26 to 28, 2011.        
	The Calcutta chapter of the alumni association is organising GuruSpeak 2010 with Dipak Jain, the dean of Kellogg School of Management, North Western University, and dean designate of INSEAD, on December 19.

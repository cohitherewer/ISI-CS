  - Hidco uses realty player to end resistance        ZEESHAN JAWED AND SANJAY MANDAL                                              
	If you cannot beat them, buy them.        
	After trying and failing in 15 attempts to install high-tension electricity towers in Chhapna mouza, vital to the development of Action Areas II and III in Rajarhat, the authorities have made a tactical money move to breach the pocket of resistance.        
	Hidco, the states housing department responsible for the development of Rajarhat Megacity, has struck a deal with a private real estate company with high stakes in the township, to pay Rs 2 lakh per cottah to owners of the plots earmarked for the installation of electricity poles.        
	Without these poles, electricity transmission to Action Areas II and III is not possible.        
	Two representatives of the realty company met members of the Patharghata panchayat and the unwilling landlosers at the panchayat office on Wednesday evening to discuss the compensation package.        
	Yes, we had a two-hour meeting with representatives of a private company. They want to pay market price for the plots where electricity poles are to come up. So, a solution can be worked out, said a member of the panchayat.        
	On the talks table was Daag 833 in which 11 satak land (close to seven cottah) on the fringes of Chhapna has been identified for the poles.        
	Chhapna is one of the 25 mouzas acquired in 2004-05 to set up the Megacity. A power station has come up in the neighbouring mouza of Akandakeshari for transmission to the sub-stations to illuminate the township. But without pole numbers 7, 8 and 9 for the high-tension wires being erected in Chhapna, large pockets were rendered powerless.        
	Landholders there have blocked every move by Hidco protesting inadequate compensation for fertile land.        
	In 2006, Hidco had announced compensation of around Rs 13,500 per cottah for 250 farmers, but only 50 to 60 accepted the package, said an official.        
	In two years, Hidco has made 15 attempts to install the towers, but all in vain. The last attempt, under cover of darkness on January 31, ended at dawn with irate villagers chasing away officials of Hidco and the state electricity board.        
	With the pocket of resistance stalling work and raising doubts about the viability of the governments showpiece project, the state housing minister Goutam Deb approached a real estate player with several projects in Rajarhat to bail out Hidco and pay adequate compensation to the families reluctant to give up land.        
	The company has drawn up a compensation package of Rs 2 lakh per cottah for a few landowners to clear the path for the electricity poles.        
	Hidco cannot pay the market price to the landowners because that would spark a controversy and every landowner in Rajarhat would demand such a rate. So, the private company is paying the market price to the handful of owners. This will help us end their resistance, said a senior Hidco official.        
	He hastened to add that the entire deal was unofficial. Since the land has been acquired by Hidco, no private party can buy the land. So, on paper, we have no agreement with the private company.        
	The real estate player had first involved Bajlur Rahman, a local Congress leader and former pradhan of Patharghata, to help the company strike a deal with one of the landlords in Daag 833.        
	As soon as first blood was drawn, Hidco rushed in and set up the base for one electric tower. When the other villagers heard about the fall of a Chhapna plot, they beat up Rahman, the betrayer.        
	But with Hidco using a private hand to dangle the cash carrot, the pocket of resistance looks set to bite the bait.

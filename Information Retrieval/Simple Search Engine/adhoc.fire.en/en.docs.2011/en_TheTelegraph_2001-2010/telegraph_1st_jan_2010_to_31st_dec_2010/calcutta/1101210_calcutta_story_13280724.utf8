The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Film on Tagore tale
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Film on Tagore tale
          KUSHALI NAG                                              
	With his 150th birth anniversary round the corner, Tagore is the toast this season on stage and screen, and the latest to join the bard brandwagon is director Buddhadeb Dasgupta.        
	The Childrens Film Society of India (CFSI) has commissioned Dasgupta to make a Hindi film for children based on a Tagore tale, and the National Award-winning director has picked Shey, one of Tagores lesser-known novel.        
	Shey revolves around a nine-year-old girl and a fictitious character called Shey created by her writer grandfather. Shey slowly springs from the pages of fiction and becomes flesh-and-blood. It is an abstract story and I chose it because not too many filmmakers would be interested in it, said Dasgupta.         
	Theatre veteran Usha Ganguli is translating his Bengali script into Hindi.        
	The cast features child artiste Aratrika Ghosh as the young girl, Barun Chanda as the grandfather and Mumbai-based TV actor Ashok Shivpuri as Shey.        
	Shooting for the film, titled Woh, starts in Purulia in January-end.        
	This is the first time I am working on a story by Tagore though I have grown up reading his works. As a filmmaker, I have always found it difficult to relate to the period in which Tagores novels are set. But Shey is different. It is very cerebral and unlike Tagores other works. And though the film will be experimental, I think children will find it interesting, added Dasgupta, the darling of the foreign film festival circuit.

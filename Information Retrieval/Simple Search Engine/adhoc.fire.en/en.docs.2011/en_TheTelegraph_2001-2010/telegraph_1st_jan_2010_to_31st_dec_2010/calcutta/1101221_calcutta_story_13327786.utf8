	Be it his tennis or his great great grandfathers poetry  pursuit of any passion demands quietude that is all but missing in todays Calcutta.        
	In an attempt to make his hometown a quieter  and better  place to live in, Leander Paes on Monday afternoon led a pack of around 80 students to spread awareness against honking, the principal source of noise in the city.        
	The tennis star walked from Bengal Club on Russell Street to the Park Street-Free School Street crossing, as part of a campaign launched by the NGO People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC) and Calcutta police, and picked up a Silence and a No Noise placard.        
	Surrounding him were the students from the two La Martiniere schools, Birla High schools for boys and girls and Modern High School for Girls.         
	The campaign lasted around 40 minutes, with the team stopping at every crossing on the way and the students shouting No horn at every passing vehicle that honked.        
	The students vehemence and the presence of cops who accompanied the campaigners ensured that wherever the team went, the noise level dropped significantly.        
	It seems that people blow the horn just to say I am here! The horn is there only to avert an emergency, like an accident, said Paes, dressed in jeans and a red jacket.        
	Recalling his growing-up years, the winner of 12 Grand Slam titles said: I grew up on Park Street and have lived through the noise but it used to be quieter outside the Park Street area. Now it is noisy everywhere.        
	Paes stressed the need to create a state of calm and peace so one could pursue his/her passion. For me the passion was tennis and now films. But every pursuit needs it.... I dont think my great great grandfather Michael Madhusudan Dutta could have written poems had he lived amidst this noise! The clutter, the noise kill your creativity.        
	The No Noise campaign was started in April with students of the five schools fanning out daily around educational institutions and hospitals, urging motorists not to honk.        
	Noise affects children and the aged. It hampers brain development by reducing brain stimulation and causes stress, hypertension and heart problems for the elderly, said Pradeep Kakkar of PUBLIC.        
	Paes was moved by the students enthusiasm. I remember how my tyres melted when I would cycle to school from home during summer. And these students, I learnt, had braved the summer heat for a noble cause. Hats off to them.        
	Paes is not content to be just a face of the campaign  he wants to play an active part and repay his debt to the city he still calls home. Ill be here whenever I can. I want to set an example for the Calcuttans and pave the way so that the next generation can have a quieter and better place to live in.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clear sky signals warm days
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Clear sky signals warm days
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An open sky sucked up the chill Calcuttans had been enjoying over the past week, ushering in a warm Sunday that saw both the maximum and minimum temperatures rise to three degrees above normal.        
	The lack of a cloud cover  which the weatherman attributed to a decline in moisture flow from the Bay  resulted in the warming up of the earths surface through solar radiation, especially between 9am and 2pm.        
	The weather over the weekend has been relatively dry, with Sundays maximum temperature climbing up to 32.5 degrees. In the absence of any atmospheric formation nearby, there has been no significant cloud formation, said an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).        
	The IMD official said the weather would remain warm, though not too uncomfortable, for at least 24 hours.        
	Last Monday, the maximum temperature had dipped to six degrees below normal, heralding a cold day condition.        
	The weatherman reiterated that the cyclonic storm Jal, which was 150km east-southeast of Chennai at 2.30pm on Sunday, would have little impact on the citys weather. There is hardly any chance of the storm suddenly veering towards Bengal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Strike bane for undertrials
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Strike bane for undertrials
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Twenty undertrials who got bail earlier this week are still languishing in custody following the indefinite strike by high court employees that entered its third day on Friday.        
	The undertrials were granted bail on Monday and Tuesday but they could not be set free as copies of the orders are yet to reach the authorities concerned because of the strike.        
	Court sources say copies are usually served within two days of a bench pronouncing the order.        
	As the courts doors have been shut since Wednesday, I am yet to get a copy of the bail order for my client, said Kallol Guha Thakurta, who is representing one of the 20 undertrials.        
	The 1,700-odd striking employees, pressing for the implementation of a revised pay scale recommended by a panel of three judges and two government officials, are not allowing anyone other than the judges to enter the court.        
	The government pays salaries to the court employees but the pay scale is determined by a committee comprising judges and government representatives.        
	A few days ago, the court administration had called police to remove lawyers from a room which they had allegedly occupied illegally. Why is the administration not directing the police now to remove the agitators and let lawyers enter the court? asked advocate Subrata Mukherjee.        
	Several other lawyers echoed Mukherjees stand.        
	The vice-chairman of the state legal aid services, Gitanath Ganguli, however, blamed the government for the impasse. Only the government is benefiting from the situation as the cases against it are getting dragged. So, it is sitting on the issue, said Ganguli.        
	The state bar council chairman has requested the agitating employees to allow lawyers into the court from September 26. The earnings of around 7,000 lawyers and as many law clerks, as well as 160 typists and 250 shop-owners around the court, has taken a hit.        
	The court has 531 keys that are kept in the custody of the registrar (administration). Very few employees know which key opens which door. Unless the strike is lifted and the employees resume work, there is no way the court can function, said a source.        
	Seven held: Seven suspected thieves were arrested early on Friday when they assembled at Talpukur in Titagarh, allegedly to plot robberies. Two firearms and five rounds of cartridges were found on the youths, who are residents of Hooghly district.        
	 Power supply: Power supply may be disrupted in parts of Mahestala from noon to 4pm on Saturday because of maintenance.

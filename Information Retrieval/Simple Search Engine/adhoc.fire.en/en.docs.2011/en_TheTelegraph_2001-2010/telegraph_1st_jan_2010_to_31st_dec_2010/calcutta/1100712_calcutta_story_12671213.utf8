The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Night is no longer young 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Night is no longer young 
          OUR BUREAU                           Weekend revellers outside a nightclub in a star hotel that shut down earlier than usual on Sunday. (Rashbehari Das)                                  
	Excise raids curtailed Calcuttas weekend with the all-night-long party crowd forced out of nightclubs at 2am and those enjoying a post-midnight tipple at 24-hour coffee shops going bottoms-up to beat the deadline.        
	Disha Surana, who had gone to The Park on Saturday with friends to celebrate her birthday, was among the many disappointed faces that lined the lobbies of star addresses after the curfew was enforced. We reached Roxy at 1.40am and were told that the place was going to shut in 10 minutes. It was such a mood killer, complained the 24-year-old birthday girl.        
	The curfew code on Saturday was strictly enforced by the establishments because of back-to-back Friday raids by excise teams on July 2 and 9. Excise department officials have been doing the rounds recently and forcing us to close early. Previously, we would be allowed to stay open till 4am, said the manager of a south Calcutta nightclub.        
	According to excise sources, licences to run bars for an extended period are renewed every month and fresh norms set during each renewal.        
	In June, the excise limit for bars and nightclubs in star hotels was 2am with the option of extending it by two hours on Fridays and Saturdays with the special licence that is renewable every month. For standalone party hubs such as Shisha and Venom, the official closing time was midnight on weekdays and 2am on weekends.         
	The manager of a star hotel said such raids were common at this time every year but declined to elaborate. I guess the idea is to bring things under control from time to time, he said.        
	No senior excise official was available for comment.        
	Standalone nightclubs are apparently the ones affected the most whenever the curfew is enforced because they get two hours less to do business than the star addresses.         
	The official time to shut our doors is midnight. With a temporary licence, we could stay open for two extra hours. However, with the same licence, five-star hotels cam run till 4am. Calcutta comes out to party around midnight, which gives us only two hours of business, said Gursimran Singh, managing director of The Basement, the five-month-old pub at Hotel Samilton on Sarat Bose Road, and Shimmers, a lounge bar in Salt Lake.        
	In April 2009, Shisha and Venom were barred from serving liquor for a fortnight for allegedly violating norms. This time, even star addresses are being forced to close at 2am, said Arvind Bhatnagar, the executive director (operations) of Shisha.        
	In March, two youths were shot at in front of a dhaba on Ballygunge Circular Road in the wee hours following a fight outside a Hazra pub a few hours earlier. But nightclubs in town insist that Calcutta is safe for clubbing.         
	Unlike Mumbai or Delhi, Calcutta has no drug issues or major incidents of crime under the cover of clubbing. The maximum we have faced are brawls between customers, who are then shown the door. Partying safely through the night is Calcuttas pride and other cities envy, said a nightclub manager.        
	Not anymore, at least for some time.

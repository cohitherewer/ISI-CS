                                                                                                                         3                                                                                        We Ask You Answer      Prescriptions for a perfect city
          Todays question: If you are inducted into the advisory committee of your local civic body what advice would you offer? More answers to be published next week                  
	PARANJOY DEB, 
  Ballygunge         
	If I am inducted into the advisory committee of our local civic body my advice would be to clean the roads every alternative day, use suction pumps to clear waterlogged areas during monsoon, to illuminate the roads properly, clear unused places, designate a proper place for dumping waste, plant trees wherever required. I think if we apply the above suggestions then we would have a better and brighter Calcutta. We need help and co-operation from the common people, then only can this be achieved.               
	

SIBASIS DHAR
  Dum Dum,        
	As a local body advisor, I would suggest that spilling of garbage on roads be prevented by using an enclosed container. All trees should be made free of banners, advertisements and posters. Organise a campaign every month by schoolchildren to educate people about clean and green society. Grounds used for fairs which are not utilised for the rest of the year should be turned into play grounds for children and maintained by local bodies.              
	

SHANKHA SHUVRO, 
  Dhakuria        
	It will be really sad to see our city turning into Venice again during the monsoons like in previous years. The next suggestion will be to repair the potholes which cause the jerks we face while driving. And what about the habits of spitting and urinating in the roads?                 VINAY SHRESHTHA, 
  Salkia    If I am inducted into the advisory committee, the first thing I would advise them to do is to adopt the motto Work is worship and follow it religiously. Next, Ill advice them to install two to three drop boxes in every ward where residents can lodge complaints and suggestions for their councillors. Smoking in public places is banned but it is still a common sight everywhere. Another habit that has to be put an end to is spitting. If all this is stopped our Calcutta will become a second London.									          
	

NUPUR MAROTI,
  Liluah        
	I would want the civic body to look into the problem of residents who suffer because of factories situated in the residential areas which emit poisonous gases and cause irritating noise.               
	

PRASANTA GHOSH,
  Barasat         
	Apart from mandatory duties the civic authorities would be advised to develop eco-tourism, introduce green police with volunteers from local schools and switch over to solar power for streetlights. There should be a redressal body to address civic problems faced by the citizens. The municipalities should work in tandem with the other agencies of the government.         
	

ASOK CHATTERJEE, 
  Konnagar         
	Firstly, I would recommend the improvement of water supply because the water pressure in our locality is so low that a bucket takes 30 minutes to fill. The blocked drains should be cleared regularly to accelerate smooth clearance of sewage. Most of the roads, shops and houses get flooded with knee-deep water after hardly a spell or two of rain. Pollution on the roads should be controlled. Garbage should be collected regularly instead of every two or three days.         
	

OISHIMAYA SEN,
  Tollygunge        
	Slaughtering of animals in roadside meat shops is something the municipality must put a ban on as soon as possible. Animals for slaughtering are kept under extremely unhygienic conditions, chickens are cramped together in small cages. It is a horror to see the birds being carried to shops hung upside down with their legs tied together. Goats are tied outside meat shops in a manner in which they cant even hold their necks up straight. Cruelty towards animals is the first step towards spread of violence in society.               
	

SWATI DAS,
  Address not mentioned         
	I would recommend proper removal of garbage. Streets must be swept clean between 6am and 7am everyday. Any dug-up roads, diversions and construction must have a clear sign in fluorescent paint. Yellow paint should be used to mark parking areas. Streetlights should not be put at such a height that the ground is hardly illuminated. Buses and taxis should be fined for picking up passengers from spots other than bus stops.               
	

INDRANIL SANYAL,
  Dhakuria         
	As an advisor to the local civic body, I would like to put emphasis on overall development of the area. Problems like water-logging, sanitation, sewerage system and illumination must be treated as top priorities. Whenever there is a heavy downpour, parts of our locality get inundated. Improper drainage system is responsible for this. Some of the roads are not properly illuminated which causes inconvenience to commuters. More and more tube wells need to be dug for abundant supply of drinking water. The local civic body can easily sort out this problem, as five years is a pretty long time to effect upgradation of the existing systems.               
	

POULAMI MUKHERJEE,
  Khardah         
	Firstly, it is important to neutralise the conflict between the chairperson and other members and make them willing to work hand to hand. Next, I would insist on regular clearance of roads and dustbins. Keeping the locality peaceful and free of all political hassles. Steps must be taken to increase public awareness about pollution. Development of cultural and educational programmes and helping abandoned people will also be recommended.               
	

KAJAL CHATTERJEE,
  Sodepur        
	If I am inducted into the advisory committee of our local civic body, I would advise the authorities to see to it that hawkers are evicted from the pavements to ensure the rights of the pedestrian. It is important that promoters, who blatantly flout all safety norms and regulations and illegally destroy greenery and waterbodies be reined in immediately.              
	

BHARAT KAMDAR,
  Gurusaday Road        
	If I am inducted into the advisory committee of our local civic body I would advise that all garbage vats be covered as they spread a foul smell and help breed bacteria. There should be more public urinals. This will also help maintain basic hygiene on the streets which I am sure every responsible citizen will agree is essential.

										      Sandipan Das breaks his silence on the 30-hour ordeal that began with his hailing a cab on way home from work      TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE      
	A rare moment of comic relief for kidnap victim Sandipan Das during his 30-hour ordeal last weekend was his abductors being outsmarted by his touchscreen smartphone.        
	According to the Capgemini executive, every ransom call that the trio made to his family with that cellphone continued longer than intended because they just couldnt figure out how to disconnect the line.        
	Not only did the kidnappers ignorance about touchscreen technology keep Sandipan amused, it gave the cops a few extra seconds to track their conversation and trace them through cellphone towers.        
	Tamaghna Banerjee caught up with the 34-year-old senior operations manager of Capgemini Consulting at his two-storeyed Ganguly Pukur residence in Kasba on Friday morning to piece together the story of his abduction and its aftermath. Over to Sandipan.                        
	I think it was sheer bad luck that I boarded the wrong taxi to return home from my New Town office that night (February 26).        
	I had gone quite a distance past the taxi stand near DLF Building when I realised that at least three vehicles were parked there. I did not have the energy to walk back; so I waited for a taxi to pass by. When I saw a vehicle speed past me, I shouted to catch the drivers attention. He stopped some metres away, and I actually had to run to get into the cab.        
	How was I to know that the driver (Sanjay Pal) was looking for a hostage victim?        
	In hindsight, I think he and his accomplices were on the lookout for any well-dressed passenger. I just happened to walk into their trap.        
	It dawned on me that I was in trouble when the taxi stopped near DL Block in Salt Lake and the driver pushed the front bucket seat back, cramping me for space. He then got off saying that there was a problem with the engine. I instinctively opened the door and stepped out, only to be surrounded by two armed men and the driver.        
	I punched one of them but was overpowered and pushed back into the taxi. I decided not to push it.        
	As the driver revved up, the other two blindfolded me and ordered me to lie face down on the floor of the taxi. I couldnt see anything after that but my mind was alert. I could sense the car taking a U-turn and going up a flyover, which I presumed was the one at Nabadiganta. I knew we were passing Technopolis when I heard a bus conductor shouting out the name of the landmark.        
	We passed by City Centre 2 a little later, which I recognised because of the familiar rattle caused by two back-to-back speedbreakers not far from the mall.         
	I couldnt make out where we were headed, though I kept trying to identify the places along the way by focusing on the sounds and smells. My kidnappers stopped at a roadside dhaba. When they returned to the cab they were reeking of alcohol and using foul language.        
	Then we reached their hideout, which I later learnt was a Tobin Road house belonging to the taxi driver. My hands were tied together and my eyes covered with a dark cloth. The house being near a marketplace, there was always a buzz outside. I even heard trains passing by. But not for once did I try to attract anybodys attention or seek help, lest the kidnappers panic and harm me.        
	I was jittery for the first few hours but calmed down after that and tried to learn what my abductors were planning by hearing them converse or trying to talk to them. I could sense that the trio were amateurs and nervous. They gave me regular meals of rice and dal, and often talked about releasing me after collecting whatever amount my family was willing to pay.        
	The trio made all the ransom calls with my touchscreen phone, which none of them knew how to use properly. They would make a call but fail to disconnect after ending the conversation. They never asked me to help because that would have meant taking off my blindfold.         
	After fiddling with the touchscreen tabs for some time, they would take out the battery and even the SIM card out of desperation. I am told my family members and the police would get to hear the confused chatter at the other end till the line got disconnected, which in the end proved crucial to the investigation.        
	The abductors had even tinkered with my laptop, though they returned it to me at the time of my release in Belghoria. They had promised to return my phone as well, asking me to wait for one of them near the Nabadiganta flyover four days after my release.        
	Looking back, I find it hard to believe that I have come out of this unscathed. I was unwell throughout those hours in captivity, and my mother-in-law had a heart attack after hearing about my abduction. My one-and-a-half-year-old son Surjya was down with fever, which compounded my familys woes. Thank god, it was all over in 30 hours.        
	Now that I am a free man again, my life is slowly getting back to normal. I returned to my New Town office on Thursday, and was greeted by colleagues and friends eager to know about my experience.        
	When I stepped out of office in the evening, I glanced at the spot from where I was abducted and couldnt help laughing when I saw the entire stretch well-lit and being patrolled by policemen. Why do the authorities wait for something bad to happen before they act?        
	Did Sandipan do the right thing by not trying to flee or scream for help? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com

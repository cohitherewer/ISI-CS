The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wonder years without outdoors   City tween trapped by pressure to perform
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wonder years without outdoors     City tween trapped by pressure to perform

	All work and little play is robbing Calcutta tweens of a valuable chapter of their wonder years.        
	Lets Just Play, a six-city survey carried out by TV channel Nick in association with Hansa Research, has spelt out what the city has known for a while but turned a blind eye to  children in Calcutta play outdoors less and are more burdened by academic pressure.        
	Conducted among 600 children between eight and 14 in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Calcutta, the survey indicates that only 15 per cent of city kids play outdoors everyday as opposed to 40 per cent in Mumbai and 23 per cent in Delhi.        
	If children in Mumbai play for at least an hour daily, the maximum that Calcutta kids devote to outdoor activity is a mere 15 minutes a day.        
	So what keeps kids in Calcutta indoors? From the lure of television and indoor games to lack of open spaces, there is a lot at play to keep the Calcutta kid away from play.        
	But the prime culprit is the burden of books put by teachers and parents. Calcutta kids are under a lot of academic pressure, both at school and at home, says Nina Jaipuria of Nick India.        
	Most children in Bengal are excessively conscious of their performance and position in class. Since the academic pressure is high, the demand for tuition is also high and naturally most of them do not get the time to play, says Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School.        
	Take 12-year-old Naina Sabharwal of New Alipore who cant remember when she last played outdoors. Till I was in Class III, I went cycling for at least an hour everyday. Now I consider myself lucky if I can swim twice a week, says the student of La Martiniere for Girls.        
	No wonder the numbers have stumped Nina. Being a soccer-loving and cricket-crazy city, one would have expected Calcutta to score high. But the numbers are lower than the national average.        
	Life without outdoor games is a way of life for GeNext. Students are victims of a vicious circle, with both parents and teachers responsible for building this pressure, says Esther Rajan, an English teacher of Calcutta Girls High School for 22 years.        
	The survey says Calcutta schools have a maximum of two play periods in a week, while Mumbai and Bangalore have up to four. Now that will change in at least the CBSE schools (see report right).        
	Then there are the tech tools that keep kids behind closed doors. With the easy accessibility of computers, iPods and cellphones, the enthusiasm to play outdoors is getting diluted, says Bhagat.        
	Shrinking space and lack of basic infrastructure at the few-and-far-between parks is also a factor. There is hardly any space for children to play, says Rita Chatterjee, the principal of Apeejay Schools.        
	The survey also highlights the reluctance among Calcutta parents to encourage outdoor play. Most said they were wary of allowing their children out. First, because of studies and, second, because it is unsafe, especially for the girl child, says Nina.        
	For most parents, all-round development is not important when it comes to the race for marks, points out Mukta Nain, the principal of Birla High School for Boys.         
	And what scars will this leave on children robbed of the right to play outdoors? Such children have problems with adjustments and inferiority complex. Sport helps them develop sporting spirit and the ability to tackle problems, says Tapashi Mitra, a psychologist with the Institute of Child Health.        
	The last shot in the defence of outdoor sports is fired by Commonwealth Games gold medallist Dola Banerjee.        
	Playing an outdoor sport goes a long way in building a healthy mind and body. It teaches a child how to accept defeat graciously and work hard the next time, says the champion archer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Epic tales from enlightened man
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Epic tales from enlightened man
          RITA BHIMANI                          Tribute being paid to Prof P. Lal at St Xaviers College on Thursday, the day after the poet-translator-teacher passed away at a city nursing home. Picture by Amit Datta                                   
	Life is a saga of things lost: keys, photographs, books, friends, and, in the end, life itself. If we are dedicated (and lucky) we find things too: a little understanding, glimpses of happiness, perhaps even some wisdom and peace.              
	Professor Purushottama Lal penned these lines in his introduction to a quirky and charming reprint of his grandfather Sardar Babu Lals book titled A Readable Dictionary of Phrases, Idioms and Colloquialisms, first published in London in 1917.        
	He shared his serendipity with us during one of the sessions of the Mahabharata readings that had become such an integral part of our Sundays for close to a decade, one of the many charming crumbs that we pounced upon like eager sparrows, feeding as we were on the magnificent transcreated saga of the Mahabharata by P. Lal.        
	We found more than our share of glimpses of happiness and wisdom, but lost is an individual who was surely much larger than life itself.        
	On the dot of 11am every Sunday, Professor Lal would stride purposefully up to a raised platform, in the library of GD Birla Sabhagar, set down his armful of books and start with an invocation for our small group. The translation of the invocation was amazingly varied each time and as the interpretation of all aspects of the Mahabharata unfolded week after week, we started to find an enlightenment and understanding never imagined.        
	Was it a discourse? Was it readings? Was it a handing down of gyan? None of it. And yet all of it, teasing our sensibilities, testing our knowledge of the epics, training our ears to immaculate Sanskrit and an even more impeccable English rendering, sloka by sloka.                  
	There was always plenty of scope for interaction, but what magnetised us was the sensitive-stentorian tone, the dramatisation on occasion, the humility when necessary. And impactive all the time.        
	The transcreation of the Mahabharata was in several hundred slim volumes, which many in our group would bring along religiously to follow. Professor Lal revised these into 17 volumes, perfectly bound in his signature handloom sari material with his exquisite calligraphic embedding in gold. The 18th awaits completion, sans Lal, but with a weighing in of empathy and expertise.        
	There were amusing byplays to liven up the Sunday sessions. His scholar-wife Shyamasree would sit always in the fifth row, alongside a couple of vastly well-read Mahabharata scholars. She would with a straight face ask delicate questions which he would answer, often tongue in cheek. These would occasionally relate to issues of gender bias in the epic or Lals less than favourable view of Karna. There were always anecdotes and asides, amusingly delivered in his measured tenor. I understood then why those who had studied under him in St Xaviers College cherished the creative moments of learning.        
	In his teaching or in his talks half a century later, he never consulted a book or read from a script. His spontaneity was his forte. He never reproduced lines or verses. He recited them from memory as an actor would, be they a verse from Ode on a Grecian Urn or Krishnas advice to Arjuna on the necessity of battle. The one hour always seemed immeasurably short.        
	In his English class, they tell me, he would enunciate the conversation between Ulysses and Telemachus in their different voices. His students still remember the Lady of Shallot and the Hound of Heaven as presented in his incredible timbre.        
	He had perhaps missed his calling as a theatre actor with his marvellous sense of timing and perfect delivery of lines. Matchless raconteur, with a delicious sense of humour.        
	I first met him when my mother, Tapati Mookerji, came back from an all-woman delegation trip to Russia and armed with a collection of poems, we went to see P. Lal, who had started the Writers Workshop in the late 1950s.         
	It resulted in the publication of The Golden Road to Samarkand. In the 50 years of Writers Workshop, he published over 3,500 titles, knew when and where every single book was sold, and gave encouragement and empowerment to a host of wannabe writers, many of whom have become best-selling authors.        
	His own writing spanned everything from books of poetry, several volumes of literary criticism, his Lessons (when he was near death in the USA), his translations and transcreations, anthologies, childrens stories. But his scholarship and his sharing of his knowledge were limitless.         
	For everyone who knew him, learned at his feet, revered his immense scholarship, received the publishers touchstone, and just continued to be inspired by his vast learning and his elegant manner, we feel blessed that he could envelop and transcend us into his enlightened world.

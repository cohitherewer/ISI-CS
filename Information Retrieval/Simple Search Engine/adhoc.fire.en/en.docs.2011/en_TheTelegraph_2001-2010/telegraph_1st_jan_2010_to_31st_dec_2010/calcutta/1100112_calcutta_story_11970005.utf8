The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Partial solar eclipse on January 15
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Partial solar eclipse on January 15
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Annular solar eclipse		      
	The new year, which arrived on a rare blue moon eclipse night, will see an annular solar eclipse on January 15.         
	During an annular solar eclipse, the disc of the moon covers the central portion of the sun, leaving only a ring-like peripheral region visible, called the ring of fire. The path of annularity, or places from where this phenomenon can be seen, will fall across swathes of Africa, some islands in the Indian Ocean, the southern and south-eastern extremes of India, Myanmar and parts of China.         
	Calcutta will witness a partial eclipse, starting at 12.07pm and ending at 3.29pm. The maximum eclipse will be visible at 1.58pm, when 76 per cent of the sun will be obscured.         
	An annular eclipse takes place when the Earth comes closest to the sun, so that the sun looks a little bigger than usual, and around the same time, the moon reaches its farthest position in its orbit, thereby appearing a little smaller than the average full moon. In such a situation, if a solar eclipse occurs, the disc of the moon cannot completely cover the sun, said Debiprosad Duari, the director (research and academic) of the MP Birla Planetarium.         
	In India, the path of annularity will pass very close to the temple town of Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu.         
	Duari cautioned against looking at the sun with naked eyes. One must use a solar filter  either a film of Alumnized Mylar filter or No. 14 Welders Glass, he said.         
	The last annular eclipse occurred on January 9, 2009, but India didnt fall on its path of annularity. The last time it was visible from India was on November 23, 1965. The next annular eclipse will be on May 20, 2012, but India will have to wait till December 26, 2019, to witness the celestial event again.

Power supply to Sreemohan Lane, Sarat Chatterjee Road, Charu Avenue, Tollygunge Circular Road, Tollygunge Road, Deshapran Sashmal Road and Lake Avenue areas may be disrupted from 9am to noon on Friday because of maintenance by CESC.    South Calcutta Law College has applied to Calcutta University to introduce an honours course in law. Principal Debasis Chattopadhyay said the college had applied twice earlier but had been rejected because of inadequate number of full-time teachers.    An 18-year-old youth, Lob Dului, was arrested near Ice Skating Rink on Syed Amir Ali Avenue around 7.30pm on Thursday when he tried to snatch a gold chain from a woman. The incident took place minutes before the CMs convoy passed the area.

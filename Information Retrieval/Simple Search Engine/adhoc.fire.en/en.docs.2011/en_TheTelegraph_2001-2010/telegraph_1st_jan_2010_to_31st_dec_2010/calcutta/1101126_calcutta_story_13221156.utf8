	 Sabuj Maity stood nervously before the microphone. But once he started speaking, he slowly gained confidence. This Class VIII student of East Midnapore district had to fight for what was rightfully his  basic school education.         
	The government primary school in Kultalia, East Midnapore  which Sabuj attended was in a shambles, with only two teachers for 200 students. Disgusted, he dropped out of school and joined his father as a brick kiln labourer.         
	Finally, after a long break, and helped by a rural social welfare committee, Sabuj joined another school, with better infrastructure. He is doing well in class now and has started campaigning for child rights.        
	Sabuj and three other children from Calcutta, Orissa and Jamshedpur spoke of the struggles they had to face to get educated at a press conference organised by Child Rights and You (CRY) on November 14.         
	The aim was to highlight the gaps in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, through the experiences of these children. The Act was passed in August 2009.         
	The closest school was 4km from my home, said Sabuj.        
	I found a nail in my mid-day meal, complained 13-year-old Pushpa Bala Mahato of Adibashi Jahira Bustee in Jamshedpur.        
	I was forced to drop out as my parents did not want to educate a girl child, said 12-year-old Rubina Mallick.        
	But these kids were not willing to give up easily. Today, they urged others to take up the cause for quality free education.         
	CRY associate general manager (development support) Satya Gopal Dey, said the public expenditure on primary education still remains around 1.5 per cent of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product).         
	The Act should be made applicable to private schools too. It is the right of every child, including those in private schools, to get education free, he added.

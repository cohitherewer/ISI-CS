	A 35-year-old man suffered critical head injuries when a concrete chunk from the terrace of a highrise on CR Avenue, named Supreme, fell on him on Monday afternoon.        
	Rishra resident Gouranga Dutta, who works in a share trading firm in the city, was walking with two acquaintances the day after the civic poll when a concrete slab of 35 CR Avenue, off the GC Avenue crossing, collapsed.        
	A few small pieces fell on my head. When I turned back I was horrified to see Gourangada lying on the pavement, bleeding profusely from his head, recalled 19-year-old Ankan Pal, who was accompanying Dutta along with his father Nemai.        
	My father immediately approached a traffic sergeant, who hailed a taxi and asked us to take him to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, said Ankan.        
	But doctors in the emergency ward of the medical college allegedly told the Pals that the victim could not be treated there as the hospital did not have a neuro-surgery department. The father-son duo then called Duttas employer Sandip Bardia and brother-in-law Golak Pal, who works in a Burrabazar firm, and asked them to come over.         
	Bardia and Golak decided to shift Dutta to Ruby General Hospital.         
	The chief executive of the hospital, Brigadier (retd) S.B. Purakayastha, said: The condition of the patient is extremely critical. The next 24 hours will be crucial.        
	S. Tripurari, the deputy commissioner of police (central), said: If a complaint is lodged, well launch a probe to find out whether the mishap was caused by the negligence of the owners of the building.

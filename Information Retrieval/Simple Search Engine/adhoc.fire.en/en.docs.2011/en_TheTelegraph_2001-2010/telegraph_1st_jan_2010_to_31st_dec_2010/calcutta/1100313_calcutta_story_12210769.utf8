                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Youth held for trader kidnap
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth who allegedly kidnapped a Hardwar trader from Ludhiana last month was arrested when he turned up outside Howrah station on Friday afternoon to collect ransom.         
	Kishan Kumar, 30, drugged Sarwan Kumar and brought him to Howrah by train, said state police, which helped Punjab police make the arrest.        
	According to cops, Kishan used to work in the 35-year-old traders stone-cutting factory at Hardwars Ranimajra. After Sarwan fired him a few months ago over alleged embezzlement, Kishan moved to his in-laws place at Jagachha in Howrah.        
	On February 6, Kishan allegedly spiked Sarwans drink at a wedding party in Ludhiana and boarded a train to Howrah along with the trader. The youth told co-passengers and cops that Sarwan was mentally challenged and ill.         
	Kishan was arrested as soon as he showed up at a spot outside the station to collect a ransom of Rs 5 lakh from Sarwans family members. He was so taken aback that he didnt even make an effort to escape, said an officer.        
	I think we reached Howrah on February 7. He gave me regular doses of sedatives for five weeks. I was always too groggy to protest. I dont know how I survived, Sarwan told Metro, after he was rescued from the Jagachha house.

	A man died while offering tarpan at Prinsep ghat on Thursday morning while two others died in a mishap on their way to Dakshineswar to perform the ritual.        
	Gautam Mukherjee, 24, a resident of Behala, was swept away by high tide in the Hooghly in the morning. The tide was so strong that it became difficult to stand in the water, said Arijit Mukherjee, a Bhowanipore resident who had come to perform tarpan at Babughat. The disaster management group and river traffic police were keeping a watch on the ghats. An unidentified youth was rescued soon after he was carried away by the tide.        
	Manajit Dutta and Sudipto Roy, both Tollygunge residents, died when the taxi taking them to Dakshineswar was hit by a truck near Ballyghat in Howrah.

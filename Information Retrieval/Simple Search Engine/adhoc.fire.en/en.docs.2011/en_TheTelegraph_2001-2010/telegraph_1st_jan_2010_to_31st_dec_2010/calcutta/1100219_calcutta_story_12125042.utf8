                      The final verdict                    A murder mystery full of high drama and suspense, Spandans latest production, Ek Ruka Hua Faisla is based on Reginald Roses internationally renowned play Twelve Angry Men. The action of the play is built around a case of murder that has just been presented in court. A young man has allegedly killed his father and the police have arrested the accused from the scene of crime. All circumstantial evidence and witnesses point to the son having committed the crime. After several hearings, the court directs the jury to decide unanimously on the verdict. It is declared that an acquittal would free the accused while a conviction would lead him to the gallows. The jurys discussion begins with a vote on the case. All, except one member, proclaims the accused guilty. Argument and counter-arguments follow from this point among members of the jury. Each one expresses his opinion, which is often coloured by individual or personal bias. As their complex arguments charge up the atmosphere in the courtroom, the fate of the young man, who stands precariously poised between life and death, continues to hang in balance. Direction: Ashok Singh. Staged as part of Spandans Cause for Theatre project, which supports theatre talent in the city.

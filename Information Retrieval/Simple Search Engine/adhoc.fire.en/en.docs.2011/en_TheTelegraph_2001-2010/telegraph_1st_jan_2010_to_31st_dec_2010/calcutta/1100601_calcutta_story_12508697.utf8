	Party leaders traded barbs on Monday over the shooting of a CPM activist  who doctors said might lose a leg  by a jawan outside a Patuli poll booth on Sunday.         
	Arabinda Dhar was shot at by Tripura State Rifle jawan Sandip Sharma while manning a booth in a school at 2.45pm on Sunday.         
	On Monday afternoon, Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee termed Dhar a notorious criminal.        
	In the evening, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee arrived at Peerless Hospital, where Dhar has been admitted in a critical care unit, and spoke with doctors and Dhars family. CPM leaders Biman Bose and Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, too, were present.         
	Mamata Banerjee says one thing in the morning and another in the evening. You can go to Patuli and investigate Dhars record, countered Bose.        
	Hospital sources said doctors would have to amputate Dhars leg. His left leg has to be amputated but we are waiting for his condition to improve a little before conducting the procedure, an official said.        
	The Bengal government has requested Tripura to suspend Sharma.        
	We have sent our recommendation about suspending Sharma to the Tripura government, home secretary Samar Ghosh said.        
	A state official pointed out that Sharma had fired from his rifle without receiving any order from his superior.         
	Dhars neighbours said his wife Meera was also a CPM activist. The couple have a four-year-old son, Mayukh.         
	Poll clash         
	Four people were injured on Monday as CPM and Trinamul Congress supporters clashed in Metiabruz for over an hour.        
	Police said over 50 Trinamul supporters led by Shamsuzzaman Ansari blocked roads in Lichubagan and Darjipara in the morning demanding the arrest of some CPM activists accused of hurling bombs on Sunday injuring two Trinamul men.         
	Trinamul supporters allegedly hurled stones at their rivals and a full-blown fight ensued. Cops who arrived at the spot faced a hail of stones and bricks. The police later clamped Section 144 on the area to prevent people from gathering in groups.

	Weather watch        
	It may rain during Puja under the influence of a low-pressure area that has formed over the Bay of Bengal but it is unlikely to pour, the weatherman has predicted. The low pressure is likely to intensify and cause heavy rainfall in south Bengal but the city and its suburbs will probably be spared, said an India Meteorological Department official. Fingers crossed!

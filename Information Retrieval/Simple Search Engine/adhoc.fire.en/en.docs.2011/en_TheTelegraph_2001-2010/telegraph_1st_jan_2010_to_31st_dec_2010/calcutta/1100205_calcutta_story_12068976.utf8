                      When the twain meet                          In my opinion, beauty and ugliness are ... counterparts. Just as beauty sees its reflection in ugliness, ugliness is the first step towards beauty. It is this lsquo;seeing rsquo; of the movement, which makes the venture meaningful... mdash; Shridhar Iyer  Socrates inverts the common mans intuition about what is knowable and what is real. While most people take the objects of their senses to be real, if anything is, Socrates is contemptuous of people who think that something has to be graspable in the hands to be real. Likewise, while philosophers and writers have consistently conjured up their views on beauty, the same did not happen with ugliness because it was mostly conceived as the opposite of beauty. But ugliness can have a separate existence from beauty or may be it has its own beauty. The point is about being a human being who looks at the world afresh. That is always the challenge of art and its highest calling. When Indian art was searching for its own identity in the colonial dissemination of art and the young Bengal School was seeking inspiration from the ethos and the canons of beauty found in traditional Indian and Oriental art, Rabindranath Tagore showed the way when he confessed his paintings were born from ugliness. Their origin was the scratches in his manuscripts that cried, like sinners, for salvation and assailed my eyes with the ugliness of their irrelevance. The current show, curated by Romain Maitra, examines how a repellent theme can have its own beauty, and a blissful theme can appear soi-disant ugly. Participants include Jogen Chowdhury, Rabin Mondal, Shridhar Iyer, Samir Roy, Nidhi Agarwal (The Scream  a painting by her appears here), Jaya Ganguly, Samit Das and Sutanu Chatterjee.

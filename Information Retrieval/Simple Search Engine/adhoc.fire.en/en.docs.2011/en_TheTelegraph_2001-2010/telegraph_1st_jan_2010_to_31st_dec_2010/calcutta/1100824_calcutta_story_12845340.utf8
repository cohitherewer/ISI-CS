The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clash at college 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Clash at college 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Supporters of the SFI and the Trinamul Chhatra Parishad clashed at St Pauls college over a Mamata Banerjee poster and disrupted peak-hour traffic on Amherst Street for 45 minutes on Monday evening.         
	The trouble started when supporters of the Trinamul students wing tried to put up a flex bearing Mamatas portrait inside the boys common room.         
	Our college was painted a few days back and the principal had requested students not to put up any poster on the wall. Hence, we objected to the flex being put up, said an SFI supporter.        
	A Trinamul Chhatra Parishad supporter alleged that SFI supporters tore up their posters and beat them up.         
	SFI supporters lodged a police complaint. Later the two groups threw stones at each other and blocked the road from 5.55pm to 6.40pm.

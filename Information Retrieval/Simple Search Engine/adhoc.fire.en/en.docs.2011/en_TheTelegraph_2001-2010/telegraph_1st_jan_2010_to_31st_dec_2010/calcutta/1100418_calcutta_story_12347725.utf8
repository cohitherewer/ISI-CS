										                        They called it a Vedic wedding				                           
	Never having had the good fortune to study Sanskrit, I have always had an uneasy relationship with that V-word.        
	Some years ago, I visited friends of mine on a spa holiday in a Village with this name. When I arrived I heard that one of them had a stomach upset and was not getting appropriate medical and diet help. I went to a chemist several miles away, acquired some patent allopathic drugs and brought her back to Gariahat in the evening.        
	Meanwhile, we toured the place in motorised golf carts. Organic cereals and vegetables were grown on the premises (but they hadnt been able to give my friend a simple khichdi or jhol). Decorative pottery was also made on the premises. Some of the cottages had swimming pools on the outside wall. The suite my friends had booked had a large private bath open to the suns rays. We saw a banquet hall and large conference rooms with all mod cons.         
	Our own lunch was North Indian mother tincture food, nans and strongly spiced fish and vegetables, all in the same red gravy. The salad looked fresh and inviting. The sweet dish was mishtir dokan stuff: lal doi and sandesh. It was all very pretty but Vedic? I dont know.         
	A subsequent chapter when the place went up in flames is recent well-documented history.        
	When my niece married a Pakistani in the US many years ago an NRI guest at the wedding told me she didnt approve of weddings like this without religious ceremony. Her son, who had married an American, had a proper Vedic wedding: so much more sanctimonious (the malapropism was most appropriate for what she went on to say). ...even more sanctimonious than a wedding in India where no one listens to the words of the purohit. Far away in the US a printout of the ceremony with English translations and explanations was handed out to all guests who sat quietly with heads covered during the two- hour-long ceremony.         
	This sounded to me like a tough task. The bride and groom also cut a three-tiered wedding cake that was fully vegetarian, made from the choicest nuts and iced over. A Vedic cake forsooth.        
	The Vedic wedding cuts out the contexts and concentrates on meaningful mantras. If the contexts stayed in I do not know how meaningful the mantras would be. Referring as they do to marriages of gods and goddesses and their offspring they are often polygamous, polyandrous, even incestuous.         
	Suryas bridal (and this is the daughter not the father we are talking about) supplies a number of the requisite mantras. The text of one line in Step 8, dasasyam putran dehi, patim ekadasam kriti, asks Indra to bless the bride and give her 10 sons. Whatever happened to family planning? And what about daughters: are they unwelcome punctuation? Appalling if you are a feminist (feminists appal easily).         
	Then the husband asks to be her eleventh son in his old age. Et tu, brute! (I mean brute and not Brutus!) Can his wife do the same?        
	The following mantra, however, is refreshingly welcome: Over thy husbands father and thy husbands mother bear full sway. Over the sister of thy lord, over his brothers rule supreme.         
	I kid you not: you can find all this on www.ramanuj.org/sri/VedicWeddingceremony.

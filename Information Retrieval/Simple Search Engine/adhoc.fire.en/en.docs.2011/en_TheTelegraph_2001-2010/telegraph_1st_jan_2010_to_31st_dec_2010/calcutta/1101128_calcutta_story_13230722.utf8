	Have rural cottage industries become the exclusive reserve of NGOs? This is the conclusion I reached after my recent visit to the famous Raas mela in Khardah.         
	In the 18th and the 19th century, the Raas mela at Khardah was the biggest and the most happening in Bengal. Tiny though this village was, it was important to the Vaishnavite cult as Nityananda Prabhu, a disciple of Sri Krishna Chaitanya, had settled in a thatched hut here. That is now a humble brick structure popularly known as Kunjabati, which looked plain and unadorned during the Raas festival last week when the usually dark streets of Raaskhola close to the banks of the Hooghly were brilliantly lit with Chandernagore razzle dazzle.        
	Tapas Mukherjee, a long-time resident of Khardah, who has been researching for a long time the history of what became an industrial town in late 19th century, and is currently updating his book on Rabindranath Tagores sojourn there in 1932, says earlier the mela used to be quite rowdy. According to Samachar Darpan and other contemporary records, prostitutes were regulars there. So were Chinamen, who opened gambling dens at the mela. But the law against immorality was clamped down and prostitutes were debarred from visiting the mela, and gradually it lost its attraction, says Mukherjee.        
	Then the railways were introduced, which brought Khardah closer to Calcutta. It was possible to reach the village from Sealdah in less than an hours time, and it lost its rural charm. Gradually, the Khardah mela lost its pre-eminence to the one in distant Santipur, which was far from Barrackpore, second home to the governor-general, and that of the viceroy, at a later period. Because of their proximity to the ruling class, all towns between Calcutta and British Indias first cantonment, such as Khardah, had to be kept squeaky clean.        
	It is said about 250 years ago, a woman named Pateswari Ma Goswami had constructed the famous Shyamsundar temple, which dominates Raaskhola, after her husband, who had been imprisoned by Nawab Alibardi Khan, was released. Close to the Hooghly banks are the ratha-shaped Raasmanchas and Dolmancha, and the mela with its stalls, eateries and rides is held around these structures.        
	On the day of Raasjatra itself, the Raasmanchas are lit up brilliantly as the deity carried in a flower-bedecked palanquin by local people is taken on a tour of all these ornamental structures from the main temple.         
	Flowers  real ones  there were in plentiful, but plastic petals in lurid shades were blooming amidst them, as they do at most weddings and other ceremonies these days.        
	Remember those sola pith cockatoos, monkeys and flowers that used to adorn Raasmanchas? Except for the main one in the middle of the field they were nowhere to be seen.        
	About three years ago, when I first visited the mela, I had chanced upon a man selling clay toys, not of the Krishnagar variety but the more rustic ones depicting a typical Bengali village woman carrying a pitcher to fetch water. This time both the Trinamul and the Marxists had set up camps there, but what I discovered close by was priceless.        
	There was this little old man sitting on the ground with his stock-in-trade of dolls  no ordinary dolls but dolls that sparkled in the half light. Besides the usual deities there was Baba Loknath as well, apart from the little boys and girls in charming period costumes.         
	All the toys were powdered liberally with glitter, very much in keeping with the latest fashion statement  sequins encrusting apparel of every description. The man very helpfully explained that the toys were made of rubber with plaster of Paris inside that added to their weight. At one time, perhaps a century ago, pilgrims may have felt the same way when they went around Kalighat looking in vain for patas, and had to be content with cheap prints and oleographs.         
	I searched for clay toys and bamboo baskets at the stalls selling kitchen utensils but could not find any. Instead, I saw a man selling shiny fruit-bearing trees, very much like the ones from Krishnagar but made of plastic instead of clay. He announced they were from China.        
	Tapas Mukherjee said Rabindranaths house at Shyamsundar ghat in Khardah was originally the property of barrister Nripen Ghosh, from whom it passed on to Ramrik Das and Chiman Box. Tagore bought it from them and spent a good part of 1932 there. The building was swallowed by the Hooghly and all that remains of it is its main portal.        
	Further down at Biswasghat, better known as Babughat, the 26 Shiva temples constructed in the 19th century by the Biswas family have been restored by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).         
	Even four years ago, the temples were in ruins but most of the delicate, chikan-like stucco work was still intact. This time I noticed that this has been replaced by crude and ugly versions of it. I gathered from local people that Khardah municipality had sought funding from ASI to execute the restoration project.         
	Owing to political pressure and the Lok Sabha elections, work stopped at the temple complex. Later, the work was completed somehow. Most ASI work is executed by contractors who rarely employ specialised masons trained to undertake such projects.        
	A few yards ahead, Babughat has been turned into a grotesque replica of a mayurpankhi barge.       SOUMITRA DAS

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Spy winter in weekend sky
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Spy winter in weekend sky
  - Wet spell set to end on Saturday, chill round the corner          A STAFF REPORTER                                              
	Winters finally on the radar with the Met office predicting a weekend farewell for the freakish five-day wet spell responsible for December days becoming cooler and nights warmer.        
	Between Monday and Friday, the city experienced nearly 21mm of rain, with overcast conditions throughout that kept the mornings and afternoons cold.        
	On the flip side, the overcast conditions and the rain blocked the free flow of the North Wind, delaying the onset of winter, said an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).         
	Thursday was the wettest day of the spell, with 13.6mm of rain in 24 hours (see chart). On Friday, the skies remained overcast with the minimum temperature settling at 20.6 degrees Celsius, six notches above normal. The maximum was a point below normal at 25.6 degrees.         
	Met officials said it was unusual for the city to receive scattered rain for five days on the trot in December.         
	According to the Alipore Met office, formations over the Bay were responsible for the cloud cover and the rain but those were now on the wane. The low-pressure area off the Andhra coast is now weaker. The influence of the cyclonic circulation over northern Bay of Bengal will probably not last another 24 hours, an official said.        
	The reduced influence of the formations is expected to lead to lesser incursion of moisture into the atmosphere over south Bengal, which will ease out the clouds and precipitation. With the sky likely to clear from the second half of Saturday, the city should receive bright sunshine by Sunday afternoon.        
	That, of course, means the advent of sunny days and chilly nights with the North Wind blowing freely.        
	 The weather is likely to normalise over the weekend, which bodes well for the onset of winter by Monday, said G.K. Das of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Road to school mirrors township woes
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Road to school mirrors township woes
                            
	An eight-year-old boy was killed in an accident on the dusty and bumpy road leading to Delhi Public School Megacity in Rajarhat on Saturday. The tragedy triggered a mob fury that resulted in the destruction of two security posts and a bus of the school, prompting the management to shut down the campus and defer the annual sports scheduled for the weekend.        
	The school reopened on Tuesday.        
	Villagers, who call the thoroughfare DPS Road as it leads to the school, blamed the management for its poor condition.        
	Metro drove 4km on the Bhangar-Rajarhat Road, between Rajarhat Expressway and DPS, and found that the problems were symptomatic of the ones haunting New Town.        
	Uneven road        
	A huge hoarding of DPS Megacity on Rajarhat Expressway welcomes people to the nightmarish stretch as it passes through Kamarpukur village. Vehicles that were zooming along the Expressway cannot travel at more than 5kmph once it hits the potholed path.        
	The monsoon has made the situation worse. It now takes 40 minutes to drive the 4km. Our buses often break down on the road and children get hurt because of the bumps. We drive slowly on the stretch but minor mishaps keep happening, said a DPS driver.        
	Theres a bridge across a canal but most of the guardrails have crumbled. The bridge hasnt been repaired in 10 years. Besides, its so narrow that when school buses pass through it there is hardly any space for a pedestrian,said Saidul Mistry, a villager.        
	Haze of dust        
	Residents allege the road has not been repaired in the past six years. The top layer has been wiped off and a haze of dust hangs over the area whenever a vehicle passes by.        
	The school had commissioned people to sprinkle water on the road to tackle dust. On Saturday, a giant drum carrying water for sprinkling had overturned, crushing the local boy to death.        
	Lack of lights        
	There isnt any street light, making the area a ghost territory after dusk. Travelling on the road in the dark is very scary. We have had several meetings with the school authorities, asking them to do the needful, but nothing has been done, said Ranjit Neogi, a New Town resident.        
	Non-existent policing         
	Residents allege that accidents occur on the stretch at least thrice a week. To avoid the nasty road, they have chopped off some trees and created a slip road about 400 metres long.        
	There is no presence of police or any other arm of the administration in the vicinity.         
	We dump rubbish to level the cratered stretches and have also repaired some parts on our own whenever possible. But accidents will keep recurring till the entire road is repaired, said Nasir Molla, a resident.        
	The presence of cops can help minimise the number of mishaps but they are never seen on the road, not even during the rush hour.        
	Residents hope Saturdays fatal mishap will jolt the authorities out of their stupor.        
	Blame game        
	School: The school authorities claim they had requested local panchayat members several times to repair the road, but in vain. We repair the part of the road in front of our school but it is impossible for us to repair the entire length. Our guards manage traffic in front of the gate whenever our buses enter or leave the campus, said a member of the managing committee.        
	Gram panchayat: Mannan Gazi, the pradhan of the Trinamul Congress-run Rajarhat-Bishnupur gram panchayat, passed the buck to the CPM-run zilla parishad.        
	We are not responsible for the upkeep of the road. It falls under the Prime Ministers Gram Sadak Yojana and the zilla parishad receives funds for its repair. Those who run the parishad pocket all the money, alleged Gazi.        
	Zilla parishad: The chief of the zilla parishad, Bharat Das of the CPM, blamed the gram panchayat for the lack of development and accused local Trinamul leaders of non-cooperation.        
	Panchayat members never turn up at the meetings we call to discuss development. How can we repair the road if they deny us entry? said Das.        
	Another zilla parishad member alleged Trinamul leaders had thwarted an attempt to repair the road by damaging the contractors machines and equipment.        
	Das, however, said: After the boys death, we have decided to repair the stretch without any help from the gram panchayat.         
	As for the remaining 8km of the Bhangar-Rajarhat Road, neither the Trinamul panchayat nor the CPM-run zilla parishad is ready to take responsibility.        
	Tamaghna Banerjee

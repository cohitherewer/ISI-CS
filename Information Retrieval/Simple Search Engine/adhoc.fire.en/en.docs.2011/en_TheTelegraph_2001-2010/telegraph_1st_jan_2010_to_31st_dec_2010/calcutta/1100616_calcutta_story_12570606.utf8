The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Elders not safe in city 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Elders not safe in city 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta has the highest number of senior citizens suffering physical abuse compared with seven other cities, a report on the state of elderly people has revealed.        
	Calcutta tops the list with around 22.8 per cent of its elderly population suffering physical harassment. Hyderabad comes a close second at 21.7 per cent, followed by Mumbai (21 per cent) and Ahmedabad (20 per cent), said Susmita Ghosh, the regional director (east) of HelpAge India, an NGO which conducted the survey among more than 1,000 respondents of age 60 years or more in eight cities.        
	Though Calcutta has the maximum number of elderly people facing physical abuse, Bhopal (79.3 per cent) tops the list of general abuse. Delhi  at 15.4 per cent  ranks the lowest.        
	Ghosh said general abuse comprised all three categories  mental, physical and economic. The survey focussed separately on physical abuse as the aged are more vulnerable to it.        
	In most cases, the elderly are abused by their sons and daughters-in-law. In Delhi, at least a large number (of elderly people) are aware of their rights but that cant be said about Calcutta, Ghosh said at a seminar organised by HelpAge India on the occasion of the Fifth World Elder Abuse Awareness Day on Tuesday.        
	A Supreme Court ruling has made it mandatory for children and heirs to provide maintenance to senior citizens up to Rs 10,000 a month. The HelpAge report reveals that the ruling has hardly made any difference to the lives of the elderly. Worse still, one-fifth of the elderly hardly knows what constitutes abuse.        
	More and more elderly are facing depression and loneliness in todays world.... Even the children who live in the same city as their parents often do not keep in touch with them, said Shyamal Sen, a former chairman of West Bengal Human Rights Commission who was present at the seminar.        
	Avijit Ghosh of Dignity Foundation, another NGO that works for the elderly, said there were around 4 lakh senior citizens in Calcutta. Around five-six per cent of them face abuse at home. Most of them are from educated and well-off families.

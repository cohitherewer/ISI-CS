	Police said Rita Hazra, her son and Shefali Santra were taken to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital while Bapan Santra and driver Pratap Ghosh were admitted to Howrah District Hospital.         
	An officer said the family from Jagatballavpur in Howrah was taking the boy, a thalassaemia patient, for blood transfusion to Calcutta Medical College when the accident occurred around 4pm. The driver was possibly speeding and lost control of the vehicle, said the officer.         
	Student beaten up: The father of a Class III student of a primary school near Calcutta Leather Complex lodged a police complaint against the headmaster accusing him of beating up his daughter on Monday.         
	The father said the girl had been suffering from trauma since Fazlul Rahman, 32, called her to his room and beat her up for failing to answer a question. Rahman is absconding.

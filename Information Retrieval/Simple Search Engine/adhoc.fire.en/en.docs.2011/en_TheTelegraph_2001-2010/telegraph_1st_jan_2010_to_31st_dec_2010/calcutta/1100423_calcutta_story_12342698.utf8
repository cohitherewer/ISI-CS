The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU syllabi overhaul
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CU syllabi overhaul
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University is restructuring the syllabi of all 32 undergraduate courses, a move sources said was aimed at replacing the annual exams with the semester system as directed by the Centre.        
	University officials said the updated syllabi would come into effect from the 2010-11 academic session.        
	A huge exercise to review the syllabi of all 32 undergraduate courses is underway. The members of the boards of studies of all subjects are working overtime to enable us to introduce the revised syllabi from the new academic session, said Shyamal Sarkar, the secretary of the CU undergraduate council.        
	According to Sarkar, the overhaul is in keeping with CUs policy to upgrade the syllabi every three-four years but examination department sources said the exercise was aimed at paving the way for the introduction of the semester system.        
	The human resource development ministry and the UGC have long been insisting that all universities replace annual exams in undergraduate courses with semester tests.        
	The revised syllabi will be divided into modules so the transition to the semester system is smooth, said a member of one of the boards of studies of CU.        
	The last time the CU undergraduate syllabi were thoroughly revised was in 2003. Thereafter, minor changes were made in 2005 to facilitate the replacement of the 2+1 system of undergraduate exams with the 1+1+1 pattern.

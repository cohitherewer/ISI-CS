                      Tagores world of art        Rabindranath Tagore has been immortalised not only through his poetry but also his paintings and his contribution to Indian art. He learnt drawing in his childhood and was attracted by the sketches drawn by his elder brother Jyotirindranath. It was much later, in 1924, that he started doodling on the pages of his manuscript while writing Purabi. However, his famous appearance as painter in France in 1930 was not sudden. Long before the Paris exhibition which vaulted him to worldwide fame as an artist, Tagore had long discussions on art with Romain Rolland as well as French poet Saint John Perse over their several meetings in the 1920s. Tagore transformed his lack of formal training of art into an advantage and opened new horizons in the use of lines and colours. He was a prolific artist, producing over 2500 works within a decade, over 1500 of which are preserved at Santiniketan. In his search of newer forms of expressions, he explored themes of mystery and darkness. Dark creatures and haunting landscapes of another, primordial and marvellous world, which constituted Tagores works, continue to puzzle and delight art connoisseurs all over the world. The ongoing exhibition, featuring doodles, drawings and paintings of Tagore, enthralls art lovers besides offering a glimpse of another magnificent dimension of his creative genius.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Colleges denied heads in file delay
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Colleges denied heads in file delay

	Colleges functioning without principals, some for as long as two years, will not get the posts filled anytime soon.        
	Academic schedule and discipline will continue to take a hit at 30-odd colleges in the city and another 70 in the rest of the state where principals could not be recruited because a University Grants Commission (UGC) order on the new selection criteria hasnt yet reached the government.        
	Unless the higher education department sends us a circular containing the revised UGC guidelines, we cannot start the recruitment process, said Himangshu Ghosh, the chairman of the West Bengal College Service Commission.        
	The institutions functioning without principals include Shyamaprasad, Manindra Chandra, Bangabasi and the City group of colleges.        
	In the earlier system, a college teacher is considered for the principals post if he/she has a PhD and has taught in an undergraduate institution for at least 15 years.         
	The UGC order states that apart from meeting these two criteria, a candidate must also have the experience of working as a research guide.        
	We are aware of the changes but as far we are concerned, there is no official information about the new eligibility criteria. Its only after we get an order from the government that we can start interviewing candidates, said Ghosh.        
	Since the revised guideline hasnt come in, whats preventing the panel from appointing principals based on the earlier criteria?        
	The UGC has posted the new guidelines on its website. Since the revised criteria have already been made public, we cannot abide by the earlier ones, said Ghosh.        
	A senior official in the state higher education department said the UGC was to blame for the delay in issuing the circular containing the revised guidelines. We will send a letter to the college service commission only after the UGC order comes.        
	Teachers and officials associated with higher education said the stalemate, unless resolved soon, will take a toll on academic activities as well as campus discipline.        
	Violence is erupting on one campus after another over students union polls. A college without a principal is more susceptible to unrest. Besides, the academic schedule will go haywire in the absence of a proper administrative head. The government should urge the UGC to expedite the process of sending the circular, said a teacher of a college without a principal for two years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dawn flames lick Presidency labs   Water spoils those safe from heat
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dawn flames lick Presidency labs     - Chemistry hub lacks tools to battle blaze
          OUR BUREAU                        Firemen douse the flames in one of the two chemistry laboratories at Presidency that were completely destroyed in the blaze at dawn on Friday and (below) smoke billows out of the third floor of Derozio Building, to which the labs were shifted from the main building in 1971. (Bishwarup Dutta)				                                       
	Priceless research papers, pricey equipment and years of painstaking work went up in smoke when a fire at newly-anointed Presidency University early on Friday left two chemistry laboratories gutted and several damaged.        
	The fire was detected around 4am by a guard on duty in the Derozio Building, to which the laboratories were shifted in 1971. Twelve fire tenders fought the fire for three hours and finally put out the flames around 7am.        
	Only ashes and ashen remains of equipment were visible when firemen made it to the third-floor labs used by researchers and students. Crestfallen research scholars were seen running into the less affected labs and trying to salvage whatever they could even as the firemen were at work.        
	Water through a cracked floor came down like a torrent into a dark corridor seconds after researcher Ananya Mondal had stepped out of a room. She had a sheaf of papers in one hand, an umbrella in the other to protect herself from the flying debris, and tears in her eyes.        
	In an organic chemistry lab where hazardous chemicals and reagents abound, any one or a combination of these may have triggered the fire. Till late on Friday, a refrigerator stuffed with chemicals was the prime suspect in the pre-dawn blaze.        
	The fire appears to have started from a refrigerator in the third-floor laboratory for research scholars. It then spread to the other adjoining lab for researchers and the two laboratories across the corridor that postgraduate students use, said Dhurjati Prasad Sengupta, the director of the state forensic laboratory.        
	In terms of money, the damage could be worth crores. The deep-freeze refrigerator, which stores chemicals in as low as minus-20 degrees Celsius, costs around Rs 20 lakh. Some of the proteins and enzymes stored by biochemistry researchers cost as much as Rs 80,000 for a few milligrams.        
	Of the two gutted rooms, one was a research lab and the other was meant for postgraduate practical classes.         
	Night guard Ajay Seal, 38, said he was alerted by what sounded like crackers and then saw thick smoke billowing out.        
	In the lab where the fire is believed to have originated, even the desks and ceiling fans had crumbled in the heat.        
	The room had three refrigerators storing chemicals, five almirahs with research papers and three vacuum pumps. Everything has been destroyed, said Sanjib Ghosh, a former principal who also taught in the chemistry department.        
	A classroom and a protein research laboratory on the third floor were also affected. Their windowpanes were broken and the walls were soot-stained. The immense heat caused cracks on the floors, as a result of which the lab on the second floor also suffered damage.         
	Several years of hard work has been reduced to ashes, said Dipak Mondal, the head of the chemistry department. Solutions and theses documents, and several computers have been destroyed. Its very painful, he added.                          
	Presidency has 11 chemistry labs. The authorities said the heat and the water may have damaged most of these rooms. It will take a while to ascertain the extent of damage, said ex-principal Ghosh.         
	Rooms like the second-floor inorganic lab where Ananya works were untouched by flames, but flooded.         
	Fire service officials pointed at the colleges lack of preparedness to tackle a fire hazard. There were fire extinguishers, but not what a chemistry laboratory of an educational institution as large as this should have, said Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of the West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services. There were no sprinklers either. It was difficult fighting the fire.         
	Principal Amitava Chatterjee admitted the labs were not equipped to tackle a big fire. We have extinguishers but not the equipment to tackle a fire of this scale, he added.        
	Professor Shyamaprasad Goswami of Bengal Engineering and Science University, a former student and teacher at the department, recalled how exceptionally heated the roof of the lab would be in summer. I always felt the construction was unsuitable for a chemistry lab. A false ceiling or a fibre glass shed could have helped stave off the heat. We were safer when the lab was in the main building, he added.        
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee said the civic body would consider some compensation if Presidency asked for it. Higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri said the state government would provide all possible help.

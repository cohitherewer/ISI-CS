The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | He limps to class but soars in his dreams
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      He limps to class but soars in his dreams
  - Budding painter battles polio and poverty          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          Sujit Shaw at home with his typewriter and the canvas of his dreams. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                        
	Wake up at 7am. Do household chores. Practise typing. Go for accounts and math tuition. Limp 20 minutes to Park Street to teach a couple of kids. Take the Metro to Sovabazar and attend BCom classes at Jaipuria College. Return home by 9pm. Then, finally, sketch with pencil on chart paper till sleep envelopes the 8ft/9ft home in Uma Das Lane off SN Banerjee Road.        
	A day in the life of Sujit Shaw, 20, a polio-stricken dreamer determined to be an artist.        
	A recipient of the Surrendra Paul Memorial Award for Courage on Saturday at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence, Sujit could only crawl for the first few years of his life. Today, he walks with a limp and cannot do so for more than 15 minutes at a stretch.        
	But that didnt stop Sujit from scoring 76 per cent in his ISC from The Assembly of God Church School.        
	And that hasnt stopped him from eyeing a place in the Government College of Art and Craft. I could not take the entrance test in July as I suffered a bout of malaria. But I will definitely try next year, he told Metro.        
	Sujits father brings home Rs 2,000 a month, for the family of five, from selling gunny bags. I started doing odd jobs when I was in Class IX so that I could supplement the family income and also pursue my painting, said Sujit, one of whose elder brothers lost his right leg in an accident.        
	Polio has been Sujits companion from birth. Unable to walk, he would crawl all over his village in Begusarai district of Bihar. But ayurvedic treatment worked wonders for the boy. His mother massaged his legs and dug up a hole where he would stand for hours and then gradually he started walking, recalls father Shatrughan.        
	The family, minus Sujits mother and one of his sisters, shifted to Calcutta when Sujit was five and he was admitted to a school in Esplanade. His exceptional academic performance got him admission to The Assembly of God Church School in Class VII.        
	The artist in Sujit saw him sketching from Class VI, exhibiting his works in school and winning competitions. He gradually married passion with profit by designing the theme of the Saraswati puja for his para clubs and giving paintings to frame-shops on SN Banerjee Road.        
	What he gets from his artistic endeavours he uses to buy pencils, pads, oil pastel and poster colour. He has also bought a typewriter to open up another avenue of earning. I am working on my speed, he said.        
	But Sujits dream lies not in the keys but on canvas. I want to make a career out of my love for painting.

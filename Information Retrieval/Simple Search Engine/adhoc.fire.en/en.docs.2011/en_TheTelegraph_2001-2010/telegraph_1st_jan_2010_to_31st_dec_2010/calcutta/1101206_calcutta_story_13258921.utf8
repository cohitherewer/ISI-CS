The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Row on result review
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Row on result review
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University has agreed to a special review of the Part I exam results of five Presidency students on vice-chancellor Amita Chatterjees request, inviting criticism from teachers who fear it would open the floodgates for re-evaluation demands.        
	The decision, taken last Friday, came within four days of Presidency students holding their first vice-chancellor to ransom inside her office room for almost three-and-a-half hours.        
	Although provisions for a special review of exam results do exist in the university rule-book, this is the first known instance of the Calcutta University syndicate accepting five applications from one institution for a single exam.         
	The special review will be held in the presence of the chairpersons of the CU boards for the respective subjects. If the five students are dissatisfied with the results of the re-evaluation, the answer scripts will be referred to teachers of those subjects at Presidency.        
	The results of the aggrieved students will be rectified if they have been awarded low marks because of an error at any stage of the evaluation process or when the results were being tabulated, CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das told Metro.        
	He confirmed that the decision was taken on the basis of a written request from vice-chancellor Chatterjee, who took charge of newly-anointed Presidency University barely a month ago.        
	Special reviews are usually held on the basis of appeals of individual students, routed through the heads of institutions. A special review is considered only when a student is not eligible for the normal review, which requires the examinee to score above the stipulated cut-off  higher than the minimum pass marks  in the other subjects.        
	Examiners feel the syndicates decision to allow a special review of the Part I results of five Presidency students at one go would have far-reaching repercussions.        
	The request for a special review seems to have come under duress, which makes it worse. This could encourage the tendency among undeserving students to seek special reviews every time they fail in an exam, an examiner rued.        
	Some suggested that the answer scripts of the five Presidency students be made public if their results remained unchanged after the special review.        
	On November 30, a gaggle of students had barged into vice-chancellor Chatterjees room crying conspiracy over the poor Part I results and demanding a re-evaluation of both honours papers.        
	Calcutta Universitys re-evaluation rules stipulate a single-paper review in Part I.         
	The students also demanded that the university show them their evaluated answer scripts under the Right to Information Act.

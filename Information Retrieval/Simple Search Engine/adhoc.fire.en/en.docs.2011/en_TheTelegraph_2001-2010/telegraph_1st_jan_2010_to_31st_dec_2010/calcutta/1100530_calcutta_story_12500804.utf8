The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | London dreams
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      London dreams
          What if the city really tried to be the British capital, as Mamata Banerjee wishes? Amit Roy answers from London                                    
	Professor Rodney Barker of the London School of Economics, one of Britains leading experts on government, ponders Mamata Banerjees pledge to turn Calcutta into a London  Kolkata ke London kare tulbo.              
	 It is unclear how much research Mamata did before making her promise or indeed how familiar she is with London but her promise is not being dismissed out of hand ahead of todays civil poll.        
	I dont want to give the impression that Britain is saying to the rest of the world, Copy us,  Barker tells The Telegraph with characteristic English modesty in an exclusive interview.         
	Like many others consulted, Barker says: I am sure that there are lessons that London could learn from Calcutta. No city is perfect and every city has aspects to it which are attractive and can teach lessons to other people.        
	 But the politics of the bandh, as frequently practised in Calcutta, would be utterly alien to Londons politicians. Indeed, it would horrify most.        
	Barker, who has written many scholarly books and papers on politics, civil disobedience, propaganda, enmity, rhetoric, identity, ideology and legitimacy, concedes: There are issues on which people will feel particularly strongly, not the result of elections but on the environment, nuclear weapons, where relatively small groups of people will say, Our voices are not being heard and therefore we will take direct action.         What lies beneath            Calcutta Metro has 18 trains, serves 21 stations, is 23 km long and carries 350,000 on a weekday and employs 3,500 people. Services operate from 7am to 10pm and begin on Sundays at 2pm.
  London Underground has over 500 trains, serves 270 stations, is 402km long and carries 3.5m passengers on weekdays. Service begins at 5.15am and the last leaves at 00.20am (23.30 on Sundays).
  In total, Transport for London (TfL), which also looks after buses, employs 28,000 people. There are 6.4 million bus journeys each weekday, 2.2 billion last year, 700 bus routes, 8,500 buses. Night buses run on most main routes.            
	But it is not the sort of direct action of bandh as practised in Bengal, Barker emphasises.  
	It tends to be passive resistance, he explains. You sit in front of the gateway to a nuclear weapons base or, in the case of the guerrilla gardeners, you set up your tent in Parliament Square (for instance, over the Iraq protest), but this is not riotously bringing things to a halt. It is possibly, though not in all cases, breaking the law but breaking the law in an entirely passive way and saying, I am doing this in order to attract the force of the law against me as a dramatic protest.          
	He considers it ironic that Mahatma Gandhi would be more at home in London than in Mamatas Calcutta: Many people in this country who are engaging in passive resistance as a form not of obstruction but of communication would indeed cite the example of India under Gandhi.         
	In general terms, what Mamata wants is probably not radically different from the aims set out by Boris Johnson, the current Tory mayor of London whose task is to provide leadership to the capital. And Johnson has built on the work, much of it commendable, that was done by his Labour predecessor, Ken Livingstone, who served two four-year terms.        
	London is busy, bustling, dirty with litter in areas, suffers still from terrible traffic jams, has pockets of deprivation, is concerned with rising knife crime among the young and, following an exceptionally hard winter, its roads were often more full of pot holes than Calcuttas.            here vs there            Calcutta rsquo;s population is put at 51,38,208, increasing to 10m during the day. London had an official population of 75,56,900 in July 2007 within the boundaries of Greater London, while the Greater London Urban Area had a population of 82,78,251 and the metropolitan area an estimated total population between 12 million and 14 million. 
  The population density of Calcutta is put at 27,462 per sq km, compared with 4,761 per sq km for Greater London. 
  Calcutta had 3,21,800 cars in 2007, while the number in London is over 3m      
	I want to bring out the very best in London  helping its companies to grow, its communities to thrive, and its people to prosper, says Johnson. I want to deliver those changes that Londoners, and visitors to the city tell us they want to see: a cleaner city with safer streets, better transport, and good quality affordable housing. Through this we will create a more civilised society where the creativity, vibrancy, innovation and entrepreneurial talents of Londoners can be developed and nourished -- truly making this the best city in the world.        
	There are 33 London boroughs, including the City of London Corporation. Each borough is managed by a local council that is responsible for administering the borough, and for the on-the-ground delivery of public services such as housing, refuse collection and schools.        
	As the strategic authority for London, the Greater London Assembly works closely with the boroughs to deliver the mayors long-term strategy for London, ensuring that the big picture of the capital is taken into account at the local level. The mayor sets his pan-London vision and strategy and uses his position and influence to ensure that the boroughs help him to deliver on that vision.        
	In most boroughs, the task of clearing rubbish from household bins has been outsourced to firms that wont be paid if the job is not done. A situation like that in Calcutta, where rubbish is allowed to accumulate, does not arise.        
	Politicians cannot get away with arrogant disregard of the wishes of Londoners  partly because of a watchful media.         
	The people are made more aware of what is going on and therefore the politicians have to pay closer attention to popular discontent, more criticism, Barker argues. They have to look over their shoulders more, they have to be more careful of what they are doing, they have to pay more attention to public criticism. The democratic side of democratic government is probably stronger in London precisely because it is the capital city.        
	Of course, Barker acknowledges that London has resources that Mamata wont have.        
	 Thanks to sustained effort, the Thames is now clean enough to attract the return of many varieties of fish and could well be a model for the revival of the Hooghly.        
	It is a rich city  both in money terms and culturally, Barker says of London. If you want an effective public transport system, if you want a clean river, if you want services to run effectively, obviously it helps if you have got rather a lot of money to spend on it. A rich city can do more than a poor city.        
	With a resident population of 7.6m which increases substantially during working hours, London claims to be ethnically the most diverse city in the world. It is a distinct advantage that law-abiding and hard-working people of Indian origin, who number more than 172,000, constitute the biggest ethnic group.        
	To me the most striking thing about London is not an aspect of its governance but an aspect of its social structure, observes Barker. It is an enormously diverse city. It has pretty well every ethnic group, every religion, every national origin, every cuisine in the world which makes it potentially a very exciting and vibrant place to live. To that extent its governance is successful in so far as it responds to that.        
	The maturity of politicians allowed London to defuse the tensions generated by four home- grown Muslim suicide bombers who exploded bombs on the London Underground and on a bus on July 7, 2005, when 52 people were killed and over 700 injured. Despite the rise of the far right British National Party in some parts of East London, racial problems have been largely contained though not entirely resolved.        
	On transport, use of cars is being discouraged in favour of cycling  something that Mamata might wish to examine.        
	London has seen a dramatic rise in the number of people cycling, with a 117 per cent increase on Londons major roads since 2000. It is estimated that there are now around half a million cycle journeys a day across London as a whole.        
	Kulveer Ranger, the mayors transport adviser who is on the board of Transport for London (TfL), says: Placing cycling at the heart of the mayors transport strategy means developing biking boroughs, installing cycle parking where people want it, focussing on safety, improving cyclists behaviour and improving security.        
	Johnson has set out a 10-point pledge to London cyclists in a bid to get thousands more Londoners on their bikes, while TfL is to spend 116m this year on promoting cycling. And soon there will be bikes for hire left scattered all over London.         
	Could this happen in Calcutta?        
	In terms of public transport and getting round the city, interestingly, one of the most successful innovations in public transport or the transport of people in London over the last five or 10 years has been a restriction on motor traffic and an encouragement of bicycles, Barker points out. When under Ken Livingstone congestion charge was introduced so that there was a tax on people who came into central London in motor vehicles, one of the consequences of this which was perhaps not foreseen was not only that motor traffic reduced and so pollution reduced but cycling increased massively and has continued to do so.         
	 He adds: A fashionable thing is to cycle. The fashionable thing is not to have a car. So there is a degree of environmental revolution going on which is making the streets of London more pleasant.        
	In theory, then, there is no reason why politicians should not get out of their Ambassadors and cycle, say, from their homes to Writers Buildings  Johnson and David Cameron, the Prime Minister no less, certainly use their bikes so maybe its not too late for Mamata to squeeze into lycras and truly trigger a revolution. Its a chance for Didi to set a fashion trend.  
	So what do they think of the city turning into London?             
	KEVIN McCOLE
  Chief operating officer with the United Kingdom India Business Council in London, lived in Calcutta for three years, working at the British deputy high commission:
  ldquo;Calcutta, like London, should properly tackle its air pollution. This would improve its quality of life and help make the city more investment-friendly for international businesses. rdquo;             KRISHNA DUTTA
  Author of Calcutta: A Cultural History:
  ldquo;Calcutta is getting dirty and dingy. We are also destroying its skyline. Let us modernise the heritage buildings from inside, but preserve their exteriors. rdquo;            LORD SWRAJ PAUL
   Labour peer; chairman, Caparo; came to London from Calcutta in 1966:
  ldquo;Calcutta and London both have their own charms. The congestion charge in London ( pound;8 for cars entering the city centre during the day) does a fantastic job in reducing traffic jams. It is worth considering for Calcutta, but not without improving public transport.            LORD RAJ BAGRI 
  Conservative peer; chairman, Metdist group of companies, and former chairman, London Metal Exchange: 
  ldquo;Calcutta does not need to copy London, each city has its own character. Calcutta needs a good leadership that will look after the needs of the common man. rdquo;                 SANGEETA DATTA
  Film director, worked in Calcutta on Chokher Bali and Brick Lane and directed part of her own Life Goes On in the city: 
  ldquo;You need a better civic sense mdash; this means no bandhs. The bus and tram services need to improve vastly. There should be beautification of open spaces and green patches. Rejuvenate the Strand and other heritage buildings. Make the city safe for women at night. rdquo;            INDAR PASRICHA 
  Whose gallery Indar Pasricha Fine Arts, near Selfridges, currently has an exhibition of Calcutta flowers painted onto china plates by artist Jonathan Heale:
  ldquo;Calcutta is a city of great style. Its heritage should be preserved. The Botanical Gardens should be beautified and its museums better maintained. rdquo;

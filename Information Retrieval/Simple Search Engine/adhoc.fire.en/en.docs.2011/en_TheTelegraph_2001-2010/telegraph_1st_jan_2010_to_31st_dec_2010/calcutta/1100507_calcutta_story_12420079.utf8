	The Aspen Institute India on Thursday announced the launch of its city chapter at a programme at a city hotel which was attended by governor M.K. Narayanan.        
	Aspen Institute India was set up by the Confederation of Indian Industry through an agreement with Aspen USA which gives access to all Aspen US trainers, faculty, and methodology for use in India, said Tarun Das, the former chief mentor of the CII and president of Aspen Institute India.        
	The Aspen Institute India is a non-profit organisation dedicated to in-depth discussion of issues, development of value-based leadership and exchange of opinions, information and ideas.        
	In Calcutta, Aspen Institute India has drawn up a plan to focus on a series of events in the area of Indias international relations with special reference to the impact on business, industry, economy and globalisation. We expect to organise our next event in July, he added.

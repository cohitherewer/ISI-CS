The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Deafening devotion
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Deafening devotion
										      Autumn Flush                                          
	On August 15, the familiar growls of mike-testing (Hullo hullo hullo) in our para began early. One or two renderings of Jana Gana Mana and Sare jahaan se achchha followed.         
	The volume was then turned up to maximum via giant amplifiers atop various buildings and electric columns to produce surround sound as supporters of political parties made speeches, for the next two or three hours. When they exhorted listeners to say Jai Hind the response, if it was there at all, was drowned by the hum of the mike.         
	Since the speakers, doing several roadside meetings each through the morning, were sometimes late turning up we were treated to conveniently canned Hindi cinema patriotica: Sabarmati ke sant tu ne kar diya kamal, Mere desh ki dharti sona ugle ugle hire moti..., Aye mere vatan ke logon, and the shrill little boy voice doing: Nanna munna rahi hun, desh ka sipahi hun...        
	With almost no break there began what is now described as a reality show, where tuneless voices karaoke with canned music, and more canned music to which the local belles danced. Patriotism now forgotten, there were audible whistles and applause for more (and more) popular songs and dances.         
	The elderly, the sick and babies could do without their afternoon rest. I think of them with compassion: also of students preparing for exams and the loneliness and despair of students trying to write a thesis in this extreme form of celebration. These sounds are repeated at the same decibel level for Republic Day and the anniversaries of various Gandhis.         
	The thirteen festivals in twelve months reputed to be the Bengalis lot get similar treatment. Add to these Navratri Jagaran and days and nights of devotion (?) to the matas made popular by the Hindi cinema: Sheravali, Santoshi and Bhawani. Chalo bulava aaya hai, mata ne bulaya hai..., not to mention Tarakeshwars very own Bhola Baba. Music for each of them comes conveniently canned into cassettes and discs along with strange devotional parodies of all-time cinema hits. One goes: Mata ke dil mein kya hai mata ke dil me. Can one meditate on the mata without thoughts of Madhuri Dikshits original seductive choli number?        
	Christmas in central Calcutta comes with its own pandal, illuminations and HC music; at the end of a long line of tuni bulbs you will reach a Krishnagar model of the Christ child in a manger complete with Mary, Joseph and charming cows.         
	St Patricks Day is celebrated with a 100-member band that goes through the streets and lanes surrounding the Salvation Army Hostel: more decibels and the vision of foreigners dancing in the streets to Hindi cinema tunes. Guru Nanaks birthday is celebrated by a prabhat pheri (amplifiers and crackers here too) at what feels like dead of night.        
	Each of the many mosques dotting our area is permanently equipped with public address systems and nearby the faithful also play HC canned music loudly.         
	Kabir was on the button when he said: Masjid upar mullah pukare/kya Sahib tera behra hai? /Chinti ke pag nevar bandhe/ so bhi Sahib sunta hai. (The Lord is not deaf. He can even hear a bell tied to the foot of an ant!)         
	Unexposed to public address systems, the godpersons, the sants and matas, the political leaders of times gone by are not deaf. Neither are we but senior citizens are in grave danger of terminal hearing problems. These piercing public address systems supplied cheaply by your friendly neighbourhood decorator or electrician will continue to belt out appropriate or inappropriate music at decibels that should make the pollution control board squirm.         
	Perhaps the honourable finance minister could place a tax on the buying and successive hirings-out of such systems to boost the nations depleted coffers. Would the police and the pollution control board be deaf to our request for less ear-splitting noise?

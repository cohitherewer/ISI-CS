                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Party veterans bank on Youngistan

	Ayan Ghosh was rushing out of his Kasba home on Wednesday to meet his friends when he noticed a group of men and women with flags and banners at his doorstep. Calling out to his mother to take care of the poll campaigners, the BSc second-year- student tried to edge past them. But he suddenly stopped in his tracks and turned back  in the group was one of his college seniors.         
	Political parties are going all out to woo the young voter, banking not just on time-tested electoral promises but also on the familiarity factor. Thus enter leaders of students unions and party youth wings.         
	A member of the SFI said the CPM bosses had given them a list of 20 priority wards where the fight would be intense. We are preparing a database of students living in these localities. While campaigning we bring in SFI activists from those colleges whose students live in the area, he said. A known face from college helps capture the interest of a student voter, the young leader explained.

	But he wouldnt divulge the numbers of the 20 wards. In the civic polls, at times the margin is as little as five or 10 votes. So every vote counts, he smiled.        
	While the SFI is banking on door-to-door campaigns, the Trinamul Congress has fielded two members of its student wing Trinamul Chhatra Parishad (TCP) as candidates for the May 30 poll. Their presence has ensured the participation of youth activists in the poll campaign in large numbers.         
	We go and meet people in their homes. Though civic problems are the thrust of the campaign, we also talk about student issues, said Dhrubajyoti Chakraborty, the secretary of the Calcutta district committee of the SFI.         
	The student leaders accompany the candidates on the campaign trail and also visit the wards separately. While speaking to the youngsters we hope to convince the families of the students too, said an SFI leader.         
	Matters are much the same in the rival camps. We asked our unit committees in the colleges to prepare a list of students and the areas they live in. Based on it, we are sending text messages to the students asking them to vote for the Trinamul candidates in their particular ward, said Sushanta Ghosh, a TCP leader and Trinamul candidate from ward 107.         
	Fellow TCP member Mohit Sarkar is contesting the polls from ward 34.         
	Sometimes a band of college students draped in party colours belt out songs on the campaign trail.         
	In the Congress camp, its youth wing Chhatra Parishad has formed a campaign committee steered by college students.         
	We received instructions from the party high command that students must play the most important role in street corner meetings for Congress candidates ahead of the civic polls, said Sourav Chakrabarty, the state president of the Chhatra Parishad.         
	Leaders of the parent parties are happy with the youth brigades helping hand. If SFI activists can contribute to the poll campaign, so be it. After all, the college election results showed that the student community still supports us, said Mohammad Salim of the CPM.

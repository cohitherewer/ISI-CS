The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lalbazar voice alert at shop stops
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Lalbazar voice alert at shop stops
          OUR BUREAU                                          Forum on Elgin Road. A Telegraph picture      
	The voice of Lalbazar will soon echo through the corridors of crowded malls and multiplexes.        
	After months of soft-pedalling, the citys police force is set to launch an integrated awareness announcement system at these popular hangouts around town to underline the need for Calcuttans on the move to be more vigilant about security issues.        
	This system would enable cops sitting in the Lalbazar police headquarters to speak directly to shoppers and cinemagoers through loudspeakers installed there.        
	This move was initiated as a part of stepped-up security measures. We will deliver the awareness messages with the help of a newly installed computerised system. If people keep hearing these messages frequently, it will definitely help increase awareness levels, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police, headquarters.        
	According to Vineet Goyel, the joint commissioner of police, Special Task Force (STF), the announcement system has already been installed at Satyanarayan Market in Burrabazar and AC Market on Theatre Road, where the trial run has begun. We will cover at least 45 markets and multiplexes gradually, said Goyel.        
	What prompted Lalbazar to make the mall move? We often receive general alert messages from the Intelligence Bureau (IB) that terrorists may strike at soft targets like malls. We then convey the messages to all the shopping malls, who step up security. But they do not make security awareness announcements through loudspeakers. So, we have decided to initiate this move for the sake of safety and security, said an officer.        
	Are the malls ready to blare out Lalbazar lines? We were told about this months ago when some officers came for an inspection and said they would be back with a device. We are ready to install it as we already have an internal public address system through which we play music and make announcements. We are just awaiting instructions, said Ujjal, the general manager of Forum Projects.        
	South City, though, is clueless about the cop move. We havent received any intimation from Lalbazar. We have our own announcement system to reach out to shoppers in case of an emergency but the new system would need proper technical planning, said Man Mohan Bagree, the vice-president of South City Projects.         
	Cops will also start paying visits to hangouts that have been told to take special measures, from deploying private security personnel at parking lots to keeping an eye on the monitors of closed-circuit televisions.        
	We will urge them to follow the basic security arrangements. If any mall does not follow the guideline, we will be forced to take action, said Shamim.  
	Safety first  
	MESSAGES will be stored in a master computer  
	CLICK of the mouse will pick and play a message  
	ANNOUNCEMENTS will range from lsquo;do not touch unclaimed articles rsquo; to lsquo;inform police about any suspicious movement rsquo;
    
	LOUDSPEAKERS at the mall will convey the messages

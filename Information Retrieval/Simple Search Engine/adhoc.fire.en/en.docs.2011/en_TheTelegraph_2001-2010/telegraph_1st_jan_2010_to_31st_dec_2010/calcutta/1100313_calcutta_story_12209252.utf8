                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      All-girl game after big boys play
          SHRADHA AGARWAL                          T20 F-SHOW: A Manish Malhotra look that will be on the Sunday night ramp in town. (Pabitra Das)                                           
	Welcome to the KKR fashion week, spread over five weeks. On each of the seven Eden match nights  from March 14 to April 19  the action will shift from the stadium pitch to the hotel ramp.        
	Starring the likes of designer Manish Malhotra or Anamika Khanna and model Candice Pinto or Sonalika Sahay, the exclusive fashion shows will be put together by star couple Arjun and Mehr Rampal.        
	As big boys play at night, it will be a girls-only show. Arjun and Mehr have specified that it will be an out-and-out glamorous all-women show; no celebrity showstoppers and no male models, Manish Malhotra told Metro from Mumbai.        
	This is to please all the men, laughed Arjun. (Just when you were thinking IPL was not a mans-only world!)        
	The ramp action begins on Sunday when Souravs Kolkata Knight Riders clashes with Kumbles Royal Challengers Bangalore. Match over, the party (and the stars led by Shah Rukh Khan) moves from Eden Gardens to ITC The Sonar Calcutta where Bollywoods favourite designer Manish Malhotra showcases his summer-resort line.        
	But why marry fashion and cricket? Film is already a big part and fashion seemed like the natural extension to brand IPL. Its a stylish end to the days proceedings, said Arjun.        
	The actor and his wife will be steering all 54 post-match fashion shows, for which 45 designers  a mix of emerging and established  were handpicked by Mehr, a former supermodel. The big names at the non-Calcutta venue include Manish Arora, Tarun Tahiliani and Rocky S.        
	For the seven city matches, Manish on Sunday apart, theres Kallol Datta on March 16, Dev R Nil on April 1, Kallol again on April 4, Anamika Khanna on April 7, Prashant Verma on April 17 and Anamika again on April 19.        
	The look and feel of the shows will be fun. Its essentially clubwear so the mood will be relaxed and spirited. The music, hair, make-up, choreography, set and light design, will be all fun, said Mehr.        
	It will be a very entertaining show  colourful and cocktailwear, promised city boys Dev and Nil.        
	These shows are part of the IPL Club Lounge experience that includes after-parties and game zones.

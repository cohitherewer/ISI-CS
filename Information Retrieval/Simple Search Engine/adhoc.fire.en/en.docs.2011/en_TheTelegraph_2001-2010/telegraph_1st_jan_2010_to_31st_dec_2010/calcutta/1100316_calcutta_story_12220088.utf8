The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traffic plan for terminal
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Traffic plan for terminal
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Cars drop passengers at the domestic terminal on Monday. A lane has been demarcated with black and white cement slabs. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                   
	Vehicles approaching the domestic terminal of the airport would be channelled into lanes from Tuesday to prevent traffic congestion.         
	No car would be allowed to park outside the arrival gate of the domestic terminal. Many cars stop outside the gate to allow fliers to get off and unload their luggage. This creates congestion, said an airport official.         
	Fliers on their way into the domestic terminal would have to be dropped outside its two departure gates. The vehicles would not be allowed to proceed to the arrival gate. They would be diverted towards the parking lot and the VIP Road exit.                    
	Vehicles approaching the terminal would be divided into four lanes [see graphic]. We expect the new system will reduce traffic congestion, said R. Srinivasan, the airport director.        
	Till late on Monday, only one of the lanes  the one closest to the terminal  had been demarcated. The rest of the lanes are expected to be marked and the new system put in place by the end of the week, according to airport officials.         
	Under the plan, the two lanes closest to the terminal would be reserved for cars that come to drop fliers. Lane 3 is for the air-conditioned buses that were recently introduced from the airport.        
	Cars that come to pick up fliers would take Lane 4 to the parking lot.        
	A shed would be built on the first row of the car park for prepaid taxis, said Srinivasan.        
	The preliminary plan suggests that passengers arriving at the domestic terminal would have to walk to the buses or the car park.        
	It has been observed that some fliers take a lot of time to load their luggage in their cars outside the arrival gate, creating a long queue of vehicles. This would not happen in the new system, said an official.         
	The area outside the terminal gates should be clear through the day. Cars should not be allowed to stand outside the gates. The existing practice is inconvenient for passengers, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	A private agency would manage traffic near the airport and ensure that the new rules are followed, said an airport official.        
	The agencys services are needed as a number of diversions have to be created as part of the Rs 2,100crore modernisation project of the airport that is currently underway, he added.

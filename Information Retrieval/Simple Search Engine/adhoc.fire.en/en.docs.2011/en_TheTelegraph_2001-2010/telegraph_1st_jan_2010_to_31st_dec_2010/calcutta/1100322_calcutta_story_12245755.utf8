The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops struggle to quiz minor
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops struggle to quiz minor
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four days after two Class IV girls of a Bansdroni school died after eating tiffin, sleuths are still clueless about how to approach the suspect, a classmate of the duo.         
	It is a strange case where the suspect is a nine-year-old girl. We cannot simply arrest and interrogate her as we usually do. Our officers are struggling to question her. We dont want to frighten the little girl, admitted a senior officer of South 24-Parganas police.        
	A preliminary post-mortem has confirmed that Payal Pandey and Jyoti Singh died of poisoning on March 18. The chemical composition of the contents found inside the victims stomach is close to that of pesticides. But we are yet to ascertain the chemical, said a doctor of Katapukur morgue.         
	Officers visited the suspects home on Sunday after Jyotis father lodged a complaint against her. The cops took her statement and asked her to identify the handwriting on some pieces of paper, said the girls uncle. He said one of the papers said Payal tum mere group me aa jaao (Payal, join my group) while the other said Jyoti tum mere paas chali aao (Jyoti, come to me).         
	An officer said the girl denied writing the two notes or giving the duo anything to eat. The girl said she was with her sister in another room when Payal and Jyoti were eating tiffin, he added. The police had earlier quoted the girl as saying that she was drawing a picture during recess.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trees cut at NRS
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Trees cut at NRS

	At least 19 large trees have been cut down in the NRS Medical College and Hospital compound in Sealdah. Laxmikanta Ghosh, the medical superintendent of the hospital, said the trees were being cut to beautify a pond after obtaining permission from the forest department. But hospital sources said the trees were being hacked to create space for a facility for patients. The foundation stone for the project was laid by health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra in end-March.         
	The sources also said the pond was being drained out using a noisy and smoke-belching generator, between 4pm and 6am for the past seven days, flouting pollution norms.         
	More than 19 trees have been hacked. I have lodged a complaint with the forest department and Entally police station, environment activist Subhash Dutta told Metro.

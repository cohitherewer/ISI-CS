The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wanted: a few good women
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wanted: a few good women
          ZEESHAN JAWED                                            
	Wanted: Women keen on a career in politics        
	Requisites: Good academic record, amiable personality and ability to strike a chord with voters        
	Apply by: April 2010        
	If you are female, 25 and above, educated and even mildly popular, you neednt even apply  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee or Mamata Banerjees men could soon be at your door with a ticket to politics.        
	Such is the scurry for  and shortage of  worthy women willing to take the political plunge that almost every party has launched a door-to-door campaign to scout for candidates before they step out to seek votes for the civic elections, due in May.        
	The top leadership wants the names of 47 suitable women candidates for the municipal elections by next month. But where do we find them? We have been going from door to door but to no avail, said a Trinamul Congress leader entrusted with the task of drawing up a list of potential candidates in the Burrabazar belt.         
	The Election Commission made it mandatory in 2005 to reserve one-third of the wards under municipal corporations for women.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation election under the one-third reservation rule that year, however, saw several puppet candidates being fielded in 47 of the 141 wards.        
	A Congress leaders wife from Kidderpore was among those fielded  and elected  but very few in the area have since seen her step out of the house. I wouldnt even recognise her now, said a resident of the locality.        
	A Trinamul leader in central Calcutta continues to give interviews to reporters on his wifes behalf, who is the local councillor. The CPM woman councillor of a reserved ward is more often spotted at parties than in her office.        
	In 2005, we barely had the time to select candidates. But this being the second election since the one-third reservation rule came into force, every party is seriously looking for good women candidates, explained a CPM leader.        
	So if all three major parties in the fray  the CPM, Trinamul and Congress  are to adhere to the reservation rule in letter and spirit, the city would need to throw up at least 141 women candidates before the process of nominations begins for the elections.        
	Starting with ward No. 1, every third constituency is reserved for women. But sources said there were hardly 41 eligible  and willing  women candidates to choose from.        
	If we fail to find quality candidates, the sitting male councillors will wrest the reserved wards for their wives, sisters-in-law or other relatives. That will be such a shame. I think we are paying the price for not encouraging educated women to look at politics as a career, said a CPM councillor in Borough IV.        
	At this rate, it will be years before the city sees another Mamata Banerjee or even a Brinda Karat emerging. Some may argue that is not such a bad thing, but that is a different debate.        
	We are still a male-dominated society where women are not given the opportunities they deserve. But we have a strong womens wing (the Ganatantrik Mahila Samity). We are trying to select the best candidates possible, said Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, the CPM councillor from Watgunge.        
	The Trinamul Congress Mahila Samity, headed by Aparna Niyogi, has almost no organisational structure in the city, while the CPM womens cell has active members in pockets but is thin in wards in the Burrabazar area and parts of south Calcutta.        
	Sources said several women matching the profile of a councillor had turned down offers from parties to contest the civic polls. The standard response is: Politics is not my cup of tea.        
	Most women perceive politics as a dirty game from which they cannot emerge with their reputation intact, no matter what. Its so untrue, complained a Trinamul leader.         
	Given the shortage, most parties might ultimately resort to shuffling candidates to enable sitting women councillors to shift to the reserved wards.         
	Dont blame us if the girlfriend of a sitting male councillor gets a ticket this time, said a member of one such selection committee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain relief hope from swelter
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rain relief hope from swelter
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Relief from the swelter is in sight with the weatherman predicting rain in the city and its neighbourhood on Friday.        
	According to meteorologists, a low pressure trough extending from north-east Jharkhand to north-east Assam across Gangetic Bengal, with an embedded upper-air cyclonic circulation over north-east Jharkhand, will aid the formation of a cloud cover over south Bengal.        
	The low-pressure trough has so far been pushing up the humidity level in south Bengal without aiding the formation of thunderclouds. The cyclonic circulation will provide the necessary trigger, said the weatherman.        
	Rain or thundershowers in and around the city are likely in the next 24 hours. If it rains, the temperature could fall three to four degrees Celsius, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Thursday remained as uncomfortable as the rest of the week. An evening drizzle failed to provide relief.        
	The humidity ranged between 67 and 89 per cent. The minimum humidity is around 17 per cent above normal, said an official of the India Meteorological Department, Delhi. The minimum temperature was four degrees above normal at 29.7 degrees Celsius.         
	The difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures on Thursday was 5.4 degrees. That means the temperature practically did not dip below the 30-degree mark even around 2.30am, when the city is usually the coolest, said the official.

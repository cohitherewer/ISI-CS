          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Bad weather and a snag forced passengers of an Air India Express flight to spend over 17 hours at Calcutta airport since Sunday night.         
	The low-cost carriers Bangkok-Calcutta-Dhaka flight arrived in the city at 10.35pm, delayed by over two hours. The flight, with 178 passengers on board, could not take off for Dhaka at night because of poor visibility there, said an Air India official.         
	On Monday, low visibility in Dhaka again delayed take-off and altercations broke out between airline officials and the fliers, who were not provided accommodation.         
	Around 11.45am, the Dhaka weather improved and passengers boarded the flight. But at noon the pilot detected a snag in the auxiliary power unit of the aircraft.        
	The fliers were again taken to the lounge. After four hours, the airline decided to take them to hotels. The flight took off soon after, at 4.20pm.

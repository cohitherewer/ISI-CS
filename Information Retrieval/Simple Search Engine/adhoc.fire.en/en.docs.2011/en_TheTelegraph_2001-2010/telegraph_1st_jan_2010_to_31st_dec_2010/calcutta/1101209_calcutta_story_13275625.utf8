BHATTACHARYA                          Neil MacGregor, in the city on Tuesday. Picture by Aranya Sen                                        
	He had touched the Rosetta Stone at the British Museum, one of the largest in the world, for the first time when he was six. Almost six decades later the stone still seems touched with magic for Neil MacGregor, now the iconic director of the museum.        
	He was in the city on Tuesday to visit the Indian Museum and meet the governor as part of the Indo-UK exchange following the MoU on culture signed by David Cameron and Manmohan Singh.        
	An object at a museum, MacGregor says, is inlaid with inscriptions, with histories, not necessarily of the West. The stone is a literal embodiment of this. Of a great deal of historys ironies too, of the absurd patterns of conquering armies crawling over time. Of the oneness of the world. The Rosetta Stone from ancient Egypt, on which a decree is inscribed three times, in hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek, was a key to the understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphics.        
	For MacGregor, the stone, a symbol of the Greek invasion of Egypt, is equally remarkable for the way it landed in London. Napoleons army discovered it in 1799 near the town of el-Rashid (Rosetta). But Napoleon was defeated, and the stone became the property of the British and has been a resident at the British Museum since 1802.         
	A text remains what it essentially is. But an object, a thing, becomes different through movement and time, says McGregor animatedly, at a private dinner in the city on Tuesday.                          
	If the Rosetta Stone can do it, so can a broken bit of crockery. From a few pieces of crockery from Tanzania, around the year 1100, it is evident that the same house was using porcelain from China, from the Gulf, and from East Africa, a result of a trade network spread across the Indian Ocean, long before the Europeans took over the seas.         
	A museum preserves such routes through time. And an object, a very ordinary one, equalises the world.         
	The art historian, who was director of UKs National Gallery before he assumed office at the British Museum in 2002, turned the museum around from a loss-making institution to Britains top cultural attraction. He earned the name Saint Neil. MacGregor is reputed to have transformed the British Museum, got the footfalls, without the common surrender of culture to the temporal forces of politics or money.         
	Because he adheres to the old idea of the museum, the idea on which the British Museum is founded, an extraordinary dream, something he likes to talk about.        
	The British Museum was established in 1753, by an Act of Parliament, he stresses, as an open university, free of charge, for all studious and curious persons. It is a pre-imperial idea of engaging with the outer world, says MacGregor. The museum was to make a new citizen, an Enlightenment ideal.         
	His personal life is quite extraordinary, too. He refused to head the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, as it was not a free institution. He refused knighthood. He left law school to study art.        
	At the British Museum, he has brought exhibitions from China, Iraq and Iran. Two upcoming exhibitions are Afghanistan: Crossroads of the Ancient World and Treasures of Heaven: saints, relics and devotion in medieval Europe. This summer an Indian collection had travelled to Shanghai.        
	MacGregor has to his credit a very successful series on BBC Radio 4 called A History of the World in 100 Objects, which includes the Tanzanian crockery, found on Kilwa Kiswani, an island off Tanzania.        
	He has tried to resurrect the original idea at his museum in this new age, and he thinks all museums should aspire to it. Every community living in Britain now has something it can claim as its own at the museum. Every object at the British Museum has a native supporter, he says, including Bengalis.         
	We cant suppress the word global any more.         
	But can a museum have the same function in India?         
	He says he knows very little about India. This was his first visit to the city, to which he will return in February. I dont know what a museum can do in India. A museum is a space where the community can think of itself, he says.

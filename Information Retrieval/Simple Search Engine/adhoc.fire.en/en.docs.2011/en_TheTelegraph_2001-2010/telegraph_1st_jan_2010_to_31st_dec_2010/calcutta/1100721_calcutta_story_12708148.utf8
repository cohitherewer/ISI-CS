                      Cooking up a storm                    More than just a cookbook, Miss Masala is an essential, handbag-sized companion that fuses irresistible Indian recipes with a quirky and evocative narrative. Specially intended for women on the go, it is full of delicious, easy-to-prepare recipes and handy tips to make ethnic cooking an effortless part of a glamorous goddess lifestyle. It is also a book in which Bollywood finally meets Sex and the City  alongside easy instructions for making succulent Ceylon chicken or the best shammi kebabs, author Mallika Basu (who lives in central London and is a director in one of the UKs leading PR agencies) also shares witty anecdotes about her high-flying city life and gives useful hints on how to cook a jalfrezi and still head to the bar an hour later without reeking of eau de curry. Anyone who aspires to the job, the image, the parties, and still wants to whip up a meal for friends and bask in the reflected glory should be clamouring for a copy. As promised by its title, this book offers real Indian cooking for busy city living! Beautifully designed with rich colours, scrapbook-style internals and lavish finishes, this stunning and utterly desirable book can also be the perfect gift for women everywhere, although most girls will want to keep it for themselves. This evening percussionist Bickram Ghosh will release the book, to be followed by a discussion session (participants: the author, Bickram Ghosh and Doel Basu) on Blog to Book: Personal Adventures with Indian Cuisine.

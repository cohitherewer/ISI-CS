The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sip on wine before screen time
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sip on wine before screen time
  - Coming up, first multiplex bar in a metro for feel-good factor amp; flashback          PRIYANKA ROY                                                  
	City partygoers have had a 2am curfew clamped on them, but city cinegoers can now sip wine or take a swig of beer before a movie show and during the interval.        
	For, later this month, Calcutta will become the first metro to have a bar in a multiplex, with Fame (South City) poised to serve it up for its Gold Class patrons.        
	A series of dipstick surveys conducted among Calcutta consumers showed a receptive audience, eager to experience innovation in the movie-going experience, says Rishi Negi, the chief operating officer of Fame, explaining why Calcutta is the chosen one. Also, we managed to obtain the liquor licence first here.        
	A patron will, however, not be allowed to carry his glass into the audi because the plex authorities dont want anything to dilute the movie-going experience. PVR Indore is the only other multiplex in the country to list liquor on its menu.        
	The first-at-Calcutta move has also been spurred by the bid to relive the nostalgia of the single-screen culture. In the Calcutta of the 1970s, one walked into a film after downing a drink at the bars housed in Lighthouse and Globe. We want to create a similar atmosphere at Fame, says Negi.        
	This is one blast from the past the likes of percussionist Bickram Ghosh welcome. As a kid, I remember going to watch a film with my father where he would have a drink at the cinema bar before the show. It just added to the entire experience.        
	Limited to the Gold Class patrons at the moment, the Mumbai-based plex chain reveals that the bar will stock limited but premium offerings at affordable prices. Wine and beer are ideal complements to a laidback experience like movie-viewing, says Negi.        
	Positioning the innovation as an experiential add-on, Fame, however, is aware that where there is alcohol, there may be trouble. Every precaution will be taken to keep the plex family-friendly. The idea is not to get people drunk, but to ensure that movie goers have more to look forward to, says Negi.        
	Software engineer and Bollywood buff Damini Joshi is all smiles, already. I can boast about this to my cousins in the US.

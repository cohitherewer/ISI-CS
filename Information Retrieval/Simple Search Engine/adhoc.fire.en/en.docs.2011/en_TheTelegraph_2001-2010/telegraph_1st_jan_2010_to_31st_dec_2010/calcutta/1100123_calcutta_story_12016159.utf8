The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Principals in poll code bind
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Principals in poll code bind
        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	The principals of city colleges are caught between the government and Calcutta University (CU), each blaming the other for not framing rules to prevent campus violence.        
	The CPM-backed All Bengal Principals Council, alarmed by the recent spate of violence over student union elections, has requested the government as well as the university to frame a uniform code for conducting such polls.        
	The principals feel the code  specifying a common date and eligibility and campaign criteria for conducting the polls in all colleges  could minimise chances of violence.        
	But neither the Left Front government nor the university whose policy-making bodies are packed with Left sympathisers seems willing to act on the college heads plea.        
	The higher education department has washed its hands of the issue, saying problems related to the governance of state-aided colleges have to be addressed by the affiliating university.        
	CU officials, on the other hand, claim that their statutes prevent any intervention in the administration of the affiliated colleges.        
	Governance of the colleges is looked after by their governing bodies. Our rules do not allow us to interfere in the internal matter of any college unless there is a specific complaint, said CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.        
	A higher education department official, however, pointed out on condition of anonymity that CU, being an autonomous body, was free to frame or amend rules.        
	Students will suffer the most if something is not done immediately to prevent violence, said Anjan Sengupta, the general secretary of the principals council.        
	According to an assessment of the council, the spiral of violence, following the success of the Congress-Trinamul Congress combine in the last Lok Sabha elections, would continue till the Assembly elections in 2011 unless the uniform code is framed.        
	Now, students union elections are held according to the rules set by the governing bodies of individual colleges. The rules are changed every now and then in favour of the ruling group in the governing body and the students union. This often leads to clashes between rival student groups.        
	In many cases, the violence is triggered by outsiders mobilised by the parties. The strategy will lose its teeth if the polls are held on a single day in all colleges, said the principal of a south Calcutta college.        
	Asutosh College, Behala College, Srish Chandra College, Manindra College, Sarsuna College, Surendranath College and St Pauls College are among the institutions where students had clashed in the past few months.

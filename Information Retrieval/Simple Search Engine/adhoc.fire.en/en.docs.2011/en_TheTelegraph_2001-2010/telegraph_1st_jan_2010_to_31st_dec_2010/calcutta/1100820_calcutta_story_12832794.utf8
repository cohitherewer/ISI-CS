The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Missing: key cog in civic wheel
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Missing: key cog in civic wheel
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                            
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has a jumbo advisory board to chart its future but no borough committee to steer its present.         
	Mamata Banerjees busy schedule and her insistence on handpicking the whos who of the civic body is being blamed by insiders for the two-month delay in forming the borough committees, leaving the CMC without the cogs in the civic wheel that carry out most development and maintenance functions.        
	A borough office not functioning even two months after the formation of the board is unprecedented. The casualties include the routine pre-festive season repairs and several ongoing projects, said a senior officer at the CMC headquarters.        
	Although the convention is to form the committees after the first meeting of the new civic board, Team Trinamul has failed to do so even after three meetings.        
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee blamed technicalities for the delay. Some wards in the Jadavpur area needed to be swapped between two boroughs. The proposal had to be first passed by the mayoral council and then ratified at the monthly meeting of the civic board. The process took around five weeks. Then it was time to prepare the revised budget, he claimed.        
	The 15 borough committees are responsible for everything from road repair and removal of garbage to the upkeep of parks and implementation of immunisation programmes. But with the borough offices still empty, hardly any major civic project has been cleared, let alone implemented, over the past two months.        
	The CMC usually starts giving the streets a fresh topping of asphalt and touches up the parks and playgrounds before the start of the Ramazan month. In the slums, damaged toilets are repaired and water supply is improved. But such initiatives are almost missing this time, said a councillor.        
	At this rate  Mamata is supposed to choose the borough chairpersons, just as she picked the advisory committee members  the CMC might even miss its Puja date with repairs and renovation.        
	Even if the boroughs start working from September, any project file wouldnt receive the green signal from the headquarters before two months, warned an official.        
	The headless borough has left many stumped. I have never faced such a dilemma in my 24 years with the CMC. There is nobody to take a policy decision on development issues. We cant even draw up a scheme for maintenance of an existing facility, complained an executive engineer of one of the boroughs.        
	He said several schemes were lined up for a post-poll launch with the Rs 25 crore allotted to each borough by the previous board, but the new board has stalled the process.         
	It doesnt make sense, the mayor had said of the Rs 25-crore allotment to every borough as part of a plan to decentralise civic infrastructure development and maintenance.        
	Chatterjee presented a revised budget for 2010-11 last week.        
	Left Front leaders have accused the Trinamul board of being averse to decentralising civic activities because the civic headquarters would really be run from 30B Harish Chatterjee Street. Sources in the Trinamul board admitted that only Mamata could decide the composition of the borough committees.        
	The formation of these committees is getting delayed because our leader is busy, from Lalgarh to Parliament, said a party leader.        
	Mayoral council member (roads and engineering) Firhad Bobby Hakim denied that the delay had slammed the brakes on development and maintenance. During this period, several proposals for maintenance from borough executive engineers have been cleared from the central budget, he insisted.        
	Engineers and Opposition councillors contested the claim. The councillors local area development fund (Rs 5 lakh annually) is now the only money available for borough development, said Rupa Bagchi, the leader of the Opposition in the CMC.

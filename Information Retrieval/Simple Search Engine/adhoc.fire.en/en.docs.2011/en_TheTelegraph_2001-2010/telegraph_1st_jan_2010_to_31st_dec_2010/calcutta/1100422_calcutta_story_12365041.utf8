The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Peeved over Presidency
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Peeved over Presidency
  - Teachers bloc threatens to slip out of Alimuddin clutches          MITA MUKHERJEE                                    
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees move to bulldoze opposition in the path to Presidency Colleges unitary university status has split the CPM-controlled West Bengal Government College Teachers Association with members demanding freedom from party control.        
	Our legitimate protests against the decision on Presidency College was forcefully muzzled by the Alimuddin Street. We do not want to have anything to do with the party, said a key official of the 1,300-member body of teachers from 35 government colleges.        
	The association was against Bhattacharjees decision to grant unitary university status to Presidency College but the chief minister managed to push it through with the backing of the party.        
	Now, the threat to distance itself from the ruling CPM is being seen as yet another hurdle to slow down the chief minister. As a first step, at least half-a-dozen members of the associations executive committee (EC)  including two party members  have resigned their posts taking responsibility for their failure to stop the governments move.        
	The association has also decided to dissolve the elected EC and advance the polls for its highest decision-making body from January 2011 to May 2010.        
	Though the associations call for freedom from its clutches may rattle the party  preparing for the civic polls next month and the Assembly elections in 2011  this arm-twisting technique is unlikely to derail Presidencys upgrade.        
	The bill has been cleared by the Assembly and preparations have started to make it a centre of excellence. These political moves will have no impact on the process, said an education department official.        
	The association members, however, were determined to convey their displeasure to the party and the six EC members resigned in the past few weeks, under pressure from members of the association. The new EC will take charge after the elections. Unlike in the past, the committee will not take orders from Alimuddin, claimed an association member.        
	Shyamal Basak, the general secretary of the association and also a senior teacher of Presidency College, was the first to submit his resignation earlier this month. Debashis Sarkar, former secretary of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education and a present senior faculty member of Maulana Azad College, and four others later resigned from the EC.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      8-year-old boy run over
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An eight-year-old boy was run over by a luxury bus while it was reversing on Suren Sarkar Road in Beleghata on Tuesday afternoon, sparking mob fury and a 30-minute roadblock.         
	Dulal Ram, who sustained severe head and chest injuries, was rushed to Nil Ratan Sircar Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.        
	The driver was arrested and the vehicle impounded.        
	According to police, the child was standing right behind the bus when it started reversing. The driver did not realise that he had hit the boy till he heard shrieks from pedestrians and local traders. The driver then jumped out of the bus and tried to flee but was caught by bystanders.        
	A mob threw stones at the bus and beat up the driver before cops rescued him. Residents later put up a roadblock alleging that the police have been unable to control rash driving in the area.         
	Drowned: The body of 17-year-old Raghunathpur resident Siddharth Talukdar was found floating in a local pond early on Tuesday. The teenager had gone swimming in the pond on Monday evening after a game of football with friends.        
	According to police, Siddharthas friends had claimed that they had no clue about what happened to him after they dived into the pond, known in the area as Kelopukur.        
	The boy, a resident of an apartment block, had headed for football practice soon after returning from school, said a relative.        
	An unnatural death case was registered and the body sent for post-mortem. Only after getting the post-mortem report would we be able to ascertain if it was a case of homicide or suicide, said an officer of Baguiati police station.

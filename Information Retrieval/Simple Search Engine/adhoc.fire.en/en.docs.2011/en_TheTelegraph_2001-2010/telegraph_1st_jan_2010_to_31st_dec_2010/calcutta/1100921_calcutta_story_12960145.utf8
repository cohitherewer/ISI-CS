The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Airport visa goof-up in holiday horror
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Airport visa goof-up in holiday horror
  - Nepalese green card-holder deported to city from Bangkok after 18-hour detention          SANJAY MANDAL                          Tsomala Lama in Calcutta on Monday afternoon. (Sanjay Mandal)                                        
	A US-based Nepalese homemaker headed for a holiday in Thailand via Calcutta was cleared for boarding at the city airport despite not holding a Thai visa, leaving her to face 18 hours of detention in Bangkok before she was deported.        
	Tsomala Lama, 33, has accused Thai Airways and immigration officials at the city airport of misleading her into thinking that she was eligible for the tourist visa-on-arrival facility at Suvarnabhumi and other airports in Thailand.         
	No official at the Thai Airways or immigration counter told me that a passenger passing through a third country doesnt qualify for a visa on arrival, irrespective of nationality, she told Metro on Monday, recounting the holiday that went horribly wrong.        
	On discovering that she was not carrying a visa, officials at Suvarnabhumi airport had threatened her with indefinite detention and a fine of $10,000. I was so scared.Those 18 hours that I spent there were traumatic, she recalled.        
	A senior immigration official said California resident Tsomala, who holds a Nepalese passport and an American green card, wouldnt have got a tourist visa on arrival in Bangkok even if she had travelled directly from the US. Thailand doesnt offer that facility to some countries, including Nepal. Since the lady holds a Nepalese passport, she would need to apply for and get a visa either in Nepal or the US, where she enjoys permanent residency, he added.        
	If Tsomala was ignorant about the Thai visa rule, what about the officials who allowed her to board the Bangkok flight on Saturday night? Vutichai Kampanartsanyakorn, the city-based general manager of Thai Airways, said: This is surprising. I will look into the matter. Even if our staff gave her a boarding pass, she should have been stopped at immigration.        
	Shakil Ahmed, the foreigners regional registration officer for eastern India, insisted he was unaware of any such incident at the city airport. In any case, the onus is on the receiving country to allow or deny entry to anybody.         
	For Tsomala, the visa fiasco means returning to Kathmandu, where she had spent some time before arriving in Calcutta on Saturday morning, to join the four friends with whom she was booked on Sundays 2am flight to Bangkok.         
	Her friends are still in Thailand. She returned around 12.45am on Monday and will be leaving for north Bengal en route to Nepal on Tuesday, a source said.

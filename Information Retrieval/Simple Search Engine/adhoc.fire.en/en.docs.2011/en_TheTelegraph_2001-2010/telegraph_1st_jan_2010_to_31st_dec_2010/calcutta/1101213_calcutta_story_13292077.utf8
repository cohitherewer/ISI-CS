The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mallick to be SRFTI captain
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mallick to be SRFTI captain
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Ranjit Mallick hopes to bridge institute amp; industry                                  
	Veteran actor Ranjit Mallick has been chosen the chairman of Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI). He will take over from film-maker Buddhadeb Dasgupta, who has chaired the institute twice (1996-99 and 2006-2010).        
	Mallicks filmography includes directors like Satyajit Ray (Shakha Proshakha) and Mrinal Sen (Interview and Calcutta 71), alongside blockbusters of the Seventies like Shatru and Raag Anurag. He was approached for the post by C.M. Jatua, the Union minister of state for information and broadcasting.        
	I will come to know about my duties on Wednesday when an official announcement will be made. My first responsibility as chairman would be to maintain the existing infrastructure and build a bridge between the institute and the Bengali film industry, which I think is missing now, said the father of actress Koel.        
	Mallick has already drawn up a list of things he wants to get done after taking charge. I want to introduce acting classes at SRFTI, like the ones they have at FTII Pune. Also, the equipment needs better care and I will find out if it can be rented out for commercial film shoots. That way the institute can make some money, he told Metro.        
	SRFTI was established in 1995 and courses on campus include direction and screenplay, cinematography, audiography and editing.        
	The process to improve infrastructure had begun over the past few years, pointed out Dasgupta. We had planned a state-of-the-art film processing lab for which we were in talks with the Chennai-based Prasad Film Laboratories. I have submitted the relevant papers and now it is for the ministry to decide. Once the laboratory starts functioning, it will benefit not just the students but the film industry in general, said the National Award-winning director.        
	According to the outgoing chairman, one of the most important changes that happened during his tenure was recruiting 42 faculty members. The construction of two separate buildings for the art direction and animation courses is also underway.        
	And his parting words for SRFTI and his successor? The students should try not to lose patience as they have in the past and the administration should improve their relationship with the students.

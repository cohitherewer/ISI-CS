The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Generators for Eden
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Generators for Eden
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The Eden Gardens lights would be powered by generators, and not CESC, during the IPL 3 matches, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) informed Calcutta police on Wednesday.         
	The CAB authorities told us that they will bring in five generators to supplement the three that serve as backup for the four light towers, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner (headquarters), after a co-ordination meeting at Lalbazar between agencies involved with the IPL.         
	In the first edition of the IPL, the CAB had used CESC feed to power the lights and had kept generators as backup. The lights had gone out during one of the Kolkata Knight Riders matches.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti would chair another meeting on IPL 3, at Writers Buildings, on March 6.         
	Irrespective of the measures being taken, we have asked the CAB to check the circuit-breakers and other electrical systems. The public works department will conduct a thorough check. Only after it declares the ground fit will the matches be played, said a senior government official.         
	The police have asked the CAB, IPL authorities and the KKR management to take into account noise pollution norms while bursting firecrackers during matches.         
	Firecrackers that were tested at the Eden Gardens on Tuesday flouted the decibel limit, said a police officer.         
	The organisers were also asked to keep in mind the ban on using loudspeakers during Madhyamik examinations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mahi comes home to biryani
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mahi comes home to biryani
          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          Dhoni in town on Tuesday. (Sudeshna Banerjee)                                  
	The nice, approachable guy stooped to touch the feet of a 70-year-old lady and signed a little boys miniature bat with a smile.        
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni was in fine touch on his first visit to his in-laws since his wedding to city girl Sakshi Singh Rawat in July.        
	Nobody asked him to touch her feet, neither his wife nor his in-laws, but he did it. He is a nice approachable guy, said one of those present in the second-floor Sundaram apartments flat late on Tuesday when the Team India skipper came home to Alipore.        
	The elderly woman blessed the newlyweds with her hand on their heads and then hugged them both.        
	In blue jeans and a white T-shirt, Dhoni came with a stunning victory against Australia in his backpack, but no airs at all, a neighbour added.        
	He knows the city well, prides himself on his Bengali and loves the biryani served here, she added.        
	He is fluent in Bangla and takes pride in speaking it, said someone who was with Dhoni during his stay at his 10B Burdwan Road sasural.        
	Sheila Singh may not have met Dhoni often since her daughters wedding but she sure knows just how much her jamai digs the Calcutta biryani. So chicken biryani was the star on the menu.        
	He loves the biryani here, especially from Shiraz and Arsalan. Though he did not comment on the food it was evident that he enjoyed it, said a guest at the table.        
	The biryani was served with the fried chicken Sheila had cooked for her star son-in-law and they rounded it off with jalebi  another Dhoni favourite.        
	While Sheila was busy in the kitchen, father-in-law R.K. Singh kept Dhoni engaged in conversation. Coping with the pressures  from fans and the media  of being a star cricketer was on the talks table.        
	On his visit to the city four days after their marriage, Dhoni had skipped the Alipore Road address as Sakshis parents had not yet returned from Dehradun.        
	This time, Dhoni spent around three hours at a stretch with Sakshis parents, marking his first major interaction with them.        
	After spending almost all of Tuesday at a commercial assignment in a star hotel on the Bypass, the countrys hottest brand endorser reached Sakshis house around 9.40pm.         
	He had also dropped in at his in-laws once past Monday midnight, soon after touching down in town.        
	Dhoni hardly had time to rest as he left early on Tuesday and returned close to 10pm, said a neighbour.        
	He had barely finished a cup of tea when the next-door neighbours came calling. All of them wanted to meet him, a source said.        
	Mahi was very patient and even answered questions on cricket and how he manages his hectic cricket schedule, said a woman in her mid-40s who met him.        
	Dhoni has been to the Alipore flat several times when he was dating Sakshi but he appeared more relaxed and open this time.         
	Clearly, the Calcutta jamai has taken the city to heart. He loves the city, the food and the people of Calcutta, said the source.        
	Mr and Mrs Dhoni left home as early as 4am on Wednesday.

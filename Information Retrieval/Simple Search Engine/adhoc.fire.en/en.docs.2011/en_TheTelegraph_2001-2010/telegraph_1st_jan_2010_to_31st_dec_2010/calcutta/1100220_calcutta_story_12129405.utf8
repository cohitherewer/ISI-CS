                      Calcutta panorama                    In Calcutta, the seams of modernity are encrusted with village idioms and pulsate with revolutionary zeal. The interweaving of religions, languages and the vestiges of colonialism all co-exist in the former capital of British India and the epicentre of the Bay of Bengal. Leena Kejriwal, the photographer, has walked the streets of old Calcutta in an attempt to come to terms with its palimpsest, arrested by the aesthetics of the city and its contemporary purpose. The photographs in East City  Kolkata Before the Campaign, her ongoing solo show, bear witness to the eastern dream of expansion and the rise of the technopolis on the former citys carcass. The city has thrived on difference, and the photographer has captured both sides of the equation with equal ease. Besides, her lens brings into focus various interesting and distinguishing facets of the city: its people, its landmarks, its communities, its grand past and its could-be-better present, its natives, its immigrants, its history, its rituals, its festivals, its streets, its religion, its artisans and craftsmen, its culture, its everyday life, its richness along with its emptiness, its nature and, most of all, its vibrant colours. Curated by Shaheen Merali.                  Event: An exhibition of photographs by Leena Kejriwal When: Till March 5 (except Mondays amp; public holidays); 3pm - 8pm Where: Birla Academy of Art and Culture, 108 Southern Avenue

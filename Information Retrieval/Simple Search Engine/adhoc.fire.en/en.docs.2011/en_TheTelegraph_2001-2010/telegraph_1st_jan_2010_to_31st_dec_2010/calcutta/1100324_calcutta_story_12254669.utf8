          SANJAY MANDAL                          Trapped residents try to climb down the ladder to the ground. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	At first, it was a waft. But smoke quickly engulfed the office of Orissa Transport Service on the second floor of Stephen Court.        
	Forty-year-old Kajal Nath, an officer at the firm, realised he must escape, and as fast as possible. But the wooden staircase was in flames. He was trapped.        
	There was only one thing to do, Nag said from his bed in SSKM Hospital on Tuesday evening. That was to jump off the burning building.        
	Initially, even the idea was frightening. I thought for a couple of minutes  and it seemed such a long time  about what I should do, Nath said.        
	I once again peeped out and immediately realised that taking the stairs was certain death. Jumping out of the window was the only option that offered slender hope.        
	As the smoke got thicker and breathing more difficult, Nath realised that time was running out and inched closer to a window.         
	What suddenly gave him the courage was the sight of his 35-year-old colleague Goutam Banerjee getting up on the windowsill and jumping out.        
	When I saw that he had survived, I decided it was time for me to try my luck. I had nothing to lose because I knew I would choke to death in the office, said Nath.                    
	He sat on the windowsill, shut his eyes and thought of his wife waiting at home. I convinced myself that by jumping out I was giving myself the only chance that I had of living and not making my wife a widow. Before any other thought crossed my mind, I jumped down.        
	The next thing Nath remembers is lying on a Park Street pavement in great pain with people crowding around him.        
	I knew some bones were broken because I was aching all over, but to my great relief I also realised that I was alive, said Nath.        
	He was later told that he had passed out after falling on the ground. When he came to, he was rushed to the hospital where an X-ray revealed that his right leg was fractured.         
	Nath also learnt that his colleague Banerjee was admitted to the Mission of Mercy Hospital with multiple fractures.        
	Naths wife came to the hospital to take him home. For me, surviving the jump is like getting a second life, he said before leaving for home.        
	Naths 40-year-old colleague Rupa Ghosh, too, got a second life. She knew that she had to jump, if only for the sake of her college-going daughter Priyanka.        
	Unlike Nath, Ghosh first jumped to a parapet 10 feet below before climbing down a ladder. I knew that I owed it to my daughter. My only thought was that I had to save myself and get back to my daughter, said Ghosh, who sustained minor injuries.

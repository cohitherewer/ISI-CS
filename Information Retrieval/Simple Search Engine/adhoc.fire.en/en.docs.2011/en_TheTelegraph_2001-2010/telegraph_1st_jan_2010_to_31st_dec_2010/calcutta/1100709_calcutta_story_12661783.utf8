          A STAFF REPORTER                           A few teachers of La Martiniere for Boys await police interrogation                                  
	The detective department of Calcutta police will interrogate the principal and four other teachers of La Martiniere for Boys in connection with the suicide of Class VIII student Rouvanjit Rawla.        
	Interrogation of more than 40 students of Rouvanjits class is over. Now, its the turn of the teachers. We will interrogate the principal as well and try to piece together the days development, said an officer of the detective department.        
	The 13-year-old was found hanging at his Alipore home on February 12, four days after he was caned by principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi.        
	The boys father, Ajay, had lodged a complaint of abetment to suicide against five teachers, including the principal, with Shakespeare Sarani police station on June 7.        
	Since an abetment case is always based on recent developments, it is crucial for us to interrogate the teachers. We have received the post- mortem report as well as some other documents, including the attendance book, which we had sought from the school, said another officer of the detective department.        
	Officers probing the case will once again speak to Rouvanjits family members, including his brother and sister, said a source.        
	Ajay Rawla had also lodged a complaint with the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. In his complaint, he had mentioned the names of English teacher Partha Dutta, who had allegedly made Rouvanjit stand outside the class, L.G. Gunnion, the head of the middle school who had allegedly slapped the boy, and principal Chakravarthi.        
	Arrest: Around 100 BJP supporters were arrested in front of the office of the South 24-Parganas district magistrate in Alipore on Thursday afternoon for protesting price hike. The supporters had organised a procession from the Hazra crossing and were arrested after they tried to break the police cordon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cradle of craters on Bypass

	The blacktop has worn off on a number of stretches of the EM Bypass between Science City and Patuli, causing frequent accidents, but the CMDA refuses to undertake repairs, according to cops.        
	Officers of the South East traffic guard of Calcutta police, manning the Bypass since September, said they had sent at least four reminders through the proper channel to the CMDA to re-lay the damaged parts of the tarmac but did not receive a response.        
	Heres a look at the Bypass stretches with the deepest trenches.        
	Tagore Park        
	After a near-fatal accident on November 25 evening, residents made police officers on duty in the area stop a concrete mixer truck plying down the EM Bypass and pour quick-drying material on the trench here.         
	A kid had been flung off while he was riding pillion on his fathers motorcycle and sustained serious injuries in his head and arms. Residents put up a blockade and said they would not leave the spot unless we fixed the crater immediately, recounted a sergeant.        
	The stretch has not been levelled after the patchwork, angering residents and commuters even more.        
	The spot was cordoned off with branches. By next morning, a bumpy white patch had replaced the gaping hole, said Arghya Neogi, a motorist who regularly crosses the stretch.        
	Panchannagram        
	We try to provide a green corridor here. If you get a green light at the Ruby crossing, you will keep getting greens at the next few signals and can reach the foot of the bridge near Science City without stopping. So motorists are generally moving at a high speed when they spot the craters in the middle of the road and struggle to control their vehicles, said an officer of the traffic guard.        
	This is such an important thoroughfare with such a lot of traffic. How can the CMDA take things lightly and keep the roads in this state? the cop said.        
	There are treacherous trenches in the north-bound flank between Uttar Panchannagram and the Science City roundabout that need to be repaired immediately, said motorcyclist Adarsh Agarwal, a resident of VIP Bazaar.        
	Avisar-Ruby rotary service road        
	This is the service road motorists going north should take if they want to turn towards Gariahat at the Ruby rotary. Many choose to brave the signal at the roundabout instead of the craters at the two ends of the service road.        
	Rickshawpullers who operate from the stand nearby try to fill the holes with rubbish but that is not a solution and the holes just keep expanding, said Bishwanath Biswas, who drives an autorickshaw on the Ruby-Fern Road route.        
	Hiland Park-Ajaynagar service road        
	The craters at the Santoshpur-EM Bypass intersection of the service road are the deepest.        
	Motorcycles and even rickshaws topple over trying to negotiate the stretch, just longer than 20 metres.        
	There are accidents almost every day. The number of accidents increases in the rainy season when the potholes get filled with rainwater and cannot be seen in the dark, said a local trader.        
	Ministers version        
	There is a plan to pave the entire stretch from Ultadanga to Ruby and beyond with mastic asphalt and also widen it at places. The work will start soon. The engineers are perhaps not repairing the roads now because the other project is scheduled to start soon, said Asok Bhattacharya, the state municipal affairs minister.         
	I do not know if we have received any complaint from the South East traffic guard of Calcutta police. My engineers would know. But if the condition of the road is really bad, I will ask them to repair it at once, the minister promised.        
	The CMDA chief engineer (traffic and transport) could not be contacted.                    RITH BASU

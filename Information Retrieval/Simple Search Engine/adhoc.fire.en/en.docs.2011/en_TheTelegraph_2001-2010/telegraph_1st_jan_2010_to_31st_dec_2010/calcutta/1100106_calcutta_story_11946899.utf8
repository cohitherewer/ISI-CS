                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CU makes the highest grade
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The success rate of its students may be dipping, but Calcutta University (CU) has passed its accreditation test with flying colours. The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (Naac) on Tuesday awarded grade A to the university, the highest rating given by the central body.         
	The accreditation will be valid for five years. This was the second consecutive time CU bagged the highest rating from Naac. In 2001, during the first assessment, the university was awarded five stars  the highest rating then.        
	We are happy to know that Naac has awarded the highest grade to us. Our universitys performance has improved in many respects in the past few years, especially in the field of research. We were confident of making the highest grade, said Suranjan Das, the vice-chancellor of CU.         
	Das received a letter from Naac on Tuesday informing him of CUs grade. Later in the day, at the fortnightly meeting of CUs syndicate, Das congratulated students, teachers, and employees of the university for enabling the institution to achieve the highest grade.        
	An eight-member Naac inspection team had visited CU last month for re-accrediting the institution. Naac has informed us that a detailed report of the inspection will be sent to us within two weeks. This will help us understand our strengths and weaknesses, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the CU pro vice-chancellor.         
	After the three-day inspection, S.P. Thyagrajan, the chairman of the Naac team, had said that CU outshone many institutions in the country in areas like nanotechnolgy and biochemistry.         
	CU, however, had suffered a setback with the pass percentage in the BA and BSc Part II honours declining by two to three per cent in 2009. In the BA and BSc Part II general courses, the number of failed candidates rose by four to seven per cent. The BA Part I honours and general exams also saw a decrease in success rates.        
	Jadavpur University, which was accredited for the second time by Naac in February, 2009, was also awarded grade A.

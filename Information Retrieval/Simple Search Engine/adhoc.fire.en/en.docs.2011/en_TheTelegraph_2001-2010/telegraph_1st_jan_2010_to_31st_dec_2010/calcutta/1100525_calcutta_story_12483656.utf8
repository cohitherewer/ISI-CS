                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cop benched for aiming at boss
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A reserve force constable has been suspended on the charge of training his rifle at his superior following an altercation.        
	An officer said the authorities decided to start a departmental probe against Jaman Bin Azad after a preliminary probe found him guilty.        
	Azad, who was allegedly drunk when he aimed his rifle at his boss, failed to come up with a satisfactory reply, the officer added.        
	A couple of months ago, Azad had been fined Rs 500 for ignoring his duty.        
	Joint commissioner Jawed Shamim said Azad was on duty at the high court last Saturday when a sub-inspector of the reserve force turned up to see whether the constables were performing their duty.        
	The officer found Azad sitting on a slab, his rifle resting on a wall.        
	Azad started arguing with the sub-inspector when he was asked to explain his conduct. While the altercation was on, Azad suddenly picked up the rifle and aimed it at the officer, said Shamim.        
	The sub-inspector caught hold of the gun and pinned down Azad, who was then dragged away by the other cops.

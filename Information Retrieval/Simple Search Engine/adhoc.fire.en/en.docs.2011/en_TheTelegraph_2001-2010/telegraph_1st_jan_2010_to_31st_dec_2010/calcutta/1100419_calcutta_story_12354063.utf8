                Air Indias Calcutta-Delhi-London and Calcutta-Delhi-New York flights on Monday were cancelled because of the volcanic eruption in Iceland. The flights were cancelled on Sunday too.     Relatives of a 45-year-old man who died at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital on Sunday morning following a heart attack later demonstrated outside the emergency ward. They alleged senior doctors were not present in the ward in the morning when the patient, Dhiren Chandra Saha, was admitted. The family lodged a complaint with the authorities.    A fire broke out in a market beside the Bengal Chemical factory at Beleghata early on Sunday. Firemen said local residents spotted the fire around 1.30am. Eleven tenders took about an hour to bring the blaze under control.     Mohammed Israil and seven other men were arrested in Rajarhat on Sunday for assaulting Union ministers Sultan Ahmed and Mukul Roy, when they went to Rajarhat last week to offer condolences to relatives of a deceased party member. Two rifles, cartridges and bombs were found on the eight.    Rabeya Khatoon, 11, died after being hit by a lorry on Canal West Road in Narkeldanga on Saturday evening.

  - TV show A lesson FOR creative ART          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                                                JUST WATCH ME, PARDNER: Cartoon character Ben10 entertains children at a fast food restaurant on Park Street. Picture by Aranya Sen		    
	Get ready with your colours, a pair of scissors, glue and a bit of imagination. The eighth season of the award-winning show, Music, Art and Dance, popularly known as M.A.D., is set to begin this Sunday (October 24) on Pogo channel at 10.30am.         
	The stimulating yet simple show has the anchor Rob taking young viewers on a fun-filled, interactive and creative journey, transforming ordinary materials into works of art. This season is my favourite because of the amount of action we have managed to pack into every half-hour episode, says Rob, speaking from the channels studio in Delhi.        
	A new segment called Draw it Now, for instance, will have Rob showing how everything  from a shark to Spiderman, aeroplanes to cats  can be drawn in five simple steps. All you need is a marker, pencil and a sheet of paper, he promises.         
	Another new segment is called Challenge Rob, where co-host Rumana throws a new challenge to Rob. One day, she gave me a toolbox with hammer, saw, sandpaper and screwdriver and asked me to design a T-shirt. All I had in hand were my oil pastels. Rob found a way out by drawing on the rough side of the sandpaper in which the colour grains (of oil pastels or wax crayons) got caught.         
	Then, all one has to do is use a hot iron to press the design on a T-shirt. Believe me, it wont come off after a wash.         
	He also creates animated figures which, in turn, offer tips on art  on colour- mixing, framing, distinguishing between primary and secondary colours, how colours are specific to a layout or mood etc,  through a simple storyline.         
	Kids with bicycles can learn how to convert their vehicle into cool art pieces  adventure bike, bike for aliens or art bike, with space to carry along easels, paints and canvas. You can also design your own helmet or a flag to stick in front.         
	For smaller kids, he promises simpler tricks, like turning toothpaste caps into penguins or sculpting soaps into glaciers, all using safe table-top settings.

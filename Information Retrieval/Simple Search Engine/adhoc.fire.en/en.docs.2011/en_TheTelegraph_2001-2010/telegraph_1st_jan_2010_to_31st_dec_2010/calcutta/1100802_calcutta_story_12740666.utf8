The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rajarhat road project hits land hurdle
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rajarhat road project hits land hurdle
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                              
	A proposed 5km stretch connecting New Town and Doltala near Madhyamgram has hit a land acquisition hurdle with over 40 villagers refusing to part with their plots for the six-lane road.         
	The project was inaugurated on April 11 and was to be completed by the year-end. But with a section of Trinamul Congress leaders ready to back those who are unwilling to part with their land, meeting the deadline seems unlikely.         
	But Goutam Deb, the housing minister and chairman of the Hidco, which is funding the project, is hopeful. I dont think the Trinamul Congress will oppose this project as they are doing in Chhapna over erection of electric poles, he said.         
	Around 100 cottahs will be required for the 5km stretch, for which nearly 80 settlers on the route have to be removed.        
	The local convener of Trinamuls Jami O Jibika Raksha Committee, Prabir Kar, said the committee would intervene only if it received a written complaint from residents.         
	We will definitely provide support to the residents if they lodge a written complaint saying the authorities are forcibly acquiring their land , said Kar.        
	Though four months have passed since work started, only a kilometre of land, free of settlers, has been handed over to the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) that is constructing the road.         
	Metro spotted hardly any concrete road on the stretch, except for a mechanically flattened stretch of nearly 100 metres near New Town.         
	At present we have got land only for one kilometre of the proposed road. We have to wait out the rains before resuming work, said an HRBC official, explaining the delay.         
	Most of the residents along the route are wary of speaking on the issue fearing the wrath of political goons.         
	The Hidco and local CPM leaders said we would get a cottah and a new house in the space just beside our existing land. We are waiting to see if this is the best deal for us, said a resident.

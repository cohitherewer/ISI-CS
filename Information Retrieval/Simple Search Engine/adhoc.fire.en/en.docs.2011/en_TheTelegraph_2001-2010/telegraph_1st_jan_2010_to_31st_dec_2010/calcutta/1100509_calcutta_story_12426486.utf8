The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | German help for sun power
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      German help for sun power

	Germany is not a particularly a sunny country. But it has become the world leader in solar power. In contrast India, especially its eastern part including Calcutta, is the recipient of strong sunlight for about 250 days a year. But the generation and use of solar power in the country and in eastern India are negligible.        
	Recently a 10-member solar energy delegation from Germany visited Calcutta to talk about their solar power network and met senior government officials, city experts and entrepreneurs. The event was organised by the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce.        
	We have been meeting experts and businessmen from the region to spread the solar network in city and around, said Berthold Breid, the chief executive officer of the Berlin-based Renewables Academy and a member of delegation.         
	Indian companies have apparently responded well.         
	Five companies from the region have signed MoUs with their German counterparts, for technology transfer, to build inverters, engineering and setting up of power plants, said solar energy expert S.P. Gon Choudhury.         
	We will try to enhance the business ties between Germany and India, stressed B.G. Roy, regional director of Indo-German Chamber of Commerce.        
	Breid felt that Germany and India coming together on the solar front could be a win-win scenario as Germany has rich reserves of technology and experience while India has huge resources. Germany generates nearly 9,000MW solar electricity, while India produces hardly 110MW.         
	Solar energy-related manufacturing is happening here but the scale is extremely small, said a delegate. GTZ, a German institution, will soon start financially supporting both rural and urban solar power projects through the Indo-German Energy Corporation.        
	Recently the government as part of its solar mission has declared a target of 20000MW in 2020. If we want to achieve this target, we need more such collaboration, said Gon Choudhury.        
	We have a long way to go. As a delegate pointed out, in Germany there is a solar panel almost on every rooftop; here despite having such wonderful sunshine, you hardly have any.

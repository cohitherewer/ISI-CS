The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A pranksters final act
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A pranksters final act
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                                      Rouvanjit Rawla        
	The greatest pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do.        
	The colourful computer printout stuck to the door leading to his room is trademark Rouvanjit Rawla. But what would draw an indulgent smile from family and friends till the other day, is now burdened with a cruel irony.        
	Rouvanjit, 13, was found hanging in a room on the roof of the Rawla home in Alipore on Friday evening.        
	He was full of life and fun. He could not have committed suicide. It was an accident, father Ajay Rawla told Metro, leafing through a picture album of Rouvanjit on Sunday.        
	Rouvan, said the family, always played with his rope, using it to swing down the stairs rather than walk down. He practised knots. He was probably doing that. There was a cardboard carton below the hook that he must have been standing on. It tore down the middle. That is how we found it. It was an accident, said Ajay, the owner of a furniture and furnishing shop on Theatre Road.        
	Police, meanwhile, are pursuing the possibility of a suicide, with a probe team scheduled to go to La Martiniere for Boys on Monday to talk to his classmates and teachers, said an officer on the case.        
	The principal of La Martiniere for Boys, Sunirmal Chakravarthi, had said on Saturday that he had called for the Class VIII students parents after a case of indiscipline but Ajay Rawla rubbished talk of a link between that and his sons death.        
	I spoke to him around 3pm on Friday and he told me that the principal wanted to meet me. I asked him if it had anything to do with not going up to Class IX and he said no. I asked him if he was hassled and he said no, he recalled.        
	Brother Rukhenjit, 18, and sister Raiheth, 16, described their kid brother as someone who made friends with everyone from six to 60, was always playing pranks and taking up challenges.        
	Stepping out of line in school was nothing new for Rouvanjit. He was so naughty, but you could never be angry with him for long, said sister Raiheth, gazing at his room with a guitar case, a computer, a fooseball table, a whiteboard and a bunk bed with a slept-in look, under which was a calendar marking the days of his exams.        
	One challenge that the boy who would be 14 on March 9 will not have to take up.

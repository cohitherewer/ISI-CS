	A taxi drivers arrest and the detention of two others in the Sandipan Das abduction case has thrown up the possibility of the crime having been committed with the help of cabbies stalking potential hostage victims in the Sector V-New Town belt.        
	Ash Mohammad, the 28-year-old Chitpur resident arrested on Monday night, had allegedly ferried two of Sandipans kidnappers to the location where the Capgemini managers family members were waiting with Rs 2 lakh in ransom early on Sunday.         
	The driver of taxi No. WB 04A 0975 was remanded in judicial custody for a fortnight after defence counsel Shibu Mukherjee pleaded in court on Tuesday that his client knew nothing about the two men who had boarded his vehicle a little after midnight on Saturday and asked to be driven to Delhi Road.        
	Police sources said Mohammads employer, Mehfuz Alam, and another taxi driver were suspects in the hostage-for-ransom case that has coincided with some big names in business receiving kidnap threats from extortionists.        
	The vehicle seized from the second driver  WB 19B 0251  may have been the one in which Sandipan was kidnapped on his way back home from his New Town office on Friday night, the sources added.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen visited New Town police station on Tuesday to ask officers to speed up the probe and trace the actual kidnappers.         
	Investigators continued to blame the Das family for the delay in wrapping up the case, saying there were discrepancies in the information provided by them about Sandipans kidnapping, the negotiations over phone for ransom and the circumstances leading to his release early on Sunday.        
	Sandipans lawyer and family friend Saikat Dutta Mazumdar contested the allegation  he visited the police station to narrate afresh the Capgemini executives side of the story  saying there was no reason for the family to withhold information from the police.        
	A source close to the family said the police couldnt have traced Mohammads vehicle to a garage in Alam Bazar, in Dakshineswar, had Sandipans family members not noted down the registration number while handing over the ransom amount on Delhi Road around 1.15am on Sunday.        
	Mohammad was arrested from his residence and his employer brought in for questioning later.        
	One question the cops are asking is: was Sandipans kidnapping a planned one? His statements give the impression that the kidnapping was a planned one but we have found nothing to prove it. How could the taxi driver who allegedly helped kidnap him that night have known that Sandipan would leave office earlier than usual because of a headache? asked an investigator.        
	An officer who did not wish to be named said Sandipan, who had hitched a ride with a colleague on duty in an office car till the New Town crossing, was probably at the wrong place at the wrong time.        
	The driver of the taxi he hailed was probably part of the kidnap gang and was on the lookout for a hostage victim when Sandipan walked into the trap. It would have helped us come to a conclusion had he and his family provided clear, consistent information, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Weather softens power blow 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Weather softens power blow

	Power cuts continued to plague Calcutta and its suburbs on Tuesday as an increase in humidity brought relief from the oppressive heat.        
	Salt Lake and the fringes continued to suffer the longest power cuts with the state utility facing a shortfall of 500MW during peak demand.         
	The prolonged power cuts forced City Centre in Salt Lake to switch off air-conditioners in the evening.         
	The feeder line that has been provided to us cant take much load. We are getting 25-30 per cent less power than we require. So we are using air-conditioners by turns in different blocks, said an official at the mall.        
	Customers at nearby Mani Square also complained of air-conditioners being switched off. The mall management, however, stressed that despite frequent power cuts, air-conditioners could be kept on because of generator back-up.        
	It was much worse in the township homes. Between 3pm and 7pm, there were phased power cuts for around three hours. We are resigned to our fate now, said BB Block resident Baikuntha Majumdar.        
	In CESC-served areas, the deficit was 230MW during peak demand. Power cuts ranged from 90 minutes to three hours in most areas.        
	What helped was the maximum temperature remaining normal for the second consecutive day at 35.6 degrees Celsius.        
	The higher humidity kept the mercury in check. The current conditions are likely to prevail for another two days or so. In fact, temperatures could dip a little, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	A trough of low pressure in Bihar and Jharkhand has been drawing moisture from the Bay of Bengal for the past 24 hours increasing the humidity over south Bengal.        
	The heat wave conditions would abate in south Bengal from Wednesday because the humidity would lower temperatures there too, added Debnath.        
	However, Norwesters, the primary source of relief from heat in south Bengal at this time of the year, are not on the radar. There is no chance of a Norwester in the next two to three days. But the conditions are more conducive to Norwesters than in the past 10 days or so, said Debnath.        
	The improvement in weather condition, however, did not have an impact on the power situation.        
	The demand through the day was unusually high. At 11.30am, it was 1,500MW. When that happens, its very difficult to avoid loadshedding, said a CESC spokesperson.

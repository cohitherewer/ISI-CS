                      Trials of womankind                    Indian Council for Cultural Relations, in collaboration with department of information and cultural affairs, Government of West Bengal, presents Leela, a mini theatre festival on womens issues, participated by South Asian countries. Besides troupes from the neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, Myanmar and Bhutan, two renowned theatre groups of the city, Rangroop and Nandikar will participate in this festival. To be inaugurated today at 6 pm, todays performance features Behular Bhasan by Syed Jamil Ahmed (Bangladesh). It narrates the story of Behulas desperate attempt to revive her dead husband. In each episode of the play, Behula meets a different male prototype. When Behula meets Saksmundars uncle, his revelation about her husbands past comes as a shock to her. She begins to question the validity of her journey and acknowledges the futility of reviving Laksminder back to life.The play ends with Behula still afloat in her raft in the rain, being blessed by the clouds so that her wishes are fulfilled. The clouds also bless the seven male prototypes she has met on her journey at the seven bends of River of Life, so that they can redeem themselves.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 220 sets robbed in cell shop night raid
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      220 sets robbed in cell shop night raid
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A gang broke into a Diamond Harbour Road cellphone shop, barely 25 metres from Thakurpukur police station, and decamped with handsets worth Rs 10 lakh on Saturday night.        
	The burglary was discovered when the shop was opened around 9am on Sunday.        
	My brother saw cellphone boxes strewn on the floor. The gang took away 220 handsets, said Tarun Debnath, an owner of the shop.        
	Most of the stolen handsets were priced between Rs 1,500 and Rs 15,000. Some were more expensive.        
	Police said at least two persons had entered the shop. The burglars seem to have entered the shop through the gap they created by twisting the shutter at the rear with the help of a crowbar and other tools, said an officer of Thakurpukur police station.        
	The owners alleged that a gang had earlier tried to break into the shop.        
	A month ago I had spotted two youths roaming around suspiciously when I was closing my shop around 9pm. I chased and caught one of them. The one who fled was carrying arms, said Taruns brother Dilip Debnath.        
	The duo were carrying crowbars and pliers. Today, we found similar tools lying near the pond behind our shop.        
	The sleuths feel it wont be much of a problem to nab the culprits if they insert a SIM in any of the stolen phones. But if they sell the handsets, it would take some time to zero in on the burglars, said an officer.         
	Cellphone shops have become the soft target of thieves because of an ever increasing demand for stolen and second-hand handsets.         
	Police records reveal that four cellphone shops in and around the city were looted in the past couple of months. Last July, more than 300 handsets were stolen from two shops in Chandni Chowk and Jorabagan.        
	The burglars are part of a racket that deals with stolen cellphones in grey markets. They have fixed buyers, said an officer in the detective department.

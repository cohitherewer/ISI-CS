          ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE IN ASANSOL                          The trekkers on their return to Asansol early on Monday. Picture by Gour Sharma                                  
	Ranjit Halder has been trekking for three decades but nothing he had faced before prepared him for the ordeal of the past few days.        
	I really thought I would not return alive this time, said the 58-year-old Asansol resident, who spent six days  and cold nights  on hilltops and in forests of Uttarakhand that has been ravaged by floods and landslides.        
	I have never experienced such horror in my 30 years of trekking, the railway employee said after getting off the Doon Express at Asansol around 2.45am on Monday.        
	Halder and seven others had left Asansol on September 10 with the hope to scale Yamuna pass in Uttarakhand, at an altitude of 14,000 feet. Six are from Asansol while one trekker is from Serampore.        
	We sensed the danger ahead on reaching Dehradun. It was raining heavily and some local taxi drivers told us that parts of the road to Sankri, about 200km away, had subsided. We ignored the warning because subsidence is common in mountains during the monsoon, recalled Surajit Banerjee, 35.        
	On September 12, the eight reached Sankri where they hired a guide. The trek began the next morning.        
	On our way from Dehradun to Sankri, we saw at least two major landslides. Our guide Suraj Mani Rana warned us that rocks and boulders have come loose following persistent showers. But we decided to press ahead, said Koushik Chowdhury, 39.        
	The situation spun out of control in Upper Thung on September 16. The nearest human settlement was about 50km away.        
	The showers were unrelenting and it had begun to snow. Two members of the group fell ill and complained of breathing problems, said Banerjee. The food, clothes and shoes were damaged. The guide suggested that they stop the journey at a point 25 km from Yamuna pass.        
	The trekkers camped there till September 18 and then decided to return. On their way back, they faced perhaps the most horrible moments of their lives.        
	All the rivers were flowing violently. The rocks were slippery and boulders came crashing down every now and then. We could not even call for help as the area was beyond cellphone reach, said Serampore resident Jayanta Ghosh, 38.        
	On September 20, Ghosh missed his step in Darkut, a hilltop forest, and slipped into a river. He would have been washed away had he not got trapped between two boulders.         
	On September 23, the group reached Sankri and from there went to Nagaon, a village near Barkote, via taxi.        
	Police ferried the trekkers, who had run out of cash, to Barkote and put them up in a hotel. On September 24, they were flown to Dehradun by a helicopter. The next day they boarded the Doon Express with special tickets provided by the railway.        
	Missing: The nine trekkers from Bengal who have been missing for more than a week are yet to be traced, civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee said on Monday. Rescue operations are on.

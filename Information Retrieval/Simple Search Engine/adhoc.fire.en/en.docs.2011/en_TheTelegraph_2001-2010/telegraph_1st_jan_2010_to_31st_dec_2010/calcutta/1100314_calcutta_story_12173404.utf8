The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Adda greats 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Adda greats 
										      SAJNI MUKHERJI      Autumn Flush                            Radha Prasad Gupta (top) and Kumar Prasad Mukherji                           
	Iwas privileged to meet two Calcutta personalities in their prime, men who survived into old age without having lost any of their verve or their zest for the good things of life. One was my brother-in-law, Kumar Prasad Mukherji, classical singer of the Agra gharana, musicologist and lover of cricket, a great reader and photographer, henceforth Dada.         
	The other was Radha Prasad Gupta (well-known among friends as Shantul), perennial mine of information culled from his vast reading of old forgotten books, connoisseur of art and films. Best of friends, great raconteurs, impressive at any adda, they sparkled when together at one.         
	Dada worked for a large part of his life for Coal India, Shantulda for the Tatas but they lived equally in other worlds. I think of them as being quintessentially the adda greats of all time.        
	A long time earlier they had discovered and partly invented a grandfather and a great grandfather teaching at Hooghly Mohsin College about the same time and also someone called Khelat who in his capacity as member of the governing body persecuted both ancestors.         
	Whenever they met or parted company they would always say Kali-Gobinda or Gobinda-Kali (Gobinda and Kali being the names of their respective ancestors) like a personalised war cry. Any person/s, objects or even abstract concepts that stood in their way were immediately dubbed khelat and together they would seek ways of getting round the problem.         
	Moshai! Aajke ekhane aashtei partam na. Khelat baddo bagra dewar chesta korechhilo. Kono rakame nijeke baanchiye eshechhi (I nearly didnt come. Khelat almost laid a successful trap. I luckily found a way out of it).        
	While most of the world held Satyajit Ray in awe, Dada and Shantulda cheerfully referred to him as Manke, a corruption of his nickname, Manik. Shantulda referred to the exceptionally tall film- maker as Oriental Longman and later, when Satyajit Rays heart attack coincided with the opening of the new road: Eastern Bypass.        
	I could never imagine anyone could speak in this way about someone like Satyajit Ray but it was perhaps this total irreverence that appealed to the great man himself: he counted them among his few intimate friends. The coffee house addas including all three are legendary. It was true adda, gossip without malice, an exchange informed with information, wit and humour.         
	They discussed gourmet food with avidity. The best of alcohol formed an important part of each adda: partaking and discussing it. Dada could talk of some incredible delicacy he had come across in his travels. Shantulda knew that koi mach with bethua saag was a treat like no other.         
	Dada had a great way of mingling his two passions: cricket and music. Watching a match on TV with two of his music disciples one day, he asked: Would you rather sing a khayal like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan or hit a cover drive like Vishwanath? I think he would have been hard put to choose between them.        
	Both loved to travel: once when some of us were going with Dada on a trip to the Chhota Nagpur forests, Shantulda turned up at Howrah station and got on the train with us without prior reservation. He had recently had a cataract surgery and was due one in the other eye, so he could barely see and at night not at all. But he enjoyed the idea of being in the forest anyway: on a night safari he would listen to us talk among ourselves and say: Hati na ki? Kota hati? (Elephants did you say? How many?)        
	In easy companionship as middle-aged men they made the difficult trek to Pindari glacier and came back with hilarious anecdotes about the unavoidable Bengali tourists they met en route: devotees of Vraman Sangi (Bhraman sangir bhakta) or Kundu Specialists. An elderly gentleman among these turned out to be a relative of Dadas; they chuckled like schoolboys at the remembered vision of him on the back of a mule, disappearing into the mists like Sancho Panza.         
	Mortality was for other people. From a Calcutta hospital three days before his death, at the age of 79, Dada talked to his niece in Delhi at length about a new restaurant there with exclusive chefs flown down from Lahore. He would bring a Mosel to accompany the kababs when he visited her a fortnight later for the release of his book. That was not to be.         
	Shantulda died in 2000 and Dada in 2006: they were pickers-up of lifes curiosities. A too-tiny shelf of their writings can still conjure up a few delights of their incomparable adda.

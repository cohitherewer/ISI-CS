                      Political game of carnage                    A play about communal riots, ? (Question Mark) confronts us with the brutal and cruel face of political leadership in our country. The Hindi adaptation of Ismail Choonaras They Burn People, They Do, it depicts the horror of riots and conveys the message that riotous violence has nothing to do with religion; it is only politically motivated. To meet their own greedy, selfish ends, our leaders create an imaginary enemy and poison the minds of the masses, compelling them to fear and hate the so-called enemy. And the most lethal weapon they use for the purpose is religion. In the play, Raj, Raza, Mohan and Kanti are four mentally-challenged patients who live in an ashram under the care of a widow, Mrs C. Rajendra. Their speech and actions are devoid of any logic, at least from the perspective of people with rational minds. Yet, our leaders, who should represent the most sane and sensible among us, also behave in a way that is nothing short of madness. The manner in which they manipulate religion is no less absurd or maniacal than the pretentious game of cricket played by Raj and Raza. Design and direction: S.M. Azhar Alam.                  Event: Play in Hindi, ? (Question Mark), produced by Little Thespian When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Gyan Manch

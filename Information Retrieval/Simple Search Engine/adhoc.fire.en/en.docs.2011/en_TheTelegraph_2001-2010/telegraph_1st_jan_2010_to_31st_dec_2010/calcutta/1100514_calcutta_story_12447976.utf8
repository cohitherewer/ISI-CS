                      Tryst with Tagore                    To mark the birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore, Films Division, Government of India and Nandan, West Bengal Film Centre jointly present the screening of four documentaries on the Poet by celebrated Indian filmmakers. The poetic mind of Gurudev Rabindranath finds a new lyrical expression in his paintings. Tagores Paintings (dir: Ranabir Ray; 6 pm) focuses on his art and the various moods represented in them. Tagore composed nearly 2000 songs, including some very popular ones on the rains and the season of spring. These songs are beautifully presented in Tagores Ode to Nature (dir: Ranabir Ray; 6.20 pm), and highlight the use of European, Indian classical and Bengali folk strains in his compositions. Kalakalam (dir: Dev Benegal; 6.50 pm) is an animation film based on Tagores short allegorical fantasy Totakahini. The last film, Rabindranath Tagore (dir: Satyajit Ray; 7.10 pm; a still from it appears here), is a biography on Tagores life comprising live shots, sketches, photographs and a dramatic impersonation of the Poets early life. Besides unfolding the growth and maturity of Tagores genius in the diverse spheres of art, literature and music, this outstanding work also captures his persona as a rebel and a reformer.                  Event: Screening of documentaries on Rabindranath Tagore When: Today; 6 pm onwards Where: Nandan II

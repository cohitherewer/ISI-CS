                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      College seat racket busted
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Two alleged members of a racket that duped city students of at least Rs 1 crore by promising them seats in private engineering and medical colleges across India have been arrested.         
	Hasan Kadri, the chairman of a Bangalore-based co-operative bank, was arrested in the Karnataka capital on Wednesday. Kazi Taufique Islam, who was arrested in the city on February 24 on the basis of a complaint by Nazma Khatun, a student from Ekbalpore, told the police about Kadri, said an officer.        
	Islam is the assistant secretary of Career Foundation, which had placed an advertisement in a newspaper in 2009 promising admission in medical and engineering colleges under management quota.         
	Khatun had paid the institute Rs 28 lakh by a demand draft for a seat in the Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences. Relatives of the girl could not trace members of the institute after she did not make the cut, said city detective chief Damayanti Sen.        
	Before taking the money, institute members had even organised a meeting between Khatun and the principal of the college, Sen added.        
	Investigations revealed that the institute authorities had shifted their office from Gariahat Road to Shakespeare Sarani after taking the money from Khatun.        
	According to cops, members of the racket duped at least five other city students using similar tactics.        
	We are looking for a Bangalore resident called Rafat Mullick, who is the kingpin of the racket. It appears that the racket has links with colleges in Bangalore, Bhubaneswar, Pune, Chennai and other cities, said an officer.

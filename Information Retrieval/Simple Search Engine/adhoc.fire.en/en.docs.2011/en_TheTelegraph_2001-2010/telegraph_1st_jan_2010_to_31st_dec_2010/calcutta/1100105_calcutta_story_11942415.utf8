          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An inter-state car theft racket has been busted with the arrest of two men in the city and another two in Bihar.        
	A police team has left for Bihar in search of the cars that the quartet had stolen.        
	A preliminary probe has revealed that the culprits had stolen more than a dozen Tata Sumos from the city over the past four months. They operated across the city, from Cossipore to Tollygunge, targeting vehicles parked in open areas, said the deputy commissioner of police (detective department), Damayanti Sen.        
	The duo arrested in Bihar have been identified as Naresh Rai and Arvind Mahato. Their local accomplices were Jeetu Shukla of Taltala and Gautam Shaw of Beleghata. Naresh was the alleged kingpin.        
	Jeetu and Gautam would mark the cars to be stolen, while Naresh or Arvind drove them to Bihar. The gang unlocked the cars with a master key, said an officer.

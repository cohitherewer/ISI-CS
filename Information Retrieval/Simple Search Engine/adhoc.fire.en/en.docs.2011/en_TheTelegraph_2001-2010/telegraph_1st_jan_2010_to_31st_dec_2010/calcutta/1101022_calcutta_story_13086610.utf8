  - 18-year-old leaves home to meet friends from coaching class, ends up with slit throat and chest stab          OUR BUREAU                         Mother Manju Baidya mourns Tithiswars death at their residence off Jodhpur Park on Thursday evening.

	An 18-year-old school topper was found dead beside a south Calcutta rail track with multiple injuries hours after he received a call and stepped out of his Jodhpur Park home to meet some friends.        
	The father of Tithiswar Baidya, a Class XII student of science at Jodhpur Park Boys School, filed an FIR on Wednesday night, alleging murder without naming anybody as a suspect.        
	Why would anybody want to kill my son in such a gruesome manner? He was such a quiet, harmless boy, cried Dilip Kumar Baidya, an employee of the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health.        
	Tithiswar, who had topped the Madhyamik merit list of Jodhpur Park Boys School with 88 per cent, was found with his throat partly slit and a deep wound on the right side of his chest late on Tuesday.        
	He had left his home at Rahim Ostagar Lane off Jodhpur Park around 7pm, shortly after taking a call on one of his two cellphones.        
	Father Dilip said Tithiswar told his mother Manju before leaving that he would be back soon after meeting some friends with whom he attended coaching class.        
	According to Dilip, wife Manju last spoke to their son around 9pm.        
	She called him to ask when he would be coming home. He replied that he was busy and hung up. My wife dialled him again after half an hour and continued doing so till 10pm, but he didnt take any of her calls, recounted Tithiswars father.        
	Dilip, who was watching an episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati when his wife was dialling their son, said even he got worried when Tithiswar wasnt back by 10pm.        
	I went across the road in front of our home and dialled him, only to find a stranger answering the call. The voice at the other end asked me: Eita kaar phone bolun to (Whose phone is this?). I suddenly felt numb, said Dilip, who also has a five-year-old daughter.        
	The stranger apparently asked Dilip to come to rail gate number two at Gobindapur  off Lake Gardens  but didnt say why.        
	On reaching the area, a five-minute ride on his scooter, Dilip spotted a group of young men huddled around a body that they said was found lying on the track a little while back.        
	I couldnt believe it was my son. I didnt even look at the body and came back home, sobbed Tithiswars father.        
	Manjus cries brought neighbours and relatives living next door to the Baidya household. Some of them immediately left for Gobindapur and identified the body.        
	One of Tithiswars cellphones was found beside his body. Police are yet to trace the other one, switched off since Tuesday night.        
	Railway police had received news of a body lying on the tracks from the guard of a local train.        
	 On October 19, a case of unnatural death was initiated by Ballygunge GRP. We registered a murder case when the boys father lodged a specific complaint the next day. He also called me and sought a thorough probe into the incident. We have assured him of all help, the director-general of railway police, Dilip Mitra, said on Thursday.        
	Two of the injuries on the body (clad in a pair of blue jeans and black vest) suggest a sharp weapon had been used, said Anil G. Srinivasan, superintendent of railway police, Sealdah. We will have a better idea of what might have happened once the post-mortem report arrives, he added.        
	Gopal Chandra Nandi, the headmaster of Jodhpur Park Boys School, said he knew Tithiswar as a hardworking student who kept to himself. All our teachers liked him for his quiet nature. It is difficult to believe that he has been murdered, he added.

	Calcutta will get its own great wall on Teachers Day  a wall for a cause made not of bricks and mortar but of books and compassion.        
	The Aviva Great Wall of Education, presented by The Telegraph, will be built at City Centre (Salt Lake) from September 1 to 5.        
	Schools and citizens can donate books at the site to be built into a wall and then distributed among children who cant afford to buy them.        
	The first time Calcutta got to hear about the event was at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence on Saturday, a fitting platform for the announcement of an initiative to support the pursuit of education against all odds.        
	Barry OBrien, the convener of the awards, announced the Aviva Great Wall of Education and appealed to schools to donate books for the cause. The Telegraph Education Foundation supports the endeavour, said O Brien.        
	The book donation drive for underprivileged children was launched by Aviva India in Delhi on November 11, 2009, national education day, and a wall with over 1,23,000 books was built.        
	Education is the insurance for a better future and the Great Wall of Education aims to improve the lives of thousands of underprivileged children, said T.R. Ramachandran, the chief executive officer and managing director of Aviva India.        
	From September 1 to 5, 11am to 8pm, anyone can walk into the Kund area of City Centre and contribute to making the wall longer and taller. The five-day event will also witness a host of programmes (see box).        
	Spot collections apart, drop boxes are being placed in 300 schools across Calcutta with students being urged to help build the giant wall of books. If the classrooms of South Point High School and Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, are already counting their contributions, Salt Lake School and Scottish Church Collegiate School have pledged their entire library to the wall.        
	Children from our primary classes have already collected 20,000 books and given it. They were very enthusiastic, said Krishna Damani of South Point High School.        
	The Great Wall of Education is part of the global Aviva Street to School initiative, under which the books from the wall at City Centre will be distributed among the thousands of underprivileged children supported by the Sarva Siksha Abhiyaan (West Bengal) and leading NGOs like Save the Children India and CINI Asha.        
	We are very happy to be a partner of this unique initiative. The books will be distributed to schools whose students belong to the disadvantaged and weaker social groups, said Choten Lama, the state project director of Paschim Banga Sarva Siksha Mission.        
	The wall will be inaugurated by Governor M.K. Narayanan and actor Mithun Chakraborty at 11am on September 1. After Calcutta, the wall be built in Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai.

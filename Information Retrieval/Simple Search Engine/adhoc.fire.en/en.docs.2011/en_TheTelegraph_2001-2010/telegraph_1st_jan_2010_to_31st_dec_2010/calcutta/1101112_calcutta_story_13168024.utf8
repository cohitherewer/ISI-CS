The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | ...festive film sizzles on   Laughter power
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      ...festive film sizzles on   Laughter power
          PRIYANKA ROY                          LAUGH OUT LOUD: The Golmaal 3 gang that has fired the Diwali box office                                  
	The Diwali weekend verdict is out. Laugh riot Golmaal 3 has sizzled while retro yawnathon Action Replayy has fizzled out in the festive filmi face-off.         
	Even before release, the audience had made up its mind to watch Golmaal 3. It got off to a huge start on Friday and there was no looking back. In comparison, Action Replayy (despite Akshay Kumar and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) had a lukewarm opening; the Golmaal surge proved too strong, says Rishi Negi of Fame Cinemas.        
	Golmaal is an established franchise targeted at the young and its got in huge crowds, adds Virendra Marya of INOX.        
	Powered by LOL (laugh-out-loud, for those out of the loop) jokes and an ensemble cast  Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor, Arshad Warsi, Shreyas Talpade... plus Mithun Chakraborty as the real scene-stealer  the third instalment of the Rohit Shetty fun franchise grossed Rs 33 crore in the first weekend, with Action Replayy managing just Rs 17 crore. In Bengal, Golmaal 3 mopped up Rs 2.5 crore-plus in the first week.        
	If the plexes are going chock-a-block, standalone cinemas are also riding the Golmaal wave. Fun and frolic always works during Diwali and Golmaal 3 had that in abundance, says Arijit Dutta of Priya Cinemas.        
	With no big Bolly release this Friday, Golmaal has marched into week 2 all guns blazing (read, number of shows intact or rising). The second week should be equally good and we expect to earn Rs 4 crore (gross) from 140 screens, says Mahendra Soni of Shree Venkatesh Films, the films regional distributors.                          
	Traditionally, the Golmaal films have crackled on Diwali. Golmaal Returns raked in big bucks in Diwali 2008 while Golmaal-maker Rohit Shettys Ajay Devgn-starrer All The Best thrashed Blue and Main Aurr Mrs Khanna last year.        
	Diwali has always been a lucky time for my films, but Golmaal 3 has been the biggest for me yet. I now have to plan something equally big for Diwali next year and Golmaal 4 will arrive in Diwali 2012, Shetty tells Metro.        
	So whats worked for Golmaal 3? In terms of humour and performances, its better than the first two films. It was the first choice of most moviegoers this Diwali, says trade analyst Taran Adarsh.        
	Like Ballygunge resident Shalini Agarwal. Golmaal 3 was my first choice because I love the familiarity of the characters and the kaleidoscope of comic colours it has come to be known for.

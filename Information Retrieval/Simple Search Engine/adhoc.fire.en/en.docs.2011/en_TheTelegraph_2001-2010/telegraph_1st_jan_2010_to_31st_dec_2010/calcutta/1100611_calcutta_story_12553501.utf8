The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Boys score with eye on Joburg
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Boys score with eye on Joburg
          RITH BASU                                            
	Messi dribbled past Lucio and Kaka sped past Heinze on the slushy turf of Cotton Mill-er Math in Howrah as the young guns of Dasnagar Juba Sangha battled it out in country colours on World Cup-eve.        
	We have a strict rule that everyone should wear our blue and yellow jersey even during practice. But the boys pleaded that they be allowed to play in their new Argentina and Brazil jerseys, so I decided to relent for one day, said chief coach Ramen Das, who is also coaching the George Telegraph team this season.        
	The Juba Sangha kids had a ball when for the last 15 minutes of practice Das let them play a friendly between the two nations (but both on home ground). We have never played like this before. I felt as if I was actually playing for Brazil against Argentina. The game made us even more impatient to watch the World Cup, said Swagatam Das, 15, a fan of Robinho.        
	There is clearly a spring in the step of the budding footballers in various academies around town as the countdown to the Cup reaches a crescendo and the boys want to just play on and on.        
	You have to pretend to lose your temper to get them off the turf at the end of a practice session now, laughed Subrata Guha, the coach of a camp being run by the Putiari club of Kudghat in association with the state sports department.        
	What does watching the best in the business on TV do for the boys on the ball back home? It does them a world of good, stressed Anjan Banerjee, the chief coach of Dukhiram Majumdar Coaching Scheme.        
	Every other day, some kid or the other exhibits some dribbling skill newly picked up and says, Sir, please check if I do this like Ronaldo or if this turn is like Messi....That is a very good sign because football is one game where you can learn a lot by just watching, said Banerjee.        
	So, coming soon to a para pitch (or pavement) near you  a Ronaldo step-over or a Messi dribble.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Buddha balm for students
          OUR BUREAU                              (Top) Rouvanjit Rawla; Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee				                                 
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee stressed the need for an academic environment free of fear in schools for the all-round development of students while making a statement in the Assembly on Thursday about the death of Rouvanjit Rawla.        
	Physical and mental torture of school students interferes with their natural development. For the all-round development of children it is necessary that the schools do not create an environment that evokes fear among them, said Bhattacharjee, referring to how the La Martiniere for Boys student had been caned four days before his suicide on February 12.        
	The chief minister said police investigation had shown that Rouvanjit was a happy child... full of life who was not attentive about his studies and was prone to play truant and be up to mischief with his friends for which he was often hauled up in school. The principal on February 12 had told Rouvanjit he wanted to see his parents, he added.        
	For Ajay Rawla, Rouvanjits father, the chief ministers statement marked a step forward in the quest for justice for Rouvanjit. The chief ministers statement gave me confidence that no one will have to go through the thing that Rouvanjit had to face and that is the most important thing for me, said Rawla.        
	Officials at La Martiniere for Boys also applauded the chief ministers statement and felt that it would help usher positive developments in the school education system.        
	La Martiniere has proactively taken initiatives that are very much in tune with what the chief minister has said today, said principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi, who has apologised to the schools board of governors for caning Rouvanjit and promised to do away with corporal punishment on campus.        
	The school has amended its Service Rules, classifying corporal punishment as a misconduct that would draw major penalties, and is in the process of creating a redressal forum and drawing up a code of ethics for teachers.

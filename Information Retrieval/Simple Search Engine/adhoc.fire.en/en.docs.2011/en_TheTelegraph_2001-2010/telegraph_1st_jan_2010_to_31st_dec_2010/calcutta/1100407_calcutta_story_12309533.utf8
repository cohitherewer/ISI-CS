	A car trying to overtake another vehicle knocked down a woman and her three children at Tiljala on Tuesday morning, the mishap resulting in a Bypass blockade for an hour.        
	Akhtari Begum and her children, all aged between four and six years, were crossing the Bypass at Panchannagram around 10.30am when a Park Circus-bound Maruti Omni lost control and hit them.         
	The driver lost control while trying to overtake another vehicle, said Bokul Mondol, a witness.        
	Akhtari and her children were taken to National Medical College and Hospital where the mother and one of the children were admitted. The other two were released after treatment.        
	Residents and shop-owners blocked the Bypass demanding the arrest of the driver and protesting lax policing on the stretch. The driver was arrested soon after but the blockade continued for an hour. When the stretch was cleared at 11.30am, there were long lines of vehicles on the Bypass stretching several kilometres.

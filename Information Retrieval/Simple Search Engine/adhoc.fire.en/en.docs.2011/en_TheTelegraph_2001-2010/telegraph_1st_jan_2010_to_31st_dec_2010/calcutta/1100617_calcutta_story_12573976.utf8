The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stay on Stephen Court probe
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stay on Stephen Court probe
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The city sessions court on Wednesday stayed the probe into the Stephen Court fire till a petition by Sanjay Bagaria, a director of the firm that manages the Park Street landmark, comes up for hearing on July 7.        
	Bagarias petition challenged the proclamation notices issued against him and two other directors  Sushil Kumar Sureka and Pradip Kumar More  of Stephen Court Ltd that has its office at 23 NS Road.        
	On March 23, a devastating fire had raged through top two floors of Stephen Court, killing 43 people and injuring over 100.        
	The chief metropolitan magistrates court issued arrest warrants against the trio  the prime accused in the case  after the detective department failed to trace them.        
	But the directors continued to be elusive, prompting the court to issue proclamation notices against them on May 18.        
	People slapped with such notices have to turn up in the court within a month to avoid being declared proclaimed offenders, whose properties the police are free to attach. Bagaria moved court just two days before the deadline for turning up was to pass.        
	Since the order has stayed the probe, we are considering moving the high court against it, said a police officer.

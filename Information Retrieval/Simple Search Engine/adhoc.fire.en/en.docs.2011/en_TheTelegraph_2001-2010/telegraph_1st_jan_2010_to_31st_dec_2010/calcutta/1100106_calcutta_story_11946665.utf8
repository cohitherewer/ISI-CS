The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | No chopper? Farooq hails a cab
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      No chopper? Farooq hails a cab
  - Union minister certifies city safe for VIPs wanting to travel by taxi          OUR BUREAU                          Abdullah after visiting Jyoti Basu. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                         
	A Calcutta cab may be no substitute for a motorbike with a young Shabana Azmi riding pillion, but Farooq Abdullah did wear a big smile after his taxi adventure in town on Tuesday afternoon.        
	The energetic 73-year-old Union minister for renewable energy, scheduled to head for IIT Kharagpur from the city airport by helicopter around 11am, left his security entourage sweating by hailing a taxi to go to the Salt Lake campus instead after low visibility forced the flight to be aborted.         
	Clad in a sherwani and his trademark cap, Abdullah later shrugged off concerns over his security  he is on the hit-list of several terror groups  by saying he was protected by Allah.        
	And what was the cab ride like? It was an adventure. The driver was also very nice, and I think it is safe to travel by taxi in Calcutta without security personnel, Abdullah told Metro after a visit to AMRI Hospitals in Salt Lake to meet the ailing Jyoti Basu.        
	Cabbie Jhagru Rai  initially unaware about his VIP passengers identity  had driven Abdullah, his secretary, a bodyguard and the deputy director of IIT Kharagpur to the Salt Lake campus of the tech institute around 12.30pm. The fare was Rs 190 but I got Rs 250, he smiled, though auto driver Dipak Haldar had made double that amount by ferrying a stranded Mamata Banerjee till the airport on December 28.        
	IIT deputy director A.K. Mazumdar said Abdullah  who rode a bike through Gulmarg in 1984 with his favourite actress riding pillion  had asked for a taxi even as his secretary informed the home department that the helicopter ride had been cancelled. He didnt want to wait for a bullet-proof car. I sat in the taxi with some degree of concern, he added.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen later said no inquiry would be required.

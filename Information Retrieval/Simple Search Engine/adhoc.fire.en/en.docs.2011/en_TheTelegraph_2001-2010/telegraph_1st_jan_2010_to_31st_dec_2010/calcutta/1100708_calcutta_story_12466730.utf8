                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Luxury wheels duo set for city roll-out

	Two premium marques are revving up to zoom into Calcutta. While Nissan from Japan is scouting for a dealer, Audi from Germany will throw open the doors to its first showroom on Friday.        
	Both brands will bring their entire range of cars and provide workshop facilities.        
	Nissan wants to debut in the city before the launch of its made-in-India hatch Micra this month. The company, which has opened pre-order bookings for the car, needs a showroom to display it to potential customers.        
	Calcutta has responded favourably to the Nissan Micra. We have received over 75 enquiries from the eastern region, said a spokesperson for Nissan Motor India.        
	The showroom, spread over 6,000sq ft, will be in line with the Nissan Retail Visual Identity guidelines and norms and will display five to six cars, according to the spokesperson.        
	Apart from the Micra, the showroom will display the Teana, X-trail and the Nissan 370z. The dealership will also have a workshop spread over 25,000sq ft. Audis first dealership, at 9 AJC Bose Road, has been functioning informally and has already made 22 deliveries.        
	The 6,500sq ft Audi terminal with its characteristic black curve inside and a honeycomb aluminium faade showcases the A4, A6, A8, Q5, Q7, R8 and the Audi TT. The four-ring company emblem is embossed at the reception. The dealership comes with a shop that would sell customised products and Audi branded merchandise.         
	After a years delay prompted by the economic meltdown and a dealer pullout, the premium brand from the Volkswagen group is set to complete the super luxury German troika of Mercedes, BMW and Audi in the city.        
	Audi expects to sell 100 cars in the city in 2010, said a spokesperson for Audi India.        
	The eastern India market would grow by about 40 per cent in 2010, he predicted. Audi, which has a market share of 22 per cent in the luxury segment nation-wide, hopes to cash in on this growth.         
	We will have a state-of-the art workshop on the EM Bypass, behind the PC Chandra Gardens, that will be ready soon, said Manoj Mehta of Audi Kolkata.

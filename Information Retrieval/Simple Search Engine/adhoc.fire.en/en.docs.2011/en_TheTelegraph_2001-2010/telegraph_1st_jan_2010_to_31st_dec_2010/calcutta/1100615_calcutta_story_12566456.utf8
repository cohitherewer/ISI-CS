                      An appreciation of Indian film theory                    Father Gaston Roberge has long been a prolific and perceptive analyst of the media, in particular the Indian media. His pedagogical initiatives have enriched the cultural life of Calcutta, and his books and articles have continued to stimulate, edify and energise all who are interested in the media. His latest book, The Indian Film Theory: Flames of Sholay, Notes and Beyond, is both a summation of his work as well as a departure from it. In it, Roberge focuses on the celebrated Bollywood hit, Sholay, and constructs a theoretical analysis of why the film was so successful with audiences. The reasons for its popularity, he argues, can help us understand the implicit theory  or theories  with which Indian filmmakers work. The author emphasises the need to abandon the antiquated distinction between art cinema and commercial cinema, which continues to blight todays academic film scholarship. He believes that, as far as Indian films are concerned, it is emotional content that is of the greatest importance, not intellectual or social analysis. Using examples from the work of Satyajit Ray, including Pather Panchali, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne and Ashani Sanket, Roberge shows how even that pre-eminent exponent of the so-called art film operated with the fundamental principles of Natyashastra. Moreover, this book also reprints some of Roberges earlier publications, some of whose conclusions he now disagrees with. It, therefore, not only provides fresh food for thought but also charts the intellectual and cultural trajectory of its author. Readers will find it an inspiring volume, a book to learn from and debate with. This evening, filmmaker Mrinal Sen will launch the book to be followed by an interactive session with the author. Hosted by St Xaviers College and Sampark Publishing.                  Event: Launch of Father Gaston Roberges The Indian Film Theory: Flames of Sholay, Notes and Beyond When: Today at 5 pm Where: St Xaviers College, 1st floor, Room

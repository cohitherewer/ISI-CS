                      Life and nature        A self-made artist without any institutional training, Sumana   Ghosh has developed a spontaneous, yet unconventional   style of expression that does not conform to any set norms. Since her first solo show, her naivety of expression has undergone a great transformation. Her recent works are straightforward   and ser-ene, but inward-looking, lucid and subtly humorous. In   them, a search for an identity of her own has an intimate relation with her environment, often serving as the primary theme of   most of her paintings. Despite their simplicity, her works occasionally reveal a melancholic and rebellious tune that grows   out of her intimate love for the environment she lives in. Her   love for nature and the environment has also influenced her   ideas and forms. In Intimacy, the ongoing fifth solo exhibition   of her drawings and paintings, she makes a silent suggestion   as to how art can project an identity of our own selves and still   remain committed to indigenous culture and tradition. Her   works portray scenes from nature and everyday life, but at the   same time they give the impression of being figments of her   imagination or a fantastic dream. Though bright and colourful   in design and composition, her works are poignant reminders   of our failure to remain in touch with nature in our daily lives.

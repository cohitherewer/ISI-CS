The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | At 90, he still plays it straight 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      At 90, he still plays it straight 
          JAYANTA BASU                      Siddhartha Shankar Ray (in picture above by Jayanta Basu) watches every ball being bowled by India against South Africa. The 90-year-old Eden veteran was all praise for Hashim Amla rsquo;s technique and temperament but rubbished Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee rsquo;s claims of being a cricket follower, referring to a picture of him playing a cross-batted shot (below).                                 
	Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly not Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	A dream batting order picked by the oldest spectator at the Eden Gardens, who has hardly missed a Test here in 75 years.        
	I like him (Buddhadeb) otherwise but he does not understand cricket. The other day I saw a photograph of him playing a cross-batted shot, admonished Siddhartha Shankar Ray, whose political stature and legal acumen can only be matched by his passion for cricket.        
	Find another 90-year-old in the ground, challenged the former Bengal chief minister, watching every ball being bowled at the Eden from a VIP box.        
	Rays debut at the Eden was as a teenager in January 1934, when he remembers watching Douglas Jardine hook Muhammad Nissar.        
	Today, as he watches Hashim Amla sweep Harbhajan Singh, with a lunch plate on his lap, his appetite for Test cricket appears undiminished.        
	In 1934, I first came to the Eden buying a Rs 8 ticket. At that time the batsmen used to play so straight, recalled Ray.        
	In the modern era, Gavaskar, Tendulkar and Sourav stand out.... Sourav should not have retired. He had lot of cricket left in him and I recently told him that, said the man who had once fought a legal battle to protest the suspension of Ganguly by the ICC.        
	An Eden Test has scored over everything in Rays busy book. Even politics. Once Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, the then President, came to Calcutta while a Test was on. I was chief minister and he requested me to accompany him to Delhi. I said no way, not while a Test was on at the Eden! smiled Ray.         
	Among political friends and foes, he considered Jyoti Basu to be a keen cricket watcher, but not his successor. As a chief minister he (Bhattacharjee) should not have interfered in cricket administration, said the man who became CAB president when not the chief minister.        
	All through the sporty trip down memory lane, Ray had an eye on the 22 yards, chastising Ishant Sharma for bowling too wide or too short, enjoying Amlas technique and temperament, and praising the curator for a wonderful pitch.        
	So who was his favourite batsman at the Eden? Not Sunny, not Viv, but Nirmal Chatterjee! I have not seen anybody like him at the Eden. He was almost lyrical, said Ray, of the Bengal all-rounder from the late-30s to the mid-50s.        
	At the end of a great day of Test cricket  he was there from 11am on Thursday till Harbhajan scalped Morkel  Ray came back home in a very happy frame of mind. Not just because India won but also because Amla played a great innings.        
	As the ramrod-straight man, 90 years young, put it: Whether in cricket or in life, one does not succeed without a straight bat.

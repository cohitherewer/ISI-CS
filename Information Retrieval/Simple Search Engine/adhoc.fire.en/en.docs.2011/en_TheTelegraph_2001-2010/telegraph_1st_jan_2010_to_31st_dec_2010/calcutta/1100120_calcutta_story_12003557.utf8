The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Last visit turns clock back at Assembly
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Last visit turns clock back at Assembly
          RITH BASU                          Rathindranath Bhattacharya. (Rith Basu)                                  
	Jyoti Basu had first entered the Assembly in 1946. His last visit to the building, in a hearse, opened the floodgates of memories for old employees who remember Basu as a no-nonsense administrator as well as a sympathetic politician.        
	Jyotibabu had the sort of personality I have never seen in any other politician in my 32 years of service, said Jayanta Kumar Majumdar, who had served as marshal (internal security) of the Assembly from 1976 to 2008.        
	Majumdar recalled a sit-in by some Opposition members in front of the chief ministers office in the Assembly in the late 70s or early 80s. I was accompanying Jyotibabu, who was CM then, with a dozen guards. After spotting the protesters he suddenly quickened his pace and was amongst the protesters, unguarded.        
	I heard him ask the Opposition members in his characteristic matter-of-fact tone: Ki byapar, apnara ekhane ki korchhen (Whats up, what are you all doing here)? By the time we reached the spot, he was making his way through the demonstrators. Before entering his office, he turned around and said: There is no power in the world that can stop me.        
	Rathindranath Bhattacharya retired last April as chief reporter of the Assembly. His job was to note down the proceedings in the House.        
	Jyotibabu had bailed me out on several occasions when I was a junior reporter. One day he had made two statements in the House but I could not hear a word because of the ruckus between the Treasury and Opposition benches, said Bhattacharya.        
	Ignoring advice from his seniors, he went straight to Basu and identified himself. I didnt even have to tell him what I wanted. He handed me a bunch of papers containing both statements.        
	Bhattacharya also recalled with gratitude how Basu used to spell out the English words in his speech for him.        
	Lakshmi Pal, who was an Assembly guard during Basus tenure as chief minister, said: Whenever he saw me he would raise his hand to acknowledge my presence.

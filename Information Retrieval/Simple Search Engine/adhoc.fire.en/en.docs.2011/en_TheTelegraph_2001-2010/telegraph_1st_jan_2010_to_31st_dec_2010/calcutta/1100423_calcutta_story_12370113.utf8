          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Sleuths arrested two men on Thursday for allegedly siphoning off over Rs 1 lakh from a Korean womans bank account using her lost debit card.         
	The duo used the card to buy gold coins and to refuel their car, said an officer.         
	According to the police, Jeongsan Noh, a leather exporter who was in the city on business, had lodged a complaint after she received a text alert on January 23 saying that Rs 96,000 had been debited from her account.         
	Nohs bank told her that her card had been used to buy gold from a private banks branch in Shyambazar on January 22. She also learnt that Rs 12,000 was debited from her account the same day, said city detective chief Damayanti Sen.        
	Noh told the cops that she didnt know when she lost her card. The sleuths scanned the CCTV records of the Shyambazar bank and zeroed in on a youth who had bought gold worth Rs 96,000.         
	They then traced the machine used for the second transaction on January 22. We raided the place in Ultadanga and nabbed Pradip Bose, a middle-aged man who runs a small business. He had installed the swipe machine said the officer. Bose led the cops to his associate Sujit Singh, the youth who had bought the gold.         
	The duo have been remanded in police custody till May 6.

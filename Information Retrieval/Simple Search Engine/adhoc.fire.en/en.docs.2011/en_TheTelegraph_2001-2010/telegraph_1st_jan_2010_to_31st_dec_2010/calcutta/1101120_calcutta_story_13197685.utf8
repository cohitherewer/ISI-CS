          OUR BUREAU                              
	A magistrate on Friday refused to accept the chargesheet against the La Martiniere for Boys principal and three other teachers for Rouvanjit Rawlas suicide and asked police to include a harsher charge that carries death sentence as the maximum punishment.        
	The police have charged principal Sunirmal Chakravarti under IPC Section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means).         
	The other three  L.J. Gunnian, David Ryan and Partha Dutta  have been charged under Section 23 of the Juvenile Justice Act.        
	Apurba Kumar Ghosh, the 12th metropolitan magistrate, ordered the police to include IPC Section 305 (abetment to suicide by child) in the chargesheet.        
	While offenders under Section 305 can be punished with death sentence or life imprisonment, those under Section 324 have to spend only three years behind bars. The maximum punishment under Section 23 of the Juvenile Justice Act is two years in jail.        
	Rouvanjit, a Class VIII student, was found hanging at his Alipore home on February 12, four days after being canned by the principal. Father Ajay lodged a complaint with Shakespeare Sarani police station against the teachers under Section 305.        
	The principal and the other three were arrested but released on bail as the police had slapped them with lighter charges.        
	Rawlas lawyer Amitava Mukherjee pleaded that the cases be started under Section 305.        
	The magistrate asked the police to include Section 305 in the chargesheet and sent the matter for trial to the sessions court. The trial should start from December 14, the magistrate said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crash, repairs clog traffic
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Crash, repairs clog traffic
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A mishap and a road repair project that cops claimed to know nothing about combined to cripple traffic on perhaps the busiest stretch of BT Road for over four hours on Wednesday.         
	Traffic movement was completely stalled north of the Dunlop crossing from 10am to 2pm because the public works department (PWD) had started repairing Nilgunge Road without intimating us, said an officer of Belghoria police station.        
	The repairs were being conducted about 75m from the BT Road end of the Nilgunge Road. Machines were placed across the width of the road, blocking it. Since the obstruction could not be seen from BT Road, several north-bound vehicles entered Nilgunge Road and then turned back. The resultant chaos affected traffic on BT Road for hours.        
	Around 9.30am, a truck collided with a car on the Shyambazar-bound flank of BT Road, starting the traffic troubles. A long queue of vehicles had formed on the flank before the truck and the car were towed away about half an hour later.        
	Officers from nearby Belghoria police station later detained PWD sub-assistant engineer Kiriti Sarkar, who was supervising the repairs. The engineer was released in the afternoon after his superiors took up the matter with police.        
	North 24-Parganas police superintendent Rahul Srivastava said they had asked the PWD to inform them in advance before blocking a busy thoroughfare but the government wing did not do so.        
	PWD officials claimed they had been working on the stretch for the past six days. We are working with specialised machines to repair the 4.85km stretch between Dunlop and Sodepur station. The police were well aware of our work and yesterday, too, we had told the traffic inspector at Dunlop about the project, said A. Dey, assistant engineer, PWD (Baranagar circle).         
	According to the PWD, the repairs could not be carried out at night since residents had objected to the noise made by the machines.        
	Those who were stuck had no patience for the blame game. I was to reach Shyambazar by 2pm for an important appointment but could not. I hope the police and the PWD sort out the mess by tomorrow, said commuter Asit Chatterjee.

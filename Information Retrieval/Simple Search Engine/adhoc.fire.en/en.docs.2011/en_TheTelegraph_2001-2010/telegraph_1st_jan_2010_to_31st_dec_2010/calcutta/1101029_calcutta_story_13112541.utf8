The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Break the barriers between Bharat and India
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Break the barriers between Bharat and India
          SOMAK GHOSHAL                                    A few items that will be on display at CIMA Gallery from Friday as part of Yeh Image Mahaan: India Meets Bharat. Pictures by Aranya Sen				                                 
	The Empire is no longer interested in striking back. On the contrary, it is speaking with a voice of its own, not to or at the West, but rather to whoever would care to listen. And it is increasingly becoming impossible to ignore what it has to say.         
	Few will be able to resist the temptation to stop and pay heed to the young artists whose works are being shown by CIMA Gallery at an exhibition opening Friday entitled Yeh Image Mahaan: India Meets Bharat.        
	From the classical to the colloquial, from the profound to the profane (as the catalogue puts it), there is a bit of everything in this show for everyone. But its thrust is to break the barriers between high and low art, between subaltern and sublime imaginations, between rural and urban sensibilities.        
	The result, to quote Rakhi Sarkar, the curator, is a heady confluence of India and Bharat. If there is Shakila and Mayank Kumar Shyam, artists with no conventional academic training, giving us their versions of the turmoils of 21st-century India, there is also a number of highly-qualified men and women striving to forge an original visual language. While acknowledging their debt to Western traditions, they do not want to lose their indigenous bearings.        
	So, like the pioneers  Abanindranath Tagore, Jamini Roy, M.F. Husain, Bhupen Khakhar or Jyoti Bhatt  they are engaged in ingenious experiments. It is important, says Sarkar, that young artists get a platform to explore their creative impulses unhindered by the strictures of the market.        
	This explains the presence of some compelling installation art in this show. The towering scale and sheer vibrancy of the two carnivores, one by Sumitro Basak and the other by Ashish Ghosh, suggest, as it were, a shedding of inhibitions. There is a severe energy in Kingshuk Sarkars muted, but darker, minimalist vision. In Manas Acharyas video, the fall of the twin towers is juxtaposed with cosmic churnings, albeit with a touch of bleak comedy. And of course, there is the serpentine book, made by Basak, trailing on the floor and framed by alpona  a work of exquisite and eccentric power. From the entrails of fish being cleaned to the worms and snakes that infested his ancestral home to the Maggi noodles he ate as a child, Basaks snake-book is a repository of a myriad memories, many of which will have personal resonances with the viewers.        
	Much of the imagery in this show is drawn from popular culture  from posters, advertisements, billboards and other images that fill up Indian cities and small towns. So, in order to add an extra dimension to the viewing experience, the curator has included a couple of rather unusual pieces.        
	Not many Indian galleries will be adventurous enough to give space to advertisement campaigns that have had a distinct impact on the popular imagination. But Sarkar has given a different spin to the intellectual context of the show by including the storyboards for the advertisements designed by Rediffusion for the Airtel campaign featuring the actor, Sharman Joshi. These advertisements are played in loop on a television in a room that has been redecorated to simulate a typical middle-class drawing room.        
	Other campaigns, one based on the peculiarities of South Indian politics, draw attention as well.        
	The show is on till November 20.

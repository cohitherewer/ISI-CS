                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      3 diagnosed with swine flu 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A youth and two children were detected with swine flu on Thursday.        
	State health department officials said the condition of a 25-year-old man, admitted to Woodlands Hospital, was critical. Among the other two whose blood samples tested positive for swine flu are a nine-month-old boy from Salt Lake and a 12-year-old boy from Dakshindari, on the northern city fringes.        
	With the detection of the three cases, the number of people in the city affected by the H1N1 virus that causes swine flu has gone up to 12.        
	The 25-year-old patient from Bhowanipore is being treated at Woodlands Hospital. He is suffering from chronic renal failure and had recently gone to Vellore for treatment. It seems he had contracted the virus there, a health department official said.        
	The patient has been shifted to an isolation ward. Health department officials will visit him on Friday, sources said.        
	The nine-month-old boy from Salt Lakes Basanti Devi Colony was admitted with fever to Bidhannagar State General Hospital four days ago.        
	His blood sample was sent to the National Institute for Cholera and Enteric Disease-Indian Council of Medical Research laboratory, where the H1N1 virus was detected. He has been shifted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beleghata. The 12-year-old boy from Dakshindari, too, is being treated at the Beleghata hospital.        
	Credit card fraud: Two youths were arrested on Thursday for allegedly hacking credit card details and using them to recharge their prepaid cellphone connections.        
	Bishan Shaw, 23, the owner of a PCO in Khardah, and Mushtaq Ashraff, 21, a BA student, were arrested in Khardah by a cyber crime team of North 24-Parganas police.        
	Arnab Dewanji, a Lake Town resident, had complained in November 2009 that his credit card statements had shown an expenditure of Rs 48,929 incurred on recharging some unknown cellphone connections. The cops zeroed in on the duo by tracking the numbers that were recharged using Dewanjis credit card.        
	A bigger racket is at work. We suspect a few employees of various banks are involved, said an officer. Cops, however, are yet to know about the modus operandi of Shaw and Ashraff.        
	Seven held: Seven persons were arrested in Howrah on Thursday when they were about to board a bus for Bajkul in East Midnapore. Three firearms and 10 rounds of cartridges were found on them.        
	Trader shot: Tapan Samanta, a 26-year-old trader, was shot dead by a bike-borne gang in Mahendra Bhattacharya Lane in Howrah on Thursday evening. Police said Samanta, who owned a jewellery shop in Ramrajatala, was earlier seen engaged in an altercation with the gang members.         
	Artist dead: Artist Ramlal Dhar, who taught at the Government College of Art amp; Craft, died after a prolonged illness on Wednesday night. Dhar, who had graduated from the same college, went for training to Nice in France. He leaves behind his wife, Sohini Dhar, who teaches art at Rabindra Bharati University.

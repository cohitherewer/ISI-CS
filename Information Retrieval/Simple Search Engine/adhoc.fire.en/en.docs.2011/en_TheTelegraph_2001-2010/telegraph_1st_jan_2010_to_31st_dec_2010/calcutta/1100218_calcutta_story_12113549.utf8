The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SC rejects musician appeal 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      SC rejects musician appeal 
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed tabla player Pandit Sanjay Mukherjees plea against a lower court order asking him to pay interim monthly maintenance of Rs 3,000 each to his divorced wife and daughter.        
	In May last year, Calcutta High Court had upheld a plea by Mukherjees ex-wife Chitti and daughter Ranika seeking enhanced maintenance.        
	Son of musician Sasanka Mukherjee, Sanjay was trained by Pandit Jnan Prakash Ghosh. He has been a regular face on Doordarshan since the 1970s and has played with musical greats in the country and abroad. Mukherjee is married to kathak dancer Sumitra Mitra Mukherjee.        
	He had married Chitti in 1979. A Howrah court had granted the couple divorce by mutual consent on November 21, 1984. Chitti had then agreed to a monthly maintenance of Rs 300 for herself and her daughter.        
	In 2005, they had moved a city trial court claiming that the amount was inadequate and an agreement between a husband and a wife could not overrule Section 125 of the CrPC, which entitles a divorced wife to maintenance.        
	The trial court ruled in his favour but asked Mukherjee to pay Rs 2,000 per month for his daughter. He contested the amount in a sessions court. He had said that his daughter wascapable of earning by coaching students.        
	The judge had fixed an interim amount of Rs 3,000 each for the mother and daughter and had passed on the case to the high court.        
	So long as the daughter remains unmarried and is unable to maintain herself, the father cannot be absolved of the responsibility of maintaining her, said the Supreme Court.         
	The judge also said the earlier maintenance amount of Rs 300 was inadequate for Chitti to sustain herself following rise in prices.        
	The terms of compromise in a divorce suit cannot be allowed to supersede the provisions of the statute (CrPC), the court ruled and ordered the musician to clear the arrears in maintenance payment.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HS board to fix recheck charge: HC
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court special bench ruled on Friday that the HS board could decide the amount examinees would have to pay for production of their answer scripts in court for re-evaluation.         
	But the HS council would have to fix the amount after taking the courts approval, the special bench, comprising Chief Justice M.S. Shah, Justice K.J. Sengupta and Justice Dipankar Dutta, held.        
	HS examinees unhappy with their marks file petitions praying that their answer scripts be produced in court and re-evaluated.        
	The special bench had to be set up after two division benches made different rulings about the amount to be deposited for re-evaluation of answer scripts on the courts order.        
	A division bench headed by Justice G.C. Gupta had ruled that the HS council should not charge more than Rs 500 for the re-evaluation process. Another division bench headed by Justice A. Banerjee held that the council would fix the amount of deposit and the court would approve it.

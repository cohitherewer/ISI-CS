          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Over 700 students of Seacom Engineering College in Dhulagarh, Howrah, gheraoed the principal and 40-odd faculty members on Tuesday morning to protest the lack of placement facilities and irregular classes. The gherao was yet to be lifted till late on Tuesday.         
	We paid Rs 3.47 lakh for the four-year course, but the authorities are not doing anything to help us with jobs, said one of them.         
	We were told electrical engineering students would be given placements but the process will start only in January, just three months before our course ends, said a student of the department.        
	Vice-principal Sonali Sarkar said: We have placements for everyone. The students are agitating as they want to meet the chairman. He has said he will meet them on Friday.         
	Hunger strike: Chhatra Parishad and Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad supporters at South Calcutta Law College on Tuesday went on an indefinite hunger strike in front of principal Debashis Chattopadhyays office demanding the expulsion of three students belonging to the RSPs Progressive Students Union. The trio had allegedly harassed freshers.

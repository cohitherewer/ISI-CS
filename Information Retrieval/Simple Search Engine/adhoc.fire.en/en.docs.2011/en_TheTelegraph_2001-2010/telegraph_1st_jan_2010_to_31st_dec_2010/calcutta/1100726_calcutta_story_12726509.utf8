                      Mercy to the merciless                    Conventional ideas of war involve fighting an enemy outside ourselves. A monster with a label, a terrorist or a rebel. Not someone within. Besides Iraq and Afghanistan, Ryan Lobo has travelled to Liberia to shoot a story about a brutal warlord who claims to have personally killed more than 10,000 people. In the midst of incredible poverty and loss, he watched people who had nothing, absolve a man who had taken everything from them. Hosted by Seagull Foundation for the Arts and Tasveer, War And Forgiveness, a series of photographs by Lobo, captures controversial subjects about war and its impact on innocent civilians with empathy and insight. The exhibition can be divided into three categories. Liberia, which depicts a war criminals search for redemption in the aftermath of a civil war; Afghanistan, which shows the Taliban-backed heroin trade in that country; and Baghdad, which portrays a city under conflict and the lives of its people during war. Lobo says that war enjoys exciting press in our storytelling tradition. Photographs of men firing guns and charging forward make for great selling visuals .... But that is not all. He discovered from his experiences that those who suffer also have a tremendous capacity to forgive. Out of suffering and sorrow come a deeper understanding of the world and its humanity. It is this valuable sentiment that Lobo seeks to articulate through his work.                  Event: An exhibition of photographs by Ryan Lobo When: Till July 31; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

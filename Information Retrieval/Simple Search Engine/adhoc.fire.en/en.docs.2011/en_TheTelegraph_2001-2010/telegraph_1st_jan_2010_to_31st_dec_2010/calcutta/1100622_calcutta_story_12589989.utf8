                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Car hits pregnant woman
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 40-year-old pregnant woman was hit by a speeding Ambassador in front of Udayan housing complex off the EM Bypass on Monday morning.         
	Rinku Pal, a member of the housekeeping staff at the condominium near the Ajoynagar crossing, was returning to work after having tiffin at home around 9.30am when the mishap occurred. She was admitted to Peerless Hospital. Doctors said the condition of Rinku and the baby was stable.        
	The woman had cuts and scratches all over her body. She also sustained injuries on her chest and a bone in her right hand was broken, said Sudipta Mitra, the medical superintendent of the hospital. Rinku was crossing the feeder road in front of the housing estate when the car  with West Bengal government displayed on a board in front  slammed into her, said her colleague Bhim Halder.         
	The driver hit the brakes but could not stop the car as it was moving too fast. He picked up Rinku and a shop keeper from the area saying that he would take her to Peerless Hospital, added Halder.        
	However, he drove straight to Patuli police station and surrendered. From there, the shop keeper took Rinku to the hospital in a taxi.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Eight research institutions from across the country will set up their units at a research and development zone in Baruipur, where the state government has earmarked 500 acres for setting up the new district headquarters of South 24-Parganas.         
	The list of institutions include the Defence Research Development Organisation, The Energy and Resources Institute, Spice Board and the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science.         
	The land has been allotted and will be demarcated by next month. Construction would begin after that, said Vivek Bharadwaj, the CEO of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA).         
	Speaking at Infra East, a CII forum, on Thursday, Bharadwaj said: Apart from the township, the R amp;D centre and the district headquarters, the zone would also have space for commercial development, for which we seek private participation.         
	The CMDA is also seeking private participation for Kolkata Business Park, which is coming up on 100 acres in Nonadanga and for developing 17 acres of water body off the Bypass, near Ruby General Hospital. The authority will invite private players for designing a convention centre besides Alipore Central jail as well.

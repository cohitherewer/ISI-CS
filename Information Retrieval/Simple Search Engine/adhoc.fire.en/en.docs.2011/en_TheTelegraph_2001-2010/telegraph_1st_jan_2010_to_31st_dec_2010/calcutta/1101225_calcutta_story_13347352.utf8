The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Night of revelry and day of gifts
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Night of revelry and day of gifts

	Camaraderie was the key at The Saturday Club Xmas Eve, presented by Seagrams Blenders Pride Magical Nights and The Telegraph. Model Jessica Gomes was the emcee as the young andnot-so-young partied the night away to DJ Whosanes chartbusters and singer Swastika.                   Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray

	Fun and food, drink and dance was the formula on the CC amp;FC greens at the Seagrams Blenders Pride Magical Nights, in association with The Telegraph. Later at night, the party rocked to the sounds of Live Martini from Chennai on stage followed by DJ Sachin at the console.               Picture by Pabitra Das

	The Tollygunge Club greens came alive to the tunes of DJ Akbar Sami and Hip Pocket on Friday night as Chivas presents The Telegraph Xmas Eve ushered in Merry Christmas. The bonfire and the bamboo grove, the groovy tunes and yummy platter picks made for an evening well spent. ()

	In the build-up to Christmas, as first the chief minister and then the challenger choked Esplanade with rallies, Metro asked its readers: What Christmas gift would you give Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee and why? We pick and choose...                        FOR HIM
            
	 The best Christmas gift for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would be peace of mind. It is high time he quit and gifted himself an early retirement. The best gift for Mamata Banerjee would be prudence. She is short on forethought and her party is reckless.        
	Virendra Jaiswal                 
	 Id gift Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee something for his vocal chords in the run-up to the Assembly polls and a pair of roller skates to Mamata to help her reach people in distress even faster.        
	Diptimoy De (Barisha)                
	 Centre Fresh for Buddha, Chloromint for Mamata.        
	Basudeb Bhattacharya, Salt Lake                          FOR HER
            
	 Neither deserves any gift from us. Together they have ruined the state. Today the rest of India doesnt even count Calcutta among the important cities. The only thing one gains from Calcutta is persecution in the name of bandhs, roadblocks, corruption and useless politicians.

	 I would not like to gift anything to either. Both have brought only shame and disgrace to Bengal.

	Youve hugged him, tugged at his beard and loved his presents. Now your kids probably do the same. Meet Alan Marshall, Calcuttas very own Santa Claus for 22 years. Alan has been ho-ho-hoing at Dalhousie Institute since 1988. The offer came to me because of my size. My friends at DI said look, hes the perfect size and colour. He wont even need padding, he laughs.         
	For most of the year, Alan is a retired mechanical engineer who manages Floriana, off Park Street, but come December-end and he slips into Santas big red costume and dons a bushy white beard, making the Xmas tea party at DI merrier. Its lovely watching the starry-eyed kids. The naughty ones try to pull off the beard, every year, smiles the 59-year-old.                  
	But playing Santa is no party. Once the false white eyebrows went missing, so I had to get mine coloured with ink whitener! It was impossible to take it off later. Another year we used commercial glue instead of stage glue to put on the beard and moustache and my face broke out in a terrible rash, he recalls.        
	Like Father Christmas, Alan does it for the joy of giving something to kids, who bring a smile to our faces and refuses to make it a profession.        
	So what does Santa want this Christmas? I wish children would learn more about the real story of Santa Claus and why he comes with presents, he says.

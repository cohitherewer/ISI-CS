										      Fashion is doing its bit to turn the citys young into miniature adults                                     
	Victoria Beckham says her seven-year-old son Romeo wants to run her fashion label.               
	Romeo apparently loves fashion. He likes to go out in a suit with a bowler hat hes a real fashion lover, says the wife of David Beckham.         
	Calcuttas very young may not be far behind Posh Spices little one. Children everywhere are dressing up like adults and the city is no exception. Previously the little girl who dressed like her mom would be called precocious: now she is just trendy.         
	But no child can escape the pressure of looking like an adult, dressing like one, smelling like one. Fashion and the beauty business are doing its bit to make children grow up fast.         
	Walk into a childrens clothes store  there are several high-end ones, and their number is increasing  and what do you see? The age bar at nightclubs might not have been lowered yet to allow 10 and 12 year-olds to groove the night away, but the slinky, sequinned dresses, long or short, in seductive hues and cuts will do justice to any dance floor.         
	Ruched churidars, net kurtas in Anarkali pattern embellished with kundan work, striped jersey dresses, balloon hemlines, tiered dresses, empire-line dresses, crushed gypsy skirts (like Kareena wore in Kurbaan), and peasant tops, leggings and tunics, floral print dresses, folded denims. Just a range of kidswear on display at a childrens chain store.         
	The boys have three-quarters, mock shirts with tees and jeans with lots of zips and chains.        
	I like to wear t-shirts and denims. Shorts are too kiddish, says designer Agnimitra Pauls seven-year-old son Vighnesh. After watching 3 Idiots I got him cute t-shirts with cartoon drawings on them because they are so in, but he thought them too childish. He has no faith in me. It doesnt matter that I am a designer, laughs his mother.         
	My 10-year-old daughter Upasana likes to wear shorts and noodle-strap tops. Accessories are important. She just got a haircut to match Priyanka Chopras in Pyaar Impossible, says Joyita Bose.        
	For the feet there are metallic ballerinas, jootis, boots and sandals, to complement each outfit. The prices are comparable with adult stuff.         
	Fashion for kids has definitely become more mature in the past one year. For example, leggings and tunics are very in now. That is a grown-up trend, says Dhananjay Shetty, brand manager, Pumpkin Patch, a childrens store. The brand has two major collections every year: summer and winter. They also have a festive wear range for the pujas and Diwali.         
	If the mind boggles at that, it topples and falls to pieces at the sight of the toiletries and accessories.         
	Some cosmetics brands offer lipgloss and nail colour for children. If Clinic Plus is wooing young consumers with the promise of Barbie hair clips, hair bands and other accessories, the shelves of Little Shop, Zapp, Pumpkin Patch and other kids stores are filled with stuff that fantasies are made of (see box).         
	The accessories market is growing at the rate of 40 per cent per year, says Shetty. My two-year-old daughter saw a girl slightly older than herself wearing a string of beads around her neck at a party and liked it. I got her one too and she is inseparable from it now, says 28-year-old Chandreyee Banerjee.         
	The market for kids products is increasing by about 20 per cent per year, says Kuntal Roy, distributor for Johnson amp; Johnson. Little Shop is soon to open a 2,500 sq feet store in the Forum Courtyard that will have everything but clothes.         
	Kids fashion today is an extension of what the parents are wearing. The trend has been there for the past two years, agrees Shiv Daswani of Little Shop.        
	Is it that parents are easier to imitate than before? Or is it that children are plunging straight into adulthood, as far as appearance and lifestyle go? Is the generation gap disappearing?         
	Blame it on globalisation and its regional variations. As women in the cities get trendier, wear salwar kurtas, pants, skirts, her daughter finds it more exciting to wear what she is wearing. The child probably wouldnt always want to wear a sari if the mother wore one.         
	On TV and in the media in general, too, children see other children dressing and behaving like adults, sometimes with very adult emotions, expressions and thrusts, as any dance competition is evidence. In their homes, children of nuclear families, sometimes one-child nuclear families, live with only adults.         
	And then there is Hannah Montana everywhere. And Kareena Kapoor. And John Abraham. And Hrithik Roshan. All fashion icons and all childrens role models. A childs world is turning very adult.         
	So children are also being driven to salons in droves for the right hairstyle, waxing and threading and pamper packs. And some are being turned away.         
	The mother of an 11-year-old recently gave her daughter a birthday gift by taking her to the salon. The child got a haircut and hair spa done for Rs 1,500. Another mother had no qualms about marching into a salon with her two daughters, one was a student of Class IV, the other of Class II. She wanted the younger daughters previous haircut corrected and discussed with the stylist whether the older girl should get some soft layers to frame the face.         
	Twelve-thirteen year olds are now coming to the salon to get their eyebrows threaded. I think its still a little too young. I would have preferred them to be 15. But I draw the line at 13, says beauty expert Bridgette Jones.         
	If a young girl wants a chemical treatment done, I dissuade her. Every day I have to turn away some kid or the other, she adds.         
	Usually the kids listen. We try to give them a funky haircut, or an alternative look and they go away happy, says beautician Priscilla Corner.         
	Doctors are disapproving of the beauty business. Even a natural fruit pulp can be too sensitive for the skin. Hair treatments have to take into consideration everyones different hair type. Continued hair removal can make the follicles visible. These things are best avoided till the body has matured, says dermatologist Debasis Bose.         
	But who cares for a doctors opinion? IT professional Smita Agarwals 11-year-old has already started occasional pedicures and manicures, and her mother thinks she may soon demand facials too.         
	Psychologist Anuttama Banerjee blames it on lost childhood. It is the adults who are responsible. Their lack of creativity has surrounded the kids with adult toys and merchandise. Take for example the Barbie. That doll is not very child-like, she says.         
	When Barbie entered the little ones world, all the world over, with her mature, perfectly sculpted body, boyfriend Ken in tow, many little girls got the message that they were miniature women. Now Barbie has entire lines of fashion and accessories, which are quite popular.         
	How many little girls can escape the lure of coming so close to Barbie?

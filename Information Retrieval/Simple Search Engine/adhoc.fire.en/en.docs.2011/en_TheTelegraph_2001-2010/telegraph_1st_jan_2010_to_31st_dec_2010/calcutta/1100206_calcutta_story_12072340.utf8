                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mystery calls before death
          OUR BUREAU                          Samata Maloo. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Samata Maloos mystery death followed not one but two mystery calls from her cellphone.        
	The 18-year-old Shibpur resident, who was found dead not far from Lalbazar on Thursday evening, had called friend Neha Agarwal around 4pm asking her whether she would come to the tuition class.        
	She said she, too, would come. But when I reached the class, a few blocks away from her home, after about 20 minutes, Samata was not there. A couple of hours later, Samatas elder brother Kuldip came running to my house asking about her, recalled Neha.        
	Kuldip was alerted by the second mystery call from Samata, which came around 6.20pm. The girl cried out Im in trouble, save me before the line went dead. Kuldip immediately called her back but a stranger answered, saying the girl he was looking for was found unconscious on a pavement of Ganesh Chandra Avenue. Police later took her to Medical College and Hospital where she was declared dead on arrival         
	Sleuths probing the Class XII commerce students death are trying to figure out what had happened between the two calls. To know the truth, we need to find out why Samata skipped the coaching class despite telling her friend that she would turn up and what problem she was referring to when she called her brother moments before her death, said an officer.        
	The post-mortem report suggests the death was caused by a fall from a height of 40-50 feet. The police suspect she had fallen from an abandoned corner on the fourth floor of a highrise at the crossing of Ganesh Chandra Avenue and Bentinck Street.        
	We are probing the case from all angles and have not ruled out murder, said city detective chief Damayanti Sen. We are trying to find out whether the girl came to the spot alone or was accompanied by one or more persons.        
	Sleuths said there was no apparent reason for Samata to come to central Calcutta as none of her relatives, friends or acquaintances lived there.        
	The viscera and the contents of the stomach have been sent for tests. According to medical records, Samata had fractured her spine, two ribs and the hip and right thigh bones in the fall.

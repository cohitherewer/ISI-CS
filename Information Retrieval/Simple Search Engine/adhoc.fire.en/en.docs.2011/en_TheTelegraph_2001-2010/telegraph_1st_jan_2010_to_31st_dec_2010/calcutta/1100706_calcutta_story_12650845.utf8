The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro to mud roads
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Metro to mud roads

	The Garia Sreerampur area in ward 110 is a study in contrast. It is connected by Metro but commuters have to take kutcha roads to reach Kavi Nazrul station from their homes. The residents here are victims of civic neglect and apathy that has stemmed from political rivalry.        
	The area, under railway minister Mamata Banerjees Lok Sabha constituency, had allegedly been ignored by the Left Front board at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation since it is surrounded by Trinamul Congress strongholds.        
	Garia Sreerampur has practically no metalled road or proper drainage facility. Even a brief spell of rain is enough to inundate the area.        
	Street lights are few and during monsoon, most of them go on the blink.        
	Roads have not been metalled in Mondolpara, Baidyapara, Naskarpara and Sapuipara. Residents of the area said they had not seen their councillor or the borough executive engineer in more than 10 years.        
	The ward has been under the control of the CPM. In the recently concluded civic elections, CPM candidate Chandana Ghosh Dastidar won from the ward.

	Development work in wards are carried out according to the direction and requisition of the local councillor. If the roads are kutcha there, it is because the councillor has not taken any initiative to make them metalled, said P.K. Bose, the executive engineer of Borough XI.        
	The previous councillor Dipa Roy said: I have never received any complaint from the local people about roads or anything else. We had undertaken a few projects but because of the civic elections, they have all been stalled.        
	After a Metro Railway ride to Kavi Nazrul station, passengers have to take the unmetalled Sreerampur Kutchha VIP Road to reach the EM Bypass.        
	After the Metro station came up, only a small strip of the road was metalled. The rest is in such a state that even rickshaw pullers refuse to ply. on the stretch.         
	Metro connectivity has, however, pushed up the land prices through the roof. The pace of urbanisation has also picked up. Population in the area is increasing fast but the basic civic amenities are absent.         
	I had no idea that such an undeveloped area exists in Calcutta. The biggest problems here are the kutcha roads, lack of drainage facilities and absence of surface water. Waterlogging is a regular feature during monsoon. We never think of buying a car because the roads here are not motorable, said Sandip Mitra, a resident of Briji Road.        
	Another resident Robin Naskar said: I have never seen our councillor here. Contractors work when and how they please and there is none to supervise them.         
	The roads here are not at all safe for children who have to go to school daily. I would love to invite our councillor to the locality on a rainy day, said Sikha Patra of Briji Naskar Para.

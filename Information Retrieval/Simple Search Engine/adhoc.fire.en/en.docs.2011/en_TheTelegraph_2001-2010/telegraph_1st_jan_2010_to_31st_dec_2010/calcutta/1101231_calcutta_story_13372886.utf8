The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City leads the way in music law compliance
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City leads the way in music law compliance
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta is once again on the (copy)right track this party season.        
	Party organisers in town have already made around 250 payments to music owners for rights to play their tracks at the year-end shindigs, leading the way in copyright compliance among the metros.         
	For the few who have not paid up yet, Mumbai-headquartered Phonographic Performance Ltd (PPL)  the copyright society for sound recordings  obtained an injunction from Delhi High Court on Wednesday, restraining them from broadcasting or performing tracks owned by its 240-plus members.        
	Calcutta has provided us a model that we have replicated elsewhere. The help we have received from the government, police and the media has also played a big role in enforcing copyright laws here, said Sowmya Chowdhury, country head (events) of the PPL.         
	The society, which opened its first office in Calcutta in 1941, started enforcing copyright laws in 1997.         
	In those days, only All India Radio and a few Mumbai discos used to pay us. Around six-seven years ago usage of music in public exploded. But awareness about the copyright act was low, recalled Chowdhury.        
	In 2004, the PPLs city chapter moved court for the first time to seek an injunction against party organisers refusing to pay up. We sent around 200 legal notices that year.        
	Over the years, compliance has steadily increased. Organisers now queue up in front of the PPL office in Salt Lake before party nights.        
	So is there hope of the city recording a zero-default New Years Eve yet?         
	Of the defaulters listed by PPL, a representative of Manor Floatel told Metro on Thursday that the requisite licence fees would be deposited by Friday.         
	Another organiser, Tangerine Banquet at Silver Spring on the Bypass, said it would need to first clarify with the society if the music it intended playing at a private party was within the scope of payment.         
	If yes, we would certainly pay, said a representative of Tangerine.

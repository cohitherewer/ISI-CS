The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rule-flout vehicles clog airport artery 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rule-flout vehicles clog airport artery 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Vehicles move at a snails pace on Jessore Road near Patipukur on Sunday. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                  
	The stretch of Jessore Road between the Nagerbazar crossing and Patipukur has become a commuters nightmare.        
	I take nearly 20 minutes every day to reach the Lake Town crossing from Patipukur. The journey should take less than five minutes, said Jayanta Das, who lives in Belgachhia.        
	Residents blame their traffic woes on the violation of rules by vehicles that ply the stretch that many take on their way to the airport.        
	Nobody follows even the most basic traffic rule and there is no policeman to catch the violators. Vehicles plying down the wrong flank and parking in the middle of the road are common, added Das.        
	Infrastructure projects at different points on the stretch have worsened the traffic situation.        
	Snarls are common at Patipukur where the road has been dug up by the CMDA to build an underpass. We expect to complete the project by December, said Debdas Bhattacharya, the chief engineer (traffic and transportation) of the CMDA.        
	At Duttabagan, laying of sewerage pipes has narrowed the artery. The intersection of Jessore Road and the VIP Road connector in Lake Town is another hurdle.        
	Three autorickshaw stands and regular violation of traffic rules in the absence of cops keep the area perpetually clogged.        
	Vehicles coming from Patipukur and heading to Lake Town make a right turn at the crossing. Vehicles coming from Lake Town and going towards Nagerbazar also make a right turn at the crossing. The two sets of vehicles often come to a halt, blocking each others way, said a shopkeeper in the area.        
	During peak hours, nobody cares to wait even a second and allow another vehicle to pass, said Pratibha Samanta, who lives in Lake Town and takes an auto to Belgachhia Metro station on weekdays.        
	The Nagerbazar-bound autorickshaws stop on the eastern flank of the road and the autos plying between Lake Town and Belgachhia Metro station have their stand on the opposite side of the road. The stand for autos plying between Lake Town and Ultadanga is located a few feet away, on the VIP Road connector.        
	The crossing can easily be decongested if the auto stands are moved a few metres from the crossing, Samanta added.        
	Buses also stop in the middle of the road to pick up passengers. Earlier, a traffic cop used to be deployed here. But for the past three months, cops have not been seen at the crossing, said a resident.        
	Construction of a flyover at Nagerbazar has also hit traffic flow in the area.        
	Buses that used to ply from the Nagerbazar stand are now parked in the middle of Jessore Road near Amarpalli because the road near Nagerbazar has been cordoned off, said a shopkeeper in the area.        
	The police admitted that vehicles plying without any restrictions had been causing traffic problems in the area.        
	We will try to keep men posted there but it all depends on the availability of personnel, said a senior officer of North 24-Parganas police.

	A youth with several criminal cases pending against him was stabbed to death in a garage on Garcha Road early on Monday.        
	Police said assailants had stabbed 26-year-old Pappu Rai, who used to sleep in the garage at 60A Garcha Road, in his chest and then in his head with a knife.        
	To make sure he was dead the gang also exploded a bomb, the sound of which jolted residents awake around 5.30am. Pappus left hand got severed in the blast.        
	The motive for the murder could have been business or gang rivalry or even a tiff in personal relationship, said an officer of Gariahat police station.        
	The youth, who lived in the locality, had extortion cases as well as cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act pending against him in Gariahat police station. Of late, he had started a business of supplying building materials, the officer said.        
	During the probe, the police contacted a woman who had lived with Pappu for a few years till they got separated seven months ago.

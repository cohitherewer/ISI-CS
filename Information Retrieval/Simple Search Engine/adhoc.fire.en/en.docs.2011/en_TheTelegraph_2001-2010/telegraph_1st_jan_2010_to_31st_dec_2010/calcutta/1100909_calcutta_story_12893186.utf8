The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Helping hand to beat cancer 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Helping hand to beat cancer 
          RITH BASU                            Mishtu Roy Biswas when she was undergoing chemotherapy (above) and now                                 
	Mishtu, a six-year-old girl who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in February last year and forced to be off treatment for a month after her familys funds ran out, is now on the road to recovery with help from readers of The Telegraph.        
	Its like a dream for me that my daughter is getting better fast. In July 2009, when my savings ran out and I had to bring her back from Vellore midway through a chemotherapy session, I had thought that I would lose her, said the girls mother, 31-year-old Saptami Roy Biswas.        
	Arpita Bhattacharyya, a consultant paediatric haematologist and oncologist with Apollo Hospitals, where the Tribeni girl is being treated, said Mishtu had responded well to treatment. The last bone marrow test we did six months ago showed no sign of leukaemia. Mishtu only has to complete another 11 months of maintenance, which involves taking mostly oral medicines, to recover fully, she said.        
	Mishtu was a normal child till severe joint pain and swelling forced her to quit school in February 2009. After tests confirmed cancer, the family started treating her in Calcutta before being advised to take her to Vellore, where their funds ran out.        
	Back in Tribeni, after Mishtu was without treatment for about a month, an NGO called Swayam provided her medical funds for a while. The monetary problems were solved for good after Mishtus news was published in Metro (5-yr-old in fight with cancer, November 26, 2009).        
	The doctor had said we would need Rs 5 lakh for Mishtus treatment. Readers of The Telegraph deposited close to that amount at CMRI Hospital, where the girl was being treated, and Swayam. Some people deposited cheques in my account as well. Employees of some IT companies set up a fund to pay for the medicines, said Saptami.        
	One of the techies who had spoken to people and put up posters in his office to arrange funds for Mishtus treatment, described her recovery as one of the most gratifying experiences in his life.        
	We were moved by her picture in Metro. The article said there was 75 per cent chance of her getting cured if she was treated properly. So we had tried our best to garner funds and are very happy following her recovery.        
	The only worry is that the girl has contracted Hepatitis B during one of her many blood transfusions over the past year, though it is not hampering her liver function.        
	Mishtu is back to her sprightly self. She has rejoined Devendranath Primary School in Class I, right where she had left off. Fittingly, her favourite among the songs she sings at school is We shall overcome.

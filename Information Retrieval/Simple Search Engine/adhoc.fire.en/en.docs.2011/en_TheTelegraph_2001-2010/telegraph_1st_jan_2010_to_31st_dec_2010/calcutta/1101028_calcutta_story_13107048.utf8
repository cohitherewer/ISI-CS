The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seal on hawker right to pedestrian path
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Seal on hawker right to pedestrian path
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The cabinet on Wednesday approved the states hawker policy with an eye on the Assembly election votes of 3.25 lakh hawkers and another 12 lakh dependants, officially robbing pedestrians of their right to easy passage.        
	State urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya cited the Centres National State Vendor Policy 2009 for the policy shift that gives hawkers permanent pavement rights.        
	The beleaguered Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government appears desperate to legalise hawkers  giving them identity cards and also one-third of the pavement  by enacting the policy in the next Assembly session.        
	The Left Front, which has nearly 80 per cent majority in the 294-seat Assembly, should not have a problem getting the act passed in the House.        
	Trinamul  which also believes in the hawkers right to the pavement  has been drawing up its own hawker blueprint.        
	The idea of trying to formulate such a policy without consulting the mayor of Calcutta is a joke. Now I do not want to be consulted. We have our plans for and with hawkers, which will be revealed when the time is right, mayor Sovan Chatterjee told Metro on Wednesday evening.         
	But wasnt it Advantage Hawker to the CPM for now? Let them pass whatever law they want. We can change such absurd laws easily when the people vote us to power, said Chatterjee, attacking the state government for finalising the policy without consulting the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).         
	Bhattacharya, however, stressed that Trinamul leaders did not attend the consultations after the government came out with its draft proposals in April even as the trade unions and hawkers bodies took part in the talks.        
	We have finalised it after consulting all concerned and we will implement it, he said.         
	Green activist Subhash Dutta, who had sought the courts intervention in 2002 to remove hawkers and speed up traffic in Calcutta, said that the policy would be misused and the pedestrians would lose all right to the pavement.        
	The matter is still pending before the high court as the court had sought the states views on hawkers in the central business district. The government has bypassed the court. Before announcing the policy, it should have informed the court, said Dutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chilly day after cold night
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Chilly day after cold night
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Monday was slightly warmer than Sunday but still cold enough to force Calcuttans to layer up before going outdoors even in the afternoon.        
	The maximum temperature rose three degrees to 20.1 degrees Celsius, seven notches below normal, while the minimum climbed down to 10.9, three notches below normal.        
	The maximum temperature on Sunday was 17.2 degrees Celsius, 10 notches below normal.        
	The cloud cover cleared partially but the sky was sufficiently grey to block out the sun, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Calcutta and other parts of eastern India are facing a phenomenon called cold day  marked by a drop in the maximum temperature by five or more degrees below normal. Met experts have attributed the drastic fall in the mercury to two cyclonic circulations on either side of south Bengal.         
	Tuesday is likely to remain as cold as Monday. The ongoing condition will persist till Tuesday afternoon. The sky will start clearing up after that, resulting in a gradual rise in the maximum temperature, Debnath said.        
	Tuesday was not as windy as the past couple of days. The wind speed was less compared with Sunday or Saturday. Thats another reason why Tuesday was slightly warmer than the past two days, said an official from India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi.        
	The weatherman said Tuesday would be partly cloudy with fog in the morning. Temperatures are likely to range between 21 and 13 degrees Celsius.        
	Fog conditions will prevail across the entire Indo-Gangetic plain, including south Bengal. Cold day conditions should fade out completely by Wednesday, an IMD official said.        
	The minimum temperature, however, would be low, thanks to a strong northerly and northwesterly wind flow. A western disturbance is likely to reach Bengal later this week.

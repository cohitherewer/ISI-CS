	All-night adda at the pandal, offering anjali on Ashtami, feasting on elaborate community bhog and catching up with friends and family. Not at Maddox Square or Mohd Ali Park, but at your apartment puja.        
	For, KKN Group presents The Telegraph Hand In Hand 2010 promises to make the home puja action-packed and impossible to stay away from.        
	Starting off with 15 addresses in 2003, The Telegraph Hand In Hand now has a presence in 100 apartments across the city. Lake Gardens to Lake Town and Behala to Beleghata, the ninth edition of The Telegraph Hand In Hand promises four days of festive fun, with a variety of contests and a host of prizes.         
	Sit-and-Draw to Spot Quiz, Antakshari to Three Minutes to Fame, there is something for every member of the family. Show off those flowing tresses at the Bajaj Almond Drops Beautiful Hair contest, check your compatibility quotient with your partner by signing up for Sriman Srimati or strut your stuff on the ramp at the Pantaloons Style Icon male and female contest.        
	From the young to the not-so-young, all our residents wait to participate in the Hand In Hand events every year, says Nirmal Chandra Saha, member of the Millennium Tower puja committee in New Town.        
	Everybody looks forward to Hand In Hand events like Dandiya, Dhunuchi Naach and Shankha Dhwani. We cant think of Puja without these events anymore, adds Sobhakar Sarmah of Green Tower Apartment in Golf Green.                  
	Then there are all those prizes to be won for contests galore. The Telegraph Hand in Hand is the ideal event for our flagship brand Tripti as our direct presence can be felt in the thousands of kitchens of more than 100 apartments spread across the city during this festive season. I think this is the best possible way to place our brand during the Puja days, says Kausshik Kumar Nath, managing director of KKN Group of Companies.        
	Bonhomie and bonding among residents of housing complexes is what The Telegraph Hand In Hand events aim at every Puja. What makes our puja more fun and exiting are the Hand In Hand events. Our residents are really curious about the programme roster for 2010, smiles Kalyan Surya Gupta of Kasbas Manjulika Cluster-B.         
	So for 100 housing complexes around town, an extra dollop of festive fun is being served up at their doorstep.

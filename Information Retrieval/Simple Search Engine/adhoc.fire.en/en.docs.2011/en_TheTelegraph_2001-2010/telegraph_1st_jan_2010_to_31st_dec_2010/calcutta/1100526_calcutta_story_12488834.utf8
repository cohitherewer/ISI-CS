          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          WORDS OF WISDOM: Participants on Day I of the second mock United Nations conference, organised by La Martiniere for Boys from May 8 to 10. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                        
	La Martiniere for Boys and La Martiniere for Girls kicked off their second mock United Nations conference on May 8 with almost 250 students from 34 schools in 19 cities and a lot of encouragement from chief guest Somnath Chatterjee.         
	The conference will give young people a taste of speaking in a political arena. Until young people come into politics, the countrys development will continue to stagnate, he said.        
	The three-day La Martiniere Calcutta Model United Nations conference had peace as its theme. The topic was chosen given the urgent need of returning peace to todays strife-ridden world, said Pratik Ranjan Das of Class XI, LMB, acting as secretary-general.         
	The idea of organising the mock session arose when students of LMB attended similar conferences at Cathedral and John Connon School, Mumbai, and at DPS RK Puram, Delhi, in 2007, said Class XI student Debayan De Bakshi, acting as the chairperson of the UN Security Council. The first conference was organised in May last year.        
	Each participating school represented a United Nations (UN) member, discussing subjects relevant to the countrys present. We picked topical issues like light weaponry used by terrorists, human trafficking and the use of children in armed conflicts, said Debayan.        
	Addressing students at the start of the conference, Sunirmal Chakravarthi, LMB principal, said: This will give you an insight into problems that plague the world. It will give you the start you need to make a change in society.        
	On Day I, the discussion centred on China. The United Arab Emirates, represented by Birla High School (Girls), accused China of supplying arms to rebel hands in Africa. To which China, represented by Bishop Cotton Girls School, Bangalore, said that China had bilateral economic relations with African countries and supplied only to the government.         
	La Martiniere Girls College, Lucknow, representing Libya, discussed the role of oil and diamonds in fuelling the arms conflict in Africa. Said Kriti Tripathi, who was part of the Libya team: When we found that we were to represent Libya, we were a little sceptical. But we took it as a challenge and learnt a lot about Muammar al-Gaddafis governance tactics.        
	The civil war in Congo, the Darfur crisis and the Israel-Palestine conflict were the topics of discussion on Days II and III.        
	A lot of research went into making the session a success. We read books, researched on the Internet to find out logical solutions to the problems we discussed, instead of merely engaging in a debate, said Yash Saraf, acting as the chairperson of the General Assembly.         
	At the end of the three-day session, DPS RK Puram and DPS Rohini from Delhi, Cathedral and John Connon School, Mumbai, and Modern High School for Girls, Calcutta, won the secretary-generals award for the best delegation.

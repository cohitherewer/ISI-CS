	The Beverly Hills man who once taught Madonna and Michael Jackson yoga was given a painful lesson in rowdyism in his hometown late on Wednesday.        
	Bikram Choudhury was abused by local toughs at his home near Triangular Park over a parking fee row with his guests that turned ugly. The vandalism that left cars and windows at 125 Rashbehari Avenue  where dancer-actor Mamata Shankar also lives  damaged, and the celebrity yoga guru nursing an injured thumb, led to the arrest of the chief rowdy.        
	Bikram Choudhury had guests at his place late on Wednesday and there were seven-eight cars parked in front. Dhananjoy Mandal, who works for the CMC-authorised Geetanjali Fee Parking Cooperative Society, along with a group of two-three others tried to extort extra parking fees from them, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters). This led to an altercation and Mandal went on the rampage with seven-eight others. He has been arrested and charged with extortion and vandalism.        
	The two celebrity residents of the four-storeyed building told Metro that Mandal and gang were regular troublemakers. Ive heard that they sit there, abuse people, tease the girls and create a ruckus, said Choudhury. Added Shankar: They get drunk and indulge in hooliganism. We had not protested till now, but on Wednesday we had to call in the cops, who took prompt action.                          
	The yoga guru, in town for a winter break, recounted the Wednesday shocker seated in his flat: We had a gathering of friends and family at home. The guests cars were parked downstairs. Around 10.30pm a friends driver ran up and said some boys were demanding extra parking money and abusing him. When we went down, the group of boys abused us, demanded money and then attacked us. They ran after us with bamboos and bricks and started smashing up the glasses of the cars and windows of the apartment.

	Pool car and taxi owners met transport minister Ranjit Kundu at Writers Buildings on Thursday to push for tax sops and smoother replacement of polluting vehicles.        
	While pool car owners wanted to pay the same road tax as private cars, taxi owners asked the minister to pressure Hindustan Motors to step up the supply of Ambassador taxis.        
	Pool car owners pay about Rs 8,000 a year in tax. They want the amount reduced to around Rs 2,500. We will consider the demand, said Kundu.        
	The minister reiterated that the deadline for submission of applications for replacement of pool cars registered before 2000 was January 31.        
	According to Kundu, Hindustan Motors has supplied over 1,600 taxis since last August and another 1,700 will be supplied by March.        
	Most of the 5,000-plus taxi owners who had applied for replacement of their taxis have not received new vehicles.

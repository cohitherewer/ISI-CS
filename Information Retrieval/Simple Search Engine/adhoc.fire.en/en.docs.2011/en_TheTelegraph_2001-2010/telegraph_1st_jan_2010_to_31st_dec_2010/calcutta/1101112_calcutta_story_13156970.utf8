                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HC hike short of panel award
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The state government on Thursday agreed to offer a higher pay to high court employees but not as much as a panel that included three judges had recommended three years ago.        
	The pay structure of the high court staff is being revised but we cant follow the recommended scale for fear of antagonising the other government employees, said an official in the law department.        
	The five employees unions of the court, which had threatened an indefinite strike from November 18 to press for the implementation of the recommendations, have called a meeting on Friday to discuss the governments stand.        
	We will decide our course of action at the meeting, said D. Mukherjee, of the High Court Officers Association. The unions had observed a 10-day strike in September to press for the same demand.

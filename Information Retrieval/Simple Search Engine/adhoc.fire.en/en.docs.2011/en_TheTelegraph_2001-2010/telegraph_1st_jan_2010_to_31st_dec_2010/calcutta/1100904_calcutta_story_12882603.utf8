The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Boy band with the beat
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Boy band with the beat
          ARKA DAS                          Brinda Badan rehearses on a Tangra rooftop. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	Thermocol boards, paint cans on makeshift stands, large plastic containers, enamel bowls and plates, PVC pipes, mineral water bottles filled with pieces of glass bangles.         
	Such instruments in hand, Brinda Badan, a 10-member army of 12 to 16-year-olds, makes a Tangra rooftop come alive, churning out track after track with infectious rhythms, blistering solos and subtle melodic motifs.        
	Feet start tapping automatically to the bands renditions of dhaak rhythms or the music used in Ganpati festival. And then theres the take on childrens rhymes, from traditional chhoras to Hattimatimtim, where the spoken word melds seamlessly with the musical grooves.        
	In July, Brinda Badan was chosen for the east zone prelims of Colors entertainment channels talent hunt show, Indias Got Talent. Racing past over 500 competitors at Swabhumi, the bunch reached the pre-quarter finals.         
	They wowed judges Sonali Bendre, Kiran Kher and Sajid Khan at Science City auditorium and booked a slot among 48 quarter-finalists at Mumbai. The quarterfinals will be telecast from September 11.         
	The bunch of boys is led by 29-year-old Sanjoy Mondal, who flaunts a khamak  fashioned out of a paint can, a metal string and a hair roller used in beauty parlours  for a new composition.        
	I find a little bit of me in each of the children, Sanjoys face lights up with a smile. Like him, the kids at Brinda Badan live in a Tangra slum. Their parents are sweepers and they themselves have been doing odd jobs from an early age to take home whatever they can. And like Sanjoy, they had faced nothing but rejection from the so-called mainstream.         
	But the band, which Sanjoy founded seven years ago, has changed the lives of Rahul, Biswajit, Pappu, Vicky, Ajoy, Amit, Akash, Surojit and Tapas.        
	I have cleaned sewers and worked as a peon and labourer. At the same time, I always felt a pull towards music, especially rhythm instruments. Some of the kids here are going through the same process. Fortunately, we have a platform where we can try and show them the way to a better life, to live with self-respect, says Sanjoy.         
	Sanjoy knows what it means to earn such respect. As a kid, he would be on the front row watching the sreekhol player at the Kali temple in his Tangra neighbourhood of Marer Bagan, but was not allowed to even touch it! A little older, he ended up buying a dhol, learning how to play the instrument all by ear, and by watching other players in para programmes.         
	His family did not approve but Sanjoy kept practising. In 2000, he joined the Tangra-based theatre production house Indian Mime Theatre (IMT) and started accompanying the troupe in shows around town.        
	He received a scholarship from the state culture department in 2005 to formally study sreekhol. He was also finally given the responsibility of playing the khol at his paras Kali temple.        
	By that time, Sanjoy had formed Brinda Badan. I knew all the children and their families. I handpicked some of them, those who shared a knack for rhythms, and started this as an experiment.        
	The youngest of the troupe, Rahul, now 12, started on his plate, pipe and bottles when he was 5.         
	Brinda Badans first public performance was in 2008, at the Childrens Theatre Festival organised by the IMT. The band has not looked back since. Watching them perform, sarod player Rajib Chakraborty sent their work to the UK-based experimental jazz outfit Pan-Jazz. A collaboration is in process.         
	We feel fortunate to have been born in a slum: it gave us the freedom to make our own instruments. All the materials are readily available, laughs Sanjoy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Writers rewrites rally script
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Writers rewrites rally script
          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          Writers buzzing with life on Tuesday. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                   
	Look ma, no bunking.        
	Writers Buildings recorded a rally-day first on Tuesday with an attendance of above 80 per cent across departments even as the Left Front leadership stood on a dais in the heart of the city to rail against all things Trinamul.        
	Even accounting for the so-called winds of change sweeping across Bengal, it was a shocker  albeit a pleasant one  from the babus who usually dont need a reason to take a break.        
	When was the last time attendance at Writers was normal on a day when the Left Front was holding a big rally in the city? Not once between 1977 and Tuesday, declared a Writers veteran.         
	In stark contrast to Tuesday, around 3,000 of the 7,000-odd workforce had left Writers by lunchtime on July 21, when Trinamul held its annual martyrs day rally at Esplanade.         
	Most of those who headed for Metro Channel to listen to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Tuesday did so only around 5pm.        
	It is a historic day, beamed Sanket Chakraborty, the general secretary of the Trinamul-backed Federation of Secretariat Employees.        
	For the first time since 1977, state employees were not seen leaving the secretariat in droves to attend a rally organised by the ruling Left Front, Chakraborty told Metro.        
	Earlier, attendance would not be more than 25 per cent on days when the Left held a rally.        
	Some would argue that Tuesday was payday for most departments at Writers, when attendance is usually higher than the average of 70 per cent. But a round of the secretariat confirmed that attendance was high even in departments where salaries were paid on Monday.         
	The headcount in all these departments  365 out of 450 in land and land reforms, 480 out of around 600 in PWD, 453 out of 562 in PWD (roads), 83 out of 122 in PWD (catering)  were as high as in the rest.        
	Attendance is usually low in these four departments when there is a Left Front rally. I am really surprised, remarked a land reforms department employee who has worked at Writers for 15 years.        
	Ananta Banerjee, the general secretary of the CPM-backed Co-ordination Committee, claimed that there was usually no diktat from the unions to attend such political events.        
	We leave it to them. We do not force anybody to attend, he said.         
	On why few from Writers attended Tuesdays rally, Banerjee said: I dont have figures. I cannot comment.        
	Employees said it was customary on such days for the department conveners of the West Bengal Secretariat Employees Association, a wing of the committee, to crack the whip in the first hour and organise the exodus from offices.         
	On Tuesday, many of these conveners Arpan Palchowdhury of the finance department, Ruidas Biswas of the transport department and Rajat Chatterjee of the information and cultural affairs department  attended work. So did association general secretary Nityananda Chakraborty, of the finance department.        
	Biswas insisted that there was important work to be done and that he would attend the rally when the chief minister would make his speech.        
	A colleague later admitted what Biswas wouldnt. Many of our leaders and supporters have realised that we might lose the elections next year. Most see no point in dodging work for customary rally attendance, he said.

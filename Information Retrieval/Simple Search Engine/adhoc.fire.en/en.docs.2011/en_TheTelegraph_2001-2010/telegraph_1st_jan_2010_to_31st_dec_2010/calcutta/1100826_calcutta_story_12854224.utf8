The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Triple fault on Setu takes toll
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Triple fault on Setu takes toll
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Vehicles race down the slope leading to the Vidyasagar Setu toll plaza on Wednesday afternoon. (Bishwarup Datta)                                  
	The toll plaza on the showpiece Vidyasagar Setu has turned into a death trap for passengers of even stationary vehicles with reckless lorry drivers, lax policing and lack of upkeep triggering chaos in the queue every day.         
	Seven persons have been killed in stationary cars in the past six months at the toll plaza, where vehicles waiting for their turn risk being rammed from behind during rush hour.        
	A 14-wheel trailer smashed a Tata Sumo Victa ferrying employees of a private firm home while it was standing at the toll plaza on Tuesday evening, killing five of them. Four other passengers, sandwiched between the trailer and a truck in front, are in the ICU of Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. Doctors said their condition was improving.        
	On February 6, a Howrah-bound trailer loaded with logs had ploughed through several cars waiting at the toll gate before toppling over on two taxis.        
	Although most people blame recklessly driven lorries for the accidents on the Setu this year, lack of vigilance and maintenance are also factors.        
	Trailers change lanes without slowing down, elbowing out smaller vehicles on the left or right, said Ashis Thakur, waiting near the plaza on Wednesday. Most lorries slow down only 50 metres before reaching the plaza, which is dangerous for the last car in the queue, he added, glancing at the rear-view mirror.         
	Residents of the area said police deployment near the toll plaza or on the bridge was adequate a few years ago but few cops could be seen patrolling the area now. I have never seen a lorry driver being penalised for breaking rules, said Zeeshan Ahmed, who lives in nearby Kajipara.        
	An officer of the Vidyasagar Setu Traffic Guard claimed that the police could do little because no speed limit was specified. We can only take action against rash driving, he added.         
	Poor upkeep of the bridge makes it even more risky, especially at night. Many of the lights on the flyover do not work. Some stretches are so dimly lit that you cannot even see the road in front. Barely 1.5km from the toll plaza on the Howrah-bound flank, iron strips on the road surface are exposed. These can cause a major accident, said a driver.         
	The top layer of the road is eroded and the steep downward slope on the approach to the toll booths make it difficult for speeding vehicles to slow down in time, he added.        
	The state-owned Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) is in charge of the Setus maintenance. We carry out routine maintenance work, insisted Sadhan Banerjee, its vice-chairman.         
	Overloading is another reason why trucks frequently lose control on the bridge. It is difficult for drivers to control an overloaded vehicle coming down a slope and the police never take action against them, said a resident.        
	A separate lane for goods vehicles at the plaza could ease the problem, according to experts. If one or two lanes are reserved for trucks, the chances of an accident will be reduced during peak hours when there are long queues, said toll booth manager Uttam Patodia.

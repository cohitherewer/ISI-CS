The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | VC hunt hits deadline hurdle 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      VC hunt hits deadline hurdle 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The committee formed to select the first vice-chancellor of Presidency University has failed to draw up a shortlist within the deadline, raising doubts about the availability of a consenting suitable candidate and threatening Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees fast-track schedule.        
	The three-member team was supposed to send the list to the government by Friday September 3 but the higher education ministers office confirmed that no recommendations had been made yet.        
	The recommendations of the search committee have not reached us. They havent approached us for an extension of the deadline either, higher education secretary Satish Chandra Tewary told Metro.        
	The search panel was supposed to hand-deliver the list to the ministry latest by 5.30pm on Friday.        
	Going by the rule book, Presidency needs to have a vice-chancellor by October 7  within three months of the gazette notification announcing the setting up of the university.         
	Higher education secretary Tewary said the government had no choice but to abide by the cut-off. Once the list reaches the higher education department, it is to be scrutinised by minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri, who will then forward it to governor M.K. Narayanan, the chancellor of Presidency University.        
	The government had wanted the search committee to submit the list by September 3 so that it had sufficient time in hand to make the selection process hassle-free. The governor will need at least 15 days to examine the credentials of the candidates. According to protocol, the government cannot ask the governor to fast-track the process, an official said.        
	The buzz in bureaucratic circles is that the government would find it almost impossible to stick to the schedule if the search committee further delayed submitting the list of prospective candidates.        
	It is likely to take at least four weeks for all the formalities to be completed after the shortlist is submitted, an official said.        
	There is of course no rule that makes it binding on the search committee to meet the deadline set by the government for drawing up the shortlist. The government had set September 3 as the deadline for its own convenience given the fact that it cannot push appointing a vice-chancellor beyond October 7, a source said.         
	A day after the search panel was announced on August 2, its convener, Jadavpur University vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh, had told The Telegraph: September 3 will be too early for us to complete shortlisting the candidates.        
	Ghosh was unavailable for comment on Friday. Economist Amiya Bagchi and former Indian Statistical Institute director Sankar Pal are the other members of the search team.        
	A source close to the panel blamed the delay on the reluctance of several candidates with the right academic credentials to accept the job.        
	They had approached some renowned academicians working in reputable institutions in and outside Bengal. But most of them have turned down the proposal. So the panel is facing difficulty in drawing up the list, he added.        
	Of the few prospective candidates who were keen to join the race, none apparently made the cut after members of the search committee failed to reach a consensus on them.        
	Several names have been in the realm of speculation from Day 1, including Mamata Roy, the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, Dhrubajyoti Chatterjee, Calcutta Universitys pro-vice chancellor (academic) and Jayati Ghosh, professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

	Construction of the right-turn flyover leading to the airport from VIP Road will start in October, Union minister Sougata Roy said on Tuesday.        
	Survey and land identification for the project are complete. Construction will start in October, said Roy, the junior urban development minister and chairman of the Airport Advisory Committee, Calcutta.        
	Officials hope the proposed kilometre-long flyover would end the perpetual snarl at the entry to the airport.        
	The project has been delayed by several months following an impasse between the airport authorities and the state transport department.        
	The flyover will connect to a second flyover on the airport premises, which will lead to the upcoming integrated terminal building, said Roy. Construction of the second flyover has started.        
	The Airport Advisory Committee, which met during the day at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, discussed ways to solve the problem of waterlogging in the area.        
	We also discussed several other problems at the airport, including the tout menace, unavailability of pre-paid taxis and traffic management, said Roy.        
	The minister said the city airport had last year handled 80 lakh passengers, double its capacity, and earned a profit of Rs 85 crore.        
	Several new airlines were set to start operations from Calcutta, including chartered flights of Deccan Aviation to Jamshedpur and Cooch Behar and Qatar Airways cargo flight to Doha.        
	A private airline from China is conducting a survey to start operations from here, said airport director R. Srinivasan.        
	Theft: Thieves broke into the Belur Math branch of Life Insurance Corporation of India on Monday night and decamped with computers, fans and clocks worth Rs 50,000. On Tuesday morning, employees found the locks of the front gate and door broken. A complaint has been lodged with Bally police station.

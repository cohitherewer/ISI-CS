The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dengue threat rides monsoon exit delay
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dengue threat rides monsoon exit delay
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	Dengue cases are on the rise compared with last year, fear experts who blame the surge on a prolonged monsoon, a spurt in the mosquito population and a host of other factors.        
	A nine-year-old boy suffering from dengue died at the Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) on Thursday, taking the years death toll linked to the vector-borne disease to at least three.        
	The death certificate of nine-year-old Pappu read: Death due to dengue haemorrhagic fever with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and cardiovascular arrest.        
	In 2009, there wasnt a single death from dengue. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation, however, has denied any dengue death this year.         
	Civic records also say there have been only 155 dengue cases this year against 170 till October last year, a claim most city-based doctors dispute.        
	There has been a significant increase this year in the number of people testing positive for dengue. A change in the physical character of the virus is also apparent, said Amitabh Nandy, a tropical and infectious disease specialist at the Centre for Tropical Medicine and Parasitology.        
	The more the number of infected people, the more the dengue sources, said Nandy. Its a cycle and, this year, both the number of infected patients and the number of infections are high.        
	The disease spreads if an Aedes aegypti mosquito carrying the dengue virus bites a non-infected person.        
	The late exit of the monsoon  at least three weeks behind schedule  has compounded matters. The director of the Institute of Child Health, Apurba Ghosh, said delayed showers had added sting to the disease.        
	We normally start getting dengue cases from June. It peaks during the monsoon and then starts coming down. But with the rainy season lingering, the dengue period, too, is getting stretched, he said.        
	Ghosh said the disease becomes threatening when it strikes a victim for the second time. This is one ailment where you have to be careful even after the fever goes into remission and watch out for the symptoms. If the patient continues to feel uncomfortable, he/she should be taken to hospital at once, he said.        
	The doctor, who had treated Pappu when he had fever, had asked his relatives to keep him in the hospital even after his fever subsided. But they took him home. When his condition worsened, they took him to CMRI on Wednesday.        
	The rise in the number of mosquitoes has caused repellents to vanish off the shelves. On Thursday, Metro was told at the Spencers in South City Mall that it had run out of the electrical mosquito repellents. There has been a 20 per cent rise in the sale of mosquito repellents, said a spokesperson.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      For the broken body of Jesus
										      DEAR MOTHER - Sister shanti                        Princess Diana at Nirmal Hriday in 1992				                           
	Sister Shanti, a doctor at Mother House, worked closely with Mother for many years              
	I joined The Missionaries of Charity because of Mother Teresa. When I was in my 20s, I had read an article in a Bombay newspaper on Mother and her work. I found my calling. I came to Calcutta and joined the mission in 1959. Before I joined, Mother had told me that life would be very tough. We work for the poorest of the poor, she said. But it was her gentle smile and kind words that helped me adjust to the new life and its hardships.         
	Mother sent Sister Andrea and me to study medicine at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital. After getting my degree, I worked in Tanzania in West Africa for 10 years. I returned here in 1980 and since then worked closely with Mother till her death.        
	She always quoted Jesuss saying, I thirst for love and for souls. She said the most important part of the day was the morning and urged us to pray at the chapel in Mother House to gather strength to continue with our work. We call our prayer house the power house. Here we get all the inspiration, enthusiasm and commitment we need to render free, dedicated service to the poorest of the poor.        
	Mother taught us that at the chapel we pray before the unbroken body of Jesus and in the slums and streets, we encounter the broken body of Jesus in the sick, diseased and dying people.        
	At Nirmal Hriday, where Mother would tend to the patients, she would ask them what they wanted. Give me rosogolla Ma, give me puri, they would say. Mother would make sure that their little wishes were fulfilled.                    
	Once she was speaking to a famous neurologist and told him that whenever you treat the poor, God says You did it to me. The doctor was so moved by Mothers words that he started rendering free service for her patients. He does so even now, a couple of times a week. Such was Mothers effect on people.        
	Mother would get a stream of visitors throughout the day and she tried to meet each one of them. She always met her visitors with a big smile; a smile that hid her own pain.         
	She looked straight into the eyes of the person she was talking to and at that moment, he or she was the most important person for her. Mother would listen to their problems with undivided attention and compassion. Then she would try to help them the best way she could. She would frequently write letters of introduction for patients to eminent doctors  she knew they would never say no to her.        
	Mother lived like the poorest of the poor in every way. She had a very small room with no fan. She ate the same food as the inmates and drank the same water.         
	Mother touched the lives of so many people in her lifetime and whoever came in contact with her was transformed for life. Mother had dedicated her whole life to God. I am just a pencil in Gods hands, she would say.         
	Today we miss Mother Teresa but Sister Nirmala has followed in her footsteps and kept her spirit alive. The stream of visitors to Mother House continues and we have sisters from all five continents working here. We draw strength from prayer and the touch of God, just as Mother had taught us.       AS TOLD TO SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI

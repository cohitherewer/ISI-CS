The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SALUTE TO SOME TRUE TOPPERS
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      SALUTE TO SOME TRUE TOPPERS
          SIX STUDENTS WHO SCORED BIG IN OUR BOOK                                    
	Srirupa Mukherjee        
	The Patha Bhavan girl met with a road accident in November, two months before her selection test, and suffered multiple fractures in her left hand and right leg. She went to school in an ambulance and was allowed to answer questions verbally as she could not sit for the test. She filled up her Madhyamik form in an ambulance. She was confined to bed for another two months. She could only study for a few weeks before Madhyamik. She still scored 553 (69 per cent).                      
	Poulami Dutta        
	The shy 16-year-old from Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan cannot write for more than an hour at a stretch, cannot sit for long stretches or walk a long distance. During my history paper, my fingers went numb, recalls the patient of syringohydromyelia, a disorder of the spinal cord, who goes in for surgery next month. She scored 652 (81.5 per cent).                    
	Sushmita Pyne        
	This fighter from Giribala Sarkar Balika Vidyalaya in north Calcutta cannot afford reference books, forget about private tuitions. Her father barely brings home Rs 2,500 per month with which he has to support the family of five. A neighbour taught me math and I scored 98. He also helped me with reference books, smiles Sushmita, who managed an overall tally of 650 (81.25 per cent). She wants to pursue science, her father wonders how.                    
	Sagnik Gupta        
	A thalassaemia patient, he could not appear for Madhyamik last year because of a surgery that did not allow him to study for five months. The student of Shyambazar AV School kept falling ill and missing class, but he decided to fight back. I set myself a challenge that I would not let my health deter me, says Sagnik, who scored 480 (60 per cent) .                    
	Pramit Bhattacharyya        
	The Nava Nalanda boy lost his father during Madhyamik, the day before his geography paper. I was determined to sit for the exam as that is what my father would have wanted me to do, says Pramit, who scored 95 in geography and 700 (87.5 per cent) overall.                    
	Amartya Baidya         
	The South Point boy suffers from parallel nystagmus, a congenital eye disease that prevents him from distinguishing one object from another and reading or writing for over an hour at a stretch. He confuses digits and symbols and uses a magnifying glass to read complex words. He scored 100 in math, 97 in Bengali and 89.3 per cent overall. He dreams of making it to IIT.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Six Pandrol clips were found to be loose on Metro Railway tracks near Tollygunge station on Tuesday morning. An inquiry has been ordered.        
	Around 5.30am on Tuesday, two RPF officers detected the loose clips on the tracks just outside the tunnel during a routine inspection, said a senior Metro official.        
	Maintenance employees tightened the clips before Metro services started at 7am.         
	According to Metro sources, the Pandrol clips probably came loose during the running of trains on Monday.        
	The gangmen who patrol the tracks at night after Metro services stop did not notice that the clips had come loose, said an official.         
	Health camps: The Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the directorate of national vector-borne disease control programme have been conducting health camps in the 15 city boroughs since Sunday. The camps will be run till the first week of October.

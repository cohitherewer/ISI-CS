The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Madhyamik to breach million mark
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Madhyamik to breach million mark
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	About 1,050,000 examinees will appear for the next Madhyamik, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said on Thursday after unveiling the new eight-storey administrative headquarters of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education in Salt Lake.         
	After expressing happiness at the increase in the number of Madhyamik examinees, Bhattacharjee voiced concerns about the thousands of students who would pass the Class X board exams but would not find a place in Class XI.        
	What will happen to those who cannot secure seats in the conventional Plus Two courses? he asked.        
	About 950,000 students had appeared for Madhyamik 2010 and over 700,000 passed. The number is expected to go up next year increasing the competition for the 450,000 HS seats in the state.         
	The chief minister also suggested a way out. Keeping in mind the increased requirement of skilled hands, the best solution is to start vocational courses at the school level. The board will have to take the initiative to start such courses, he said.        
	The new office of the board has been named after Sister Nivedita.

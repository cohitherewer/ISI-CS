The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court seeks malaria report
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court seeks malaria report
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Friday sought details from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) of the funds received and utilised to combat malaria.        
	Pradip Roy, an advocate, had alleged that the CMC had failed to take adequate measures to fight malaria. Based on the allegation, the division bench comprising Chief Justice M.S. Shah and Justice K.J. Sengupta passed the order.        
	As the court had earlier sought details of what the civic body had done to eradicate malaria, the CMC informed the court through an affidavit on Friday that it had opened 136 clinics with diagnostic facilities across the city.        
	Roy opposed the affidavit and claimed the CMCs statement was false.        
	In fact, they have 85 clinics and these do not have diagnostic facilities. Some maternity clinics run by the CMC have been converted into malaria clinics. So the claim of opening diagnostic centres is not true, Roy submitted.        
	The lawyer also claimed that even after repeated orders from the court, the CMC did not launch awareness programmes. The CMC has not done enough to kill mosquito larvae, the advocate claimed.        
	The CMC lawyer, Alok Ghosh, rubbished Roys allegation. The CMC projects and progress of work have satisfied both the donor agencies and the Centre, Ghosh said.        
	Now people are more aware. Even local clubs are offering help in fighting malaria, the lawyer claimed.

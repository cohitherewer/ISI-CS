The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Artificial eye for injured student 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Artificial eye for injured student 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Souvik Hazra, the 19-year-old Asutosh College student who had been hit by a brick during a clash between Trinamul and CPM unions, underwent surgery at a Hyderabad hospital last week to replace his left eyeball with an artificial one.         
	Souviks damaged eyeball has been replaced with a plastic one. He had lost vision in that eye. The surgery will save his other eye, a doctor at LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad told Metro on Monday.         
	The 19-year-old has recovered after the surgery, which was performed on Thursday. I am in no mood to talk to anyone. We are devastated, said his father Bidyut, a state government employee.        
	The second-year English honours student was in danger of losing his right eye too because of sympathetic ophthalmia, a vision-threatening inflammation in one eye triggered by trauma in the other.        
	There is no such threat now as the damaged eyeball has been replaced, said the doctor.        
	Souvik was having tea with friends outside the main gate of the south Calcutta college on December 16 when the clash between supporters of the SFI and the Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad escalated into a brick-throwing competition.        
	The brick that struck the Behala boy caused extensive globe rupture.        
	He was taken to the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology in Calcutta Medical College and Hospital where he underwent an emergency surgery. Next morning, his father got him discharged and took him to Hyderabad.         
	Souvik also has a congenital problem in his right leg.

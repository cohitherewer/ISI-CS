The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | New Town bill deferred
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      New Town bill deferred
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	State housing minister Gautam Deb on Wednesday deferred the tabling of a bill concerning property tax collection in New Town on the request of the leader of the Opposition, Partha Chatterjee.         
	The gesture comes at a time when the political parties in the state are polarised and the two main ones are not willing to yield even an inch to each other in the run-up to next years Assembly polls.        
	The bill, if it was passed in the Assembly and signed by the governor, would have empowered the New Town Calcutta Development Authority to collect tax on plots and buildings in New Town.        
	Seconds before Deb, who is also the chairman of New Town development authority Hidco, was to present the bill in the House, speaker Hashim Abdul Halim told him that Chatterjee wanted the bill to be tabled later.         
	It would have been better had the leader of Opposition specified why he wants me to defer the bill. But he is not present here to explain why he made such a request. Though I am prepared to table the bill, I am deferring it, respecting the principal Opposition partys request, the minister said on the floor of the House.        
	Chatterjee wanted a discussion on the bill in one of the committees before it was tabled in the House.        
	Is Hidco a legal body to collect taxes? Is it even a notified authority? We want discussions on these points before the bill is placed in the House, said the leader of the opposition.        
	Deb deferred tabling the bill because he himself realised that he was doing something wrong, added Chatterjee.        
	Deb claimed he was being accommodating by deferring the tabling of the bill. On Tuesday, however, his government had pushed through the West Bengal Panchayat Board of Education Bill despite stiff resistance from the Opposition.        
	The panchayat education bill will empower the state panchayat department to create a parallel education system with nearly 20,000 rural schools. The department does not have the infrastructure to do so and even members of the ruling party fear that it would impart inferior education to lakhs of children and jeopardise their future.        
	The government is not as accommodating as it is portraying itself to be. It has shown how intolerant it is by pushing through the panchayat education bill. It is difficult to believe that they have turned accommodating overnight, added Deb.        
	A Hidco official told Metro that day-to-day development work at Rajarhat would not be hampered because the tabling of the bill had been deferred. That is why the minister did not let go of the opportunity to go one up on the Trinamul Congress, said the official.         
	If I wanted I could have got the bill passed in the House despite resistance from the Opposition. But the Left Front government does not work like that, said Deb after the House was adjourned.

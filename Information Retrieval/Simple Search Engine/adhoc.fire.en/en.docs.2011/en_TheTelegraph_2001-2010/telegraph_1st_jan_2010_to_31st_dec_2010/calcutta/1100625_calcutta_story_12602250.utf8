The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Glitch-free promise for CAT 2010
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Glitch-free promise for CAT 2010
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The 2010 edition of Common Admission Test (CAT) for the Indian institutes of Management will see several changes aimed at making the process glitch-free.        
	The pen-and-paper test was made computer-based in 2009. But technical glitches prevented about 7,000 examinees from taking the test in the scheduled 10-day period.         
	Many more complained of slow downloading of questions, freezing of the test process mid-way and other problems. The candidates were allowed to take a re-test.        
	To avoid a rerun of the glitches, Prometric, the US-based testing service provider responsible for conducting computer-based CAT, is set to extend the test site preparation period and introduce local technology partners.         
	The local partners will work in the areas of site readiness, test administration and on-site technical support, said Soumitro Roy, the managing director of Prometric, India. Prometric has decided to extend the 10-day window period for taking the test as well.         
	We have recommended an earlier schedule for CAT to prevent a clash with college exam dates, said Roy.

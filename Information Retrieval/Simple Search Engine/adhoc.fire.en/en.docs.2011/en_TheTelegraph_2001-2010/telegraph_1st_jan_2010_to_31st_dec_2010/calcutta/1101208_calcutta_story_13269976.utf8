The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bridge the gap with mind game   Bridge, the boast of Bengal
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bridge the gap with mind game
  - National championship returns to cradle of card-play after nine years          PRATIM D. GUPTA                                          
	If you take it up young, you have fun doing it the rest of your life. A lot of games dont have that depth. This one does.  Bill Gates.        
	A few good men in town would sure agree with the Microsoft man. For, when it comes to bridge, what Bengal thinks still dictates what India does. At a time when every B in the book  from brains to business  is fleeing Bengal, the last B standing (sorry, Buddhababu) seems to be the yen for bridge.        
	Proof? The biggest bridge tournament of the country  the Winter National Bridge Championship  returns to the city after a nine-year lull. The weeklong tournament, last held in Calcutta back in 2001, will take place at the Netaji Indoor Stadium from Friday.        
	The Winter Championship is the summit of Indian bridge in the calendar year, says Arijit Guha of West Bengal Bridge Association, organising secretary of the 52nd edition of the event. When we had the tournament here in 1987, we had a record 288 teams and even in 2001 we had a very healthy 224 teams. This time we are expecting at least 250.        
	Not only does the tournament offer a handsome prize money of Rs 5 lakh (total), it also gives the players a chance to represent India. Says Pritish Kushari, one of the top players from Bengal who has represented India at many an international tournament, The team which goes on to win the Gold Cup will get a crack at the Indian team selection trial. That and the fact that the tournament gets the most number of teams make the Winter Championship the greatest bridge meet of the country.        
	The Indian team of six usually has four or five bridge players from Bengal. Players from the state have been representing the country in World Bridge Championships like Bermuda Bowl and even at the World Team Olympiad on a regular basis, says Guha. You cant really put a finger on why Bengal is good at the game. Maybe because the persuasion levels are high.                    
	Throughout the year, besides national and state-level tournaments, the city clubs  from Union Club to Hindustan Club  keep the game alive.        
	With more money coming into bridge and given the domination of Bengal at the all-India level, more and more players are taking up the game in Calcutta.        
	There is also an effort to maintain the high quality of the gameplay in the state, adds Kushari, who has been playing for close to 30 years. Bridge is very much a part of our heritage and the way new players are taking to the game, I see the trend continuing.        
	A tournament like the Winter National Bridge Championship allows new players to play against or simply watch not only home-grown champions but also those from around the world. Come Friday and players from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are expected to take the table. There is even a lady flying in from the United States.        
	This is one game where GenEx scores over GenX  where an 80-year-old has an edge over an 18-year-old.        
	No wonder Bill Gates seeks out a partner like Warren Buffet when he plays his hand.  
	India rsquo;s pride, Bengal rsquo;s best

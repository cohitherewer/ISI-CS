The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Calcutta shade card
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Calcutta shade card
          On the occasion of Holi, Metro lists the most colourful people in the city, literally or otherwise                                     
	Mamata Banerjee              
	Her language more than makes up for the colour lacking in her clothes. They rush out of her like an angry storm.         
	She treats the crowds like a baby. Before singing the National Anthem at a Trinamul Congress rally in the city about a year back, she said: Ebar keu norbe na. Ami Jana Gana Mana gaibo. Eta khub important gaan (Dont move. I will sing Jana Gana Mana. This is a very important song).         
	The stormy petrel of Indian politics, she is direct, forceful, banal, cute and funny. At a rally in Nandigram, which she was visiting for the first time after her Lok Sabha victory, she called chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee the biggest pickpocket of democracy. At the same rally, she called the CPM thieves  chorer mayer boro gola  and finally blamed them for global warming.         
	She sways slightly on the stage, from one side of the mike to the other, sometimes even stepping around the mike, telling a story, talking about her own life, quoting from Tagore, quoting rhymes. She looks like she belongs to the folk tradition of story tellers. She is loved.         
	In the solitude of the night, she paints flowers. Colours rush out of her brush. But does another person do them? For they can be signed Mamataa, though Didi attributes them to her creative self. Just like my paintings are guided by instinct, so is my signature, she said. She admits, then, that she is at least two persons.         
	Is that why one moment she is the railway minister, next moment she is not? One moment she is with the Centre, next moment she is not? One moment she is smiling, next moment she is not? Though she is almost always screaming, she can change colour fast.         
	Her mood and personality change colour very fast. She can be an entire shade card for your new home, says comedy show host Mir.         
	Does she contradict herself? Very well then, she contradicts herself, she contains multitudes. She can also be mistaken for a mob.        
	Rituparno Ghosh                  
	Just wait and watch. Rituda will walk in like Rekha! said director Kaushik Ganguly of Arekti Premer Galpo, in which Rituparno Ghosh debuts as an actor playing both gay film-maker Roop and jatra artiste Chapal Bhaduri, famous for playing female characters.         
	He walks in, with slow, graceful steps, hair in a bun, light fringes framing his face, dressed in a heavy red zari-embellished sari, and adorned with rich jewellery. His nails are painted red, and so are his lips. A big bindi adorns his forehead. Bold and beautiful.         
	In real life, Rituparnos shaven head is often covered with an artistic turban. He wears make-up  kajal and lipstick, and jewellery. When he sits down, he never forgets to cross his legs daintily. And in a minute, playful laughter breaks out and he punches your arm playfully. Bald and beautiful.         
	From his unkempt, colourless days in advertising, he has made himself up so colourfully as a self-styled film-maker with a unique persona, says Anurag Hira, an advertising professional.         
	Who said there is no third sex? It is for me to decide whether I will stand in the queue for men or for women or neither of the two. I think its important that we realise this now, Rituparno says.         
	Clothes are the man. He is shock-therapy in an otherwise staid Calcutta art-culture-party scene. But in his films he reveals another side: they often deal with sensitive, if not downright melancholy, storylines.         
	Interesting shades.                   
	Kallol Datta         
	Another man who makes womens clothes look special. Designer Kallol Datta is not literally colourful  he is more Goth than rainbow. But his abaya-like clothes, long loose kurtas, printed patialas (sometimes he also wears pants), long wavy tresses, black nails and intense dark Goth eyes make him stand out even when he is crossing Park Street. His accessory bag really is neighbours envy and owners pride. Whether it is his supersize super bling brooch or his purple cloth maala, every piece is worth a snatch.         
	Kallol and his big manbag are often seen in society parties. He socialises but selectively. He likes his music, and a glass of wine, hates to dance and when has to will do so very reluctantly.         
	His mood too is just like him  colourful. Expect the most unexpected prints from the designer  from toilet signs to cockroaches. Ditto for his silhouettes  crab dresses and D for Datta dresses being his signature.         
	His last collection was titled Avant Garde Fck, inspired by everything, from corpses to clowns. Off-colour? Obviously not in fashion circles. He says anything as long it doesnt hurt religious sentiments, he points out. He has a stalker too, he claims.         
	P.C. Sorcar (Jr)                   
	From his colourful costumes on stage, to his even more colourful tricks, which include making the Taj Mahal disappear in front of an elite gathering, nothing about Sorcar is subdued or on a modest scale.         
	For P.C. Sorcar appearance is important. He is a performer, an entertainer and he dresses the part. His turban is richly embroidered and studded with stones and beads, and set up with a feather. His robes made of rich silk are heavily embellished with zari. He wears lipstick and kajal, and his moustache looks painted into a slim line. He is the Maharaja of the Calcutta stage. In no picture is he without his eyes widened, his hands poised in the trademark abracadabra mode. I am an illusionist and an actor. I create illusion... it is nothing but science with magical effects, says the magician.         
	Off the stage, he carries over with him an aura of grandeur  and his accent. The magician speaks with the same sing song of dramatic precision over phone and at parties that he does on the stage. The Waater of Indiaaaaa is one supply that has been abundant.                  
	Usha Uthup         
	Without the help of size zero or a models looks, she has made heads turn by a liberal use of bright silk saris with gold borders, gajras, loads of glass bangles, the bindi with the Bengali letter Ka for Kolkata and personality. The spunky Usha Uthup, who once sang at Trincas in Park Street, shot to national fame with Hare Rama Hare Krishna, would go Kolkata Kolkata later (with innovations to suit any occasion), but she belts out international hits and regional ones with gusto and huskiness. She sings in more than 13 Indian and eight foreign languages.        
	The audiences still oblige promptly when she asks them to clap and sing along, and one wonders how many of the glass bangles she keeps breaking.        
	But she can be one of the masses too  she was just another teary-eyed disciple at Shri Shri Ravi Shankars Maha Shivaratri celebrations in the city recently.         
	Taslima Nasreen                   
	One of her friends once said: Shes either the bravest or the most foolish person Ive ever met. But in this curious journey of hers, Taslima has been like a page out of her own books. More than her writings really, Taslima herself has been a subject mired in controversy.        
	Okay, she doesnt stay in Calcutta, but the roots that she has grown in the city make her an honorary one. Right now, she is in Delhi and has just received an extension of her permit to stay in India for six more months. Then, she doesnt know what. Her online updates include living everywhere to living nowhere to Carpe Diem as she moves around the world from Sweden to New York to France to Delhi.         
	But she has always managed to fend for herself. A doctor, a feminist, a writer, a social activist and a rebel writer who had to flee her native Bangladesh after being hounded by Islamic fundamentalists, has fallen, stood up, brushed the dirt off her sari, got an image makeover, changed into trouser suits, gone on low calorie diets and stepped up to garland a dead Tagore singer in jeans and a Tee just to annoy the annoyable.         
	True, she can sound despondent over the phone about her homelessness. The city has not spared her always  end-2007 saw a politically motivated mob rioting and demanding that the writer leave the city. But then, she can always look up her own website, which lists Rosa Luxembergs words on top: Freedom is always and exclusively freedom for the one who thinks differently.                  
	Rituparna Sengupta        
	She is colourful, literally. She wears a dhakai to watch an IPL. She lists black, white, yellow and blue as her favourite colours. On her person, we get to see a more varied range. Check out the picture.                          
	Mun Mun Sen            
	She could be the Zsa Zsa Gabor of Bengal. It would not be far-fetched to say that like the wisecracking Hollywood actress, her parents named her twice because she had a double helping of looks and brains alike. Cocking a snook at size zero she can still carry off miniskirts, saris... anything, with more pizzazz than ladies quarter her age. Her name was once linked with Imran Khan and her posters in itsy-bitsy bikinis adorned the walls of every young man rsquo;s pad. She was the first Tollywood actress to become a pan-India fashion icon. Before the camera, the inflexible role she was fated to play was that of eye candy, but in real life she had the guts to say outrageous things and did not mind spitting fire at the powerful. And she was sporting enough to brave even the most ridiculous jatras. Once her daughters were grown-up girls, she graciously withdrew from the scene. She continues to be quite, er, visible but only as the proud mother of two budding actresses. Her shock value has not diminished, but that is none of anybody rsquo;s business.

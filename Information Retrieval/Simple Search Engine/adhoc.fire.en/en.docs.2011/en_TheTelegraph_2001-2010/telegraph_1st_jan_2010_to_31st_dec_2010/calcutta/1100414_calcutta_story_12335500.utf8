The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court modifies foul fume ban
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court modifies foul fume ban
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Tuesday barred the state government from enforcing with retrospective effect a transport department order banning old commercial vehicles.        
	The division bench of Justice K.J. Sengupta and Justice M.A. Ghani said the notification  issued on May 24, 2005 and was scheduled to come into effect from January 1, 2006  was valid but held that the decision to ban commercial vehicles registered before January 1, 1990, was bad in law.        
	The bench asked the government to give prospective effect to the notification, which had stated that commercial vehicles registered before January 1, 1990, would not be allowed to ply in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area from 2006.        
	Prospective effect means commercial vehicles registered after the issuance of the notification could be restrained from plying after 15 years. But vehicles registered before May 24, 2005, cannot be banned for their age if they conform to pollution and other norms.        
	Sources in legal circles said Tuesdays order had raised questions on the fate of an environment department order  turned into a judicial verdict by the high court in July 2008  banning commercial vehicles more than 15 years old.        
	Its not clear which notification the state should follow  the transport departments, as modified by the high court, or the one issued by the environment department? wondered a lawyer.        
	Advocate-general Ray said he could answer the question only after going through a copy of the order.        
	Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the environment department, however, said Tuesdays order was not linked to the 2008 verdict banning vehicles 15 years or older.        
	We will continue to execute the July 2008 order. The environment department notification was based on the Air Act 1981 and the Supreme Courts observations on controlling vehicular pollution, Mukherjee said.        
	Will the state move the Supreme Court against the division bench order? We will take a call after a copy of the judgment reaches us, said Ray.         
	The transport department notification was based on Rule 88A of the West Bengal Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, which empowered the government to prohibit the movement of commercial vehicles on the ground of their age.        
	The Bengal Bus Syndicate challenged the order in the high court on the ground that Rule 88A was illegal and hence the notification based on it was bad in law, said Swapan Dutta, who appeared for the petitioner.        
	In July 2006, Justice Jayanta Biswas of the high court ruled that the notification was not in accordance with law.        
	The state then moved an appeal before the division bench.

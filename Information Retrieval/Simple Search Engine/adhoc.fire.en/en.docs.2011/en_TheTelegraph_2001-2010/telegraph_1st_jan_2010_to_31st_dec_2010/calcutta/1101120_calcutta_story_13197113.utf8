          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Friday slammed the school education department for not implementing its directives to stop corporal punishment in schools.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice J.N. Patel and Justice Asim Roy summoned school education secretary Bikram Sen to court and rebuked him for the governments failure in raising awareness about corporal punishment in schools.        
	Its a matter of shame that the government is not taking the issue seriously and paying enough attention to eradicate the evil from society. More or less every day, newspapers report torture of children by their teachers, said the division bench.        
	It directed the school education secretary to carry out the order that it had issued on August 6. The order directs the state to ask media houses to run campaigns against corporal punishment in schools.         
	You will have to carry out the order by November 25. On November 26, the matter will come up for hearing before this court. You will have to attend court on that day and state through an affidavit what steps you have taken on the issue, the bench told Sen.        
	On January 22, the state education department, on the basis of an earlier order by the high court, had issued a notice to the chairpersons of both primary and secondary education boards, asking them to direct all schools to take measures to stop corporal punishment.         
	Schools would have to ensure the protection of children from physical and mental assault, which could lead to serious injury and retardation in growth, reads the guideline.         
	According to it, each school must have counsellors for students and a forum where they can voice their grievances. The schools have been asked to hold monthly meetings where the grievances of the students would be discussed and addressed.        
	When the matter came up for hearing on August 6, advocate Tapas Bhanja alleged before the bench that the government notification had not reached the schools yet. The bench then directed the school education department to publicise the guideline.         
	On Friday, Bhanja told the court that its August 6 order had not been carried out yet.         
	Pratik Dhar, the lawyer appearing for the state, informed the bench that even after repeated requests his client had not sent him any instruction. This prompted the bench to summon the education secretary.

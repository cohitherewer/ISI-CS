                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Man dies after platform fall
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 40-year-old man suffering from tuberculosis died after he slipped and fell near a drinking water basin at Howrah station on Wednesday afternoon.        
	Dilrab Yadav, a resident of Kurlia in Mecheda, East Midnapore, was in the city for treatment. He was on his way back home with his wife when the mishap occurred.         
	Yadav drank water from a tap in front of platform No. 14. He was walking away when he slipped and fell on the ground, said a GRP officer at the station.         
	The labourer soon started to vomit blood and became unconscious.         
	Alerted by the cries of his wife Sukumari, railway officials came to the spot and called a doctor, who declared Yadav dead.         
	According to the doctor, the impact of the fall coupled with Yadavs tuberculosis led to his death. The exact cause will be known only after the post-mortem.         
	There were no marks of injury on Yadavs body but doctors suspect that he was hurt in his chest, he added.        
	GRP suspect that Yadavs disease coupled with the impact of the fall led to his death. His wife admitted that his tuberculosis problem was acute, added the officer.         
	I was in my shop when I saw people assembling in front of the drinking water basin. I saw the man bleeding. GRP officials soon came and took him away, said a stall owner near platform No. 14.        
	After the news of Yadavs death spread, railway workers were seen clearing with mops water lying on the ground in front of basins.

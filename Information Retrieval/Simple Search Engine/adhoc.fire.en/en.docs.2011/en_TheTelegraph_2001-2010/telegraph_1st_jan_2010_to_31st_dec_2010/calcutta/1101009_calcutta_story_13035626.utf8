The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain riddle in Puja countdown
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rain riddle in Puja countdown
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The skies cleared partially on Friday despite persistent spells of rain, raising hopes of some respite over the last weekend before Puja.        
	The depression that was headed for the Orissa coast on Thursday night drastically changed course and started moving towards Bangladesh around 11.30am on Friday, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The change in direction has brightened the prospects of clearer skies over the weekend, the weatherman added. Had the formation stuck to its original course, there would have been showers over the next 48 hours. At one point, while heading east, the depression came as close as 100km from the city.        
	Under the impact of the depression, there was steady flow of moisture from the sea into south Bengal even on Friday.        
	The abundant moisture helped in the formation of thunderclouds that resulted in spells of showers in the city and its neighbourhood, said an official in the weather department.        
	The weatherman, however, did warn of a wet Puja in parts of south Bengal after spying first signs of a low-pressure area forming over the Bay of Bengal early next week.         
	If the low-pressure belt forms, there will be rain in parts of south Bengal on the festive days. But we dont feel the formation will be strong enough to affect the citys sky, said an official.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bullet drop on city path
          A STAFF REPORTER                           The Toyota Qualis in which the bullets were found. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	The Bihar-based men held in connection with the ammunition haul in the city on Monday night had delivered bullets to a receiver in Jharkhand before reaching Calcutta, said investigators on Wednesday.         
	The cops learnt this while questioning the four about the Rs 2.2 lakh found on them. The money was allegedly the payment for the bullets that were delivered at Dhanbad.        
	Three of the men  Patna-based trader Mahesh Singh, who owns an arms shop, and his two drivers  were allegedly in the Toyota Qualis that was stopped at Sovabazar for jumping a signal. The trio had fled but were arrested near New Market early on Tuesday along with Dilip Mishra, who was to allegedly receive the 5,000 bullets found in the car.         
	Mishra has a Maoist link in Patna and the bullets were probably meant for Maoists in Bengal, the investigators had said on Tuesday.         
	The gang was carrying more than 5,000 bullets. We found this out while grilling the accused about the Rs 2.2 lakh they were carrying, said Rajeev Kumar, additional police commissioner, Special Task Force.        
	We are trying to find out more about Mahesh and whether there was an arms supply racket at work, he added.         
	On Tuesday, a team of officers of Calcutta police had left for Patna. At their behest, Singhs arms shop in Patna has been sealed.        
	According to investigators, the trader has been selling large consignments of arms for at least a couple of years.         
	All the bullets are of .315 bore. Since it is not a prohibited bore, civilians with arms licence can procure such bullets. But we need to know how Singh had managed to procure so many bullets, said a senior officer of the Special Task Force.         
	Investigators have got in touch with the authorities of the ammunition factory in Kirkee, Pune, where the bullets were manufactured to find out when they were sold.        
	We also want to know whether Mahesh bought so much ammunition on his own licence or there was a pool of licence holders working with him to procure thousands of bullets, said an officer.

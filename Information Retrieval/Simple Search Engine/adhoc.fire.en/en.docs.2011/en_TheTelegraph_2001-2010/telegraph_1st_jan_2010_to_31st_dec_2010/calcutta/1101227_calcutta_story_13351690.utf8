The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Christmas focus on C-team   Mamata in festive flurry
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Christmas focus on C-team     - Mamata here, there, everywhere in festive final week          ARNAB GANGULY                                               
	A picture of poise at the midnight mass on Friday, all smiles at a Christmas party on Saturday and businesslike at an emergency meeting of her culture clan on Sunday evening  Mamata Banerjee has been at her busybee best in the final week of 2010.        
	That festival and social get-togethers are high up in Mamatas diary had become apparent when she consented to be the chief guest at an iftar hosted by mayor Sovan Chatterjee earlier this year. The trend continued with Bijoya Sammilani in Calcutta and Delhi, interactions with corporate bigwigs, consulate heads and a growing band of supporters from the world of art and culture.         
	She is basically renewing her ties with civil society before hardcore politics takes over, a Trinamul leader said. So Mamatas festive weekend has been all about letting the battle over Jungle Mahal take its course and concentrating on what she does best  connecting with people.        
	After grabbing eyeballs at the midnight mass in the Church of Christ the King, Mamata made time for a Saturday evening rendezvous with the culture clan at Trinamul vice-president Derek OBriens home. Politics took a backseat as she partook of a traditional Christmas dinner and lots of cake with a lively adda thrown in, an aide said. The Mamata C (for culture) team put up a united front after months of rifts and rivalries.        
	Quizzed about the guest list  painters Suvaprasanna (as Santa Claus) and Jogen Chowdhury, Saoli Mitra and Bratya Basu from theatre and film director Rituparno Ghosh (see box)  host OBrien said the get-together was a private affair.                                            
	She was at ease and talked on a number of issues She has always respected writers, painters, filmmakers, musicians and been keen to interact with them, said a Trinamul leader.        
	The interaction with her culture clan continued on Sunday night at Bratya Basus Lake Town residence, ostensibly to get that part of her house in order.        
	Although the host declined to comment on the agenda for the meeting, a Trinamul leader said Mamata wanted to meet her culture clan for the second time in as many days to convey her expectations of them in the run-up to the Assembly elections.         
	Mamatas public relations overdrive has coincided with a war of words between the Centre and the state over the presence of armed CPM camps in Jungle Mahal. The buzz is that it was her persistent attack on the Left Front over Lalgarh and the demand for withdrawal of central forces from Jungle Mahal that prompted Union home minister P. Chidambaram to write a letter to the state government on the presence of CPM camps.

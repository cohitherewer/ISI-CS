	South African cricketers Dale Steyn, J.P. Duminy and brothers Morne and Albie Morkel dropped in at the city zoo on Friday morning.        
	The players, accompanied by Duminys girlfriend Sue Erasmus among others, spent half an hour on the Alipore campus, most of it outside the enclosures of the big cats. There were only a handful of other visitors at the zoo then.        
	The group, surrounded by cops, started the tour at the elephant enclosure, where the women clicked pictures, before moving to the den of the big cats. They were very happy to see the tigers, lions, leopards and the jaguars. They spent quite some time photographing the tigers, said an ice-cream vendor.        
	On their way out, they stopped at the giraffe enclosure. They took photographs of the giraffes as well. I wanted to ask for autographs but could not go near them because of the cops, said a snack vendor.        
	We werent notified about the visit. However, the players had adequate security cover. We are happy that they took an interest in our zoo, said S. Bhattacharyya, the assistant director of the zoo.

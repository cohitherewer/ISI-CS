          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The families of two of the five Bally residents who went missing on their way to Kedarnath were on tenterhooks throughout Friday as the Bengal and Uttarakhand governments gave contradictory statements on their rescue.        
	The chief minister and senior officials of the Bengal government said all five tourists  Gautam Biswas, 52, Subrata Ghosh, 54, Sujit Manna, 26, Mrinal Kanti Ghosh, 28 and Sachin Ghosh, 35  had been rescued. A senior police officer in Uttarakhand, however, said two of them  Sujit and Mrinal  were still missing.        
	I have been told that the five members of the team have been rescued, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at Writers Buildings on Friday afternoon. I have asked (officials) to arrange for their safe return.        
	A home department official later said: All five are safe. They have been taken to the army hospital for treatment. Some have suffered minor injuries.        
	Swati Agarwal, the superintendent of Rudraprayag police in Uttarakhand, however, told Metro on Friday night that Sachin and Gautam were missing. Their footprints have been found. We hope to rescue them soon.        
	The five went missing after being lashed by a blizzard while on their way to Kedarnath from Mohali pass.        
	I am confused. I dont know whom to approach, said Laxmikanta Manna, the father of Sujit and a resident of Kartick Chandra Ghosh Lane.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Cases were not heard in the high court for the sixth consecutive day on Monday but a solution is in sight with the government set to announce its stand on the striking employees demand for implementation of a revised pay scale on Thursday.        
	A committee with three judges had recommended the pay scale. The government had said its implementation was under consideration and the decision would be announced on September 30. But the employees have refused to withdraw the strike till there is written confirmation from the government.        
	On Monday, protesters allowed lawyers to enter the high court for the first time since the strike started following intervention of the secretary of the courts bar association.        
	A senior officer of the state finance department said on Monday: Two representatives of the high court chief justice met finance minister Asim Dasgupta during the day and discussed the implementation of the revised pay scale.         
	He added: We assured the representatives that the employees demand was being considered and the state government would make an announcement on September 30.        
	Jayanta Mitra and Milan Mukherjee, the high court bar members who went to Writers Buildings on Monday, denied meeting Dasgupta.         
	We went to the state secretariat but did not meet the finance minister. We spoke to the striking employees representatives and Chief Justice J.N. Patel during the day. We are hopeful that the stalemate would end in a day or two.        
	We do not know whether the chief justice has engaged somebody to mediate between us and the government, said Saibal Ghosh, an employees body leader.

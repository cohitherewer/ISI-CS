          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                                        The high court on Monday or  dered an interim status quo on   the West Bengal Liver Founda  tions project to build a hospi  tal on the EM Bypass follow  ing a dispute over the plot.  The hospital is coming up   on a 1-acre plot the govern  ment had handed over to the   foundation in 2009. Manoj   Chakrabarty, a Trinamul Con  gress leader in the Jadavpur   area, later moved the high   court claiming the plot be  longed to him.		 		   Chakrabarty submitted   that a major part of the land,   which he had purchased from   a man named P.K. Roy, was not   vested and the government   had no authority to hand it   over to the foundation.  He also claimed that the   high court had in 1992 quashed an order issued by the   state government to acquire   the plot.  After going through the   documents filed by the peti  tioner, Justice D. Kargupta or  dered a status quo on the proj  ect till further orders.  We have only erected a   wall around the plot. We can  not proceed further following   todays court order, said a   member of the liver founda  tion.   Roadblock: More than 200   residents of Khalisani Rathta  la in Uluberia blocked Nation  al Highway 6 from 12.30pm to   1.45pm on Monday to protest   the alleged police inaction in   taking action against hooch   traders. When cops turned up,   the protesters pelted them   with stones. Traffic movement   on the highway resumed   around 2pm.

           Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen in Indrani                           
	The article Big deal, August 1, terms many institutions as overrated. I dont think all of them are. The Boi Para in College Street is one of them. I have found more treasures there than in some big bookstores. For students with a limited budget, the discounts available in Boi Para are irresistible. Maybe it has lost its sheen with time but let us not denounce it more than it deserves.           
	Calcuttas biryani has its own appeal, mainly because of the nostalgia it evokes. When my cousins visit from Delhi, they always eat at Aminia or Arsalan because they have heard so many tales about the food from their parents.           
	The Uttam-Suchitra pairing was the most successful ever in Tollywood. Even the young generation sits glued to the television when an Uttam- Suchitra film is on. If it was overrated, their charm would have not lasted for so long.

	The one overrated institution in the city is Someplace Else. The music is ordinary, the crowd even more so. The place thrives on hype, as do many other nightclubs in the city. Let Calcutta learn pubbing from Bangalore or Mumbai. At least Coffee House had a tradition, these night spots have neither class nor tradition.

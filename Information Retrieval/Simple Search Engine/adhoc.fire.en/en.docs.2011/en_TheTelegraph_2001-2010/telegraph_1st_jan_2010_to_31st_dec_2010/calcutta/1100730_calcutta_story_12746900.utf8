The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Assault driver walks into police trap
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Assault driver walks into police trap
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A father of three was arrested on Thursday afternoon for allegedly assaulting 23-year-old MBA student Sayantee Majumdar while giving her a shuttle car ride, forcing her to jump off the speeding vehicle.        
	Rogue driver Samad Khan, 32, walked into a trap laid by police after giving the cops the slip earlier in the day. We arrested him at the Bagha Jatin residence of his employer, Debjani Saha. We had asked the car owner to call him to her address, said Debabrata Das, the additional superintendent of police, Bidhannagar.        
	Samad, who has been driving the white Ambassador ever since Saha purchased it from an Elgin Road showroom in 2006, admitted to misbehaving with Sayantee while giving her a lift from Bijon Setu in Gariahat till Salt Lake on Tuesday night.        
	Samad, a resident of Natunhat, off Garia, has been booked under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 354 (assaulting a woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the IPC.         
	He is to be produced in the court of the additional chief judicial magistrate on Friday.        
	Investigators identified Samad through sketches based on descriptions given by Sayantee and the friend who had accompanied her till Bijon Setu. The friend had also noted down the car number (WB19D 2349).         
	The sub-divisional officer of Bidhannagar, Ashoke Das, has decided to reward Sayantee and her friend.        
	Although the police had the cars registration number, the address mentioned in the records of the public vehicles department turned out to be false. We then checked with the bank to which the car is hypothecated and got the correct address, said additional superintendent Das.        
	A team led by the additional officer-in-charge of Bidhannagar East police station, Ashok Khamuri, reached car owner Sahas residence on Thursday morning and learnt that she had leased out the vehicle to a government agency whose office is in Salt Lakes HC Block.         
	We sent our officials to the office and found the car parked there. However, the driver got wind of our arrival and fled, said an officer.        
	A team went to Sahas residence again in the evening, this time in mufti, and asked Saha to call up Samad. We arrested him the moment he arrived, the officer said.        
	Samad had pulled Sayantee by the hand while driving towards BJ Block. The MBA student and a co-passenger had got off the car at Karunamoyee but the driver offered to drop her closer home, claiming he was going that way. Sayantee suffered cuts and bruises on jumping off the vehicle to escape Samads clutches.

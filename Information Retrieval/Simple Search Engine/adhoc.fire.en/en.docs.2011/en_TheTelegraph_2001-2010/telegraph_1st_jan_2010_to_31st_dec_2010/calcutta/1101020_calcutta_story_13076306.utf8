          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A man died and four persons were injured in a clash that broke out between Trinamul and CPM supporters at Kulipara under ward 17 of Salt Lake on Tuesday.        
	The two groups fired and threw bombs at each other through the afternoon, prompting police to deploy a large contingent in the area.         
	Balai Mondal, 45, died at NRS hospital after a bullet hit him on his spine. Sushmita Mondal, 12, was admitted to hospital after a bullet grazed her body.         
	The injured have been admitted to Bidhannagar subdivisional and NRS hospital, said a police officer. No one has been arrested in this connection.        
	Leaders of the two parties blamed each other for starting the clash.        
	Residents said the clash started after local councillor Ila Nandy addressed CPM activists after immersion of the idols of a local puja on Sunday evening.         
	Trinamul leaders accused the police of not doing their duty. Cops denied the allegation.

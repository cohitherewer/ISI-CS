The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Night of noise after quiet start
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Night of noise after quiet start
  - Record number of cracker and mike complaints registered        JAYANTA BASU                          Diwali fireworks in Salt Lake, where the festival of lights turned noisy. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                        
	Calcutta got noisier by the hour on Kali Puja and Diwali evening with the sound of banned crackers reaching a crescendo around midnight.        
	Violations, limited to city pockets and the fringes in the evening, became widespread as the night wore on, despite a central law banning all crackers that produce noise after 10pm.         
	Noise-norm violation was rampant on the fringes, especially Baguiati, Behala (SN Roy Road in particular), Kasba, Salt Lake, Baranagar, Ariadaha, Lake Town and Regent Park. Within the city, Tiljala in the east, Ballygunge Circular Road in the south and Girish Park, Maniktala and Raja Dinendra Street in the north fared the worst in terms of violations.        
	The state pollution control board received a record number of complaints, 172, over three days starting on the eve of Kali Puja. Last year, 67 complaints had been lodged with the board. The figure in 2008 was 68.         
	Most of this years complaints were about noisy crackers but loudspeakers too proved a source of disturbance for many.        
	Debasish Chakrabarty, a noise-pollution expert of the board, detected a trend. On the fringes, violators mostly burst locally made patkas and chocolate bombs. Crackers made in Sivakashi, Tamil Nadu, were burst in the upper middle-class areas in the city, especially in high-rise buildings, he said.        
	According to senior board officials and environment activists, the state polices laid-back approach was largely to blame for the violations.        
	Since July, we have been stressing the need to stop manufacture and sale of banned crackers across the state, especially at the hotspots on the city fringes, but not much was done. Hence, large-scale violations occurred in the city at night despite Calcutta police trying their best, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the board and a high court appointed special officer for noise-pollution monitoring.        
	Though the overall situation in the city was better than previous years, there were large-scale violations, especially after 10pm, in Beleghata, Chitpur, Shyampukur, Prince Anwar Shah Road and Tollygunge, said police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	No matter what we do, stopping sound pollution will be difficult unless the manufacture of banned crackers is stopped, he added.        
	Chakrabarti, who had written to the state home secretary that banned crackers were being manufactured and sold in adjoining districts, claimed there were fewer instances of noise-norm flout in hospitals, army areas and police quarters this year compared with the previous years.         
	We came across loudspeaker and cracker norm violations only at Howrah General Hospital, said Mukherjee, who led a special monitoring team of the board.        
	Banned firecrackers were sold in the open, in connivance with the police, in the suburbs, complained Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee, the former high court judge who passed a landmark order against noise pollution in 1997.        
	The tacit support of both CPM and Trinamul Congress leaders to cracker manufacturers in South and North 24-Parganas led to the violations, said environment activist Subhash Dutta.        
	A senior state police officer cited lack of infrastructure for the alleged lapses in noise norm vigil. Banned crackers were also sold in the Calcutta police area, added the cop.        
	What is the point of finding out who was responsible and who was not for the cracker-norm violation? Eighty-five noisy crackers were burst on the rooftop of a nearby building. Despite lodging a complaint, we had to suffer the noise for hours, said a resident of DB block in Salt Lake.

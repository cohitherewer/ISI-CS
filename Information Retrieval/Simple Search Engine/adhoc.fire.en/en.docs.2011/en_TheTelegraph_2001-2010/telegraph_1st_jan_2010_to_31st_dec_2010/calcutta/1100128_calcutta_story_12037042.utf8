The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A fair dark and dismal
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A fair dark and dismal
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Dipika Gupta has not missed the opening days of the Calcutta Book Fair for two decades on the trot. Thats my pick-me-up at the beginning of every year, says the 42-year-old book lover. But her visit to the 34th Book Fairs first two evenings has left her feeling down and out.        
	Even 36 hours after the fair gates were thrown open to the people  and 48 hours after the chief minister had demanded proper facilities at the venue  Milon Mela remained unlit and unfinished.        
	On Wednesday evening, the crowds were greeted by rows of half-done stalls, some stretches shrouded in darkness, piles of wooden frames and cratered pathways.        
	With close to 150 stalls  out of 650  running without electricity, some frustrated stall owners confronted officials of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild.        
	Every time we have been asking the authorities since Tuesday, we are told that the electricity connection will be given in 30 minutes. This is so frustrating, said Matilda La Mora, from Spain, who has set up a stall. Among the foreign stalls, Mongolia and Sweden were all dark.        
	I had applied for electricity three days ago, alleged Prabhat Chowdhury of Kabita Pakshik. We had a steady flow of visitors through the day, but the stall is empty since sunset. Who would visit a fair without lights?        
	Those who did, left the fair in a huff. Many stalls are dark, while several others are unfinished. The billing counters are not working and card payments not being accepted. Why has the guild been allowed to open the fair without basic facilities? demanded book lover Debasish Bose, 32.        
	No answers were forthcoming. Now they are telling us that the contractor has not provided electricity because of a technical glitch, said Subhendu Misra of Pandulipi.        
	When Metro had demanded an explanation from the guild authorities on Tuesday evening, they had promised that everything would be in order by Wednesday. When Metro pointed out the same problems to the guild authorities on Wednesday evening, the promise was repeated with the deadline pushed back by another 24 hours.        
	We will make all the arrangements by Thursday morning, said Suprokash Basu, the vice president of the guild, blaming the lack of readiness on a late start. We could only use the ground from January 17 and then had to build the superstructure before handing over the stalls.        
	But how can a half-ready fair be opened to the crowds?        
	Because the guild believes that it can get away with anything, alleged a publisher.        
	The guilds mismanagement drew protests from near and far. There are multiple committees and one tells us to speak to the other, complained Harsh Lakhani of the Mongolian consulate, that has put up a stall. Things are much better managed at Delhis Pragati Maidan.        
	Some big names in Delhi, who have decided to wait and watch how the book fair fares, are sure to take note of the dark despair at Milon Mela.        
	Both HarperCollins and Hachette India harp on the logistics and infrastructure being right before bringing their books and authors to the next book fair. They have stayed away this time, either citing the fear of dust and damage to books at Milan Mela or the World Book Fair starting at Pragati Maidan on January 30.

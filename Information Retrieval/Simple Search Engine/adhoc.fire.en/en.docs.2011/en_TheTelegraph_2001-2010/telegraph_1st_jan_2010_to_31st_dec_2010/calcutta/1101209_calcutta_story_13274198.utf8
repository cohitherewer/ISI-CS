The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Online traders in city outnumber buyers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Online traders in city outnumber buyers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta sells more than it buys on the countrys largest online trading platform, thus becoming one of the four domestic profit buying cities.        
	Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai are the other three cities whose residents collectively earn more by selling goods on the Internet than they spend on online shopping, according to The eBay India 2010 Census.         
	What Calcutta is selling, both in India and abroad, spans a wide range of categories, from technology tools to collectibles.        
	There wasnt such a divide between buying and selling in the city but it is a trend that we have seen between July 2009 to June 2010, when the survey was conducted, said Abhimanyu Lal, head (strategy and emerging markets), eBay.        
	Technology dominated the items sold to the domestic market at 44 per cent of all transactions made on eBay. Pen drives and antivirus software were the most common items sold domestically by Calcuttans.        
	Technology also grabbed the lions share of Calcuttas online shopping budget with cellphones being the most popular buy followed by cellphone accessories, smart phones and pen drives.        
	According to the survey, Calcutta is the largest collectible trading hub in the country with 46 per cent of its exports and 39 per cent of its imports being in that category.        
	The collectibles include ephemera (written or printed matter that is not intended to be saved) like tram ticket stubs, old postcards and letters.        
	Stamps, coins and historical documents are sold as well as bought the most in Calcutta, making it a collectors paradise, said Lal.        
	Despite increase in volume of transactions, Calcutta has dropped a place from its seventh position in the annual eBay list of top 10 e-commerce hubs.        
	Delhi, Mumbai, Jaipur, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad are above Calcutta in the list.        
	Manufacturing hubs and trade routes like Delhi and Chennai have a natural advantage when it comes to selling and buying. Calcutta doesnt have that advantage and maybe that reflects in its position, said Lal.

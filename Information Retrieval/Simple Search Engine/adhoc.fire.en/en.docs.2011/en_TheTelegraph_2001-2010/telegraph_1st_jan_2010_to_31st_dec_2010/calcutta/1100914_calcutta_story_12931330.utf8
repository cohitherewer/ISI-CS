The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cracker noise plea back in court
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cracker noise plea back in court
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The high court will have to decide afresh whether the state can ignore the Centres noise norms and enforce its own, stricter rules.        
	The Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia on Monday sent back to the high court a petition challenging the states right to frame noise rules when the Centre had already announced a set of norms for the entire country.        
	The central rules on crackers have set the noise limit at 125 decibel at 4 metre from the point of explosion. The limit under the state rules  framed by the pollution control board following an order from the high court  is 90 decibel at 5 metre from the point of explosion.        
	The petition was filed by the Bengal-based International Marwari Association, which claimed that the states norms announced on October 3, 1997, should have lapsed after the Centres rules came into force on October 5, 1999.        
	The state order has imposed an unacceptable noise standard without any scientific basis and (in effect) completely banned the manufacture, sale or use of crackers in West Bengal.... It has also infringed on the right of the people of the state to celebrate Dussehra, Kali puja and Diwali, the petitioner had claimed.        
	The practice of celebrating Diwali with crackers is being followed for a very long time. The (indirect) banning of crackers in West Bengal is discriminatory.        
	The state pollution control board argued before the bench that it was within its right to frame tougher rules  compared with the Centres  for Bengal. Now, both sides will have to argue their case afresh in the high court.        
	This was the third petition on the issue the apex court has refused to hear and referred back to the high court.        
	Gitanath Ganguli, the lawyer appointed by the high court to monitor sound norms, recalled that an association of fireworks traders had moved a petition claiming that the central norms should prevail in the state, too. The high court dismissed the petition saying the Central Noise Pollution Regulation Act had empowered the states to fix a higher decibel limit than the Centres.        
	The Supreme Court, too, had ruled in September 2001 that there was no curb on the Union Territories or states to adopt noise norms more stringent than the Centres.        
	Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the state board, said the cracker noise limit of 90 decibel had been fixed following a 1989 recommendation of a central panel. We have written to the Centre pointing out that its own ambient noise norms would fall flat if it sticks to its limit of 125 decibel.

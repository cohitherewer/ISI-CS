                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Driver key to student death clue
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The guard of the local train whose driver had reported hitting a person on the night of October 19, minutes before 18-year-old schoolboy Tithiswar Baidya was found dead on the tracks at Jodhpur Park, deposed before the CID on Wednesday.        
	Around 9.30pm that night, as the train was passing gate No. 2 of Gobindapur rail colony, the driver told me over walkie-talkie that we had knocked down someone. I had looked out to spot the body, said Swapan Kumar Pal, the guard.        
	Not satisfied with the details provided by him, the investigating agency sent a second notice to the railways seeking to question the driver of the Down Budge Budge local. Its important to know what exactly the driver had seen, especially whether there was anyone near the tracks, said an officer.        
	On Wednesday, investigators visited Tithiswars home in Rahim Ostagar Lane at Jodhpur Park and then the spot where his body was found.        
	The boy might have been crossing the tracks to return home quickly when the train ran him over. He was probably rushing as his mother had been calling him and asking when he would return home, said an officer.        
	Tithiswar had received six calls on his cellphones, including a few from his parents, on October 19 night.        
	Most of the other callers, supposed to be his friends, shared the same tower location as him, added the investigator.        
	The boy, who had topped Jodhpur Park Boys High School in Madhyamik, left home that evening after receiving a call.        
	Tithiswars body was found in three parts  head between the tracks, one of the arms flung nearly 50 metres away and the rest of the body besides the tracks. His father lodged a murder case the next day.

          A STAFF REPORTER                      The building where the Sarkars live. 
  (Anindya Shankar Ray)                          
	Diamond-studded gold jewellery pieces worth over Rs 1 lakh have gone missing from the Jodhpur Park house of a trader.         
	A woman, recruited by Ranjit Sarkar to look after his newborn girl, is suspected to have stolen the ornaments when she quit the job recently.        
	The Sarkars, who live on the second floor of a four-storeyed building, realised a few days ago that the valuables were missing. The police complaint was lodged on Thursday evening after the family members were convinced that they had not misplaced them at home.        
	Sarkar mentioned in the complaint lodged with Lake police station that three diamond-studded rings and two gold bracelets worth Rs 1.013 lakhs were missing.        
	The complainant said his wife had kept the ornaments in a drawer and had forgotten about them. He suspects they were stolen by the familys former domestic help, Chhaya Mandal, a police source said.        
	The Sarkars had recruited Chhaya through an agency in Dhakuria. Around three weeks ago, she told us that she wanted to leave. But when she left we had no inkling that she had stolen ornaments from our home, said a family member.        
	A police team visited the agencys office on Friday but it was closed for Diwali.        
	The officer-in-charge of Lake police station, Partho Mukherjee, said: A case has been registered under IPC Section 381 (theft by a servant).

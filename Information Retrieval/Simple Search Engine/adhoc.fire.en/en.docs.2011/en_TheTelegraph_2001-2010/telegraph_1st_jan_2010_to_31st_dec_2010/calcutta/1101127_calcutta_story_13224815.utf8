The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Writers ruse in cop car grab game
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Writers ruse in cop car grab game
          MONALISA CHAUDHURI                                        
	We have orders from Writers Buildings to seize any vehicle.         
	A policeman had shouted at the driver of an SUV that he was about to requisition for the special law and order duty of ferrying IPS officers for a tennis tournament.         
	When the driver wanted to see a copy of the order, one of the four plainclothesmen surrounding the car only showed him his lathi.        
	The four cops had zeroed in on the Scorpio on the northern fringes of the city around 4.30pm on November 18. I had stopped at a red light. As the signal was about to turn green, four men holding lathis, blocked the path of the car and introduced themselves as cops, recounted the 33-year-old driver.         
	After he showed the cops his driving licence, the tax receipt of the car and a photocopy of its blue book, they told him that the vehicle was being requisitioned for a day.        
	They then filled up a requisition slip (a copy of which was printed in Metro on Friday with the report on car grab by cops in the name of law-and-order duty [see box]) and ordered the driver to report at the Alipore police lines at 6am on November 20.        
	The driver called up his employer. I had no option but to ask my driver to do what the cops wanted him to, said the owner.        
	The driver handed over the tax receipt and his driving licence to the cops and signed the requisition slip that declared he had been assigned law and order duty in connection with the All India Lawn Tennis Competition. The slip does not mention the law under which the vehicle has been requisitioned.         
	More than 30 other cars had been similarly requisitioned for ferrying IPS officers for the tournament that ended at South Club on Friday.        
	Within minutes of reaching the police lines on November 20, I realised I would have to be on tournament duty for seven days, said the driver.         
	In desperation, he approached a senior cop. The officer told him to leave if he wanted to but since his requisition slip would not be returned, he would not be able to get back his papers.        
	Scared, the driver turned to another officer but to no avail.        
	In May 2009, trader Sachin Halder had been meted out the same treatment by Election Commission officials who had forcibly requisitioned his Tata Safari. Will the Scorpio owner move court like Halder? I remember what happened to Halder. The high court ruled in his favour but the Election Commission kept on using the car. It was finally returned in a bad condition. I cannot risk that, said the owner.

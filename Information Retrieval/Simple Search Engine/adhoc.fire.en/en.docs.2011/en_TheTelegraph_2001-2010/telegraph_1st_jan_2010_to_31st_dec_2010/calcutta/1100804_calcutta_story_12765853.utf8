The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Runway rule book on collision close call   Safety threat in rush to beat queue
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Runway rule book on collision close call             SANJAY MANDAL                              
	Time-wasting on the tarmac may have been the reason for Mondays collision scare at Calcutta airport when a plane cleared for landing was forced to do a go-around to avoid running into one on the runway, officials said.        
	The near-mishap coincided with a Metro report on how pilots were seeking clearance for departure even before being ready to taxi for take-off, causing potentially dangerous clustering of inbound and outbound flights on the runway.         
	Delay by pilots cleared for take-off is a problem. If there is a genuine reason like a snag, pilots must inform air traffic control and act according to instructions. Let us wait for the probe report, said H.N. Mishra, the air safety officer for eastern India in the directorate general of civil aviation.         
	Metro highlights the how, why and who of such close calls at the city airport.              
	How does a delayed take-off compromise flight safety?        
	Air traffic control clears planes for take-off or landing based on precise calculations of when the runway and the flight route would be free for a particular procedure. Disaster strikes when one flight deviates from the schedule without a valid reason.        
	On Monday, the pilot of an Air India plane bound for London via Delhi with 75 passengers allegedly delayed take-off by a few minutes because of unspecified reasons even as ATC cleared a Jet Airways plane from Bangkok with 154 people on board for landing.        
	A mishap was barely averted with the Jet Airways pilot doing a go-around and landing only after the other plane had become airborne.              
	How often are inbound flights cleared for landing forced to go around?        
	Such incidents are routinely recorded at Calcutta and most other busy airports but it is rare for a plane cleared for landing finding the runway occupied by another aircraft.        
	Pilots often go around when they spot a stray animal, a vehicle or airport equipment on the runway but those are not considered as risky as a plane on the runway, says an airport official.              
	When was the last time such an incident occurred at the city airport?        
	Last month, when an animal on the runway forced a pilot to do a go-around.              
	What are the safeguards and danger signals?        
	Depending on the number and position of aircraft waiting for take-off and landing, the ATC controller decides the sequence and informs each pilot.        
	All inbound pilots are asked to maintain a specific speed  varying between 140 and 180 nautical miles an hour  at the time of landing. An aircraft ready to take off usually moves at 30 to 40 nautical miles an hour while taxiing.         
	If the speeds of approaching and departing aircraft are slower or faster than the prescribed range by even 10 nautical miles, landing or take-off timings can change up to a minute.        
	Under the stipulated air safety norms, even a minutes deviation is dangerous.                           
	Why do pilots delay take-off on the runway?        
	Pilots seek ATC clearance even as boarding is underway so that they can beat the queue.         
	Has any pilot been penalised for delayed take-off?        
	The last known instance was two years ago, when a British Airways pilot was warned. The rulebook states that pilots can be grounded.         
	Is any change in the offing to force the pilots to fall in line and make the runway safer?        
	The DGCA has recommended that a plane be pushed to the bottom of the queue if it does not taxi for take-off within five minutes of receiving ATC clearance.         
	But the best bet yet is a precision-based navigation system called Air Traffic Flow Management that is set to be in place by next year.

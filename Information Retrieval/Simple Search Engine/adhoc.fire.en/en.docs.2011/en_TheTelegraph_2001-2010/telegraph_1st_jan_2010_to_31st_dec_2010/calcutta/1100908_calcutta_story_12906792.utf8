The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shutdown strikes wrong chord   Party decides where you   stay and shop
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Shutdown strikes wrong chord 
  Party decides where you   stay and shop          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	Schoolboy Zaid Hossain, 11, was officially exempt from Tuesdays bandh but he spent the whole day sulking in his Salt Lake home about not being able to go out shopping for his Id clothes.        
	We are Muslims and we reside in Salt Lake. So what does Citu make of us? Do we need to stay in a Muslim-dominated locality to be eligible to go out shopping two days before Id? demanded Zaids father Arshad Hossain, a manager with an insurance company.        
	If Tuesdays bandh was ill-timed, Citu made it worse with its ill-conceived decision to compartmentalise the city and leave Muslim-dominated areas out of the realm of the 24-hour general strike over sundry issues like price rise and privatisation.        
	This is ridiculous. Did it not occur to the bandh enforcers that a sizeable Muslim population stays in so-called mixed localities like Salt Lake, Lake Town, Kasba and Alipore. They fast or shop for Id just as the rest of the community does, said Arshad, sitting in the living room of his first-floor apartment in BB block of Salt Lake.        
	Salt Lake alone is home to more than 300 Muslim families. Like other residents spread across the five sectors, they depend on the local markets for almost everything, but not one was open on Tuesday.         
	Members of the Alam household in Golaghata, off VIP Road, were also forced to postpone their Id shopping like the many Muslim families living throughout the city.        
	Even if we had wanted to go out, transport wasnt available. I was planning to visit Zakaria Street in central Calcutta but getting there would have been a problem. What was the point in declaring a bandh in some areas and exempting others? wondered bank official Munawar Alam, in his mid-40s.        
	Former chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray accused Citu of trying to drive a wedge between communities by exempting Muslim-dominated areas from the bandh.        
	How do you segregate Muslim areas and non-Muslim areas? How do you identify Muslim markets and non-Muslim markets? Every inch of our soil belongs to people of all religions. What is Citu trying to do? said Ray at his residence on Tuesday afternoon.        
	An ailing Ray said news of the so-called exceptions along communal lines had left him very agitated. This is a black day in the history of trade unionism in Bengal, he stressed.        
	Although Citu general secretary Kali Ghosh had claimed on Monday that his cadres wouldnt hit the streets to enforce the shutdown, strike supporters did show their spots in one of the areas their organisation had exempted from the bandh.        
	Police arrested five persons for attacking a branch of Arsalan restaurant on Ripon Street and shattering the glass shield of a counter outside the eatery around 12.15pm.        
	We had kept the shutters half down as we didnt want to risk trouble. But suddenly a group of 70 people waving CPM flags came and attacked the counter, said Md Eqbal, the restaurant manager.        
	The mob also hurled flower tubs and stones. They were set to smash all the glass windows and partitions, but our staff managed to pull down the shutters in the nick of time, added Eqbal.        
	The vandals attacked Arsalan  whose main branch is at Park Circus and whose biryani is Sourav Gangulys favourite  for around five minutes till a team from Park Street police station reached the area.         
	Ripon Street is a minority-dominated area and Citu was supposed to allow the restaurant to do business without being disturbed on Tuesday, a police officer said.

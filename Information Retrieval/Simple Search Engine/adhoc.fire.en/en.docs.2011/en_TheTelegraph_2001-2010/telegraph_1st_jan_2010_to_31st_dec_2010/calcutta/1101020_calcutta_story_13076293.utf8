The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Attacked for chanda delay
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Attacked for chanda delay
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The chanda monster reared its head post-bhashan in Beleghata with a resident alleging that puja organisers beat him up after the cheque he gave them under duress had bounced.        
	Nitin Lakhotia, 35, the employee of a share-trading firm, lodged an FIR on Tuesday stating that he was beaten with rods and bamboo sticks late on Monday by members of the Akal Bodhan Sarbojanin Durga Puja Committee.        
	Beleghata police station, according to Lakhotia, had initially refused to register the complaint but changed their tune after he got in touch with police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	The puja committee members had first demanded Rs 15,000. When I pleaded that I could not afford to cough up such a large amount, they finally scaled it down to Rs 5,000 and agreed to take a cheque, Nitin, who hails from Mumbais Goregaon, told Metro.        
	On October 9, Nitin handed over the cheque to the puja committee members and requested them to encash it once he had more funds in his account. According to the complaint, the organisers tried to encash the cheque on October 11 and were told on October 13, Sashthi, that it had bounced.        
	With the banks shut after that, some puja committee members confronted him and demanded that he pay up the full amount in cash.        
	I said it was not possible for me and that they would have to wait till after Puja, said Nitin.        
	Late on Monday, when one of Nitins friends had come to drop him off at his Beleghata home, a section of the puja committee members spotted and confronted them.        
	That was around 1.30am and they demanded Rs 5,000 in cash. When I tried reasoning with them, some of the committee members started beating me with rods and bamboo sticks, Nitin said.        
	Ronojit Chaudhury, joint secretary of the Akal Bodhan Sarbojanin Durga Puja Committee, termed the altercation unfortunate when Metro contacted him on Tuesday evening.        
	Its a very unfortunate incident but it appears that some of the youths, along with the victim and his friend, were in an inebriated state. Things shouldnt have snowballed into such a big incident, added Chaudhury.        
	According to Nitin, he went to Beleghata police station around 2am, where they refused to register his complaint. They made me wait till 6am, he said.        
	Finally, after he got in touch with the police commissioner, the FIR against the puja committee was filed.         
	A case of extortion has been lodged and well soon make necessary arrests, said Damayanti Sen, the city detective chief.

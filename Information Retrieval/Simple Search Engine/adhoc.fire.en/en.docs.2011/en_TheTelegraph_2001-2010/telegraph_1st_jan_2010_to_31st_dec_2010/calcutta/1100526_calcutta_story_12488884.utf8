	After reporting for two days on how the hanger hoods of Howrah bridge were being destroyed by gutkha spit (picture right), Metro caught up with some more offenders on Tuesday, who promised not to do it again              
	Lalit Mathur        
	Job: Porter at a Burrabazar shop        
	Act: Spat out gutkha on the hanger hood ever so casually while taking a break from lugging a huge sack        
	Confession: The stains show that everyone spits here. But now that I know its dangerous, it wont happen again.              
	Lakhindar        
	Job: Porter at Phool Bazar in Burrabazar        
	Act: Walked down briskly from the Howrah side and spat on the hanger with a practised tongue        
	Confession: I had no idea that the bridge was weakening because of our spitting. I will keep this in mind.              
	Bablu Das        
	Job: Flower seller. Shuttles between Salt Lake and Howrah daily        
	Act: Spat gutkha on more than one hanger hood as he walked the length of the bridge        
	Confession: I know its not right to spit on the road. Ill not do it again.              
	Manoj Sahu        
	Job: Supplier based in Tikiapara        
	Act: Was walking his bicycle up the slope towards Howrah when he let loose his venom        
	Confession: This is such a beautiful bridge, who would want to damage it? Ill not spit here again.              
	Bhaskar Barik        
	Job: Works in a private firm in Kalighat        
	Act: Stopped in front of a hanger and spat out gutkha confidently        
	Confession: I dont usually spit. I spat just this once by mistake. Not only on bridges, people shouldnt spit anywhere.

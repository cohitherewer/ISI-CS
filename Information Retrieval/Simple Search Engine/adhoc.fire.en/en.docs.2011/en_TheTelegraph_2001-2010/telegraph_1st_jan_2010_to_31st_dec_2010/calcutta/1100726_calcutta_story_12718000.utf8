The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | ITs back: jobs fuel seat scurry

  - Colleges fill up as companies return to campus          MITA MUKHERJEE AND CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                    
	Information technology classrooms that had gone virtually empty during the last two admission seasons are filling up fast with renewed hiring by tech companies finally lifting the downturn-induced gloom.         
	The fall and rise of IT as a career option is reflected in the counselling sessions for the 60,000-odd students who cleared the Joint Entrance Examinations this year.         
	We dont have the exact numbers yet but few IT seats are likely to remain vacant this year, confirmed Siddhartha Dutta, the chairman of the West Bengal Board of Joint Entrance Examinations.         
	Around 85 per cent of the 28,000 engineering seats in the state were filled up after the first phase of counselling ended last week. That leaves only 4,395 seats for the second phase of counselling, scheduled to start on July 30.         
	More than 2,500 IT seats in private engineering colleges across Bengal had remained vacant last year.        
	Although most engineering aspirants now seem to be bullish about a career in IT, caution remains the watchword against the backdrop of job cuts, pay freeze, zero perks and stunted growth.        
	High performers in JEE are also being held back by the hiring trend, which shows that people are being recruited mostly at the bottom end of the IT chain.        
	The current round of hiring is being fuelled by bread-and-butter projects rather than high-end computing or product development. So recruitment is restricted to basic IT manpower for the services industry rather than professionals across the board, said a senior manager of a Sector V company.        
	Suparno Maitro, the regional manager (east) of Nasscom, said tech companies were likely to be conservative about hiring from now on despite the sector looking up. The industry has matured and become quality conscious, he explained.         
	What that means is that an IT degree wont guarantee a job like it used to despite the rosy projections.         
	According to industry estimates, around 1.5 lakh people would be recruited during the current financial year, which is at least 60,000 more than last year.         
	Cognizant is going big with its Bantala unit, Tata Consultancy Services is expanding and Wipro is planning to hire as well. So demand for good IT professionals will be high, said Maitro.        
	The global IT scene has also encouraged optimism. More than half of the large US firms that had laid off staff last year are planning to rebuild their manpower to pre-recession levels, a survey by Accenture has revealed.        
	Officials overseeing placements at Jadavpur University and Besu confirmed the turnaround. Most IT companies seem eager to hire students from our institution this year, said Manas Sanyal, who teaches at Besu.         
	Campus interviews at Besu are set to start in August.         
	Private colleges offering only IT had taken the biggest hit during the downturn, forcing many of them to petition the authorities for permission to introduce courses in core engineering.

	Union culture secretary Jawhar Sircar met local theatre persons and dancers at the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) in Salt Lake on Monday to discuss ideas for the India-Bangladesh joint celebrations of Rabindranath Tagores 150th birth anniversary.         
	We had not been able to include theatre persons and dancers in the delegation that went to Dhaka recently, so it was essential to meet them and exchange ideas on collaborative commemoration projects, said Sircar.         
	Leading actors, directors and playwrights like Bibhas Chakraborty, Manoj Mitra, Arun Mukhopadhyay, Rudraprasad Sengupta, Soumitra Basu, Usha Ganguly, Chandan Sen, Debashish Majumdar, Bratya Basu, Koushik Sen and Suman Mukhopadhyay attended the session.        
	Academicians like Uday Narayan Sinha, the pro vice-chancellor of Visva-Bharati, and Ananda Lal of Jadavpur University were also present.         
	Manoj Mitras proposal of an international playwriting workshop to inspire new dramatic adaptations and interpretations of Tagores works was greeted with enthusiasm. He was requested to head the project, with assistance from Bratya Basu.        
	Sircar suggested a collection of authoritative translations of Tagores plays or acceptable theatrical adaptations from his works in languages other than Bengali and Hindi. Ananda Lal was invited to take the responsibility with assistance from Uday Narayan Sinha.        
	Anup Matilal, the director of the EZCC, and K.K. Banerjee, the convener (east) of the Tagore Commemoration Grant Scheme, were asked to co-ordinate between Indian and Bangladeshi theatre groups.        
	There are also plans to stage plays on Tagores life and film his works. If the proposal is good we will find the funds, Sircar said.        
	His session with dancers was attended by Thankamani Kutty, Shanti Basu, Alakananda Roy, Mamata Sankar, Tanushree Sankar, Mahua Mukherjee, Amita Dutta and others. Priti Patel was requested to conduct a workshop where dance groups and leading dancers can brainstorm and come up with novel projects related to Tagore.

          SUBHAJOY ROY                                    
	Two families each claimed at least three victims of the Stephen Court fire at the SSKM Hospital morgue on Wednesday afternoon, with little left to identify of the bodies except clothes and accessories.        
	Bhaskar Chakrabarty, a 42-year-old railways employee, had identified the body tagged No. 6 as his wife Tapati on Wednesday morning.        
	Tapati was wearing Bata shoes and some gold ornaments on Tuesday. Bhaskar identified the body after seeing a portion of the shoe that survived the fire and the ornaments, said Kallol Ghosh, a relative.        
	The relatives were waiting to receive the body and head for the crematorium when around 3pm, the Parveens of Topsia staked claim on the body.        
	My relative Ekbal Hussain identified his daughter Ruhi seeing the ornaments she was wearing, said Akhir Parveen.        
	Unable to come to terms with the cruel twist, Bhaskar fainted in the morgue and had to be taken to a doctor.        
	Police said a DNA test would be conducted to determine whether the body was of 21-year-old Ruhi Parveen or 35-year-old Tapati Chakrabarty.        
	A senior officer at Lalbazar, however, said collecting bone marrow samples from the bodies would be difficult since they were charred.        
	The Dattas of Anandapur lived through the same nightmare as the Chakrabartys and the Parveens.         
	My brother-in-law Shibaprasad Datta had identified the body tagged No. 12 as his 22-year-old daughter Richa on Tuesday night. She had joined Wintech PC a week back, said the girls maternal uncle Sambhu Ghosh.        
	When family members returned to the morgue on Wednesday morning, they found that the tag on the body had changed to No. 2 and it now bore the name Bhagyashree Dhali.         
	The 19-year-old Microsys Technical Enterprises employees mother Prabhati, a resident of the New Market area, said she could identify her daughter because the teenager was wearing the red salwar kameez that she had borrowed from her.        
	The Chatterjees of Bhowanipore identified the body tagged No. 7 as Bhagyashrees friend and colleague Pampa Chatterjee on Tuesday night.         
	Pampas maternal uncle Pintu Ghosh said they found that a male body bore the No. 7 tag on returning to the morgue on Wednesday morning. The ornaments that helped family members identify the 23-year-old could not found on the other bodies.        
	Confusion reigned at the morgue because the identification of bodies hinged on the tiniest of markers.        
	For example, 21-year-old Ankush Ghoshs chipped tooth helped his mother identify the body.        
	Ankushs father had visited the morgue on yesterday but he could not be sure. We brought his mother to the morgue today because only she would know about a chipped tooth, said a neighbour of the Haridebpur family on Wednesday afternoon.        
	Rajendranath Samantas watch helped his family members and fiancee Sunita Saha identify him on Wednesday afternoon. The 25-year-old Baguiati resident was to be married to Sunita on August 13, her birthday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puja holiday ends   in burglary shock
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Puja holiday ends   in burglary shock
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Burglars broke into a house in Salt Lakes HA block and decamped with gold jewellery and cash worth close to Rs 7 lakh while the family was on vacation.         
	The burglary was discovered on Monday when Ajoy Paul, an eye surgeon, and his family returned to their ground floor flat at HA 274. The Pauls had left for their Raichak holiday retreat on Sashthi.        
	The burglars probably knew we would not be at home during Puja. It seems they had an informer known to us, said Ajoys wife Chandra, also an eye surgeon.        
	A window grille of the flats dining room was found broken. The window latch was twisted and an iron rod lay in the bedroom. Police suspect the burglars had used the rod as a lever.        
	We are not ruling out the possibility of the theft being carried out by the same group that had committed a burglary on Friday night, said an officer of Bidhannagar South police station.        
	Burglars had broken into an FD block residence, 700 metres away from the Paul familys flat, and decamped with ornaments worth Rs 3 lakh while the owners were busy pandal-hopping.        
	Ajoy said the bulk of the stolen jewellery was purchased during a vacation in Egypt three months ago.

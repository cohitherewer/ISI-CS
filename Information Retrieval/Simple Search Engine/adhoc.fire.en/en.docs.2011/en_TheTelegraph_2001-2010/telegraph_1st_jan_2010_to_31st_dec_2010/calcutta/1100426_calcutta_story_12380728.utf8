                      Frames of reference                    Avijit Mukherjees fascinating grids, objects and forms are chosen for their visual qualities and symbolic nature. He is interested in the drama and tension created by their random arrangement where objects and forms are viewed as archetypes and symbols. As such, they are the means to convey an inner resonance and personal meaning. In his ongoing show, Within the Grid, the grids live and breathe in the counterpoint between the strangeness of the world and its ordinary, domestic familiarity. They have their own histories, which they carry into the present. Usually practical and useful by nature, the subjects spring free from daily contingencies in the process of their representation on pictorial surface. Footwear, spectacles, headgear, insects, birds and much else beside find a complex life in these works; their juxtapositions defying customary groupings. Objects may be clumped together like a cityscape, or they may be separated so that the individuality of their form and texture is emphasised. The artist takes on the mlange of the contemporary condition. The outpouring of work is, therefore, varied and diverse. It brings the real, the false and the imaginary together in a wonderful amalgam of meaning and wonder. Ultimately, his works are an exploration of philosophical and emotional concepts like mortality, time, space, reality, illusion and, of course, the seen and the unseen.

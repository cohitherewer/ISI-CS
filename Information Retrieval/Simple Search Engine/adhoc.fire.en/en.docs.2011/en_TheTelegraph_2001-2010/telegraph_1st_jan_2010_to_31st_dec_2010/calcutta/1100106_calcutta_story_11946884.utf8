The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taslima pins hope on visa visit
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Taslima pins hope on visa visit
          MOHUA DAS                              
	Writer Taslima Nasrin has expressed her desire to visit Calcutta when she returns to India this month to renew her visa, which expires on February 17.         
	Taslima, however, doubts whether she will be allowed to step into the city, even to attend the launch of the sixth instalment of her autobiography, Nei, Kicchu Nei, at the Book Fair.         
	I really want to visit Calcutta Book Fair but will I be allowed to? asked Taslima from the US, where she has completed a year-long fellowship in human rights at New York University.        
	After attending seminars across Europe throughout 2009, she hopes to spend time in Delhi, if not in Calcutta, during her India trip.         
	I dont want to settle in the West. Im waiting to see if the authorities would allow me to return to Calcutta. I hope good sense will prevail. It was hard for me to concentrate on my writings away from where I belong. I write for the well-being of society so why am I being punished?        
	She said she got the impression that resident visa was being granted every six months on the hidden condition that she would leave India immediately. But there has never been any demonstration against my stay in Delhi. Ive moved around freely and nobody even recognised me. Calcutta too is a safe place for me. Ive lived there for four years. I dont know where Ill go if they kick me out this time again, said Taslima, who is writing the seventh instalment of her autobiography, dealing with her expulsion from India.

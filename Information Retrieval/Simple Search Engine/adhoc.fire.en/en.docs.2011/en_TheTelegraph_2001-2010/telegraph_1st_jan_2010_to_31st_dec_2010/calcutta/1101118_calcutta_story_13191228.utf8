                      Jungle fun for everyone                    The rapid and reckless efforts of industrialisation and urbanisation are mainly responsible for the rapidly diminishing wildlife on our planet. The crushing pressure of the academic and social world has made the wonderful, exciting and many-splendored animal world, that coexists with us on earth, a mere memory for the urban child. Therefore, some time spent with nature and wildlife will bring home the realisation that life itself, flowing from a power greater than ourselves, is at work all around us. The modern child must understand that birds, animals and fish have equal right to the bounties of this planet and that the protection of the earths vitality, diversity and beauty is a sacred trust. Hosted by Kangaroo Kids, Jungle Safari is an exciting collage of events seeking to spread awareness in children and help develop their interest in nature and the need to protect and conserve its resources. In it, kids brings alive wild and exotic animals from India, Africa and Australia through puppet shows, live enactments, karaoke sessions and more.

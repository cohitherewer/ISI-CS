			        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	An intervention by the chief ministers office has prompted the higher education department to send the Presidency University Bill 2009 to the governor for his assent but a cloud of confusion still hangs on the extent of freedom the institute will enjoy as a unitary university.        
	The bill, which the Assembly had passed in March, reached Raj Bhavan on Thursday for the second time since governor M.K. Narayanan expressed reservations on the provisions that deny Presidency absolute freedom to recruit vice-chancellors and members of selection committees for appointment of teachers.        
	According to the Constitution, the governor has to sign a bill sent for his assent the second time.        
	Narayanan had earlier sent back the bill to the higher education department, his concerns recorded in an accompanying file.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may try his best to fast-track the process of granting autonomy to Presidency but the bill suggests the government has equated the institution, supposed to function as a centre of excellence in its new avatar, with any other state university, said an alumnus of the College Street campus.        
	Political control over the appointment of vice-chancellors is inevitable. The relevant provisions are almost the same as those in the proposed Sidho-Kanhu-Birsa University Bill, and the acts governing Jadavpur and Calcutta universities.        
	The clause 8(1) of chapter II of the Presidency University Bill says: The Vice-Chancellor shall be appointed by the Chancellor on the unanimous recommendation of the (university) Court. If the Court fails to make any such unanimous recommendation, the vice-chancellor shall be appointed by the Chancellor in consultation with the minister from a panel of three persons to be elected by the Court....        
	The clause 9 of chapter II of the Sidho-Kanhu-Birsa University Bill states the same.        
	Had the government really wanted to make Presidency a world-class university, it should have followed the standard model of forming a search committee with reputable academicians for the appointment of the vice-chancellor. The state actually wants its nominees to head the varsity and retain control, said a former Presidency teacher.        
	Once the governor puts his seal on the bill, a gazette notification will have to be issued following which the college will start functioning as a unitary university.        
	Admission to Presidency postgraduate courses will start before that. The students will be admitted in the existing system, said an official.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday again rejected the bail plea of Haldirams owner Prabhu Shankar Agarwal.         
	Agarwal was sentenced to life imprisonment in January for conspiring to kill a tea-stall owner to acquire a plot.        
	The high court had earlier denied the bhujia barons bail plea on March 10.        
	On Thursday, the division bench of Justice S.P. Agarwal and Justice M.K. Sinha said: The court feels Agarwal should not be released from jail at this stage. The bench also directed the authorities to prepare a paper book containing all documents related to the case within eight weeks. Once the book is ready, the bench will hear Agarwals appeal against the trial courts verdict.        
	Moving Agarwals bail plea, lawyer and former mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: My client should not be implicated in the case. He had obtained an eviction decree against the tea-stall owner from a civil court. So there was no need for him to get the tea-stall owner killed.        
	Public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami opposed the plea, saying there were enough documents to prove that Agarwal had conspired to get the owner killed.

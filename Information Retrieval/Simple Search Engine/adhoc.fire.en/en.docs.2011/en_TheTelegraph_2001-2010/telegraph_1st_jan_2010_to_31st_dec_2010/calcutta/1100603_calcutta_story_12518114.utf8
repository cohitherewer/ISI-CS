The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Red bastion goes green                                                                                                                            3                                                                                      Red bastion goes green     - Streets of revelry for one, roads to avoid for another                                      Trinamul flags fly high in Alipore; the CPM flag flutters forlorn at Alimuddin Street on Wednesday. (Amit Datta and Bishwarup Dutta)                                        
	As the fate of the candidates was being sealed, Metro reporters scanned the mood at some of the counting centres across the city.              
	Where: Jodhpur Park Girls School, Jodhpur Park        
	Time: 8.20am-8.45am        
	Wards: 103 to 109 (Dhakuria and Kasba)        
	What we saw: Upbeat Trinamul supporters, carrying party flags and wearing headbands, had gathered around the school. CPM supporters were standing at a distance, quietly.              
	Where: Hare School, College Street        
	Time: 8am-9.30am, noon-1pm        
	Wards: 36-37, 40-45 and 48-50 (New CIT Road, CR Avenue, College Street, Amherst Street)        
	What we saw: Party workers and common people started trooping in even before the counting started. The initial drift was in the Lefts favour but the trend reversed soon after. By afternoon, the area resembled a sea of green.            
	Where: Jadavpur Sanmilita Balika Vidyalaya, Baghajatin        
	Time: 9am-10am        
	Wards: 101-102, 110-114 (Tollygunge, Garia and Jadavpur)        
	What we saw: Around 150 CPM supporters had gathered beside the school, occasionally cheering as trends trickled out. Across the road, Trinamul supporters were seated in rows of chairs.                    
	Where: Ballygunge Government High School, Beltala        
	Time: 10.30am-11.30am         
	Wards: 68-73, 84-87, 90 (Bhowanipore, Ballygunge, Deshapriya Park, Southern Avenue and other areas)        
	What we saw: Around 300 Trinamul supporters were dancing, shouting slogans and smearing one another with green abir as trends showed their candidates were ahead in all 11 wards. Not a single CPM supporter was around.              
	Where: Bethune Collegiate School, Bidhan Sarani        
	Time: 9.30am-10.30am        
	Wards: 21-28, 38 and 39 (Cossipore, BT Road, Posta, Sir Hari Ram Goenka Street, Kalakar Street and MG Road)        
	What we saw: Supporters of almost all parties were scattered around but once the trends started emerging, BJP and Trinamul workers hit the street, forcing police to divert traffic on Bidhan Sarani for almost an hour.              
	Where: Jaipuria College, Raja Naba Krishna Street        
	Time: 10.30am-noon        
	Wards: 10-12, 15-20 (Narkeldanga, Rajabazar, Beleghata, Maniktala)        
	What we saw: Police had to put up barricades to separate slogan-shouting supporters of the CPM and Trinamul. The CPM won two wards but its celebration paled when Trinamul broke into raptures, hailing their victory in the rest of the wards.                                Caption      
	Where: Mahadevi Birla Girls High School, Darga Road        
	Time: Noon-1.30pm        
	Wards: 56-59, 63-67 (Tangra, Pottery Road, Christopher Road and other areas)        
	What we saw: Around 500 Trinamul supporters were inside the Park Circus maidan while the rival camp was represented by only five men near bridge No. 4. The Left Front ranks, however, swelled to 100 within minutes of Trinamul heavyweight Javed Khans defeat being announced. Both groups headed for a face-off. The cops immediately took up position and RAF personnel started patrolling Darga Road. A showdown was averted.              
	Where: Barisha High School, Behala        
	Time: 9am-9.30am        
	Wards: 115-123 (east Behala, Roy Bahadur Road, Thakurpukur and Haridevpur)        
	What we saw: Trinamul supporters danced and shouted slogans every time there was an announcement that their candidates were leading. Traffic came to a standstill at times, as the Mamata brigade chose to celebrate its moment of glory bang in the middle of the road. CPM supporters, outnumbered, were standing across the thoroughfare. Forlorn.                          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI, ZEESHAN JAWED AND SUBHAJOY ROY

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Strike hits student schedule
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Strike hits student schedule
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Over 1.5 lakh students will pay a heavy price for the 12-hour strike on July 5 called by the Left parties to protest the fuel price hike.        
	The shutdown is unlikely to trigger a price rollback but it is sure to delay the publication of results in graduate and postgraduate courses and also the process of admission in undergraduate colleges and engineering institutes.        
	July 5 is an exam date for various undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Calcutta, Jadavpur, Rabindra Bharati and Burdwan universities. It is also the day for counselling at engineering colleges and admission at several undergraduate general degree colleges in Calcutta.         
	The strike call makes it clear that the political parties are not bothered about the fate of students, said a CU examination department official.        
	It may be a potent political tool for the perpetrators of the strike and just another extended weekend  the tradition of calling strikes at the beginning or end of the week continues  for a lucky few, but the Monday strike poses a serious challenge for educational institutions and their students.        
	Take the case of several thousand students who come to Calcutta from the districts and also from other states to attend the counselling sessions. With the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination Board, which has to fill 28,000 seats from a pool of over 60,000 students, suspending counselling of students on July 5 because of the strike, they will have to alter their travel plans.        
	The students who were supposed to attend the July 5 counselling will have to be present on July 6 and similarly those scheduled for July 6 will have to turn up on July 7. The last day of counselling was July 20 but now it will end on July 21, said Siddhartha Dutta, the board chairman.        
	Postponement of exams will also affect nearly 40,000 students who were supposed to write Calcutta Universitys (CU) BA Part-II examinations in political science on July 5. The exam has been postponed till July 10  a Saturday  and the officials will have to make several adjustments to host the exam on a holiday.        
	Question papers of CUs undergraduate examinations are stored in treasury offices in the districts. To keep the treasury office open on a Saturday, we need permission from the chief secretary and clearance from the finance and home departments. We will have to make all these arrangements at such short notice, said the examination department official.         
	CU was also slated to conduct postgraduate examinations in 18 subjects such as English, Hindi, pure math, statistics, zoology and computer applications on July 5.         
	We will announce the revised dates of the postgraduate exams later, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the CU pro-vice chancellor, academic affairs.        
	The sudden strike will also derail the process of result publication.        
	The administrative work to conduct the exams on a fresh date will have a chain effect and slow down the publication of the BA, BSc and BCom Part-III results, which are scheduled for the second week of July.         
	Delay in publication of Part-III results will harm students who have got jobs in various companies or cleared the entrance tests to join postgraduate courses outside Bengal as they may miss out on joining dates or admissions, said a CU official.

                      Art for the soul                    It is a commonly-believed fallacy that contemporary artists in Bengal have moved away from portrayals of spontaneous expressions of life to an indeterminate, obscure realm that most viewers find difficult to comprehend. To be inaugurated this evening, the group show, Art Now ... A Glimpse, is an exposition of contemporary artworks that seeks to explode this myth. Participated by young and promising artists of Bengal, it features breathtaking array of paintings that can ignite the imagination and soothe the senses. Largely based on nature, with canvases that depict peaceful, sylvan, shadowy or even fierce landscapes, they inspire and inform the viewer with spiritual intimations. Participants: Suvra Chakraborty (a painting by her appears here), Nilkanto Mondal, Monami Chowdhury, Keshav Roy, Devashish Das, Sukanto Das, Samir Paul, Ranjit Roy, Rabin Mondal and others. Inauguration today at 5.45 pm by US Consul General in Calcutta Beth Payne and fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee. Hosted by Doel Sen.

                      Exploring the unreal                    Viewed from different perspectives, reality assumes different levels of interpretation and can expose multiple truths simultaneously. An examination of the dualities of the modern world, This is Unreal tries to show how what is real at one moment can become unreal at the very next. The three artists in the exhibition are all deeply linked with creating conflicting realities within the realm of their practice. Raqs Media Collective portrays the brief, unhappy love story of an imaginary estranged couple, fighting a coded war of messages against themselves, reflecting the personal complexities of an intense love affair played out on the walls of an unknown city. The apparent and the real are two sides of a simple action played out on a screen in Susanta Mandals kinetic sculpture that delves into the barrier, created by urban ethos, at times to protect its identity and at others to portray a different truth. Yamini Nayar (an installation by her appears here) builds imagined spaces on tabletops from recycled materials that are photographed, then disassembled and discarded. The photograph is an entry point into a structure held together only for the lens, but does not provide any point of reference to scale or location. Ultimately, the uncanny, nagging sensation that says this must be unreal is what constitutes each artwork and forms the essence of the show. At a time when the line between real and unreal has already blurred, this show successfully explores the ongoing conspiracy between the need to doubt and the urge to stay real.                  Event: Abstract artworks by Raqs Media Collective, Susanta Mandal and Yamini Nayar When: Till September 4 (except Sundays); 11 am - 7 pm Where: Experimenter, 2/1 Hindusthan Road

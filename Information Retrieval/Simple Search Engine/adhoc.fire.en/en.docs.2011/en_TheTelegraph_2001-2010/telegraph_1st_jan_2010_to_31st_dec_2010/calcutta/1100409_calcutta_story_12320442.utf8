The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 4 Stephen bodies identified
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      4 Stephen bodies identified
          A STAFF REPORTER      
	Four of the 16 Stephen Court fire victims whose bodies were charred beyond recognition have been identified through DNA tests.         
	The four victims are Ruhi Parveen, Prateek Roy, JP Jaiswal and Fatema Farhan Ansari. The results of the tests were made available to police on Thursday.        
	Detective chief Damayanti Sen said relatives of the four had been asked to collect the bodies. The condition of another body is so bad that samples could not be collected for DNA analysis, the report mentioned.        
	According to forensic experts, the bodies claimed by relatives of Jayatree Roychowdhury, Bidyut Chandra and Vinit Kumar Karan would be identified by superimposing their pictures with those of their skulls.        
	The bodies of six fire victims have not been claimed.        
	Some of those who survived the blaze moved a step closer to returning home on Thursday afternoon following a two-hour meeting with representatives of CESC, fire services, police and the CMC.        
	The meeting was called to facilitate the rehabilitation of the residents. The building is being re-wired and the residents are following the guidelines issued by the fire services and CESC, said Dipak Sarkar, the deputy director (fire prevention) of the fire services department, after the meeting, attended by 80 residents of Stephen Court blocks III and IV.        
	He added that once residents put in place safety measures suggested in the guidelines, they would need to fill up a form, after which officials will inspect their flats and allow them to visit without signing risk bonds. The process could begin next week.        
	The officials answered our queries and promised to help us. It was a fruitful discussion, said Debashis Guha Neogi, a resident.

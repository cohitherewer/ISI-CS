The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Smart signals out of sync
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Smart signals out of sync
  - Green and red at random throws traffic haywire           KINSUK BASU                                        
	A smart signalling system that was meant to bring method to the citys traffic madness has started sending out wrong signals midway through the project, leaving motorists flummoxed and the thoroughfares choked.        
	Lalbazar, which had signalled an overhaul almost six years ago but then made a delayed start, blames technical lapses by the implementing agency for traffic lights going out of sync at 95-odd signals in town.        
	Keltron, the company entrusted with putting the system in place, has not only been delaying the project but also doing its job in an erratic manner. Signals at several key intersections have not been working in sync because they have failed to make the necessary technological changes, said a senior officer of traffic police.        
	The Area Traffic Control project is part of a scheme known as the Integrated GIS-based Automatic Vehicle Tracking Distressed Call Response and Critical Public Place Surveillance System.         
	The system works through networks where all the signals are connected. The cycle of a signal along a particular stretch is worked out based on the feeds available from a virtual loop involving camera images of traffic at a particular point and a ground loop, where underground sensors calculate the vehicle count. These feeds are analysed, based on which the best possible cycle time of a signal on one point is fixed.         
	The new system requires an overhaul of the entire cable network on a particular grid, which Keltron insists cant be done in a hurry. The 95-odd signals being overhauled in the first phase have apparently been turning green and red at random, clashing with the other signals on the grid.         
	Malfunctioning lights have affected the Entally to Alipore stretch of AJC Bose Road, Rawdon Street, Hungerford Street and Camac Street.        
	Traffic lights along Central Avenue and parts of Strand Road have also been going on the blink during peak hours, forcing the police to resort to hand signalling.        
	The lights go off without warning and sometimes red, green and amber glow together. Hand signalling is then the only way out but that makes the traffic situation worse, said a sergeant.        
	P. Kanungo, a senior official of Keltron, dismissed the glitches as transition pangs. When you change a signal controller, you also need to change the cable layout that is 15-20 years old. Besides, there is a problem with standardisation. Different signals were set up by different companies, each following their own methods. The lack of uniformity has made matters more difficult for us, he explained.        
	So how long will motorists have to contend with signal confusion? We have asked the companies maintaining these signals to co-ordinate with Keltron to sort out the mess, said the deputy commissioner (traffic), Dilip Bandopadhyay.        
	Sources at the Thiruvananthapuram-based Keltron said work on the first phase, which was supposed to be completed one-and-a-half years ago, wont be over before September-October.

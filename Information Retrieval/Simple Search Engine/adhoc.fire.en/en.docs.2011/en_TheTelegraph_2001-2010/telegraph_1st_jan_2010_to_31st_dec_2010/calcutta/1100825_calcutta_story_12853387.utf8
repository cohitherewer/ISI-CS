                The SSKM Hospital authorities have decided to not allow more than two persons to enter the emergency ward along with a patient following attacks on junior doctors, most recently on Monday night. A circular to that effect would be issued on Wednesday, said Pradip Mitra, the director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM. He told junior doctors and students union representatives of the decision on Tuesday afternoon.    Ashok Singhi, the stockbroker who was found hanging from the ceiling of a balcony in his first-floor flat on Ballygunge Park Road, died after Sunday midnight, states the post-mortem report. Investigators have concluded that the 46-year-old committed suicide. Preliminary investigation suggests a funds crunch drove him to suicide. Police are checking Singhis bank records.     Two motorcycles collided on Strand Road, under South Port police station, on Tuesday. One of the riders, K. Singh, sustained severe head injuries and was admitted to the neurology ward of CMRI Hospital. In another mishap on Tuesday, a bus hit a motorcycle at the intersection of the EM Bypass and Beleghata Main Road.

On Beleghata Circular Canal, Bhattacharya said a Rs 10-crore project is on to reduce its pollution. The government will seek Rs 40 crore from the National Ganga River Basin Authority to desilt the canal.    The high court on Tuesday rejected the bail plea of Manjit Singh, alias Mange, who had been arrested on Park Street in 1998 on the charge of murdering the collector of customs and excise in Allahabad. Mange had fled police custody twice, in Delhi and Calcutta. After completion of his trail in Kanpur, Mange was brought to Calcutta where he has been implicated for attacking police and escaping from custody. His trail in the two cases will resume before the metropolitan magistrates court in December.

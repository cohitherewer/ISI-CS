	Colorado-based learning centre for kids, FasTracKids International, started its third centre in Calcutta last Friday. Inaugurated by US consul-general Beth Payne (picture left by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya), the Salt Lake branch will offer various courses to kids between one and eight.         
	While FasTrack Core, targeted at kids from five to eight years, trains them in mathematics, biology, technology and communication in two-hour weekly sessions, FasTrack Tots, for kids from three to five years, is a simplified version of the Core.         
	The courses are of two years duration each. FasTrack Music uses music to improve vocabulary and build motor skills, with a new topic introduced every month.         
	Discovery and Explorers are two new courses on offer. Of a years duration each, they are for kids from two to four years of age. Private players in education like FasTrack are providing more options for parents to choose from, said Payne.        
	The stress here is on practical demonstration and the use of technology. Our programme focuses on developing the physical, social and communication skills of a child, said Avanti Hemnani, a teacher at the centre.         
	The course fees are Rs 1,500 a month for Core, Rs 1,250 a month for Tots and Rs 1,000 a month for Music, along with an initial registration fee of Rs 1,500.

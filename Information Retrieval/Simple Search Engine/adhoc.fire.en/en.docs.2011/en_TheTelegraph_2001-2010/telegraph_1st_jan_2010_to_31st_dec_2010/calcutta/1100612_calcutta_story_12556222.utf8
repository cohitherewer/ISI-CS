The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cup comes alive on a wall   From boots to brush
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cup comes alive on a wall     - Railway employee and soccer devotee paints samba stars          RITH BASU                          BRUSH WITH BRAZIL: Ajay Kar at work on his wall canvas on Friday afternoon.

	Soccer fans in a south Calcutta para are tuning in to live World Cup action not only on their television screens but also on a neighbourhood wall.        
	As host South Africa and Mexico played out a 1-1 draw in the Cup opener on Friday, sometime soccer player, full-time railway employee and part-time wall artist Ajay Kar raced against the clock to complete his labour of love on a 12x110ft wall along Harish Mukherjee Road in Kalighat.        
	Kars goal is to finish painting his action captures of stars at the World Cup (and beyond) before his favourites  Kaka and Co.  kick off at midnight on Tuesday. I have barely slept for two hours on an average this week, mixing work with pleasure, smiled the 47-year-old, giving the finishing touches to a leaping Alexandre Pato of Brazil.        
	But why Pato, who doesnt even figure in Dungas squad? I wanted to include a few youngsters in my mural. So this action shot of Pato alongside Rooney, said Kar, who does night shifts in the computer signalling section of Eastern Railways Howrah office.                          
	Kar was a prolific striker for his club Elysium in the IFA fifth-division league but few knew that he could hang up his boots and pick up the brush. He painted a few freeze frames of stars in action to promote a local club tournament in 1983 and it became a para tradition. His work has been a feature of every World Cup since 1986, said a member of the socio-cultural group Samparka.        
	His fans support Kars art by keeping him company as he brings alive faces and figures. On Friday evening, someone brought along a laptop to play the Cup anthem Give me freedom, give me fire full blast. It added to the World Cup feel, said Kar, tapping his toes.        
	So what keeps him going? I am still as passionate about this as I was in 1986. This time I am even more motivated because my 12-year-old daughter has started taking an interest in what I do, he said.

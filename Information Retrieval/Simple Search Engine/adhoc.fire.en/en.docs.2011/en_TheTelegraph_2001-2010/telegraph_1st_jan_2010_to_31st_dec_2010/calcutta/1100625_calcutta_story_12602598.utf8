The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Probe team faces probe
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Probe team faces probe
  - Sanskrit, not suicide, had taken trio to school!          OUR BUREAU                              (Top) The La Martiniere for Boys gate that was opened on Wednesday for the probe team of (from right above) Ramesh Bhattacharjee, Anthony Arun Biswas and Dilip Datta				                                       
	The probe team that visited La Martiniere for Boys on Wednesday flashing the ministry of human resource development card and demanding a report on the Rouvanjit Rawla case scurried for cover on Thursday behind a smokescreen of Sanskrit.        
	It wasnt a probe team. I had gone to the school in my personal capacity to talk about the inclusion of the Sanskrit language. The others had come along with me. I never said that the ministry had sent me, Ramesh Bhattacharjee, the head of the team, told Metro at his Ultadanga house.        
	This was less than 24 hours after Bhattacharjee had got the Shakespeare Sarani police station to ensure that the Loudon Street campus gates were opened for him, as a representative of the MHRD, on Wednesday afternoon.        
	The ministry on Wednesday initiated an inquiry to ascertain how three unauthorised persons, claiming to represent it on a fact-finding mission, had visited the school.        
	After the school visit, Bhattacharjee had told Metro they had asked the school to submit a report on the matter, which would be forwarded to the ministry with observations, on the basis of which Delhi might despatch another team.        
	But late on Wednesday, after being told that minister Kapil Sibal had said no team had been authorised to visit La Martiniere, Bhattacharjee changed tack and claimed he was under instructions from the department in Delhi to collect information about the case.        
	On Thursday afternoon, he admitted he was not acting under any instructions from Delhi and that while discussing the spread of Sanskrit, he had also enquired about the Rouvanjit Rawla matter on humanitarian grounds.        
	The school rubbished Bhattacharjees claim and maintained that the team had focused entirely on the caning of Rouvanjit and had merely asked whether we had Sanskrit as a language.        
	In a letter written to the MHRD  on the ministrys request to furnish information about the mystery probe team that had landed up at La Martiniere  Supriyo Dhar, the secretary to the schools board of governors, mentioned that the persons claimed that they had been duly authorised by the ministry.... to investigate into the matter relating to Late Rouvanjit Rawla.        
	According to sources in the ministry, Sibal asked officials to find out details of the matter and explore legal action against the three persons since they had misrepresented the ministry.        
	Who are the three men under a cloud? Bhattacharjee claims to be a Congressman who had twice contested the Lok Sabha polls from the Dum Dum constituency.         
	His visiting card reads member, department of secondary and higher education, ministry of human resource development, government of India.        
	Bhattacharjee has already dashed off a letter to the ministry, a copy of which is with Metro, in which he introduces himself as member, Rashtriya Sanskrit Parishad, under the MHRD, who frequently visits Anglo-Indian schools for introducing Sanskrit as the third language and states he felt it was his moral responsibility to get... acquainted with the Rawla matter in La Mart.        
	He was accompanied on Wednesday by Anthony Arun Biswas, the president of the All India Minorities and Weaker Sections Council, and Dilip Datta, a retired deputy secretary of the West Bengal school education department         
	Biswas claimed on Thursday that Bhattacharjee had told him that the MHRD had asked him to probe the Rawla issue, while Datta said he was told that the visit was about encouraging Sanskrit at the school.        
	I have been fooled. I was told he was authorised by the ministry, said Biswas.        
	Bhattacharjee asked me to come along because I was in the education department for years and could help in convincing the school to introduce Sanskrit. I wish I hadnt got involved, Datta said on Thursday.

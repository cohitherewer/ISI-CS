The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Child body in biscuit carton
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Child body in biscuit carton
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A snack shop owner on Monday led police to the body of a two-year-old boy whom he had allegedly murdered and stuffed into an empty biscuit carton.         
	Nemai Mandal, the 47-year-old owner of the Domjur shop, was arrested on Sunday night hours after Gopal Dalui, the toddler whose parents live next door, went missing.        
	Nemai admitted during interrogation that he had killed the baby. But the motive of the murder is not clear. We have started a murder case against him, said Anuradha Mandal, deputy superintendent of police (town-north), Howrah.        
	Raju and Sharmistha, the boys parents, used to frequent the shop with Gopal. Shortly after the baby went missing on Sunday morning, Mandal left his shop and did not return till afternoon.         
	Raju and some neighbours alerted the police after Mandal made contradictory statements when asked whether he had seen the boy.         
	Around 2pm on Monday, investigators took Mandal to his shop and recovered the body from the carton.         
	Mandal used to make indecent proposals and I used to snap at him. He probably killed my son to take revenge, said Sharmistha.

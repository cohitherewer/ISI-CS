          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta polices detective department on Thursday arrested 35-year-old Sumantra Gupta at Uttorayan Township in Siliguri for allegedly cheating a Guwahati woman of Rs 17 lakh by promising her a seat at KPC Medical College, Bengals only private medical college, in Jadavpur.         
	Gupta, the son of the head of the forensic science department of North Bengal Medical College, used to run Vinayaka Consultancy Pvt Ltd in Lake Gardens, which helped students find seats at private medical colleges across the country.         
	Soon after Guptas arrest in Siliguri, a team of officers raided his office in Jodhpur Gardens, opposite South City Mall, and recovered fake stamps bearing the logo of KPC Medical College and several forged documents.         
	It seems Gupta had duped several others by promising seats in private medical colleges, said an investigator.        
	In early 2009, Gupta had allegedly promised to get 26-year-old Guwahati resident Nagma Khan admitted to KPC Medical College in exchange for Rs 17 lakh. Nagma paid the amount, mostly in cash, in several instalments. Gupta handed her a fake admission letter. When Nagma went to the college with it, she was told that it was forged. She then asked him to return the money, said an officer.         
	After refusing to do so for a long time, Gupta gave her three cheques drawn on a private bank in Calcutta.        
	When the cheques bounced, Nagma lodged a complaint with Lake police station on November 28.        
	A cop said Gupta had been arrested last year for allegedly cheating a doctor working in a private nursing home on Shakespeare Sarani of Rs 4.5 lakh by promising him admission to an institution in the UK.

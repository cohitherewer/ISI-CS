The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taiwan offer for tie-up
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Taiwan offer for tie-up
  - Plan to set up trade office in the city          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                           Wenchyi Ong in the city on Monday. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                        
	The Taiwanese ambassador to India, Wenchyi Ong, will put forward plans for collaborations in food processing, agriculture technology and IT and seek help to open a trade office in the city during his meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Tuesday afternoon.         
	West Bengal produces a lot of food products but there is hardly any food processing here. In India, only two per cent of the agricultural produce is processed. A thriving food processing industry will increase efficiency in the agricultural sector, Ong, in Calcutta on a three-day visit, told Metro.        
	We have presence in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat but we have no investment in West Bengal and we are looking forward to establishing trade relations with the state, added Ong.        
	If trade relations are established business would follow. The Taiwan government wants to set up a centre here next year and I am going to ask the chief minister to help us with it.        
	The ambassador was quick to point out that the governments of the states in which Taiwan has invested were pro-active in attracting foreign investment and West Bengal needs to be aggressively competitive.        
	According to Ong, though tax, regulations and incentives would be deciding factors, West Bengal already has an edge over other states as a potential destination of Taiwanese investment because of the strong presence of the Hakka Chinese community here.        
	For Taiwanese companies, finding people who know Chinese and Hindi becomes a stumbling block. The young people in Tangra who are bilingual and bicultural can become the backbone of Taiwanese companies in the state, said Ong, who visited Tangra on Monday.        
	The ambassador will also discuss with Bhattacharjee the possibility of the country participating in the Calcutta International Film Festival for the first time.        
	Ong will meet members of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and inaugurate the first Taiwan Film Festival in the state at the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute on Tuesday.

	A lot of facts about Stephen Court are emerging after the fire but that will change nothing as the same horror story has been repeated across Calcutta so many times.           
	Our politicians and bureaucrats have elevated themselves beyond our reach and it is now we, the people, who serve them. The road in front of Writers Buildings is one-way only for the common people, all official cars drop their masters and go the wrong way.           
	In the evenings police and other officers head for watering holes, where again their cars are parked illegally, with driver and bodyguard in attendance (for instance, check the road opposite the Chief Justices residence). The taxpayer forks out their overtime.           
	However, with respect to fire safety, flat owners and tenants are to blame too, for purchasing or renting properties that are fire traps and then permitting the landlord or builder to prevent access to escape routes.           
	It requires a lot of courage to take on the politician-builder-criminal nexus that is making a mockery of building laws in the state. So what can change things? Mamata Banerjee? Very unlikely. We ourselves have to take charge of matters. We need to set right things that are within our control, starting with the building we live in.

	Park Street has been the centrestage of many celebrations all my life. As a kid I would visit Park Street almost daily to play in one of the first video game parlours in the city. As teenagers, we headed for India Hobby Centre and Big Max for adda, while browsing at Oxford Bookstore remains a favourite activity even now. Further down, Bar-B-Q has been witness to many happy occasions.             
	When news of the Stephen Court fire broke, I rushed to the spot and stared in horror.           
	Calcutta has suffered numerous devastating fires. The ruling party, the Opposition and all administrative bodies continue to pass the buck. Keeping two hydraulic ladders in Sector V and Silpara and a defunct one at the city centre defies logic, as does a fire minister of 14 years saying that he is learning lessons!           
	Md. Badruddin Ahmed,

	The killer inferno at Park Street has turned many dreams, desires and hopes into ashes. The ghastly sight shook every Calcuttan to the core. Park Street is the heart of Calcutta. It is hard to put the loss in words.

	Calcuttans will take a long time to recover from the deep sense of despair and anguish at losing their fellow-citizens. The city can never forgive or forget the indifference of politicians. Let alone save lives, can our politicians reduce the trauma of the survivors who saw friends and family being burnt alive or falling to death? Can they piece together the shattered lives of so many people? For Calcutta, March 23, 2010 is a Black Tuesday, a day when the nation and the world saw the common man meeting a gory end, while those elected to power by him looked on and those not in power were out to get mileage out of this great tragedy to help them to come to power.           
	Jaya Ghosh,

	 Absolutely yes (Is Park Street really the citys favourite street?, March 30). Park Street had Trincas, Mad House (Sunday jam sessions), Blue Fox (the best jazz in India), Moulin Rouge (one of the best night clubs), Sky Room (the best restaurant) and Calcuttas first discotheque  In amp; Out at Park hotel. All this was till the 1970s. Park Street started losing its unique charm with companies flocking to it for office space around the 80s. The only way to return Part Street to its glorious days is by removing all offices from the street between the Chowringhee and Camac Street crossings.             
	Gautam Banerjee,
  Address not mentioned                               
	Politicians are like vultures, feeding on scorched human flesh for mileage. They had no business visiting Stephen Court on the day of the tragedy or the SSKM morgue later in the day. The lives lost were not their concern, they wanted an excuse to demand the chief ministers head, even in the midst of a devastating human tragedy. Millions of TV viewers heard Mamata Banerjees ridiculous suggestion that her railway disaster management squad would be more effective in responding to the blaze.             
	Also, why were Partha Chatterjee and Madan Mitra at SSKM? What business did they have there?           
	We mourn those who have lost their lives in this fire and also for ourselves that we have to live with these politicians till we die.           
	B.R. Pal,
  Address not mentioned                     
	We are fed up of our politicians. I fail to understand why we have to wait for hours in traffic snarls while our netas just zoom past. This right of passage should only be given to ambulances and fire tenders. These politicians are supposed to be accountable to us and must also share our agony in the traffic. But sadly the only thing they are good at is blaming others for their own faults.           
	Rahul Thapa,

	Stephen Court fire was just the tip of the iceberg. There are thousands of such violations in the city waiting for similar disasters.             
	In our Hindustan Park area, a passage between two multi-storeyed buildings has been illegally converted into a kerosene godown which can blow up any time. Written complaints to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the fire services directorate, the local police station and fire station, and local councillor have gone in vain. Where do law-abiding citizens go for redress in case of such blatant disregard for law, safety and security?           
	Atmaram Saraogi,
  Hindustan Park                               
	The Metro picture of the aged, homeless couple titled Dawn of Despair dated March 25 was extremely moving. My husband and I are senior citizens and have been living in Calcutta for decades. Park Street has stood witness to many of our joyous moments. The poignancy of the picture pulled at my heartstrings, evoking emotions which I thought had gone inert. However, I noted a faint glimmer of hope in those two tired pairs of eyes. It could be that my optimism in life has coloured my vision, but I felt that this forlorn couple still hope because things cant get worse  that the sun will shine again on their lives.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Presidency College authorities on Monday admitted lapses on their part in allowing a Group D employee to organise a family party on the campus on Saturday night.        
	Ghanashyam Hela, who threw the party to celebrate the rice-eating ceremony of his grandson, has been showcaused. The college sent a probe report to the higher education department on Monday, saying the employee had crossed all limits.        
	The probe has confirmed that loudspeakers were played in full volume on the campus till 1am in violation of pollution control norms, said a department official.        
	The union room should not have been used and music should not have been played. Such an incident wouldnt recur, principal Amitava Chatterjee said. He denied that food was served on the badminton court.        
	Hela had taken the principals consent for the party but he allegedly kept the authorities in the dark about how he was going to organise it.

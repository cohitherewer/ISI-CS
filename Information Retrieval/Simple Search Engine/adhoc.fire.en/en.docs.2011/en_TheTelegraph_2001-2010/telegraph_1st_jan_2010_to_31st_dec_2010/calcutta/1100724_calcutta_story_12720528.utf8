                      Mix of forms and colours                    Amedley of various artworks previously displayed at this gallery, Studio 21s ongoing show Monsoon Mix offers a breathtaking and diverse array of images and forms by a group of 14 young artists. While Sourav Chatterjee explores textures and movements in his work, the expressionist art of Sambaran Das is characterised by its smooth and sweeping fluidity. Rahul Waghs abstract creations on mixed media are skilful exercises in visual fragmentation. The figurative art of Sougata Das is defined by a layered appearance. A sharp eye for detail emphasises the works of Gauri and Satyadheer Singh. Sujit Karmakar paints dreary, even harsh images of shattered childhood dreams. Hemant Raos works are literally extra-terrestrial, his works dealing with a universe that is different from our own. Sunil Chandra Pal presents reality, albeit with a touch of humour, while Harish Ojha accentuates humour in his apparently simplistic creations. The artworks of Anand Prakash, Sayak Mitra and Anup Mondal lend a voice to the silent sufferings of society.

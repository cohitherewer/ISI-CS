          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A group of youths assaulted a traffic sergeant near New Market police station on Wednesday for warning their friend against riding a motorbike without a helmet.        
	Sergeant Alok Paul was on duty at Subodh Mullick Square around 10.30am on Wednesday when he noticed two youths riding a bike without helmets.         
	As he gestured at them to stop, the duo allegedly tried to race past him but the bike skidded and they fell. Paul arranged for a taxi to send them to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital for treatment after warning them not to ride a bike again without wearing helmets.         
	Around 12.50pm, while Paul was on his way to Esplanade via SN Banerjee Road, nearly 20 youths allegedly intercepted and abused him. They held me by the collar saying that I was responsible for their friends injury. They also kicked me, said Paul.        
	The youths tried to flee when a team from New Market police station rushed to Pauls rescue. Five of the youths were arrested. They are mainly from the Chandni Market area. The youth who led the attack was previously involved in incidents of burning buses and roadblocks, said an officer.

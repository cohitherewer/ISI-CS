	Metro services were disrupted for half an hour on Thursday morning after a man in his early 60s jumped on the tracks in front of a Dum Dum-bound train at Chandni Chowk station.        
	Alok Mohan Mitra, a resident of Malanga Lane in Bowbazar, was taken to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital where he was declared dead.        
	Mitra was standing at the southern end of the platform. It happened so suddenly that other commuters did not get a chance to hold him back, said an officer of Bowbazar police station.        
	Metro services were disrupted till 10.30am. Two Dum Dum-bound and one Kavi Subhas (Gariabazar)-bound trains had to be cancelled.        
	This was the 24th death on the Metro tracks in 2010. Last year, the toll was 15.

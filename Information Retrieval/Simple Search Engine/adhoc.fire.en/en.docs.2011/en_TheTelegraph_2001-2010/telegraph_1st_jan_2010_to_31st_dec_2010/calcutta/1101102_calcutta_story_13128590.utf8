          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The father of Tithiswar Baidya, an 18-year-old school topper who was found dead on the railway tracks near Lake Gardens with multiple injuries on his body, visited the CID headquarters on Monday and recorded his statement.        
	We showed him the call list of Tithiswars cellphone and asked him if he could identify those with whom his son spoke shortly before his death on October 19, said an investigator. Tithiswar spoke to a friend for 28 minutes on October 19 evening, he added.

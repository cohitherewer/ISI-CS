          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                        
	A houseful board is hanging on Dhapa and the city badly needs space to dump its waste  3,800 tonnes daily.         
	The 4,000 acres the Calcutta Municipal Corporation owns are not suitable for dumping waste, leaving the civic body with the only option of buying land to set up a new Dhapa.        
	For environmental reasons, the site has to be far away from the city, like Dhapa was when the 1,275-acre low-lying marshy land was designated a dumping ground around 1870.        
	The days of dumping the citys garbage within the city is almost over. We have to shell out money to buy land somewhere in South 24-Parganas. We cannot go very far because that will multiply the transport costs, said mayoral council member (solid waste management) Debabrata Majumdar.        
	One of the options is Bantala, about 5km from Dhapa.        
	The problem is not unique to Calcutta, Majumdar pointed out. Other big cities such as Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi face the same problem because of rapid urbanisation on the outskirts.        
	Much of the CMCs stock of land on the eastern outskirts of Calcutta is out of bounds because they form part of the 31,000-acre East Calcutta Wetlands, a designated waste-water recycling region that cannot be put to any other use following a high court order.        
	The other plots  in Uttarpara in Hooghly and Howrah  are in the middle of human habitation and cannot be used as waste dump.        
	Of the 1,275 acres in Dhapa, only about 16 acres are now left for dumping waste. The existing site has been in use since 1980, said civic chief engineer (solid waste management) Arun Sarkar. The heap of garbage has taken the shape of a 100-ft high hillock. Trucks laden with trash have to scale the height for unloading. It will soon go beyond the height dumpers can negotiate.        
	The other parts of Dhapa are now used for growing vegetables and fish.        
	Two years ago, the CMC had bought 1.75 acres adjoining Dhapa for Rs 15 crore to set up a new dumping ground. But chief engineer Sarkar said the plot could take filth only for two years.        
	For the Trinamul Congress-run civic body, however, getting a large piece of land may be difficult. The partys spectacular poll run had started following its opposition to land takeover. CMC sources said one way to get around such opposition is to take land from the government.        
	Even when the CMC gets a plot, it cannot start dumping waste straight away. Civic engineers said environment norms stipulated that the ground would have to be prepared first. The garbage has to be dumped on a synthetic impermeable liner to prevent water pollution and a thick layer of clay has to be put on the waste every week to check air pollution.

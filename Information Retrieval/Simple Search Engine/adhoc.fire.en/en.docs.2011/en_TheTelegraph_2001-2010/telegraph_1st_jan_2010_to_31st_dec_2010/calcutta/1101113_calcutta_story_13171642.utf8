                      Professor, we miss you                    Prof. P. Lal (1929-2010) was an institution in Calcuttas literary, cultural, educational and intellectual life, giving the city its reputation as the nursery of post-Independence Indian writing in English, through his publishing house named Writers Workshop, at a time when the fledgling group faced virulent attacks from many quarters as derivative or unpatriotic. The children of that movement have now won worldwide acclaim as post-colonial authors. But P. Lal was more than just a publisher. He was a poet, essayist, and transcreator of many Hindu texts and The Mahabharata. He taught for 50 years at St Xaviers College and Calcutta University. He was also invited to prestigious visiting professorships by many foreign universities. And there were other, less known sides to him: the calligrapher, the patron of folk painters, the culinary enthusiast, the comic-book collector, the childrens playmate, the lover of birds and trees. Friends, well-wishers and students are invited to the memorial meeting hosted by St Xaviers College (Calcutta) Alumni Association.            Event: A condolence meeting for P. Lal When: Today; 3 pm onwards Where: St Xaviers College auditorium

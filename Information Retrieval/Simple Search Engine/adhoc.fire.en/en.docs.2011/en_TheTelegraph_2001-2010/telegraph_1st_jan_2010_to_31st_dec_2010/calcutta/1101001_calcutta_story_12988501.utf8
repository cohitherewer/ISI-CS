          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	A years rigorous training has paid dividends for the 51 people who took a break from work and joined the postgraduate programme for executives at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta in 2009.        
	The third batch of the one-year, fully residential course launched in 2006 has been able to secure a wider array of jobs and profiles than the past two batches.        
	While 52 per cent of the executives who completed the course came from the information technology and information technology-enabled services sector, 50 per cent of the jobs were in the consulting domain.        
	A much larger percentage of students have been able to move away from their core discipline this year, said the course convener, Runa Sarkar.        
	The 60 companies that took part in the placements, which began in 2009, came up with 45 offers for 47 students.        
	The consulting giants that hired from the campus this time include McKinsey, Deloitte, Tata Consultancy Services, Hewlett-Packard, Mindtree Consulting, Amazon Consulting, Accenture and Sapient Consulting. IT companies included TechMahindra, Wipro, Rediff.com, HCL and Infosys BPO.        
	The other recruiters on campus included Opus Soft, Google (India) and Zycus in sales and marketing and KPIT Cummins, Wellspun Group and Siemens in project management and operations.        
	This year there were offers from the strategy and business development sector as well with companies like Directi Internet Solutions, Infosys, Tata International and Manipal Education Group making offers.        
	There were 22 offers in consulting, nine in IT, ITES and telecom, six in sales and marketing, five in strategy and business development and three in project management and operations.        
	We are very happy with the increase in the number of companies this year. There were 60 companies this year compared with 33 last year, said Sarkar.        
	This year, the batch recorded an average salary of Rs 18.4 lakh while the highest salary remained Rs 35 lakh. The batch also bagged an international offer.        
	Four students dropped out of the placement process, three of whom have gone back to the public sector organisations where they had been working. The three have work experience of more than 13 years.        
	They were happy with the work atmosphere at their offices and with the implementation of the 6th Central Pay Commissions recommendations, their salaries have also increased significantly, said Sarkar.        
	Fake lubricant: Cops raided a godown on Strand Road on Wednesday night and seized over 100 litres of fake car lubricant. Rehan Ali, who owns the godown, was arrested. A large number of jars and fake labels of a reputable brand of lubricants were also found in the godown.

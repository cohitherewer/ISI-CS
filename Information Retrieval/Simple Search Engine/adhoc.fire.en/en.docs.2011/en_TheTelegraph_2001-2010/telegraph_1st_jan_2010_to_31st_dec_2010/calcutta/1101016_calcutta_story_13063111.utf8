The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro relief for revellers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Metro relief for revellers
          A STAFF REPORTER                                               The festive crowd in front of Chandni Chowk Metro station. A Telegraph picture      
	Anuradha Basu, 27, was loath to enter Kalighat Metro station on Ashtami after hearing about the long delays and massive crowds over the past few days. But she was in for a surprise as the train entered on time and the journey to Central took the usual 18 minutes.        
	The Metro Railway authorities finally got their act together on Ashtami. With trains running on time, pandal-hoppers breathed easy and reached their destinations on time.        
	Whatever they have done they should have done earlier. On Sashthi evening, while returning to Dum Dum from Chandni Chowk, I thought my ribs would be crushed, said Rupam Bandopadhyay.        
	What made all the difference, according to Metro officials, was stepped up vigil on the platforms that ensured the train doors closed unhindered. There were also repeated appeals to passengers over the public address system to stand away from the doors.        
	We have deployed scouts and guides, as well as personnel from the railway and civic police on the platforms. They are ensuring that the crowd crush does not block doors. Over the past few days, doors closed after several attempts, resulting in delay in the running of the trains, said a Metro official. We also have senior officials manning the control rooms to ensure smooth operations.        
	The passenger count on Saptami was 5,30,000 in the 10-hour running time, from 2pm to midnight, against 5,50,000 on an average weekday when trains run for 15 fours from 7am. On Ashtami, with trains running from 2pm to 4am, the authorities expected the count to go beyond six lakh.        
	The two air-conditioned rakes recently inducted into the fleet made two round trips each on Saptami and three on Ashtami.        
	Injured: Joyshree Roy, 60, suffered burns while lighting a candle inside the pandal of Purbachal Club in Hindustan Park on Friday afternoon.        
	Blockade: Residents blocked Andul Road on Friday morning after police failed to arrest four men who had allegedly attacked a puja pandal in the locality. The blockade caused traffic snarls for over two hours.

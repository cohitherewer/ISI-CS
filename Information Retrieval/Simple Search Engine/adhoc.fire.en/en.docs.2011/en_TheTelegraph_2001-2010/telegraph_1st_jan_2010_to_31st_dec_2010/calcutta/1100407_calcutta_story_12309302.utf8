The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Coral islands call for Calcuttans
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Coral islands call for Calcuttans
  - Talks on to revive airlink with India           SUBHRO SAHA                          The Seychelles tourism board is all set to woo visitors after a lean year in 2009                                        
	Seychelles, with its clutch of granite and coral islands in the middle of the Indian Ocean, has come calling to Calcutta for the first time.        
	Dick Patrick Esparon, the high commissioner of the Republic of Seychelles, and Alain St Ange, the director of tourism (marketing) of the Seychelles tourism board, met travel trade representatives of the city on Tuesday to hard sell the tropical archipelago spread across a million miles of azure ocean.        
	We are here to tap into the Indian market and launch Seychelles to all segments of Indian tourists, St Ange told Metro. The Seychelles tourism board is in dialogue with a private Indian carrier to start direct flights out of Mumbai.        
	Now, one has to take a four-and-a-half-hour flight from Dubai to reach Seychelles, or alternatively, fly via Singapore, Doha or Nairobi. The circuitous connectivity has limited the size of the average Indian tourist traffic to the archipelago to just around 2,000 a year.        
	We hope this number will rise dramatically once we can start a direct flight from India, said high commissioner Esparon. The honorary consul of Seychelles in Calcutta, Nandu Belani, felt the city should contribute a sizeable chunk of that enhanced traffic.        
	It surely gives us a great alternative to offer our clients, many of whom repeat holidays in Southeast Asia for lack of options. However, the tour packages should be more affordable, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	Bhagwan Ramnani of Vensimal Leisure Holidays agreed that the price must be right to entice the individual as well as the corporate crowd. We used to tailor Seychelles packages when Air Seychelles operated from Mumbai. Hopefully, with a direct connectivity again, traffic will improve, he said.        
	Challenging the perception that Seychelles is an elite holiday destination, St Ange stressed that hotel rooms range from $80 a night to Euro 6,000 for a private island with a 24x7 butler. We have something for every pocket, and multiple modes of public transport like the bus, slow and fast ferries and even a helicopter service, he said.        
	As the highest peaks of the submerged remnants of the supercontinent Gondwanaland, Seychelles represents the most ancient mid-ocean islands in the world. While theres much to do, from hiking to diving, fishing to sailing, its the warmth of the Seychellois people that sweeps tourists off their feet, the high commissioner claimed.        
	Tourism, the biggest revenue-earner of these tropical islands, is managed by the private sector since last year. After a 22 per cent slump in business last year in the midst of the global recession, there has been a 12-15 per cent jump in tourist traffic this year, according to Myrna Michel, the director of Seychelles Business Advisory Centre (Asia).

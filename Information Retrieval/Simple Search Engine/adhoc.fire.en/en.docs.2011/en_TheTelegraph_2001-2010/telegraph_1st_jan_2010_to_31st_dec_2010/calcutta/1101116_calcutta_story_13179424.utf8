                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Setu mishap exposes lack of upkeep

	Two brothers going to school were injured on Monday morning when their family car rammed into another that had braked suddenly to avoid a hump on Vidyasagar Setu. The uneven road surface is a result of poor maintenance.         
	Shayan Ahmed, 8, and Sadab Ahmed, 14, sustained head and waist injuries. They were treated at a local hospital and discharged.         
	The boys were headed for Apeejay School on Park Street in a Maruti Ritz when it hit a Tata Indica, about 700m from the toll plaza on the Calcutta-bound flank. The Indica in front stopped all of a sudden. Its driver told me that he had to because of the mound, said Amit Barik, who was driving the Ritz.         
	Shayan and Sadabs father Jameel Ahmed was returning home to Howrah on his motorcycle after morning walk on the Maidan when he noticed his sons standing on the other flank of the bridge and crying. He took the children to hospital.         
	Regular commuters complained that the poor road condition on the bridge had turned it into a death trap.        
	Those on motorcycles have to swerve suddenly to avoid mounds that have sprouted on the bridge. Steel plates jut out in several places, said Jameel.         
	What is most dangerous is that the lights do not work, said Ashis De, who regularly travels between Shibpur and Esplanade on his two-wheeler.         
	The uneven road surface and expansion joints will be levelled soon. Our officers inspected the problem areas today, said Sadhan Banerjee, the vice-chairman of the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners, on Monday. The organisation is responsible for the upkeep of the bridge.         
	On August 24, five persons died after a trailer hit the car they were in near the toll plaza on the Howrah-bound flank of Vidyasagar Setu.         
	Following the fatal accident, HRBC officials built speed-breakers and took other steps to slow down speeding vehicles and avert accidents on the Howrah-bound flank. But the Calcutta-bound flank was left as it was.

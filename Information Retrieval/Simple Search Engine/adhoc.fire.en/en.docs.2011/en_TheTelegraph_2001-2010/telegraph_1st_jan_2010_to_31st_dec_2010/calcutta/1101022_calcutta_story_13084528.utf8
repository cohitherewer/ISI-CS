The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | In coach No. 2 of the 9.07am train, a hush descended and heads turned
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      In coach No. 2 of the 9.07am train, a hush descended and heads turned
          ZEESHAN JAWED                        ALL EYES ON D-SPOT: Passengers waiting to board a train from Central station on Thursday peer into the tunnel where a coach had derailed on Wednesday morning; (below) a passenger peers through the window of a Metro coach approaching Central on Thursday as it rolls past the derailment spot.

	Eita-te uthish na eitai kalke derail hoyechhilo (Dont get into this coach this is the one that got derailed yesterday).        
	The young woman warning her friend against boarding coach number 2 of the 9.07am Dum Dum-New Garia train at Shyambazar on Thursday mirrored the mood of those who took the Metro the morning after the first derailment in its 26-year history.        
	Virat Kohli and Suresh Rainas brilliant batting against Australia in the ODI on Wednesday, a potential hot topic on any morning Metro train, didnt figure in any discussion within earshot. Aajke brishti hobey (It will rain today), the standard opening line between strangers with clammy hands clasping a common handrail, was replaced by Aajke abar hobey na to? (It wont happen again today, will it)?        
	The 14-minute ride from Dum Dum to Central station, 15 metres ahead of the spot where Wednesdays derailment occurred, was all about reflecting on how close to disaster the citys transport lifeline was around that time the previous day.        
	How can the authorities be so callous as to run outmoded trains whose parts come off during a journey? I felt a shudder down my spine when I read what had caused the derailment, said a 30-something woman in a blue sari to her elderly co-passenger, who nodded grimly.        
	So what made them take the Metro on Thursday morning despite the fear of such an incident occurring again? Do we have an alternative? Without the Metro, most Calcuttans would never reach anywhere on time, said the woman.        
	As the train left Mahatma Gandhi Road and the familiar voice on the public address system announced the name of the next station  Central  a hush descended on the coach. Heads turned to look out of the windows. Some tried to get a glimpse of the tunnel through the glass panes on the sliding doors.         
	A mild jerk  not uncommon when the motorman shifts gears  prompted many to jump out of their seats and those standing to reach for the handrails. A few wore embarrassed smiles on realising what the jerk was all about.         
	In the 1980s, when the Metro ran only between Esplanade and Tollygunge, it was more of a joyride with the family on weekends. Today, it is a necessary evil, said Biswanath Mullick, a 55-year-old employee of a private finance company on Jawaharlal Nehru Road.         
	Mullick, a regular on the Metro from Dum Dum to Park Street since the late 1990s, wasnt on the train that derailed on Wednesday but he has seen  and felt  the gradual decay of what used to be the citys pride.        
	Snags have become a regular affair because Metro hasnt moved with the times. For the Calcuttan, it is still the best bet because there is no alternative yet, he rued.        
	The train gradually slowed down. The watch said 9.19am. Bright light filled the coach and many stood up from their seats to get off, thinking that the train had entered Central. No, this is the stretch where the accident occurred. They have installed lights here, said a man standing near the door.        
	Seconds later, as the train pulled into the station and the doors opened for some of the passengers to get off and others waiting on the platform to get in, Thursday was finally back to being just another busy weekday on the Metro.

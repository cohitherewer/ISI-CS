The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Behala boy hits   a Bayern goal
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Behala boy hits   a Bayern goal
  - Bagan junior puts missed Paris trip behind with Munich ticket          RITH BASU                          Behala boy Sanchayan Samaddar practises in a Mohun Bagan junior team jersey at a playground near his home on Sunday. Picture by Amit Datta                                              
	Sanchayan Samaddars dream trip to Paris for an international club football tournament in 2008 had hit the visa crossbar. Two years later, the 13-year-old Behala boy has made up for that missed opportunity by hitting home for a 15-day training stint with German giant Bayern Munich.         
	Winger Sanchayan, who plays for the Mohun Bagan junior team, is among only six footballers from the country and the only Calcuttan to make it to the trainee squad chosen by Bayern veterans like Andreas Brehme, Paul Breitner and Paulo Sergio.        
	I will never get over the disappointment of not being able to accompany the Mohun Bagan junior team to Paris. I was denied a visa and had to return from Delhi while the rest of the squad proceeded to France. So this makes the Germany trip even more special, Sanchayan told Metro on Sunday.        
	Apart from Sanchayan, fellow Bengal player Simanta Murmu, of West Midnapore, and four players representing Lajong FC of Shillong  two of them are from Bhaichung Bhutia country  made the cut from among a list of 96 budding footballers.        
	News of Bayerns search for the top six under-14 club footballers had reached Sanchayans father Subhashish Samaddar, a trader, on Monday. A Mohun Bagan official called my father to say that I should report at the club tent the next morning. From there, we were taken to CCFC, said Sanchayan.        
	By the end of the day, Sanchayans skills had left the entire Bayern selection team impressed.         
	I was very nervous at first but forgot about it once we were divided into 16 teams. After two matches, they shortlisted 12 players and formed two teams for the final round. I gave my everything, said Sanchayan, who idolises Mohun Bagan spearhead Jose Ramirez Barreto.        
	If there was a tinge of disappointment, it was because two of his friends from the Bagan junior team  strikers Dipankar Boral and Sujit Soren  faltered at the final hurdle. I felt so bad for them, said Sanchayan.        
	Bagan junior team coach Amiya Ghosh lauded Sanchayan for his ball control and distribution, saying justice had been finally done to him.         
	For Sanchayan, the world has changed in a week. Some classmates are asking me to take them along, chuckled the Class VII student of National Public School, who likes history but hates math.

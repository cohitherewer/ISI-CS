                The high court on Tuesday sought the presence of a convict on death row during the hearing of his appeal against the sentence, possibly for the first time. Nikku Yadav, the 26-year-old convict, had murdered Ballygunge Circular Road resident Ravinder Kaur Luthra in February 2007. He was sentenced by a sessions judge in August 2008. The division bench of Chief Justice J.N. Patel and Justice Asim Roy on Tuesday directed police to produce Yadav in court on September 15 during the hearing of his appeal. Senior lawyers said the order was unprecedented.     Kalipada Maity, 16, was found dead near the Padmapukur rail gate in Howrah on Tuesday morning. Police said there were bullet marks on his neck and stomach. Two empty cartridges were found near the body. Three men have been detained.    An unidentified man in his 60s died after a break-down van hit him on BT Road near Paikpara on Tuesday.     The departure time of the following Howrah-bound trains from their respective points of origin has been changed: the Mumbai-Howrah Mail via Nagpur, scheduled to leave at 8.35pm, will leave at 4am the next day; the Mumbai Lokmanya Tilak Terminus-Howrah Jnaneswari Express (Monday, Tuesday, Friday and Saturday), scheduled to leave at 8.35pm, will depart at 4am the next day; the Mumbai Lokmanya Tilak Terminus-Howrah Samarsata Express (Wednesday and Thursday), instead of leaving at 8.35pm, will leave at 4am the next day and the Pune-Howrah Azad Hind Express, scheduled to leave at 6.25pm, will leave at 2.45am the next day. The revised timings will remain in force till September 20.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Frenetic Phreny
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Frenetic Phreny
                                          
	Autumn Flush  
	I call her Aunt Phreny but I have heard children four years old chatting to her and calling her Phreny like she was their own age. I often wish to be like her as I get (even) older but I suspect such talent for mingling seamlessly with all generations strikes at birth.  
	She comes from illustrious stock: her father, a well-known trade unionist and freedom fighter, was jailed for participation in the Meerut conspiracy case. Only five at the time she remembers the day Daddy was taken away vividly. Some years ago she traced one of her dads old comrades and went to visit him in his last days.         
	The old man was delighted to meet his hero Jhabvalas daughter. Her brother is a renowned architect, her sister-in-law a famous novelist who has received a couple of Oscars for script-writing.        
	Phreny was herself a national table tennis player in her youth. At 85 she keeps house immaculately for herself and her daughter, makes dhansaak to die for, and is never bored or boring. Between chores she completes all the crosswords and puzzles in the papers. She plays a mean game of Scrabble and never fails to take part in the citys annual Scrabble competition and sports T-shirts to prove this.         
	She read to a visually-handicapped boy through various examinations. He is now a teacher in the Blind Boys School in Narendrapur. This was long before computer technology and audio equipment came into being to aid the visually handicapped.         
	She recalls enthusiastically how Bishu fell in love and later married the gentle girl who would sometimes come over with him to listen in to Phrenys dramatic rendering of texts from Beowulf to Virginia Woolf.         
	For many years she coached a mentally-challenged girl: not with school lessons but lessons for life. The girl can now do her own bank work, fill out pay-in-slips, correctly write and sign cheques, shop for whatever she needs and can speak, read and write English fluently. There are children of drivers, chowkidars and liftmen in her building who have spent hours with her looking at books or watching TV. They also speak fluent English.         
	All this makes her sound virtuous. She is in fact feisty and fun: full of gossip, up-to-date with news and views, ran fast at the age of 75 (thats why the neighbourhood kids used to call her frenetic Phreny). Ten years on she still walks with enviable briskness.        
	She closely supervised the setting up of a nature study park and was distressed in the early days when a portion of it had a perennial pall of oily grime on the tops of trees and bushes, caused by fumes from the generator of a fashionable flat in the immediate vicinity. She went to the flatowner and threatened him with the wrath of Maneka Gandhi who was scheduled to visit Calcutta (but not the park) soon. She recalls with a chuckle how they mended their ways while she didnt actually tell a lie.         
	She breezes in to visit older people in the area and talks at great speed about everything and nothing. She is totally irreverent: Come on ole B! Rise and Shine. You have to live to be 120. And when the old lady protests she says: Awright awright Ill give you five years off for good behaviour.         
	She tests her memory: So ole B tell me what you ate for breakfast today. And if the old person in question answers correctly she guffaws loudly and says: Thank god you didnt ask me that because I have forgotten what I ate myself! And when I ask how do you do? Please dont tell me in too much detail. Best thing say Just like a laddoo one pice two. She leaves them laughing and feeling good about themselves.         
	Quite a role model. What do you think?

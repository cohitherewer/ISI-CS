                Rohit Kumar Shaw, 8, died during Holi revelry at a Calcutta Port Trust quarters on Hyde Road on Sunday afternoon. Police said Rohit was watching a matka phor contest when the mishap occurred. Some youths had formed a human pyramid to reach up to a pot of milk, which was tied to a pillar on one side and an electricity pole on the other. The pillar, which was dilapidated, came crashing down and hit Rohit and some others, said an officer. Rohit was taken to SSKM Hospital, where he was declared dead. The police said the quarters were unsafe and the residents were living there illegally.    The high court on Monday rejected an appeal by Eastern Railway against an Alipore court order asking the civic body not to construct buildings on an Ultadanga plot where a slum was ravaged in a fire on January 12. The civic body plans to build houses for the slum residents on the plot. The railway authorities had challenged the move in the Alipore court, claiming the plot was theirs.    Bindheswar Rao, 60, of Posta, and Kundan Sharma, 15, of Baishnab Seth Street, drowned while bathing in the Hooghly on Monday.

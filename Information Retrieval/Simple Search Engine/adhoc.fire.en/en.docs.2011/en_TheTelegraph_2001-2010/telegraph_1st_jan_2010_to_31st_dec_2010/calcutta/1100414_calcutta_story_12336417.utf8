The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sitting ducks for mob
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sitting ducks for mob
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The vandalism at Peerless Hospital and the nearby Apex nursing home on Tuesday exposed how vulnerable hospitals, doctors and patients are to a security breach.        
	Slipshod security arrangements in most hospitals and the lack of any initiative from the government to implement the new anti-vandalism act are blamed for the frequency of attacks by mobs and patient parties on both government and private hospitals and nursing homes in the city.         
	Peerless Hospital, one of the largest in the city, has not installed a closed-circuit television camera on its premises yet. Security experts say CCTVs would have helped in identifying those who led Tuesdays attack.        
	The government, on the other hand, enacts laws that it doesnt bother implementing. The recently introduced West Bengal Medicare Service Institution and Medicare Service Personnel (Prevention of violence and damage to property) Act, 2009, provides for non-bailable charges to be drawn up against those responsible for vandalism with imprisonment up to three years and fine of Rs 50,000 along with compensation for damage.         
	The government should implement this act and arrest the culprits (of the attack on Peerless and Apex) immediately, said Sanjay Banerjee, the secretary of the Bengal branch of the Indian Medical Association.         
	We all feel this was not an attack only on Peerless Hospital, but on all hospitals, said P. Tandon, the president of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India.         
	The association has convened a meeting on Wednesday to devise a strategy to prevent more such incidents.        
	Officials of the association accused the police of not taking complaints seriously. Last Sunday, a post-graduate trainee at Medical College and Hospital was beaten up by a mob and a complaint was lodged at Bowbazar police station. However, nobody has been arrested yet, said assistant secretary Subarno Goswami.        
	Psychologist Nilanjana Sanyal said helplessness was the trigger for many incidents of attacks on hospitals and doctors.         
	When people reach a state of total helplessness and cannot adopt any other means, they resort to aggressive behaviour, she said.        
	Sanyal said a sense of deprivation  like medical treatment that one cannot afford  could also be responsible for mob attacks like the one on Peerless.

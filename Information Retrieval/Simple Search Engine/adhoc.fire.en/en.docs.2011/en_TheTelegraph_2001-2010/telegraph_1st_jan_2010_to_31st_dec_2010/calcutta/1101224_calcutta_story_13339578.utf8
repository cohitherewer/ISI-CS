The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Breach disrupts water supply 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Breach disrupts water supply 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The tap ran dry in over a lakh households between South Sinthee and the Sealdah-Bowbazar area around Thursday noon, after one of the five underground supply lines from the Palta waterworks to the Tallah tank sprung a leak.        
	Engineers are trying their best to restore normality by Friday, said mayor Sovan Chatterjee. At least 20 lakh people were affected by the disruption.        
	The five pipes  each 6ft in diameter  that run 22km under BT Road are the only source of water for the city proper, stretching from South Sinthee to Bhowanipore and Park Circus to the east.        
	The one that sprung a leak  after a welded patch around 15ft long peeled off  is over 25 years old and needs to be changed immediately but the civic authorities pleaded helplessness in replacing it in the absence of an alternative supply line.        
	The entire pipe has to be replaced but we can do so only after work on laying a parallel pipe is completed. We hope the parallel line, which has been laid only for 4km, will be ready by 2012, said a civic engineer.        
	Till then, sources said, vast stretches in the city proper would often suffer disruption in supply.        
	Large areas of south Calcutta have been frequently facing water crisis following snags in the pumps at Garden Reach waterworks. Many households went without water during Durga Puja and Diwali.        
	A civic engineer, however, was livid at the hint of bracketing the crises in the north and south.        
	We do not run Garden Reach waterworks. Its under the control of the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority, a state government undertaking. A breach in a water pipe is rarer than a snag at Garden Reach.        
	The civic body came to know about the leak in the Palta-Tallah pipe around 7pm on Wednesday, when water gushing from underground started flooding parts of BT Road in Khardah.        
	The CMC soon shut down the pump that feeds water to the affected pipe in Palta, resulting in a net shortage of 25 million gallons of filtered water.         
	The crisis set in around Thursday noon after the reserve at Tallah got exhausted.        
	Tallah gets 173 million gallons of water from Palta daily.

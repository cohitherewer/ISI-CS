The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tourists miss flight to safety
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tourists miss flight to safety
          OUR BUREAU                           Stranded tourists in Uttarakhand trudge down a landslide-hit hill road near Dehradun. (PTI)                                  
	Aparna Ghosh, 34, and Mihir Mukherjee, 65, spent the whole of Friday scanning the skies above Sangla for two helicopters that took off without them and never came back.        
	A district official came to our hotel in the morning and asked us to pack, saying that arrangements had been made for our evacuation. We left for the helipad around 2km away at 7.30am, only to find over 100 people already waiting there, said Mukherjee, stranded along with 31 others at Debi Resort in Sangla valley of Himachal Pradesh for the sixth day.         
	Aparna, just as disappointed at missing the days sole escape to safety, said nobody knew till the end of the day whether the helicopters would come back for them. I felt terrible walking back to a government lodge late in the afternoon not knowing what tomorrow holds, she told Metro over phone.        
	Kalyani-based Mukherjee said foreign tourists were given priority for the first two flights even as lists of evacuees were drawn up for subsequent sorties. Both helicopters apparently took off simultaneously, one headed for Rekong Peo and the other towards Shimla.        
	We were told that the chopper that went to Shimla would head to Chandigarh for re-fuelling and then come back for us. We waited but no chopper came. At 3.30pm, the officials told us that weather permitting we would be rescued tomorrow, said Mukherjee.        
	If there was chaos in Sangla, there was confusion back home with tourism minister Manab Mukherjee  supposed to co-ordinate with the two state ministers on a rescue mission to the hills  saying he didnt know of any evacuation from Himachal by helicopter.        
	I dont know who promised it (the airlift). We havent. If anyone has, then it should definitely be carried out. As far as I know, most of the people who were there were shifted to Shimla yesterday itself, said the minister, apparently unaware that over 80 tourists from Bengal are still stranded in hotels across Sangla.         
	Sports minister Kanti Ganguly, who along with civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee reached Dehradun on Thursday evening, said there was still no sign of the three trekkers who went missing near Vasuki Tal on the Gangotri-Badrinath route earlier this week.        
	We were told on Thursday night that our friends had been traced but when we went to the district magistrates office this morning, officials said they had no information, said fellow trekker Sudipto Mitra from Uttarkashi.         
	But Piyoosh Rautela, who heads the disaster management committee in Uttarakhand, held out hope for the families of N.P. Rao, Anal Das and Arun Adak.        
	He said two residents of a village located around 9km from Kalindi Pass reached Uttarkashi late on Thursday and informed the district administration that they had spotted the trekkers. We have since been able to tentatively locate the area where they may have been trapped on the basis of eyewitness accounts, Rautela added.        
	Four Indian Air Force helicopters have been requisitioned to rescue trapped tourists. Tour conductors have also hired private helicopters to rescue some of their clients.        
	According to a status report compiled by the Bengal government, at least nine people from the state  the three trekkers from Howrah and a team of six from Chinsurah, Hooghly  are missing in Uttarakhand.        
	The two ministers deputed to Uttarakhand will accompany a team of experts, including Everest climbers Basant Singh Roy and Debasish Biswas, on a private helicopter on Saturday to search for the missing tourists.        
	Our primary aim is to trace those who are missing. Those who are stranded have shelter and a good chance of being evacuated in the next 24 hours, said minister Ganguly.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Top cop slams rail on safety
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A top police officer of the state has alleged that the railway has ignored his departments proposal on enhancing security that could have led to the resumption of the running of passengers trains at night in the Kharagpur-Adra and Kharagpur-Rourkela sections.        
	The service was suspended after the Jnaneswari Express sabotage on May 28.        
	I had sent them a detailed plan for security upgrade that could have been put in place within seven-10 days. But they have not shown any interest in the proposal, said Dilip Mitra, additional director-general of police, railways.        
	Had the measures been adopted, the running of passenger trains at night in the Kharagpur-Rourkela and Kharagpur-Adra sections of South Eastern Railway could have resumed by now, he added.        
	The officer, however, did not go into the detail of the security proposal.        
	Mitra also alleged that the railway board was not serious about increasing the strength of the Government Railway Police (GRP), which is responsible for maintaining law and order on railway premises.        
	The GRP is under the state government but half the funds spent by it comes from the railway board.        
	We are short of manpower. But the railway board is not serious about our repeated proposals to increase the staff strength, said Mitra.         
	Railway officials were not available for comment.

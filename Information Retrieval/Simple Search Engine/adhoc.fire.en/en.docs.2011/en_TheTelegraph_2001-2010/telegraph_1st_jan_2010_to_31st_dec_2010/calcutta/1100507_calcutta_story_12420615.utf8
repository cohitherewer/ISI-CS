The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Code of surrender   to graffiti gangs 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Code of surrender   to graffiti gangs

	The writing is on the wall: if Elections 2009 were about standing up to the paintbrush brigade, Civic Poll 2010 is set to be a surrender to graffiti raj.        
	Paikpara resident D. Ghosh, 58, was one of the many who had filed complaints last year against parties under the Election Commissions model code of conduct for writing graffiti on their walls without seeking their written consent.        
	The front wall of his residence was defaced again last week but he doesnt intend filing a complaint. The Election Commission had promised us both protection and redress last year but we received neither. Why should I risk filing a complaint again? asked bank official Ghosh, who had faced taunts and intimidation after the polls ended.        
	With parties treating the May 30 civic vote as a dress rehearsal for the Assembly elections next year, there is more graffiti on walls across town than one would expect for a local poll. But hardly any complaint has been filed so far with the police stations or the civil administration. Its a futile exercise without any kind of enforcement, said Kankurgachhi resident Sujit Dutta.        
	The State Election Commission and the police have promised action on specific complaints. We will certainly initiate action according to the law of the land, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	According to the model code, consent needs to be taken in writing from a house owner or landlord before splashing a wall with poll graffiti. Nobody can be forced or intimidated into giving consent.        
	If someone lodges a complaint, his or her identity is to be kept a secret and the police are required to initiate legal action under Section 202 of the CMC Act of 1980. The perpetrator is liable for imprisonment up to six months and/or a fine of up to Rs 50,000.        
	Over 1,000 such complaints were lodged in the city last year, though there are few records of action being taken against the offenders. If action was initiated, we would like to know how and where. You need specific examples for citizens to believe that lodging a complaint is worth the trouble, said techie Rabin Das, who lives in Jadavpur.

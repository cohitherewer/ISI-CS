The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | King Lear for Calcutta
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      King Lear for Calcutta
										      caleidoscope                        A still from Akira Kurosawas film Ran, the inspiration behind Suman Mukhopadhyays play Lear				                           
	After the dismal production, Achin Gnayer Gatha, by an ad hoc team of youngsters, the Minerva Natya Sanskriti Charcha Kendra is out to build its own repertory with a core team. The team of 14 from Calcutta, North Bengal and Purulia was welcomed by the executive committee of the Kendra at its Beadon Street address on August 2.         
	They will devote their time exclusively to Minervas productions for three years and draw monthly salaries, says Debashish Majumdar, the director of the repertory.         
	Manoj Mitra, who presided over the programme, and Usha Ganguly are in charge of all productions. Mitra said that with the financial security, technical infrastructure and guidance of senior actors the onus is on these actors to make the repertory company successful.         
	The first production, slotted for October-end or early November, will be Shakespeares King Lear in Bengali directed by Suman Mukhopadhyay. There have been productions of Lear in Calcutta like those by Padatik (Hindi) and Theatron (Bengali), but Mukhopadhyay has been inspired more by the likes of Peter Brooks 1971 film and Akira Kurosawas 1985 film Ran. The Minerva version will feature Soumitra Chatterjee, Debshankar Haldar, Gautam Haldar, Dwijen Bandyopadhyay and members of the new team. It will not be a Raja Lear  but everyone can identify with the plays inherent truth. So we will keep the time and locale open, says Mukhopadhyay.         
	The namesake                  Suchitra Sen            Suchitra Mitra      
	Rumours about actress Suchitra Sen taking a turn for the worse started doing the rounds late on Thursday evening and reporters scurried to confirm the news. Doctors and family members confirmed that she was doing well and was at her home even as reporters made a beeline for her house on Ballygunge Circular Road.         
	But the rumour refused to die. In fact it gathered momentum once again with information that Sen might be admitted to a private hospital. Reporters camped outside her house for the night and refused to budge.         
	A little after midnight a blue Calcutta police van stopped outside the gate. The policeman wanted to know what the fuss was about and then enlightened his audience.         
	Apnara bhul korchhen, ini tight achhen, uni dheele hoye gechhen, was his cryptic  and crude  clue.         
	Decoded: This Suchitra is fine. That Suchitra is not.        
	The latter, the redoubtable Rabindrasangeet singer, who also lives on Ballygunge Circular Road, had taken ill.         
	Rabindrasangeet never compared in popularity with screen beauty, so Suchitra Mitra was spared the attention.         
	Heres wishing ini and uni good health.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Passion trail to land of Gandhi
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Passion trail to land of Gandhi
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                          Nick Levinge takes a break on a city road. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	The first thing Nick Levinge, 55, did on touching down in Delhi was book a flight to Ahmedabad. The Englishman was in India for a cross-country biking trip in a land where his granduncle served as an army officer and then a sales superviser. Levinges hero is Gandhi. So it made sense that I start my journey from Gandhis state and buy the bike there, he says, parking his Enfield Thunderbird in front of a garage in Calcutta from where he plans to steer north-east.        
	Levinge reached the city after five months of exploring India on his new two-wheeler. Gandhinagar was disappointing. There was hardly anything to see which is understandable since Gandhi eschewed possessions. But what irked me was how the place has been turned into a shrine, which might not have gone down well with him. I could visualise him as a child in his Porbandar home, though, says the man who read Indian political history between the world wars in university, his dissertation being on Gandhi.        
	He has been preparing long for this India trip. At 19, he worked to save enough for a 49cc moped. It was an interesting time. Eastern Europe was Communist. In 1974, I spent a month touring Poland. The next year, I went to Turkey and all the countries in between  all on that moped.         
	Since then, India has been on his mind even as he settled down to a career in law. I handle legal aid in crime and family cases in Northamptonshire.        
	After 29 years in law, he reached a fatigue point. As a lawyer friend said, every case is the same. The only thing that changes is the level of bitterness. Another thing that made him rev up again was the fact that his father died at 57. And I was already 53.        
	So, he left for Jordan on a bicycle. It (the vehicle) was not a wise choice. Jordan was hilly, windy and had vicious dogs. I was attacked by a pack of ten as big as German Shepherds. I had to carry small stones. Things got better when I reached Syria which is a lot flatter.        
	Otherwise, he had a feast of castles  36 of them. The architecture is of four distinct types  Arabic, Byzantine, Crusader and also by a sect called the Assassins.        
	This affinity for castles is why Rajasthan delighted him. The curator of Aina Mahal in Bhuj made out a list of castles for me. While in Jaisalmer, he even took part in a film, which he cant name. I spent a whole day shooting in a forest but the film was shelved, he shrugs.         
	In India, Levinge has been knocked down by colours. In contrast to the Middle East, where women wear black, here women wear their colourful best especially at the monuments. The forts he liked best are Daulatabad in the west and Bidar and Golconda in the south.        
	He reached Calcutta following the coastline up from Kanyakumari. My granduncle said he used to change shirts five times a day. I can see why, he says, mopping his forehead. He talked a lot of maharajahs. We were brought up on his stories of shooting tigers with them, he smiles.        
	Levinge wants to end his journey at Ladakh. Lot of bikers write of the Manali-Leh highway. It has the second highest motorable road in the world, the highest being in Ladakh. But there is one dream that he is unsure will be fulfilled. My granduncle used to say Kashmir is the most beautiful land hed ever seen. My guide book does not even name the state. Is it so dangerous?

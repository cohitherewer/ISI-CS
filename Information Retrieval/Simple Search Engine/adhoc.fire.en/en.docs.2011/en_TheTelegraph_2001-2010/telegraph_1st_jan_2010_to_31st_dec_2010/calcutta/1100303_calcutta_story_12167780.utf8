The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Paper error in exam
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Paper error in exam
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	English-medium students writing the Madhyamik geography paper on Tuesday sweated over a wrongly framed question that asked them to explain something that doesnt exist: summer and winter equinoxes.        
	Invigilators were unable to confirm the obvious error in question No. 3 (a) of the paper in the absence of a communiqu from the authorities, leaving the examinees to decide for themselves whether they should write on summer and winter solstices instead.         
	Many students said they wrote a short note on summer and winter equinoxes, as mentioned in the paper, despite knowing that equinoxes occur only in spring and autumn. Many students wasted precious time deciding what to write. The board should be more careful in printing Madhyamik question papers. This is the school-leaving examination, after all, said a teacher.        
	The Bengali version of the paper was correct, confirmed teachers.        
	Question No. 9 (c) also created confusion among the examinees by asking: What is Doon? Did they mean dune? With no clarification coming from the board, examinees answered one of the optional questions, carrying two marks.        
	Mamata Ray, the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, promised an inquiry. We will find out how the mistakes occurred. We suspect these are printing errors, she said.        
	Ray said examinees who attempted question No. 3 (a) would be awarded marks, irrespective of whether they had written on equinox (equal day and night) or solstice (longest day or night).        
	A question in the English second language paper last Thursday had also drawn complaints from a section of students. Examinees who were taught process writing in passive voice in school were stumped when asked to write a simple 100-word paragraph on gardening, using pointers.        
	Some Madhyamik examinees said they couldnt decide how to write a simple para with pointers meant for process writing.

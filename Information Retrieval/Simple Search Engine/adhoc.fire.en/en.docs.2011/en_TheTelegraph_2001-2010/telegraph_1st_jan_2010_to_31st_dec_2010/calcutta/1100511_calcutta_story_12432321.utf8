  - Kiosks empty through day           TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          A bed and a mosquito net inside a cop kiosk in DD block in Salt Lake. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	A robbery and an abduction in quick succession in Salt Lake this month have failed to boost policing in the area.        
	A tour of the 33.5sq km township revealed the cops are seldom found in kiosks set up for them. Most of the 20-plus kiosks serve as shelter for vagabonds, resting room for policemen and even as liquor dens.         
	The remnants of a drinking session  an empty liquor bottle and plastic glasses  were strewn on the floor of a kiosk near IA block, beside Salt Lake stadium.        
	Another kiosk, opposite Mayukh Bhavan, housed a prepared bed, including a mosquito net. Officers on night duty play cards in the kiosk and later sleep inside it, said a rickshawpuller in the area.        
	Residents had earlier lodged a complaint with Bidhannagar North police station against men who were selling country liquor from a police kiosk at Duttabad.        
	We do not have enough cops to deploy in each and every kiosk in the township. However, we post men at the kiosks as and when required, said Debabrata Das, additional superintendent of police, Bidhannagar.        
	Cops were transferred from Bidhannagar East police station to the recently formed Sector V police station further adding to the crunch in the residential part of the township.        
	Officials of Bidhannagar Municipality said they had asked the police several times to either deploy men at the kiosks or dismantle them.        
	The North 24-Parganas district police had asked for a no-objection certificate for construction of kiosks in the township. We had allowed them to but later found some kiosks were set up without informing us. The kiosks have billboards on top but the municipality does not earn any revenue from them, said Biswajiban Majumder, the chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality.        
	The civic body has asked the cops to remove the kiosks that block footpaths, added Majumder.         
	If the kiosks are illegal, the municipality can demolish them. The police do not earn revenue from billboards on top of the kiosks. I will ask officers to check whether the kiosks are being used for illegal activities, added Das.        
	Residents alleged that cops could rarely be found patrolling the township.        
	Policemen only turn up after a crime is committed. They provide security in the area for few days before things became as bad as before the incident. The elderly in the township are the most vulnerable. The police fail to provide them the basic security, said Kumar Shankar Sadhu, the secretary of Salt Lake Residents Welfare Association.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Probe into rail arson, cloud over arrests
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Probe into rail arson, cloud over arrests
          OUR BUREAU                                              A damaged counter at Howrah station on Wednesday
    
	Mamata Banerjee has set up a five-member committee to probe Wednesdays mob violence at Howrah station, insisting that armed outsiders rather than angry passengers were responsible for the rampage over a local trains delayed arrival.        
	 The (Bandel-Howrah) train was 15 minutes late (30 minutes by the clock). Spontaneous demonstrations can happen. But where did they get sticks and stones from? demanded the railway minister during a public meeting in Dum Dum on Thursday.         
	Mamata has asked the committee to submit its report on the incident, which she termed political sabotage by the CPM, in three days.        
	Eastern Railway officials said they were looking into factors other than the train delay to find the trigger for the mob fury.         
	Our preliminary investigation suggests that a group of ticket examiners at the exit gates of platforms number 2 and 3 were involved in a spat with some passengers who were already angry over the delayed arrival of the Bandel local, said a senior official.         
	As soon as the train pulled into platform number 1, people took turns in punching the train driver and the guard before targeting railway property.         
	Divisional railway manager Parthasarathi Mandal called it a pre-planned attack by outsiders. He said three other trains  all from Katwa  had arrived at Howrah 35 to 65 minutes behind schedule on Wednesday morning but there was no such reaction from passengers.         
	The nine people arrested for vandalism have been remanded in judicial custody for 14 days. The charges against them are of rioting, causing grievous injury, damage to property, preventing government officials from discharging their duty and theft.         
	If found guilty, they could be jailed for up to 10 years.         
	Most of those arrested said they had nothing to do with the arson as they were neither travelling by the Bandel local nor waiting to board it. Kausik Pal, 28, a resident of Hind Motors in Hooghly, was allegedly arrested when he was walking out of the station.         
	 We were headed for the exit together when trouble started. We were separated in the melee. I later heard that Kausik had been arrested, said elder brother Dipankar.        
	Souvik Roy, of Rampurhaat in Birbhum, had arrived by the Visvabharati Passenger and was to take a bus to Shibpur to sit for an exam when the cops picked him up.

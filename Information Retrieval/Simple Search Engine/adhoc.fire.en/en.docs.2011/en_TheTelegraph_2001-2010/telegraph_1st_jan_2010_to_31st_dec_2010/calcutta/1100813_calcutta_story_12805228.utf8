          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Trinamul Congress supporters threw stones at cars and broke windshields of buses on BT Road on Thursday afternoon to protest the arrest of a leader accused of almost blinding the officer-in-charge of Khardah police station.        
	Prasanta Gayen, who had served in Maoist-hit Belpahari, may have sustained permanent damage to his eyes in an attack by a mob allegedly led by Manish Shukla on Tuesday night when the cop went to Tata Gate to investigate the murder of a Trinamul activist.        
	Shukla, in his late-20s, and three other party men were arrested outside Rashtraguru Surendranath College in Barrackpore on Thursday in connection with the attack.         
	Soon after, hundreds of Trinamul activists gheraoed Titagarh police station demanding Shuklas release.        
	Alleging police torture, Trinamul activists later blocked BT Road near Barrackpore Chiria More, crippling traffic, and damaged at least half a dozen vehicles.        
	North 24-Parganas Trinamul youth wing secretary Silabhadra Dutta denied the party supporters role in the roadblock and violence.

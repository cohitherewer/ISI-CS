The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puja brush with rain
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Puja brush with rain
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Puja is unlikely to be a washout but a low-pressure area expected to form over the Bay of Bengal could cause a few spells of rain or more, predicted the weatherman on Monday.         
	The coastal belt of Bengal may receive heavy rain during Puja under the influence of the low-pressure formation.        
	The low-pressure area is likely to form on Tuesday and cause substantial rainfall in the coastal regions over the next few days. Even an indirect impact of the formation would bring rain to parts of south Bengal, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	We dont foresee heavy rain in the city and its outskirts today. The picture will be clearer in a day or two. During Puja, the city could get spells of rain, but a washout looks unlikely, added Debnath.        
	The city has received heavy rainfall over the past week under the influence of a low-pressure area that intensified into a depression. The constant cloud cover and the heavy rain kept the mercury in check and the weather comfortable.        
	There was no rain on Monday and the temperature stayed near normal.        
	The monsoon, which usually departs from the city around October 7, has overstayed this year.        
	There is no way to say, before this week ends, when the monsoon will depart this year from south Bengal. Last year, it overstayed by 13 days. It could stay longer this year, given the active final lap, said an official of the India Meteorological Department.

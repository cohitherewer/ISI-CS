The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trio touched by triumph   on home turf
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Trio touched by triumph   on home turf
										                                  (From top): Jui Biswas, Anita Basu and Rafat Javed                                 
	The city has elected 68 women councillors. Metro visits three of them to find out if and how life has changed the day after        
	First Stop: Jui Biswass house in New Alipore.        
	The 28-year-old spent her first morning as Trinamul councillor of ward 81, stretching from Tollygunge Phari to Taratala, meeting party workers and attending a puja.        
	We talked about the election results and discussed strategies to expand our base, the post-graduate diploma holder in business administration later said, sitting in the office room of the house. On one wall of the room hung a painting of goddess Kali done by Mamata Banerjee, a portrait of the Trinamul chief adorned another.        
	Solving the drinking water problem of her area tops Juis priority list. There wont be much of a hurdle now that our party is at the helm, said the sister-in-law of Trinamul strongman Arup Biswas.        
	Jui plans to meet people of her ward every morning from 7am to 10am. I also want to visit the paras for a first-hand feel of the problems. Then I will meet civic officials and try and work out solutions.        
	How does she plan to balance her political and professional lives? I am on a six-month leave from work. If need be, Ill be a whole-timer in politics, Jui signed off.              
	Second stop: Anita Basus home off Lansdowne Market.        
	The Trinamul councillor of ward 69, which covers the Lansdowne-Puddapukur areas, was back from a visit to Mamata Banerjees house. I went to pay my respect to her mother, said Anita, whose late husband Gautam was an additional private secretary to the Trinamul chief.        
	Anita is yet to draw up a plan of action for her ward. I want to reach out to the people. There is only one ward office. I plan to set up smaller offices in neighbourhoods and spend at least a day every week in each.        
	Third stop: Rafat Javeds house on McLeod Street, off Park Street.        
	The Trinamul councillor of ward 66 in Topsia was busy replying to congratulatory messages. In the afternoon, she met party workers in the ward office.        
	In tending to her ward, Rafat plans to draw on her experience as homemaker. I want to keep my ward clean and sanitised, just as I want my house to be. Drinking water is another thrust area, said Rafat, whose husband Javed was a mayoral hopeful but lost the poll by a whisker.         
	One big bother as councillor? Ill have to always carry my cellphone. I am not used to getting so many calls, she laughs.       POULOMI BANERJEE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Spotlight on street music
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Spotlight on street music
          MOHUA DAS                          Youngsters jam at Rabindra Sarobar on Sunday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Time: Sunday, 6.30pm        
	Place: Under a tree on the Rabindra Sarobar grounds        
	Scene: Three bulbs hang from the branches, lighting up a makeshift stage with two microphones and a few speakers. About 20 young men and women amble around, guitars, keyboards, bongos and music sheets in hand.        
	A lanky youth walks up to one of the mikes and screams, Hi, Im Kabya and we are here to make music for the sake of music. So lets begin with Hip, Hip, Hooray! The small audience starts to clap and cheer boisterously. An hour later, their number has swollen with passers-by stopping on their tracks to listen to the music soaring over the noise of traffic.        
	Street concerts, commonplace in New Yorks Central Park or Londons Covent Gardens, might become familiar in Calcutta too if the efforts of 25-year-old content writer Kabya Ghosh, 20-year-old college student Deepak Ganguly and 23-year-old animator Saikat Sengupta bear fruit.         
	They call themselves Gypsy and true to their name plan to move around the city organising street gigs for artistes and bands without a platform to perform.         
	We have rock, jazz and metal festivals in Calcutta but not a street music festival where all kinds of musicians can perform. Weve heard that the concept is popular in western countries and wanted to start something similar here, says Kabya while distributing newspapers for audience members to lay on the ground and sit on.        
	Kabya, who sings for a band called Not Yet Decided, and his musical buddies are far away from the spotlight of the big music business and are fine with that. If you have talent and passion, you can just come here and do your thing. People are free to like or dislike what they hear. Were not doing it to become rich and famous. We want to create a space where the line between the artistes and the audience is blurred. There is no bar on language, genre or people, he says.        
	The group takes permission from police and provides guitars and keyboards to those who come unequipped so that the music does not stop. We dont allow drums because it would drown the vocals and other acoustic sounds, explains Kabya.        
	The three-hour Rabindra Sarobar programme, the second organised by Gypsy after a gig in April, featured three Class XI boys among several amateur bands. We read about the event on Facebook. Our band Infinity is only four months old and we dont have a place to perform. This is great way for us to get heard, says Mayukh, one of the boys.        
	The plan is to hold a street acoustic gig every month in places like Sudder Street, Elgin Road or even inside a Metro Railway station, says Kabya. Once the venue and time is finalised the information will be spread through social networking sites and posters on campus walls and in music shops.

	The fate of Shah Rukh Khans hospitality box at the Eden Gardens would be decided by PWD engineers and firemen on March 30, two days before the next home match of the Kolkata Knight Riders.        
	The 400-seater IPL Club Lounge, where each ticket costs Rs 32,000, would need a fitness certificate from the PWD and a no-objection certificate from the fire services, said chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti on Thursday after a meeting at Writers Buildings to discuss the issue.        
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya and senior officials of various government wings, the IPL and the KKR attended the meeting.        
	To ensure that there is no problem in bagging the mandatory clearances, PWD officials and firemen would oversee the modifications to the IPL Club Lounge before the inspections.        
	We are trying to ensure that the rest of the Eden Gardens matches are played after taking into consideration the legal and safety aspects. The government departments concerned have submitted specific proposals. The flaws in the structure would have to be corrected before the match on April 1, added the chief secretary.        
	With a portion of Eden being out of bounds for spectators because of renovation, police deployment for IPL3 is less than in 2008 but Lalbazar would not accept fees lower than the first seasons, said joint police commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim after the meeting.        
	Last year, the KKR authorities had paid around Rs 75 lakh to the police.

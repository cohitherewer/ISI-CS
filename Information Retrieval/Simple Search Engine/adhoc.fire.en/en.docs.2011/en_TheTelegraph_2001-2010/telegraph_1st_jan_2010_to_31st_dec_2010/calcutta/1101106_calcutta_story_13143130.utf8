The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cashew booty in festive con
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cashew booty in festive con
  - Man, woman and child team up to cheat trader          MONALISA CHAUDHURI                                                  
	A con man duped a city dry-fruits trader into delivering him 15 kilograms of cashew, worth over Rs 7,000, on the eve of Dhanteras.         
	Khalid Anwar, the trader, lodged a case of cheating with Girish Park police station. Cops have not been able to catch the con man, who had pretended to be a wealthy businessman, or the woman and the boy who had helped him.         
	On Tuesday afternoon, the con man walked into Anwars Jorasanko shop and asked for the best raisins and cashews in stock.        
	The man was very well-dressed and appeared to be important. After inspecting dry fruits for over an hour, he selected an expensive variety of cashew. Before leaving, he promised to place an order over the phone the next day, Anwar told officers of Girish Park police station.        
	The man kept his promise. He called up Anwar the next day and asked him to deliver 15 kilograms of the cashew he had selected to 101 Vivekananda Road and collect the payment in cash. Anwar engaged one of his employees, Akbar, to deliver the cashew at the address.        
	On reaching the Vivekananda Road building, Akbar found a woman in her late-40s and a boy waiting on the road for him. Both appeared to be domestic help. The woman asked Akbar to follow the boy to a godown nearby, keep the consignment there and then collect the payment from her.        
	The boy led Akbar to a godown in the adjoining lane. Minutes later, when Akbar returned to collect the payment, the woman was nowhere to be seen. Panicking, he rushed back to the godown only to find the boy and the cashew had vanished too.        
	Hampers of dry fruits are in demand during the festive season, so the con man should have no trouble finding buyers for the tasty booty.        
	Our business is largely based on trust. This incident has left us jittery and suspicious of our clients, said a trader whose dry-fruits shop is close to Anwars.         
	The cops suspect that the quantum of loss was bigger than the amount mentioned in the complaint. Traders seldom reveal their exact volume of trade as their account books are not in order. We have learnt from sources that cashew worth around Rs 22,000 was stolen, said a senior police officer.        
	The modus operandi of the accused trio, suspected to be a part of a larger gang, has left the cops puzzled.        
	We usually do not come across criminals who think and plan so much to steal a few kilograms of cashew. This is a unique case, added the officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Name it now, build it later
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Name it now, build it later
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta witnessed a name game on either side of the political divide on Wednesday  Mamata Banerjee christening six stations of the Joka-BBD Bag Metro even before the first brick is laid and the cabinet renaming Rajarhat as Jyoti Basu Nagar long before it becomes a liveable township.        
	Its a dream project, a cream project, said rhyme-happy Mamata at the foundation ceremony of the Joka-BBD Bag Metro, reeling off a list of illustrious names but steering clear of the specifics.        
	President Pratibha Patil, who had arrived at the Joka venue 10 minutes before schedule so that the programme could start early, apparently inspired Mamata to declare that the project would be completed before the deadline. But the timeline  if there is one yet  remained a mystery.         
	The railway minister, with a penchant for the name game, said her choice for six of the 13 stations was vetted by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, on the dais with the President and governor M.K. Narayanan.         
	I have already discussed this with Pranabda. We will name the stations after Mohini Chowdhury (poet), Goshtha Pal (footballer), Mohammed Rafi (singer), Kishore Kumar (singer-actor), Muhammad Iqbal (poet) and Guru Gobind Singh, said Mamata to applause.        
	But all that applause cannot drown out the confusion caused by naming stations after personalities rather than places. Case in point: isnt Bansdroni as a Metro station simpler than Masterda Surya Sen?        
	So what stopped her from choosing seven more names to complete the list? We will decide on the other names soon. Bharat Sevashram Sangha has sent us a request (to include a name). We will consider that as well, Mamata said.        
	At Writers, state finance minister Asim Dasgupta announced that the cabinet had cleared Hidcos proposal to rename Rajarhat-New Town after Jyoti Basu.         
	A programme has been planned in the township on October 7 to kick off work on a playground named after the late chief minister.        
	Mamata said starting the Joka-BBD Bag foundation ceremony before schedule, thanks to President Patil, was a good way of launching the project. I request officials to follow our Presidents example and finish work before the deadline, she exhorted.         
	Officials said before time could mean within five years, though nobody seemed to know when work on the 16.72-km route would start.         
	President Patil thanked Mamata for praising her but said she would be happier if the project could beat the deadline. I appreciate what Mamataji just said. The project, accordingly, should be completed before time, she said.        
	Should stations be named after people or places?

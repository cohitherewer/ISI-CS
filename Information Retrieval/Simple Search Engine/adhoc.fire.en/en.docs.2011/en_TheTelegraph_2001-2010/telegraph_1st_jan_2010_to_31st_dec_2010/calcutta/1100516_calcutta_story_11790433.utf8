	Sashati, in Howrah district, is a picturesque village just 70km from Calcutta. It is located on the bank of the Rupnarayan river. On the other side of the river is Midnapore district.         
	We started our journey from Bagnan, hopping on to a bus that took the Bagnan-Gadiara Road to reach us at Sashati in 30 minutes.         
	We found the Sashati bus stop a beehive of activity. We ordered tea at a stall and sought van rickshaws that would take us to the riverfront.         
	As we trundled along towards the village interiors, green paddy fields and ponds flanking both sides of the road seemed a relief to our tired city eyes. Smoke curled up from brick kilns at a distance. The thick, serpentine smoke made the vision hazy.         
	We reached the waterfront within 20 minutes. The rippling expanse of water thrilled me. The air was fresh and tall trees almost blocked our vision of the riverbank.         
	While the right side of the river goes to Kolaghat, the left goes to Gadiara via Bakshi. There is a long riverbank road that leads to Gadiara and Kolaghat. Strolling along that road is an enchanting experience. A blue-breasted bird flitting in and out of the waters edge added to the beauty of the place.        
	At night, a full moon made the river look almost ethereal.         
	Sashati was once an important village town with a bustling haat (local market). The river was used for navigational purposes and cargo transported in steamers would reach Kolaghat and then Calcutta. Navigation was extended to Midnapore also. Regular boat and steamer services were available and passengers in thousands would travel on the river.                   
	Surrounded by Ganeshpur, Barigama, Chillera and other small villages, Sashati now bears the testimony of heritage. The steamer service was closed down around 70 years back. The Sashati Dak Bungalow, built by the British, is now used by officials of the public works department. Tourists can stay there as well.         
	In winter a huge 15-day fair is organised by the local people near the river. Then the riverbank is illuminated and makes for a beautiful experience.   
	Going  
	Take a train to Bagnan; then any bus heading towards Gadiara. Buses for Sashati also leave from Esplanade and Howrah. At Sashati bus stop, hire a van rickshaw to reach the riverbank. Eateries are available at Sashati More.  
	Staying  
	Bookings for the Sashati Dak Bungalow can be made at Howrah Irrigation, 11A Free School Street, 5th floor, or at the Howrah Zilla Parishad rsquo;s office opposite Howrah District Hospital      (METRO ON SUNDAY THANKS READER SAMIR CHAKRABORTY FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION.

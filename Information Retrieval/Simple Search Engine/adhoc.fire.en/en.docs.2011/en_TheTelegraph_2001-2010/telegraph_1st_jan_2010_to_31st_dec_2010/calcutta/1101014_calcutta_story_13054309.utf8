The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Water crisis looms on south as pumps fail
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Water crisis looms on south as pumps fail
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Over 2.5 million people living in south Calcutta may have to spend Puja with inadequate water as government engineers have failed to stabilise the operation of pumps at the Garden Reach waterworks.        
	Four of the five pumps of the facility, which draws water from the Hooghly and sends it to a filtration unit, broke down on Tuesday.        
	All four started running on Wednesday but after hurried repairs that sources fear could be shortlived.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation usually gets around 65 million gallons of filtered water daily from the Garden Reach facility, run by the state government subsidiary Calcutta Municipal Water and Sanitation Authority (CMWSA).        
	The civic body received half the amount on Wednesday, with households in Bhowanipore, Behala, Jodhpur Park, Garia and several other places getting water in a trickle on Sashthi.        
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee, whose locality in Behalas Parnashree was among the worst-hit, met CMWSA engineers at Garden Reach on Wednesday morning but no immediate solution emerged.        
	We hope to stabilise the functioning of the four pumps by Wednesday night. If it can be done, water supply will improve to some extent from Thursday morning. But we cannot guarantee that the pumps wont stop functioning again, said an engineer of Garden Reach waterworks.        
	When three of the five Garden Reach pumps conked out on September 1, the mayor had offered a grant of Rs 5 crore to CMWSA. Civic sources said the money could not be released as the CMWSA had yet to submit a scheme for the upgrade of the waterworks.        
	Why do the pumps at Garden Reach go out of order frequently? Because they suck in air during low tide, explained a CMWSA engineer. CMC engineers blamed poor upkeep and faulty design for the frequent snags.        
	No one can predict glitches. But we should not allow this to happen frequently. I have sought a detailed report on the pumps, said municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, under whose department CMWSA functions.        
	Ganguly Bagan resident Maya Datta said: The trouble with the Garden Reach waterworks is not new. But those responsible for the mess are never taken to task.

Baptism by water for mayor										            
	To Jol Sovan, aka, mayor of Calcutta              
	Glug, glug.        
	The first sounds I uttered on Monday.        
	The first time you, Mr Sovan Chatterjee, heard this sound as my first citizen.        
	And not just as councillor of Ward 131/132 or as mayoral council member in charge of water supply (for which you earned the moniker Jol Sovan).        
	All it took for me to drown  and for your baptism by water  was 80mm of rain in less than three hours.        
	The southern parts swiftly slipped under ankle-deep water or drowned in knee-deep water. For over four hours, the roads remained under water and the traffic out of gear. The Park Circus seven-point crossing, AJC Bose Road, Theatre Road, Sarat Bose Road, parts of Bhowanipore, Rashbehari Avenue, Chetla, Behala, Dhakuria and Jadavpur were all under water. The ripple effects on the traffic were felt near and far.        
	So, the last week of June began with curses and cries as people struggled to wade their way through water and wind their way through traffic jams to school and hospital, office and airport.        
	I overheard Riya Chakraborty, a PhD scholar residing at Jatin Das Road near Deshapriya Park, grumbling: Our entire ground floor was flooded. What is the new civic board doing?        
	To be fair, its been just 12 days since you took oath, though seven days before that you did chair a to-hell-with-protocol meeting as mayor-select to take stock of how-to-combat waterlogging. The monsoon will have hit Calcutta by the time our board takes over. So I wanted to review the preventive measures being planned to combat waterlogging, you had told Metro.        
	A for Intention, Z for Implementation.        
	So what went wrong on Monday morning? If engineers at the Ballygunge and Topsia pumping stations blamed it on the intensity of rain, mayoral council member (drainage and sewerage) Rajib Deb blamed it on old age  of 70 per cent of the drainage pumps, dragging down their efficiency levels to about 30 per cent of capacity. Then there were ground-level allegations of the gully pits not being cleared, hindering drainage.        
	The weatherman termed Monday mornings downpour normal monsoon showers and predicted many more to come. The monsoon flow is active over south Bengal and the ongoing situation should stay for another 48 hours or so, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Decoded, that would mean beware of heavy rain and so, beware of heavy waterlogging.        
	What will you do, Mr Waterman? At the mayoral council on Monday I overheard you spell out the need for short term and long term measures to tackle waterlogging. Short-term measures, you said, include cleaning of gully pits, keeping portable pumps ready and despatching submersible pumps to the low-lying pockets of Behala and east Calcutta. Long-term measures mean plotting the refurbishment of pumps and motors in the four major drainage pumping stations  Palmerbazar, Topsia, Ballygunge and Dhapa Lock.        
	I hope for your sake  and mine  that some of these measures work, and fast.        
	Otherwise, all those pills for blood sugar, blood pressure and gastric trouble you dont leave home without will struggle to keep you afloat...in tomorrows London!

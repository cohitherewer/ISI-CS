  Ustad Amjad Ali Khan is one of the foremost sarod players in India and has carved a niche for himself in the horizon of Indian classical music. He has achieved immense popularity both in India and abroad and has equally regaled connoisseurs and lay listeners of classical music. He imparts a rare aesthetic experience to his audiences with his creative imagination, consummate artistry and an imposing stage presence. Amjad Ali Khan was born to the illustrious Bangash lineage rooted in the Senia Bangash School of music. Today, he shoulders the sixth generation inheritance of this legendary lineage. His father, Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan, had received training from the great Wazir Khan of Rampur. Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan, who was among the first few to receive the Padma Bhushan, gave intensive training to his sons, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan and his two brothers. The creative genius of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan found expression in several enchanting melodies composed by him. He has composed ragas Priyadarshini and Kamalashree in memory of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. The names of other melodies composed by him are Shivanjali, Haripriya Kanada, Kiran Ranjani, Suhag Bhairav, Lalit Dhwani, Shyam Shri and Jawahar Manjari. This melodious evening will see the maestro performing solo, with Tanmoy Bose and Vineet Vyas accompanying him on the tabla.

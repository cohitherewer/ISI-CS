          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A member of the Special Action Force was injured in a clash between policemen and employees of Alipore Central jail at the Police Training School (PTS) on AJC Bose Road late on Sunday.         
	Around 11.15pm a Matador hit a van carrying 12 jail employees near the training school.        
	Both vehicles were trying to overtake each other, said an officer of Hastings police station.        
	Police said the jail employees demanded that the Matador driver pay for the damage to their van. When he refused, they allegedly abused him and dragged him out of the vehicle. The driver, chased by the jail employees, ran towards the PTS, said the officer.         
	According to cops, two SAF men deployed at the PTS gate let in the driver after he requested their help but stopped the jail team.         
	The jail employees were fuming and beat up one of the cops before forcing their way in, said the officer.         
	The jail employees caught the driver on the PTS grounds and started beating him up. The SAF personnel raised an alarm and 20 cops from the police barracks rushed to the spot, said a senior officer at Lalbazar         
	The jail employees were outnumbered and some of them received blows from the cops. Senior officers arrived and defused the situation.         
	A case of rash and negligent driving has been registered against the Matador drier. We have filed a case against the jail employees for assaulting a policeman. The jail employees also lodged a complaint against the cops, said the officer at Lalbazar.         
	He said a probe had been ordered.

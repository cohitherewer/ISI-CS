                Four SFI supporters were allegedly beaten up by fellow students at St Pauls College supporting the Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad in Howrahs Salkia on Friday. Amrita Chakrabarty, a BA third-year student, sustained injuries in his arms and back and was admitted to Howrah General Hospital. Many students of our college stay in Salkia so we had gone there to campaign for the college elections, scheduled for December 21. As soon as we stepped out of the house of one of our classmates, 25 youths belonging to the Trinamul camp attacked us with rods, said Jaswant Kesari, a third-year student of the Amherst Street college. A police complaint was lodged against four students.

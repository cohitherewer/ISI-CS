The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chaos of our times
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Chaos of our times
                              Malavika Sarukkai with Tanushree Shankar at the launch of her DVD at a city hotel. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                            
	Bharatnatyam exponent Malavika Sarukkai launched her first dance DVD in the city recently. The internationally acclaimed dancer spoke to Metro on Sunday about her work, on the mediocrity that goes by in the name of popular dance and about doing her bit to keep the sanctity of her art form alive.               
	What is the DVD about?        
	This is my first dance DVD, Vahini. I feel the classical arts in India always had two components  the sacred and the worldly. They are not separate, rather they co-exist. I have tried to make the DVD representative of the fairly wide repertoire that I perform. Its directed by K. Hariharan and shot at special locations.              
	Is the DVD based on traditional Bharatnatyam?        
	For me, making the DVD was about exploring the language of Bharatnatyam. The language of my dance is very classical, its about working within tradition and reinventing it. I have done some choreography from the traditional margam (repertoire). I have also done other kinds of choreography.              
	So its about mixing styles?         
	No, no... I am simply innovating within the traditional. In classical dance we have certain structures and I have incorporated my own understanding to make something beautiful out of it. Like Tillana is a known classical structure and Mohana Krishna is a structure that I have innovated. Its like the ragas  each musician develops the same raga differently.               
	Do you admire any Calcutta-based dancers?        
	Unfortunately I havent seen too many dancers from Calcutta. But one name that comes to mind is Preeti Patel. She does a lot of very different work. There is also Padatik and Chetna Jalan. But I havent seen them for many years.              
	What do you feel about modern dance?        
	Everyone is experimenting. Dance is now moving in an explosive direction. But I wont say every direction is the right direction. There are so many activities and too much of activity can become chaos.         
	For anything to be lasting and to have a deeper understanding, there has to be a foundation, a deeper philosophy that makes it meaningful.         
	I find everything is happening all over the place but nothing really registers. People want to consume very quickly. It is the chaos of our times.              
	Are you referring to Bollywood dance?         
	Oh my God, Bollywood is something totally different. A lot needs to be questioned. Even without Bollywood, there is a lot of mediocrity. People take what they get. But its like you have junk food and some fabulous home-cooked Bengali food but someone has to tell them which ones good. Quite a lot that needs to be done, really. We are all doing it our own way, I guess.                    MADHUPARNA DAS

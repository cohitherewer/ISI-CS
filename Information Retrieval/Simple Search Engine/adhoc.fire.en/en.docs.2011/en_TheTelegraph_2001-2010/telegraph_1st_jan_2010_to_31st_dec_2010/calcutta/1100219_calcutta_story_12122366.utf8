The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Online counselling for Madhyamik students
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Online counselling for Madhyamik students
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The state secondary education board, taking a cue from its Delhi-based counterparts, is planing to launch online counselling for students, guardians, teachers and the authorities of Madhyamik schools.        
	The move is aimed at enabling students, teachers and guardians to interact with board officials regarding examinations, syllabi, model question and answers as well as student stress. The counselling will be offered primarily during the Madhyamik exams, said a member of the West Bengal board.         
	Partha Roy, the secretary of the board, said that before starting the programme, the board would have to ensure that all Madhyamik schools, many of them located in remote rural belts, are equipped with computers and Internet facilities.        
	We cannot offer the facility during the 2010 Madhyamik exams but have plans to launch the scheme by next year, the secretary said.        
	The Delhi-based ICSE/ISC and CBSE boards have long been offering this service.         
	Arrangements have been made for providing computers to 1,800 schools but the machines cannot be delivered immediately because the process is mired in legal problems, a source in the board said.        
	Mamata Ray, the president of the board, said all arrangements for holding the 2010 Madhyamik exams from February 23 were on course. This year, 947,495 candidates will write the exams, a big jump from 854,729 examinees in 2009. The exams will be held in 1,189 centres across Bengal.        
	Ray said there was a significant increase in the number of girl students this year, making up nearly half the total examinees.         
	On the exam days, question papers will be distributed to the candidates at 11.45am and 15 minutes will be given for reading the questions.         
	The board also appealed to all departments concerned to ensure uninterrupted power supply during the exams.

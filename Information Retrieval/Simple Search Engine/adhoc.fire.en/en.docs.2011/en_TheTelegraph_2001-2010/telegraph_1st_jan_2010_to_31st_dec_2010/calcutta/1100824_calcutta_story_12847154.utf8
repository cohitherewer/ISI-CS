The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tribute to Uttams Sundari turns ugly 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tribute to Uttams Sundari turns ugly 
  - Judge orders three songs to be deleted before release          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	A bid to remake Ogo Bodhu Sundari has turned ugly.         
	Kamal Bansal, the son of RD Bansal, who had produced the 1981 hit starring Uttam Kumar, Sumitra Mukherjee and Mousumi Chatterjee, moved the high court on Friday, accusing director Sunando Mitra of copying three songs and the font and style of the title of his fathers film. Mitras film, which has the same name and stars Babul Supriyo, Sreelekha Mitra and Monami Ghosh, is slated to release on August 27.         
	Bansal on Monday told Justice Sanjib Banerjee that Mitra had copied three songs of the 1981 film  Ei toh jibon, Nari charitra and Tui jato phool dis na kine  and also the title style. Bansal sought a court order for deleting the songs and modifying the title.         
	Justice Banerjee said: The film can be released on Friday but the three songs cannot be played in the film. Also, the logo should be changed.        
	Bansal said he would watch the film when it released and decide if the plot was copied too. The Bansals have also produced Satyajit Rays Nayak, Kapurush, Mahapurush, Charulata, Mahanagar and Joi Baba Felunath.        
	The Bansals have to deposit Rs 4 lakh to the court as a short-term deposit. My client can go ahead with the Friday release of the film if the songs are deleted and the changes in the title made, said Mitras lawyer Vipul Kundalia.        
	But Mitra and Babul are against deleting the songs. The film will fall flat without the three songs. I have already taken the permission of Inreco Records, which is the original copyright holder of the music of Ogo Bodhu Sundari (1981). I am trying to see if the matter can be settled out of court, said Mitra, who is also the executive producer of the film produced by the Mumbai-based DSilva Productions.        
	Its disheartening. I was very excited to act in a film that was a tribute to Uttam Kumar. I also felt privileged to playback three songs sung by my idol, Kishore Kumar, in the original film, rued Babul.        
	Mitras Ogo Bodhu Sundari revolves around an estranged husband and wife and a tribal girl, the plot being quite similar to the Uttam Kumar-starrer. The 1981 film itself was inspired by the 1964 American film My Fair Lady with Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison in the lead. The film, which bagged eight Oscars, was an adaptation of George Bernard Shaws play Pygmalion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taxi trio nailed for kidnap
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Taxi trio nailed for kidnap
  - Rs 1.9-lakh ransom haul        A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Police cracked the Sandipan Das abduction case on Wednesday, arresting the taxi trio behind the crime and establishing a link between cabbies and recent incidents of snatching and robbery along the Rajarhat and Belghoria expressways.        
	The three arrests, powered by a breakthrough on Tuesday night, coincided with the Nabadiganta township authorities unveiling a security and taxi surveillance plan for the Sector V-New Town tech hub.        
	The superintendent of police of North 24-Parganas, Rahul Srivastava, said 42-year-old taxi driver Sanjay Pal was arrested from his Tobin Road residence early on Wednesday for plotting and executing the abduction of the Capgemini manager on Friday night.        
	The police found Rs 1.9 lakh in ransom money  exactly how much Sandipans family paid the gang is yet to be confirmed  hidden in a cotton pillow in Sanjays residence. Sanjays confession led to the arrest of his accomplices Amit Das, of Domjur in Howrah, and Murshidabad resident Manoj Bag within a couple of hours of each other.         
	The 25-member investigation squad had split into four groups and fanned out into North 24-Parganas to look for Sanjay after another taxi driver who was to have helped him collect the ransom from Sandipans family was arrested on Tuesday on the basis of a tip-off.        
	Md Muqaddars taxi (WB 19B 0251) was to have been the one in which the kidnapper trio would collect the ransom, but they fell out over something and he backed out of the plan. Once we found Muqaddar, the pieces in the kidnap-for-ransom puzzle fell into place, said Srivastava.        
	Although it hasnt been established whether Sanjay and his accomplices were involved in other crimes in the area, the police are collating evidence suggesting that recent incidents of snatching and road robberies on the high-speed corridors on the eastern and northern fringes were the handiwork of a taxi gang.        
	The trio will be produced in court on Thursday.        
	Last Friday, Sanjay was waiting for a potential hostage victim near the DLF Building in New Town when Sandipan walked towards his taxi (WB 04D 3227). Amit and Manoj were waiting near the dark stretch leading to Nicco Park, where Sanjay stopped on the pretext of a breakdown (see graphic).         
	Ash Mohammad, the first taxi driver to be arrested in the case, was apparently unaware of the plan despite his vehicle (WB 04A 0975) being used to collect the ransom from Delhi Road.        
	Sanjay and one of his accomplices had got off Muqaddars taxi at Alam Bazar after their argument on Saturday night, and Mohammad happened to be standing by. So they hired his taxi to go to Delhi Road and collect the ransom, an officer said.        
	The police, who had accused Sandipans family of making contradictory statements, received the most crucial piece of information  the registration number of Mohammads taxi  from them. Identikits of the men involved in the abduction were drawn up and circulated in North 24-Parganas on the basis of descriptions provided by Sandipan and Mohammad, who is in judicial custody.        
	The Citu taxi union and the Regional Transport Authority helped us trace Mohammads taxi. We had the advantage of knowing where to look because all the ransom calls made to Sandipans family from his cellphone were traced to towers in North 24-Parganas, said R. Banerjee, the additional SP in Barasat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | One dead, two injured in twin mishaps
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      One dead, two injured in twin mishaps
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The oil tanker that was damaged by protesters. (Soumen Bhattacharjee)                                  
	Two accidents in the city on Friday left a 42-year-old man dead and an actor and an actress injured.        
	Anupam Sanyal, who worked in the Asutosh College library, was crushed by an oil tanker that was speeding down a Kalighat lane to make up for the time lost while being stuck amidst illegally parked vehicles.        
	Sanyal had left home around 10.45am on his way to work. He walked barely a hundred metres and was crossing KP Haldar Lane when he was knocked down by the empty tanker that was travelling north.        
	Sanyal was taken to SSKM Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. The tanker was seized but the driver fled.        
	Around 200 residents blocked the crossing of KP Halder Lane and Mahim Ghoshal Lane for more than two hours, protesting illegal parking and plying of autorickshaws through narrow lanes and bylanes. They also damaged the windshield of the tanker. The blockade was lifted after senior police officers promised to look into the allegations.        
	KP Halder Lane has become accident-prone as half of it is taken up by illegally parked vehicles in the morning and evening, said Animesh Podder, a resident.        
	Adding to the risk, autos often take short-cuts through lanes, none of which figures on routes approved by police.        
	The protesters alleged that they had narrated the problems to officers at Kalighat police station and Lalbazar but no action had been taken.        
	We regularly book autos plying illegally through lanes but that hardly deters the operators. As for illegal parking, well soon take some action, said an officer of the police station.        
	In the other mishap, a car carrying the crew of a Bengali TV serial collided with a Matador on the Bypass, near Ruby General Hospital, around 3am, leaving an actor and an actress injured.        
	Rituja Dey, 30, who was sitting beside the driver, suffered multiple fractures and facial injuries. She is being treated at CMRI. Doctors said her condition was stable.         
	Suman Haldar, 34, who was sitting in the rear, was injured on the lips and forehead. He was treated at SSKM Hospital and released. The car and the fish-laden Matador have been seized. The Matador driver fled, police said.        
	Barasat death: Somnath Gayne, 25, died after a truck loaded with stonechips overturned and fell on him at Dakbungalow More in Barasat around 7am. Gayne worked for a travel agency.

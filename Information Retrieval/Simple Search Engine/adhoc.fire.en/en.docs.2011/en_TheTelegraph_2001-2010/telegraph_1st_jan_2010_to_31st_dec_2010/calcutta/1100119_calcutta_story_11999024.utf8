                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      ICSE board simplifies rules
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Council of Indian School Certificate Examinations has adopted a slew of measures to ensure that the ICSE and the ISC exams are held smoothly this year. Both exams are slated to begin on March 2.        
	Last year, staffers at an exam centre in Bangalore had mistakenly opened a packet containing ICSE geography question papers two days ahead of the scheduled exam, prompting the council to postpone the test and triggering confusion among students.        
	The council has now decided to mention only the subject on each test paper packet, instead of the entire name of the subject. So, a packet containing history papers will be marked history and a packet holding geography papers will only say geography.        
	Till last year, the full name of the subject  History, civics and geography (paper I)  used to be written on packets containing history and civics test papers, while History, civics and geography (paper II) used to be written on packets containing geography papers.         
	The Bangalore school had opened a packet containing geography papers  marked History civics and geography (paper II)  on the day of the history exam (paper I). We have simplified the name of the exam to prevent a similar error this year, said a council official.        
	For the science exams, packets will be marked physics, chemistry and biology instead of Science I, Science II and Science III as was written till last year.        
	The council has also decided to introduce a colour code for each subject. Each subject will be written in a different colour on the respective packets and the heads of institutions and employees of banks where the question papers are kept during the exams will be given necessary instructions.        
	The date of each exam will also be mentioned on each packet.        
	For the first time, senior officials of the council will hold meetings with the supervising examiners before the exams, said the principal of a school in south Calcutta.

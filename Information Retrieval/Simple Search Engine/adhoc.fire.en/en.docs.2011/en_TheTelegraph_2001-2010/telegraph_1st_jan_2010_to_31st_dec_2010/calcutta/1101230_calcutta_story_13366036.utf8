The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops now see merit in case
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops now see merit in case
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Wednesdays Metro report on the assault        
	Police knocked on the door of the brothers Dafadar on Wednesday  after sitting on their complaint for two days  to investigate the assault on them by road rowdies last Monday, giving the duo a glimmer of hope for justice.        
	The change of heart  the police had claimed that the complaint was a non-cognisable one  came within hours of Metro reporting how Rohit and Rahul Dafadar were assaulted and their mother abused and almost kicked in front of their central Calcutta home for asking some youths to make way for their car.        
	A family member said that two cops, one of them the sub-inspector who had written a general diary instead of registering an FIR on Monday, visited their apartment off Amherst Street to say that the officer-in-charge of the local police station wanted to meet the complainants.        
	For the Dafadars, everything at Amherst Street police station seemed different from the first time they had gone there two ago. Before I could say anything, the officer-in-charge informed me that the probe had started last night, said Rohit and Rahuls father, Sanjay Dafadar.        
	An officer later said that raids were being carried out at various locations to arrest the culprits, two of whom have been named in the complaint.        
	The case lodged against the accused is under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 114 (abettor present when offence is committed), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the IPC.        
	When Sanjay said that his family was feeling insecure, the officer-in-charge promised to deploy two constables in front of his ground-floor house on New Years Eve.        
	We have organised a get-together at our place on the last night of the year and a lot of people will be coming. So we wanted protection, said Sanjays wife Pratima, who also told the police that she spotted one of the goons involved in the assault loitering in the locality on Wednesday morning.        
	Rohit, the younger of the two Dafadar brothers, had become depressed when the police didnt start an investigation until late on Tuesday, their mother added.

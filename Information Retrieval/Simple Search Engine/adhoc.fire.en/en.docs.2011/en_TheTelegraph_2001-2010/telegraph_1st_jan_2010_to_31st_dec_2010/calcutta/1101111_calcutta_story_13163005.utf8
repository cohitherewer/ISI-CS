	The state pollution control board on Wednesday issued a closure order to a Lake Town chemcial factory that failed to abide by green norms.        
	The order  passed after a hearing following a public complaint  came into immediate effect.        
	The unit, West Bengal Chemical Industries Ltd, belongs to the red category as it has immense potential to pollute the neighbourhood.        
	The closure order, signed by the boards chief law officer Biswajit Mukherjee, stated the unit had failed to comply with green norms and was operating without adopting proper pollution-control systems.        
	We have no idea about the order, said Surojit Kumar Pal, the general manager (operations) of the unit.

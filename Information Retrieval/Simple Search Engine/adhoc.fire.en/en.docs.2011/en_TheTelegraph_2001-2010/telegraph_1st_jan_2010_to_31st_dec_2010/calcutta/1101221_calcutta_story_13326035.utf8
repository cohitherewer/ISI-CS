                   Dance-floor duel: The rivalry between Munni and Sheila is indeed the talk of the town (Dance baby dance: Sheila steps on Munni toes, December 9). Ever since Sheila made her entry, text messages have been doing the rounds accusing guys of two-timing Munni. For me, it rsquo;s Munni over Sheila any day. The strictly cosmopolitan feel and the little-too-raunchy-for-comfort lyrics will go against Sheila rsquo;s popularity. However, Munni badnam hui is here to stay. Its folk base ensures a wider mass appeal, urban and rural. The Dabangg song can be interpreted as more than just an item number, unlike Sheila ki jawani.

	The retaliatory attack by a student on a principal (Boy punches principal, December 16) was expected given the depths student-teacher relationships have plumbed in the past few years.           
	Gone are the days when teachers would treat students as their children. Today students are treated as if they are convicts. Do the teachers who hit students torture their own children in the same manner? They are a blot on this noble profession. If they do not rectify themselves, society will not forgive them.           
	The school authorities should behave normally with the boy and allow his psychological rehabilitation. If they succeed, he himself will apologise and not repeat his mistake. That will be their biggest achievement.

	The news is not only shocking but alarming as well. It seems todays youth have forgotten how to be patient and learn from mistakes. It is true that the principal resorted to corporal punishment, which is banned, but the boy should have shown restraint and kept his cool.           
	This incident is an example of moral degradation. How could the boy slap the principal for 10 minutes? Did the other teachers and students support him? Violence reported by the media is largely responsible for such incidents.

	Should the Calcutta Metro trains be called Death expresses? Lack of security and surveillance is definitely a reason why Metro has become the citys suicide point. Policemen deployed at the stations are either sleeping or chatting with each other or harassing commuters.             
	Commuters should also play a part in stopping Metro suicides. If a commuter finds someone standing close to the edge of the platform, he or she should immediately pull the person back or at least raise an alarm so that cops can tackle the situation.           
	Amrita Mallik,           
	Salt Lake                               
	Apropos the report Fatal crash with teen at wheel, December 6, the boys irresponsible parents who let him drive unsupervised is responsible for the tragedy. Parents need to keep tabs on their children and ensure that what they do for fun is not dangerous. Thankfully, the teenager did not kill more people by taking the wheel.

	In response to the article Auto writ runs on cop assault stretch, December 13, here are my suggestions for reining in rogue three-wheelers:             
	 Rigid implementation of stricter laws           
	 Spot fines and cancellation of driving licences in case of rule violation           
	 Immediate dismantling of auto stands near busy intersections           
	 Not allowing more than four people to travel in an auto           
	 Uniform fare structure           
	 Stricter supervision over the functioning of the public vehicles department.           
	Debasish Chatterjee,           
	VIP Road                     
	Autos plying between Salt Lake and Phoolbagan are extremely unruly. They flout traffic rules even in front of cops. Moreover, they refuse to return the change. The same is true for autos that ply from the Baisakhi stand. The drivers can afford to be so brazen because the unions protect them even if they do wrong. When they dont care about the police, one can understand how they would deal with ordinary citizens.           
	Anuradha Bhattacharya,           
	Address not given                     
	One need not be a rocket scientist to figure out how to rein in autos. The penalties in our country are from the Victorian era and need to be increased. And those who violate rules need to be penalised without fail.           
	Motorists all over the world only care about stiff fines and Calcutta auto drivers are no exception. If the penalty remains Rs 100 for serious violations, the free-for-all will continue on the Calcutta street.           
	Avik Sinha,           
	Address not given                     
	Auto drivers have a free run in Calcutta and Salt Lake is no exception. The citys traffic density is the highest in India, courtesy the lowest road space.           
	Autorickshaws were introduced to improve traffic flow despite protests from various quarters, which held that this mode of transport was unsuitable for Calcutta. Now they have become the biggest impediment to traffic flow.           
	Given the fact that autorickshaws provide many people an opportunity to earn, there is perhaps not much room for cynical outbursts.           
	The problem lies in the union culture of our state. The union dadas protect the drivers and hence they do not care about the traffic rules.           
	Anyone raising his voice against such auto-cracy is attacked in such a manner by auto drivers that even the boldest give up. They can only be reined in when the usually indulgent traffic policemen muster the courage to hold them by the collar and make them pay for their rule violations.           
	P.B. Saha,           
	Salt Lake                     
	Autos on the Kankurgachhi-Karuna- moyee route often carries six passengers each. This is too risky and needs to be stopped immediately. Passengers are equally irresponsible as they do not hesitate to travel in overloaded autos.           
	Vivek More,           
	Address not given                               
	The concept of introducing discipline as a subject (Enter, discipline in class, November 10) seems innovative. Students are more likely to take an interest in discipline and follow rules if that fetches them good marks. Eventually, following rules and regulations will become second nature for them not only in school but also at home and outside. A thumbs up for such a day.

	Regarding the report Nod for 80 houses in wetlands, December 11, it is a matter of great concern that the state government has decided to allow 80 houses to be built on the East Calcutta Wetlands.             
	During chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees tenure, several water bodies and large parts of the wetlands have been filled up clandestinely for building housing complexes.           
	NGOs and environmentalists should take up the matter and approach appropriate forums, including courts, to save the wetlands.

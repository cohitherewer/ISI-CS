The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Residents win wall war against graffiti gang
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Residents win wall war against graffiti gang
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Where there is a vote, there is a way.         
	Residents of two pockets in Park Circus have wielded the ultimate weapon against political parties defacing walls  no votes in the civic elections. The result: Orient Row and Talbagan in ward 64 wear a clean, whitewashed look even as the city turns into the graffiti gangs happy hunting ground.         
	The victory against the paintbrush brigade didnt come easy.         
	We protested against defacement of walls when Javed Ahmed Khan of the Trinamul Congress and Farzana Chowdhury of the CPI came to campaign in our locality a few days ago, said Shahanshah Mirza, the secretary of Orient Row-Talbagan We Care Committee.         
	The residents brief to the politicians was simple: Ensure that our walls are not defaced, only then will we listen to what you have to say.         
	Bowing to public pressure or moved by their pleas, the two candidates of ward 64 assured the people of clean walls throughout the poll season. The area is home to 50 to 60 families.         
	But within hours of Javed Khans assurances, the Trinamul graffiti gang came calling on Sunday afternoon. As they readied their paint and brushes, the residents got together and forced them to leave.        
	They beat a retreat following protest from local people and promised not to return. We told them we would never allow graffiti on our walls, said Mirza.        
	But the gang returned in the dead of the night and wrote graffiti on a couple of walls. The next morning, angry residents called up Khans party office and asked his colleagues to whitewash the defaced walls.         
	We felt cheated as Javed Khan had given us his word that no graffiti would be painted in our locality. We demanded that the walls be whitewash immediately, said Ashish Banerjee, the president of We Care Committee.        
	Some supporters of the Trinamul Congress visited the area on Monday morning and assured the residents that their walls would be restored to their original condition soon.         
	We forced them to whitewash the walls. It is a big victory for common people like us. It was achieved only because we raised our voice against the wrongdoing of political parties, said Banerjee.         
	According to him, political parties had no business defacing walls of common people against their wishes. We want people in other areas of the city to stand up against graffiti gangs, too, as our constitutional right to property is at stake. Hopefully, we have been able to send the message across to political parties to leave our walls alone, he added.        
	Asked about the graffiti row, Javed Khan was quick to highlight that the walls in Orient Row-Talbagan had been whitewashed.         
	On Orient Row, only my name was painted on the walls. When almost all the residents expressed their dislike for graffiti during my door-to-door campaign, I readily agreed to have them wiped clean, said the Trinamul leader.         
	After all, I am with the people. Not only are there no wall writings in the area now, the walls look better than before. Some residents even congratulated me and wished me luck for the polls, he smiled.

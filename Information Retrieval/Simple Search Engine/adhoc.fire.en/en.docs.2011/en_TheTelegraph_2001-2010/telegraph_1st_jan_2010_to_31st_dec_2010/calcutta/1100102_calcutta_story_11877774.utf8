The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tech tools to check suicide on tracks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tech tools to check suicide on tracks
          A STAFF REPORTER                          In future, an alarm could go off if a passenger crosses the white line before the train arrives on the platform                                  
	Metro Railway has turned to technology to prevent suicides on the tracks in 2010 after soothing music and speed check on trains failed to be of much help.        
	Software that allow closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to track individual passengers on the platform were activated a few days ago at the Metro stations. The cameras would not only help security personnel identify those about to make a suicide attempt and also potential security threats.         
	Those who commit suicide generally spend some time on the platform before jumping in front of a train. By tracking individuals we can stop them before they throw themselves in front of a train, said a senior Metro official.         
	Individual tracking is practised in the New York, London and Singapore underground railway networks.         
	According to sources, Metro Railway has also received a proposal from Bosch, a company that deals with video analytics, offering a state-of-the art technology that railway networks in Germany are considering.        
	Our software analyses still and video images recorded by security cameras and raises an alarm on the basis of instructions fed into it. For example, the system can sound an alarm at a stations CCTV control room the moment someone crosses the white line and goes to the edge of the platform, said Satadal Chattopadhyay, the country manager of Bosch.        
	Once this system is installed, it would not be necessary for someone to be seated in a chair in the control room with eyes glued to the CCTV images throughout the day, Chattopadhyay added.        
	Between 1988 and 2009, 184 people have attempted suicide in Metro, of whom 86 died and 98 were rescued. In 2009, there were 15 suicide attempts with 10 deaths. Five were rescued. The year before saw the same number of attempts resulting in seven deaths.        
	After a spate of suicides in November, the authorities had reduced the speed at which trains entered the stations. We asked drivers to enter stations at 12-15km per hour so that the trains can be immediately stopped if somebody jumps on the tracks. But this wasnt of help and led to delays, said an official.        
	Earlier, Metro Railway had played Rabindrasangeet and soothing instrumental music in the stations to dissuade people from attempting suicide.         
	It is difficult to work out a way to prevent suicides. We have tried different types of music and restricted the speed of an approaching train. Now lets see what more can be done, said the official.        
	We are looking for a technological solution but probably that alone wouldnt suffice. We will also need more manpower to physically stop people from jumping on the tracks, he added.

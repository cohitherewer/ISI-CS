The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Light-camera-action tips in school 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Light-camera-action tips in school 
          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          Students of Mahadevi Birla Girls watch a film screened as part of their film festival last month                                  
	Satyajit Ray was over 30 when he made his first film but if there is a Ray in your child, he can start right away.        
	A number of city schools have been introducing senior students to the rudiments of film-making, either through screenings or by conducting workshops.        
	On most campuses, the initiative had started as a film club or just another extra-curricular activity before evolving into sessions providing hands-on tips.         
	We have always encouraged our students to shoot small films or click photographs that have been used in our school calendar. In the process we have come across exceptional talent that should be nurtured. If they get the right guidance they can pursue a career in film-making, said Meena Kak, principal, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy (LSA).        
	The school will get professionals to train students between classes IX and XII in technical aspects of film-making once the Puja vacation is over. We plan to make this a once a week activity, added Kak.        
	Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School hosted an international film festival  the first of its kind  from September 27 to October 11, where Rashomon, Battleship Potemkin and The Bicycle Thief were screened.        
	The objective of the festival was not just to screen good films but also to ensure that children analyse them and engage in activities that would help them learn the technical aspects of film-making, said Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School.        
	The screenings were organised after school hours but 30 to 40 students stayed back for each. A detailed discussion and homework followed each film. The homework included interviewing people from different age groups, studying the camera work (long shot, mid-shot and close-up), recording sounds and deciding what to capture in a frame.        
	The placement of the camera reveals what relation the viewer should have with what is being shown. A lot depends on whether the camera has zoomed in on the subject or has captured it from a distance. Whether the subject is being shown from below or above also conveys a lot, said Rupali Sachdev, a senior teacher at Mahadevi Birla Girls who has been taking classes on films.        
	If we show a face and a bowl of soup, it would mean the person shown is hungry. A face and a baby could mean the person is affectionate. Its about how the images are juxtaposed, she added.         
	Such is the enthusiasm among students that they dropped in at school in the middle of the puja vacation to show teachers the photographs they had been asked to click on the theme Through a window.        
	The sessions have given us an insight into the basics of filmmaking  like shooting, editing and recording. My most important lesson was how to introduce the setting of a movie  from a long shot to a mid-shot and finally a close-up, said Class X student Namrata Agarwal.        
	The Heritage School started filmmaking training this summer. We hosted a workshop in summer and plan to host another in winter. The students are showing interest in this and it gives them an avenue to express their creativity, said Seema Sapru, principal, The Heritage School.        
	Apeejay School, Park Street, and Delhi Public School, Megacity, are some of the other schools that provide technical film-making training to students.         
	Mumbai-based NGO Comet Media Foundation recently conducted a short-term course for city teachers on using films in classrooms.         
	We dealt with juxtaposition of scenes, breaking action into shots and editing. The teachers, who had requested us to conduct the course, can impart this training to the students, said Subha Das Mollick, the Calcutta co-ordinator of the NGO.        
	Teachers from Modern High School for Girls, Loreto Day School, Sealdah and Dharamtala, Shaw Public School, Akshar and other schools attended the training programme.        
	It was part of a year-long project called Filmi Chasma undertaken by the NGO along with the Childrens Film Society of India.

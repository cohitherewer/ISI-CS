The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Station lifts grounded
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Station lifts grounded
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE AND TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                              
	When 58-year-old Pradip Banerjee, whose left leg is partially paralysed, learnt last August that the Metro Railway station to be opened near his Naktala home would have lifts, he was overjoyed. He thought he would no longer have to negotiate stairs or brave an escalator ride on the way to his Shyambazar office. His joy has turned to disappointment a year later.         
	Till date, I havent been able to use the Naktala lifts even once as officials claim it doesnt work, said the accountant who walks with a crutch. Many such infirm and aged persons head for the closed elevator doors at the four stations where the platforms are on the second-floor level  Kudghat (Netaji), Bansdroni (Gitanjali), Naktala (Masterda Surya Sen) and Garia Bazar (Kavi Nazrul)  and are turned away daily.        
	According to Metro officials, the eight lifts at the four stations are in good condition but cannot be put to use because of absence of trained operators. The automatic lifts are serviced regularly but we cannot allow the aged and the disabled to use these as they might get stuck in the middle. There is no expert at the stations to tackle such an emergency, said an official at Bansdroni station.        
	An official at Naktala claimed: If an elderly or physically challenged person wants to use the lift, one of us escorts him or her to the platform for safety reasons. On a normal day, 10 to 12 aged persons ask to use the lift, he added.         
	Officials said they had apprised their seniors about the need for lift technicians but nothing has changed.

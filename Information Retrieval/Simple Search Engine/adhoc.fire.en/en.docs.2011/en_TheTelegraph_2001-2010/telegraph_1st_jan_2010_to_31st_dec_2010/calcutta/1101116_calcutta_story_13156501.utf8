The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traffic rejig lined up for East-West 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Traffic rejig lined up for East-West

	A slew of traffic diversions have to be enforced in parts of east Calcutta because of work on East-West Metro but lack of co-ordination among agencies has led to confusion over from when the curbs will be in place.        
	Police have drawn a traffic diversion plan but the Calcutta Metro Railway Corporation (CMRC), which is building the link between Salt Lake Sector V and Howrah, doesnt know when it can start work on the stretch.        
	CMRC officials have held several meetings with us. After a joint inspection by senior representatives of both departments, it was decided that traffic movement along Narkeldanga Main Road will be restricted to facilitate work from the first week of November. We are ready with a diversion plan but the CMRC is yet to start work, said an officer of the Beleghata traffic guard.        
	Traffic on the 2km Narkeldanga Main Road will be restricted once work on the construction of pillars for the East-West tracks begins in the vicinity.        
	Small cars from the Bypass will be allowed to enter Narkeldanga Main Road in a single row but cannot travel beyond the INOX multiplex. The cars will be diverted to the street on the banks of Subhas Sarovar, leading to CIT Road. From CIT Road, west-bound cars can take Beleghata Main Road or Suren Sarkar Road to reach Sealdah and Rajabazar, respectively, the officer said.        
	However, residents of Narkeldanga Main Road, such as those who live in the condominiums along the lake, will be allowed to drive home from the Bypass.        
	Traffic from the Phoolbagan-end will not be allowed to enter Narkeldanga Main Road because of the construction of an East-West station at the Phoolbagan-CIT Road crossing.         
	For the residents along the busy thoroughfare, returning home will be an ordeal till the work is over. We have to enter the road from the Bypass, instead of Phoolbagan More. It means a detour of several kilometres. We hope work finishes fast, said Pankaj Jaiswal, a resident of Rukmani Parasmani, a housing estate on Narkeldanga Main Road.        
	According to the traffic police, around 3,500 vehicles ply on the road every hour on an average during the peak period. An ill-planned road-closure will result in chaos from the Bypass in the east to Maniktala in the west, and from Sealdah in the south to Ultadanga in the north.        
	The CMRC blamed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for the delay and promised to start work by the last week of the month.        
	There was some confusion over the diversion of the underground sewage and water lines by the civic body. The process is on and we will start work by the last week of November, said a CMRC official.        
	He claimed the delay would not push back the October 2013 deadline for the link between Sector V and Sealdah, spanning 8.5km. The second phase will extend 5.2km, from Sealdah to Howrah.        
	From Swabhumi, the East-West Metro will go underground. A tunnel-boring machine will create space for the railway line.        
	A CMRC official said traffic was being restricted on Narkeldanga Main Road because the line would go underground there and the builders need the space for the transition from elevated to underground tracks.        
	The police said they were arranging for more cops to man the area. We have asked for extra deployment during the period of the diversion, said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crossroads chaos after signal snap 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Crossroads chaos after signal snap

	Traffic signals at key crossings in south Calcutta were shut down on Monday afternoon, leaving cops on duty, motorists and pedestrians in the lurch.         
	While Lalbazar claimed that officers-in-charge of traffic guards were informed about the proposed switch-off for work on a modernisation project, sergeants and constables manning the crossings said they were not kept in the loop. The traffic lights which were snapped around 2.30pm, came back on around 5.30pm.        
	The 10-plus signals that were shut down included those at JK Island near Fort William and the Red Road-Queensway, Kidderpore Road-Lovers Lane, Exide, Mayo Road and Shakespeare Sarani intersections. Even signals that only indicate diversions and road directions did not work.        
	Around 2.30pm, we suddenly found the signals were not working at the crossing, causing traffic congestion. Vehicles come from all sides of the intersection. We had to rush out of our kiosk to regulate the traffic, said a constable who was on duty at JK Island.        
	The cops had a tough time ensuring smooth passage of the chief ministers convoy through Red Road towards his Palm Avenue home. We panicked after learning over wireless that the convoy was approaching the crossing. Three constables somehow managed to clear the way. There could easily have been a mishap, he said.         
	Policemen on the ground said they alerted the traffic control room several times but nothing was done.         
	Motorists on the stretch said they faced problems with the signal not working but there were many other signals in the city that had been lying defunct for months.        
	Deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Banerjee said the signals were shut down as part of a project to make them automatic. Officers in charge of the traffic guards concerned were alerted about the work, he said. The officer-in-charge of South traffic guard was not available for comment.         
	Another officer of the traffic guard expressed surprise over the timing of the work. The private agency pursuing the project could have shut down the signals at night and done the work, he said.

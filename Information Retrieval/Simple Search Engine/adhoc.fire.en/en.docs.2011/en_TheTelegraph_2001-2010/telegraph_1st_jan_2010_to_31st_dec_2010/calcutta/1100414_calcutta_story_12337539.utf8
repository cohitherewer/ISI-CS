                      Ringing in Poila Baishakh                    The cycle of seasons for the Bengali milieu begins in April with celebrations for the Bengali New Year.

Borshoboron, hosted by Priya Entertainments, is a celebratory countdown to the New Year featuring some of the best names in the cultural kaleidoscope of the city. The evening rolls on with an audio drama, Tobu Mone Rekho, penned by Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee. A love story manifesting through the lives of two women, it features actresses Chaiti Ghoshal and Suchita Raychaudhury, and complemented with Tagore songs by Pramita Mallick. Rongorosh is a session of rip-roaring laughter and comedy through dramatised readings by actor Dulal Lahiri and elocutionist Sutapa Bandyopadhyay. A music presentation by Calcutta Ensemble, Chironton Swarnojug is a trip down memory lane and presented in tribute to acclaimed composers. Babuana Bibiani, a musical entourage presented by Devajit and Riddhi Bandyopadhyay, provides a fitting finale to the colourful countdown, while curtains come down on the event with a fashion showcase (creations by Sharbari Datta and Shampa Das), participated by Tota Roychoudhury, Dev, Kamalika, June Maliah and Chaiti Ghoshal.

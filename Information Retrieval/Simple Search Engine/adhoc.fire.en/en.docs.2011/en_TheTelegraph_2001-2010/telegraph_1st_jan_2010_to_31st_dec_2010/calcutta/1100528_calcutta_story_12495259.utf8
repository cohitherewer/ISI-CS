          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti on Thursday instructed senior officers to be extra cautious in pockets in the Port division that border South 24-Parganas, especially Metiabruz and Garden Reach, to avoid trouble during civic polls.         
	Officers were also asked to ensure that polling agents are not provided extra chairs to prevent supporters of political parties from stationing themselves inside booths.        
	Party activists would not even be allowed to help us man queues outside booths, said an officer who attended the meeting.         
	There will be rings of police vans and pickets around booths. We will bring in tiffin in vans for cops on duty in the booths so that they dont have to step out, added the officer.        
	Other plans include vigil on the Hooghly by river traffic police and creation of an election control room at the Lalbazar police headquarters.        
	The combing of ceremony houses, guest houses and hotels will start on Friday. Abandoned houses and buildings under construction would be raided, said a senior officer.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Around 18 lakh BSNL subscribers in the districts could not use their mobile phones for more than six hours from Sunday afternoon because of a glitch.         
	Subscribers in Calcutta, barring some with prepaid connections, were not affected.        
	A problem in a mobile service station in Salt Lake was identified as the cause of the signal blackout, which started at 3.30pm and affected all BSNL mobile subscribers in the West Bengal circle. Services were not restored till late on Sunday.        
	There was a power problem in a major service station in Salt Lake as a result of which all connections in the West Bengal circle were disrupted, said a senior BSNL official.        
	According to company officials, power fluctuations damaged some equipment while others had to be shut down immediately. The power has been restored but it will take some time to switch on the equipment. We hope to restore the connections by tonight, added the official. Some pre-paid customers may have difficulty in making calls and sending messages. GPRS connectivity in some phones might also be affected, said another official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Buy-Buy: Whats in the festive bag
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Buy-Buy: Whats in the festive bag
          Calcutta does three things in the final countdown to Puja  shop, shop and shop. But what is Calcutta shopping for this time? Metro sifts through overflowing shopping bags and never-ending shopping lists as the last weekend before the festival sets in                                            
	CLOTHES        
	For Her: Short kurtis or tunics teamed with leggings. This is borrowed from the popularity of dresses this season. But Calcuttans who are shy of showing legs are giving it an Indo-western twist by teaming it with leggings to make it look like a churidar, says designer Agnimitra Paul. Think Deepika Padukone in Chor bazaari from Love Aaj Kal (picture below).        
	Mix-n-match works better than traditional salwar suits, says Manish Agarwal of Future Group, which owns Pantaloons. Experiments with sleeves is in. So be ready to see a variety of rolled-up sleeves next week.        
	Dont be surprised to see shorts and hot-pants. Over stockings or leggings for those who dont want to show skin, adds Agnimitra. Think Priyanka Chopra in Anjaana Anjaani (picture above).                  
	Lycra is the fabric of the season, say some New Market stores.        
	For a traditional twist, theres tangail or silks, but with an uncommon pattern. Nets are also in for the Bollywood touch, but with less bling and more hand-embroidery.              
	For Him: Casuals or dhoti.         
	Corduroys, cargoes, three-quarters, low-waist denims are in, says Navin Misra of Shoppers Stop. The traditional pick is the dhoti with a broad hand-painted or embroidered border, says Agnimitra. Bandhgalas and Jodhpurs also have takers.        
	TECH TOOLS                  
	High on the Puja shopping list this year. Usually home products start selling in the last leg of Puja shopping and continue till Diwali, but we have seen a 25 per cent growth in the sale of electronics goods over last year, said Agarwal of Pantaloons. Cameras and microwave ovens are the pop picks. We have seen a growth of 60 per cent over last Puja sales, said Pulkit Baid of Great Eastern Technocity. At the Imagine Apple Premium Reseller stores, along with the regular iPods, around six to eight pieces of the iPhone 3GS are being sold every week. Macbooks, iMacs and Magic Trackpad are other Apple hot buys.                  
	HOME DECOR        
	Upholstery and home linen were always Puja must-buys. This year furniture has joined the list. Modular and imported furniture are in demand as the buyer age profile dips. At Fabindia, real-wood cabinets, sofas and beds are most wanted in a pre-Puja exhibition.                  
	JEWELLERY        
	Gold and expensive pieces. Usually gold is bought for Diwali or Dhanteras,         
	but this time people are apprehensive that gold prices might shoot up further after Puja, so there is a rush now, said Bablu De of the Swarna Shilpa Bachao Committee. The diamond-studded loha at Anjali Jewellers is a pop pick.                  
	ACCESSORIES        
	For Her: Bright big bags and shoes. Big, shapeless bags in colours like red, green, yellow and purple in both shiny and matte finish are in, says Andaleeb Hashmi of Leather World in Metro Plaza. In shoes, gladiators, 5-inch heels or bright colours with big stone or Swarovski embellishments. Shoes that look like neckpieces, points out Akshat Kapur of Hamlyn.              
	For Him: Broad belts. Cufflinks too.                  
	CARS        
	This Puja, many will pandal hop in their brand-new Nanos with Tata Motors strategically announcing open sale from October 6. This is largely to capture the Puja rush, said Anil Bagaria of KB Motors, a Tata Motors dealership witnessing 15 to 20 walk-ins a day for Nano enquiries. The three variants are priced at 1.35 lakh, 1.61 lakh and 1.87 lakh.        
	Festive bestsellers are the Maruti Ritz and A-Star, the Hyundai i10, the Chevrolet Spark and Beat. The rise in September-October sales is 20 to 25 per cent, said a Maruti dealer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bottled stories
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bottled stories
                                              
	At Presidency College, I knew a man called Bhetki. He was of small build, with a beaming fish-like face and had also taken to country liquor like a fish to water.         
	He owned a small shop near Sanskrit College. In my three years, I never saw Bhetkis pigeon-holed shop contain anything but a sooty kettle and a broken pair of spectacles. Customers seldom stepped inside the store. He brought the kettle along when he visited his student friends inside the college. It contained the precious, amber-coloured liquid. He wore the spectacles only when he was suitably inebriated. It steadied his vision, he swore.         
	Bhetki was an institution. If one were to believe college lore, he was as old as the hallowed college. Some even attributed his brilliance to his association with the Derozians and the Young Bengal Movement. It was difficult to believe that a frail man, forever unsteady on his feet, could deserve such accolade.         
	Until one heard him speak, that is. Bhetki was a master raconteur. He mesmerised his young audience with stories and anecdotes of the college in a different time.        
	It was a delicious irony. A dishevelled man in perpetual penury was the only link to an institutions glorious past. Famous teachers and their equally brilliant wards flitted in and out of the tales he wove  Jagadish Chandra Bose, Meghnad Saha, Peary Charan Sarkar, Taraknath Sen, Sushobhon Sarkar, Bhabotosh Dutta, Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, Amartya Sen  Bhetki claimed to have known them all. One never felt like questioning his claims that straddled time and space, for some stories are meant to be enjoyed, if seldom believed.        
	Sometimes, sensing that the audience was thinning, Bhetki would bring out the best tales from his bag. These anecdotes were invariably related to the turbulent Seventies, when Presidency and much of Calcutta were in the throes of the Naxalite movement. One story had Bhetki as the hero. Apparently, during a police raid to catch Asim Chatterjee, famously known as Kaka, Bhetki had seen off a posse of policemen wielding his half-finished bottle like a rapier.         
	The policemen, as cops often do, fled, while Chatterjee escaped through a back-entrance. A hint of a giggle, and Bhetki threatened never to open his bag of tales. Thus, for a few painfully funny moments, one was forced to accept Bhetki as the knight and Chatterjee as the damsel in distress.        
	Bhetkis other abiding passion was literature. He swore that his knowledge of the classics was impressive. He knew most of Sunil Gangulys poems, and would recite them at the most inopportune moments. That was the signal for us to head for the lectures. But we students were in awe of Bhetkis encyclopaedic knowledge of the nooks and corners of College Street. Many afternoons, instead of attending lectures, we fell in file and followed our swaying general as he led us on a journey to discover the riches of College Street. We came to know and love many of its treasures: the dusty book shops, cool sherbets at Paramount and the piping hot kachuris at Puntiram.         
	But the colourful charm of Bhetkis stories faded as we stepped out into the grey world outside. I met Bhetki once, many years later, near Coffee House. He looked jaded, and more drunk than usual. He complained bitterly: the college gates were now closed for him, he had been branded an outsider. But what hurt him most was that none of the students seemed to have time for his stories.         
	Rashid, the Shah of Blah in Rushdies Haroun and the Sea of Stories, had once opened his mouth and heard a horrid barking sound. The stories, hundreds of them, had left him.         
	The times have changed. Even then, Bhetki has clung on to his magic tales. But he has none to tell them to.                           UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

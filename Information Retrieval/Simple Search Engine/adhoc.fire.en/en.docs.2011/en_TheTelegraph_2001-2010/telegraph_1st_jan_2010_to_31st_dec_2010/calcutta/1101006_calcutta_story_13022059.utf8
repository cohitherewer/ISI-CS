The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | French visa from town
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      French visa from town

	Calcuttans will soon have a second window to obtain a Schengen visa while travelling to Europe, with the French consulate office gearing up to throw open its visa section by the year-end.        
	We hope to move our consulate office to the new premises on Raja Santosh Road next month and our goal is to start issuing visas from the new office by end-December, Jrme Bonnafont, the French ambassador to India, said on Tuesday.        
	Now, the office of the German consulate-general on Hastings Park Road is the only European mission office in Calcutta fully-equipped to issue Schengen visas, while the Italian consulate issues visas in select cases. A Schengen visa allows the holder to travel freely within the 25 Schengen zone member states.        
	The French envoy expects his Calcutta consulate office to handle between 2,000 and 3,000 visa applications a year. The new visa window should encourage more people from this part of India to travel to France and the tourist as well as business traffic should increase, Bonnafont said.        
	There are approximately 50 French companies with some presence in eastern India, and the envoy felt this number could well grow if the government articulated its business and investment policy more emphatically and professionally.        
	Overseas enterprises will always have a herd mentality and flock together where they share a comfort level and where the business climate is conducive with good support infrastructure. Who is at the helm politically is secondary, its the policy and branding that matters, the ambassador stressed.        
	The state government has recently engaged brand guru Wally Olins to give Brand Bengal a boost.

	The middle-aged driver of a private bus suffered a heart attack at the wheel while fleeing after running over an elderly woman and died later.         
	Ranjit Singh Bhatia slammed the brakes of the bus on Sarat Bose Road, near Bhowanipore, after speeding away from the site of the fatal mishap near Gariahat on Sunday afternoon.         
	As Bhatia slumped over the steering, unconscious, passengers and pedestrians alerted police. The 54-year-old Jessore Road resident was admitted to Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, where he died in the evening.        
	A doctor said he had suffered a heart attack, probably caused by the shock of knocking down 70-year-old Chhabi Halder at the Jatin Bagchi Road-Rashbehari Avenue intersection, near Triangular Park, around 12.45pm.         
	Halder, a domestic help, was on her way home to a nearby slum. Witnesses said the bus, plying on route 3C/1 was not speeding and Bhatia did not flout traffic signals.        
	The woman should have waited for the signal to turn red before trying to cross the road, said a traffic policeman who was deployed at the crossing.         
	Bhatia stopped the bus after hitting the woman. Some pedestrians were trying to pull her out from under the vehicle when another group turned on the driver, who panicked and sped away, said witnesses.        
	Policemen and pedestrians both said Halder was crushed under the wheels when Bhatia tried to flee. She was taken to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival.        
	About 10 men, most of them neighbours of Halder, egged on by 40 others, went on the rampage at the accident site, setting three buses and a fire tender ablaze and damaged three other buses.        
	The buses burnt included two new ones purchased under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) for about Rs 20 lakh each. Another JNNURM bus was ransacked.        
	The men threw stones at buses before setting three of them on fire. When a fire engine reached the spot, the mob torched it, said a traffic policeman.        
	Six men were arrested on the charge of arson.        
	The mob also uprooted a pole on which traffic lights were installed. The police received a complaint that Rs 5,000 was stolen from a box in one of the damaged buses.         
	In the evening, residents of the area demonstrated in front of Gariahat police station, protesting the arrest of two youths in connection with the vandalism.

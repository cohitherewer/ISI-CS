The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cloud sign for wet weekend
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cloud sign for wet weekend
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A cloud cover and scattered rain brought relief to the city after Tuesdays scorcher even as the weatherman forecast a wetter weekend ahead.        
	The process of formation of the low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal, under the influence of the cyclonic circulation, is almost over. As a result, the atmosphere over south Bengal received more moisture on Wednesday, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The minimum humidity, which was around 20 per cent below normal at 54 per cent on Tuesday, rose to 62 per cent on Wednesday. The higher humidity induced the cloud cover and isolated showers in and around the city (0.4mm till 5.30pm on Wednesday).        
	The low humidity had made Tuesday the second hottest August day this decade.        
	According to Debnath, the cloud cover also blocked out the sun for several hours during the day, bringing the maximum temperature down from 36.2 degrees Celsius to 32.9 degrees Celsius, a degree above normal.        
	The low-pressure area is expected to be fully formed over the next 24 hours, he added.        
	An official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) raised hopes of a wet weekend: The low-pressure area would induce the formation of thunderclouds over south Bengal. Calcutta, in the latter half of this week, should receive heavier rain.

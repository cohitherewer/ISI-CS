	Eden Gardens, 3pm: The costliest seats in the house are empty. Each match ticket here comes for Rs 32,000, with a black kit comprising a badge, a dinner menu card, an after-party wrist band and a pen (to get an autograph with, one presumes). For this is meant to be more galaxy than gallery. Then, Gate 3 is opened but the galaxy of contention is still out of bounds. With 15 minutes to go, the photographers on the boundary line suddenly turn 180 degrees, tilt their cameras up and go click-click-click. They have spotted Katrina on the back of one of the red jerseys. Kat is the cue for we the 32K people. Welcome to the IPL Club Lounge!        
	3.57pm: The first ball is about to be bowled. Wheres Shah Rukh Khan? The KKR king had threatened to watch the match at his hotel if his throne at the gardens of Eden was not readied in time. But hey, theres wife Gauri with daughter Suhana. There he is! Shaking hands, waving, doing the thumbs up. The emperor in the shorn sheep haircut for his next film Ra.1 and in his new robes, purple and gold. Just hear the gasps, just see the gapes. The SRK show is on. Off he goes to the dugout, but he will be back. Soon.        
	4.06pm: If in IPL 1, Team SRK had taken over the right corner of the lower tier of the Club House, this year it is the left corner of the IPL Club Lounge. In the middle of the first over the KKR boss strides in with Brian Lara and Lalit Modi. In one smooth motion, he lifts an empty chair from Row 2 for Lara and the two settle down in the front row.        
	4.14pm: I want to see how Shah Rukh cheers, shouts a young girl from the back. Will he dance? wonders another. The 400-seat gallery is three-fourth full. And here the focus is as much SRK as KKR. But boys in the Club House upper tier are shouting Katrina! Katrina!. About a dozen seats away from Shah Rukh across enemy lines is the pretty lady in red, with the Royal Challengers Bangalore scion Siddharth Mallya for company.                        In the red-and-gold corner: Katrina Kaif gives Siddharth Mallya company as the pretty brand ambassador of the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL Club Lounge. Picture by Pabitra Das		     
	4.27pm: As the Angelo Mathews delivery crashes into the stumps sending Manish Pandey packing, Shah Rukh finally rises. To clap, not to dance. This is to be the SRK activity graph for the day: sitting tight, chatting with friends to his left and right, hands or foot on the white railing in front, shades on his eyes, red-bordered glasses held between the fingers of his left hand like a cigarette, occasionally rising to his feet for some restrained applause,         
	4.58pm: The Bangalore wickets may be tumbling but there is at least one bored KKR supporter. Little Suhana. Mom fusses with her hair, dad takes her on his lap.                    
	5.37pm: Ishant Sharma bowls the last ball to Kallis and Shah Rukh does a spontaneous thumbs up. He chats with his biographer and Om Shanti Om scriptwriter Mushtaq Shiekh. He is quietly confident about the KKR run chase. A quick dash follows to the lounge below to plant himself in front of an AC and puff away on a cigarette.        
	5.55pm: The suns gone but theres no respite from the energy-sapping humidity. SRK looks tired. But he can sniff a win as he shakes his head to Tonights gonna be a good night. (A long one too, with an after-party and a Manish Malhotra fashion show.)        
	6.04pm: Manoj Tiwarys first six brings SRK to his feet. The crowd chorus is going Hoo-Haa. In the red-and-gold camp Katrina fishes out her phone and goes into SMS mode. She is still smiling, though. (Her brief, after all, must be to look her best.)        
	6.42pm: Tiwarys exit and Souravs entry get a standing ovation from the team boss, who has a spring in his step after a mineral water splash of the face. The shoulders have also started moving, once to Korbo lorbo jeetbo, once to Deewangee deewangee. He moves about in the front row, has a word with Juhi Chawla.                        Gauri Khan leads the   KKR cheer. (Pabitra Das)		     
	6.57pm: The match is in the KKR bag, but the stadium commentator must keep up the tempo. Its still a tight game, he shouts. Yeh kya bol raha hai?! shouts back an incredulous Shah Rukh. Time for another smoking break. On his way out, he hugs Jeet, the only Tollywood man in the 32K gallery.        
	7.10pm: As Owais Shah strokes the winning run, theres no jig, no jubilation. Just a few warm hugs for friends, a few quick autographs for those who had paid a premium to watch the match with their hero. Ill be back on Tuesday, just to be near SRK, gushed a fan.

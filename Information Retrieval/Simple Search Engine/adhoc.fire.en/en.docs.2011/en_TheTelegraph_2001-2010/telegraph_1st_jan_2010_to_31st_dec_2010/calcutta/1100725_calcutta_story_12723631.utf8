The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | To catch the English reader
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      To catch the English reader
                              Rinita Mazumdar at the launch and the cover of Delhi Durbar with the money back promise                            
	The event was a little unusual. Anustup Publications, one of the longest surviving publishers of Bengali little magazines from College Street, launched an English academic text at Oxford Bookstore on Park Street on Friday.         
	Anustup, known to swim against the tide, now plans English publishing on a regular basis. Anil Acharya, founder- member of Anustup, explained his decision to publish in English: If a sizeable segment of the readership now is reading only in English, it is prudent to address that segment.         
	For a little magazine that has managed to survive for more than 45 years, Anustup surprised with its launch function on Park Street. There were many contradictions: Acharya began his speech referring to the 90-year-old bookstore as a bourgeois, elite place, something Anustup was not used to. The split level at the boutique bookstore was filled with economists and philosophy teachers from Jadavpur University and Calcutta University, a change from the usual crowd of Calcuttas well-heeled. Present were Soureen Bhattacharya, a former economics professor of Jadavpur University, Achiranshu Acharya from Visva-Bharati and Calcutta Universitys Rabindranath Bhattacharya to listen to Rinita Mazumdars work, titled Feminist Economics.         
	Missing from the audience was author Nabaneeta Dev Sen, who was to preside over the function.         
	The author, who holds a PhD in philosophy from the University of Masschusettes at Amherst, said: I have tried to understand the contribution of women in the growth of a country. I have tried to analyse gender inequality, womens rights and such issues. Rinita thought Oxford Bookstore gave her the right platform to launch my work.         
	Money back                  
	Get your money back on the book you just purchased! Hachette India is the first publisher to offer a money-back Publishers Promise on select titles for a limited period of time.         
	This is how it works. If one bought a Hachette India title, for example, Krishan Pratap Singhs Delhi Durbar, and didnt like the book, he could go to the bookshop from where the book was purchased and return it along with the sales receipt. Hatchette India promises to give his money back!         
	Of course, all promises come with riders. The offer is valid only for two months from the date of release of the book. So the Delhi Durbar that was released in March 2010 cannot be exchanged now for money since the offer has lapsed in April! The offer is also not valid on all Hatchette books. They make the offer only on a few titles which we are confident that readers will definitely like, says Anurima Roy, publicity officer of Hatchette India. Roy said not one Delhi Durbar copy had been returned. Another source said that 11 copies were returned. Thats not too bad either, is it, given Indias vast English-reading population?

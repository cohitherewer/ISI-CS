	One of the citys most-awaited events on the music calendar is back to rock you with all that jazz.        
	Traditional jazz fused with rock, pop, funk and ethnic along with an exhibition on German jazz history  thats what the Congo Square Jazz Festival 2010, in association with t2, promises in its eighth edition.         
	The jazz jamboree on the Dalhousie Institute lawns, from November 24 to 27, is set to showcase 10 bands from Germany, Mexico, France, Austria and the US, apart from a selection of homegrown musical talents.         
	Our focus is to feature musicians and bands who are exceptionally good, but whose music isnt easily available in the country. Some of the bands to watch out for are K3, Tere Estrada and the Alex Stuart quartet, who are touring India for the first time, said festival co-ordinator Kalyan Kamal Roy.        
	A part of the badminton court at the Dalhousie Institute is to be used for the exhibition of photographs with anecdotal references to the great traditions of German jazz. The Goethe-Institut will also set up listening posts with earphones to give visitors an audio experience of the German masters.         
	The festival will open with a gig by city-based Kendraka, who will unveil their first album Tathastu before playing their brand of jazz-based fusion with a touch of Indian folk and classical.                                 
	Next up will be French band Yapa, a big name on the underground circuit.        
	 Day Two will feature guitarist Alex Stuart from Australia, who now lives and performs in Paris with his troupe.         
	The second half will showcase an experimental Indo-German project called Lusher that will see the director of the Goethe-Institut (Calcutta), Reimar Volker, in a musical avatar. Reimer will play the saxophone, accompanied by Nondon Bagchi, Tobias Rosch from Berlin and Debabrata Mitra on drums.         
	Three On a Swing that debuted at the Congo Square festival three years ago will open Day 3 with Pradyumna Singh Manot on piano, Sumith Ramachandran on guitar and Jivraj Singh on drums. The trio will play everything from bebop and blues to modal jazz  made famous in the Sixties by John Coltrane and Miles Davis  using modes and scales instead of chord progressions. Were playing some exciting jazz and hope people come and listen, Pradyumna told Metro.         
	K3 of Austria will take the stage next with a genre-defying style in acoustic and electronica. Joining them will be Ranajit Sengupta on sarod.

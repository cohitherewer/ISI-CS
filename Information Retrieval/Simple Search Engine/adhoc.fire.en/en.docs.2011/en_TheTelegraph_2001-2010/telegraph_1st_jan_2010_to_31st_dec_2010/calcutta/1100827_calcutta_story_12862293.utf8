The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bit of Bolly balm on dance floor
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bit of Bolly balm on dance floor
  - Lack of hits and less party time get city grooving to beats old and new          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                                                  
	Le Zandu balm hui, darling tere liye        
	Malaika Arora Khan may or may not ease Salman Khans pain in September release Dabangg but the song she is grooving to is proving to be the right balm for Calcuttas Bolly-starved party people on the dance floor.        
	There have been no big Bolly tracks in recent weeks. The favourites on the floor are Gal meethi meethi bol from Aisha and Munni badnaam hui le Zandu balm hui..., says DJ Girish D of Shisha.        
	But the console keepers are not losing sleep over the Bolly drought. Ever since the curfew clock has been set early at 1.45am, we can play just the top few on the Bolly charts and then throw in some hip-hop, house and also experiment with some new sounds, says Girish.        
	Time is minimum now, agrees DJ Kunal of Venom. Earlier, we would wait till past 1am to play the best Bolly tracks. Now, the peak time is around midnight, which is when we play the Munni badnaam hui track. With three hours of actual party time (down from five hours before Cinderella time struck) I would say Bollywood takes up only an hour.        
	That one hour of Bolly beats also comprises older tracks and remakes, from Uff teri ada (Karthik Calling Karthik) to the remake Chura liya from DJ Aqeels album Forever (see box).        
	Calcutta is using this Bolly lull to get used to new notes. Commercial, house and hip-hop are doing well. Akons Nosy Neighbour, Enriques I Like It, David Guettas One Love and even Lady Gaga are keeping the party going, says DJ Devaa of Plush, making the most of a shrunken playlist.        
	The change is welcome for some. There was far too much Bolly. The last few weeks have been refreshing with more hip-hop, house and techno, feels party regular Abhishek Sharma, 27.        
	And if thats not music to your ears, theres always Zandu balm to rub it right.

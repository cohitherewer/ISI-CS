                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Verdict restores faith
          ZEESHAN JAWED                       Pramod Sharma at his tea-and-snacks shop in Burrabazar on Thursday. The tiny shop was such a stumbling block for Haldiram rsquo;s Prabhu Shankar Agarwal that he had hired goons to kill Sharma rsquo;s uncle. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                          
	In a striped shirt with a tika on his forehead, dishing out tea and kachori, Pramod Sharma barely had the time to look up, let alone rejoice.        
	For it was more than business as usual on Thursday afternoon with many flocking to the nondescript shop to catch a glimpse of the 26-year-old who had fought and won against the might of Haldiram.        
	Today, close to five years after taking a bullet in his thigh from goons hired by Prabhu Shankar Agarwal, Pramod is the unlikely David of Burrabazar, having stood up to a Goliath.        
	The bullet meant for his uncle Satyanarayan Thakur on March 30, 2005, had struck his left thigh, forcing Pramod to spend almost 40 days in hospital and one year with a limp. Wednesdays verdict pronouncing the bhujia king guilty has eased some of the pain and brought back a smile.        
	The conviction of Prabhu Shankar Agarwal and his four associates has restored our belief in the system of justice, smiled Sharma, while taking down yet another order for chai and samosa, in his 60-70sq ft shop, barely 10 metres from a bustling Haldiram outlet.        
	The tea shop at T8/1/4A Jagmohan Mullick Lane  with walls adorned by gods and goddesses  proved such a stumbling block for Agarwals expansion plans that he hired Burrabazars notorious sharp shooter Gopal Tiwari.        
	We were fighting a case with Prabhuji since 1996 because he wanted us to vacate this shop and make way for a multi-storeyed building. First he offered us Rs 4 lakh, but we told him clearly that we would not give up this shop on which our entire family, of almost 50 members, was dependent. Then he started threatening my uncle, recounted Pramod.        
	It was Satyanarayan Thakur that Gopal Tiwari and his goons had come looking for that March morning. I was dozing on a chowki outside my shop, when suddenly someone yanked off my chaddar. I saw two men and a pistol and dived under the chowki. The first bullet missed me and I started running. They fired again and this time the bullet hit my left thigh, but I kept running. They fired again but I escaped. The two goons then ran towards a car parked just opposite Haldiram.        
	On Wednesday, as soon as Pramod heard the news of Agarwals conviction and arrest, he called up his uncle, now recovering from a kidney ailment in Varanasi.        
	The shabby tea stall and the swank Haldirams outlet now await Fridays sentence, with conflicting prayers to the deities on the respective walls.

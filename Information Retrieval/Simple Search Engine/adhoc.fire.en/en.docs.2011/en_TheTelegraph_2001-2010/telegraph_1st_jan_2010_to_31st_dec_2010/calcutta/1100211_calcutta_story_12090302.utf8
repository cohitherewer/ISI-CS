                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Return of the Shaitan maker
          MOHUA DAS                          Glen Peters with his wife at a city hotel. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Glen Peters was back to where it had all started  the city where he had based his debut detective novel, Mrs DSilvas Detective Instincts and the Shaitan of Calcutta  for a short holiday with wife Brenda Squires, a psychotherapist who writes historical fiction.         
	The idea (for Mrs DSilvas...) came to me a couple of years ago. It was about something I had experienced when I was 10 and out on a picnic in Bandel, said the former student of Don Bosco Liluah. Peters grew up in the railway colony in Liluah before leaving for England aged 16.         
	I had wandered off to a shrine next to the river and stumbled upon the decomposed body of a young woman. I couldnt take that sight out of my mind afterwards. At 10, you dont know if its your fault or if youd be held guilty for it. I would think of various possibilities of how she might have ended up there and thats how I started writing crime fiction, he explained.         
	Set in the Anglo-Indian community during the Sixties, the novel also touches upon characters and places associated with the Chinese community in Calcutta.         
	The protagonist is a single mother in her 30s  Joan DSilva. Shes an Anglo-Indian schoolteacher who gets involved in the bureaucracy and develops a sense of justice and the need to find out the truth, said Peters.         
	He has already penned the sequel, where Mrs DSilva solves a mystery set in a Lucknow factory.         
	Ill write another one based somewhere in India to complete the trilogy, smiled Peters, who works at PricewaterhouseCoopers in London and has a country house in Wales.         
	Peters, who was a witness to the Naxalite movement as a child, recalled how bus burning and political strikes got assimilated into his life as a schoolkid.         
	Thats why I decided to make one of the characters in my debut novel an initiator of the Naxalite movement, says Peters, who wrote a handful of management books before trying his hand at fiction.         
	Peters, who insists on being known as an Anglo-Indian writer, said he felt it was important to highlight the community, which was in a state of transition in the Sixties because it served the Empire and has changed now.         
	He said many of his readers in Britain had found an interesting piece of history in his book. I hope I can bring the book out in India soon, he added.        
	Back in Calcutta after three years, Peters rued that the fantastic old architectural assets are not being leveraged. I wonder why these buildings arent made available to investors who can recondition and rebuild them.

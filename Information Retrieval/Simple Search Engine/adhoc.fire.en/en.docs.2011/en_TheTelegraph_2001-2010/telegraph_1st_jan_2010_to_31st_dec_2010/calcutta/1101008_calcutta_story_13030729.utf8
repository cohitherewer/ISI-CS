The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Awards with a cause that care for a smile
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Awards with a cause that care for a smile
										            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	On Mahalaya-eve, with hours to go for Devipaksha (the divine fortnight) to set in, the stage was set for another annual celebration.        
	In its eighth year, CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja (TSP) has become synonymous with revelry with an eye on making the festival safe, happy and meaningful for all.        
	About 200 community pujas have long pledged themselves to the cause of keeping Calcutta clean and chaos-free during the festive days and to lend a helping hand to the disadvantaged even after the dhak has ceased to beat.        
	More than 700 applications poured in this autumn, necessitating a round of vetting. Members of close to 100 puja committees turned up at Spring Club on Wednesday evening seeking to join the True Spirit movement for the first time.        
	As the must-have conditions  fire and electric safety, waste management, crowd and traffic management, legal sourcing of electricity, first-aid provisions, no to forced subscription and proper display of TSP signage  appeared on the screen during the introductory presentation, Shankar Sarkar, the secretary of Ramesh Dutta Sarbojanin Puja, wore a relieved look.        
	All other contests ask for bright lights, big idols and grand pandals. We cannot afford those things. We are a small puja in Rambagan, where the smile of the children from the nearby red-light district is our brightest illumination. The parameters of True Spirit Puja are such that we can fight it out with big-budget organisers on a level playing field, he said.        
	The representatives of Baje Shibpur Shibtala Saradotsab had quite a tale to tell. The men of our locality have handed over the reins for three years now. Bhog distribution to sandhi puja  everything is organised by the women. We take as much care in arranging for saris and medicines for the underprivileged, said Banashree Khan.         
	For other debutants, TSP is a learning curve. Youngsters Anuj Parashramka, Tanmoy Mukherjee and Ashish Gupta had come from New Alipur Sarbojanin Durgotsab. We are new to organising Durga puja. So we have come to seek guidance from this forum, said Gupta, keen to reduce his pujas carbon footprint.        
	For Behala Young Mens Association, it was a fitting return to the TSP fold after a four-year break. Our theme is Durga puja initiatives in civil society, with the likes of waste management and water conservation being showcased. We were a Two Star winner in 2006. We hope to better that, said puja president P.K. Mishra.        
	All eyes will be on the Model Puja crown, saluted with Rs 50,000 to be spent on social projects (picture above shows Model Puja 2009, Mitali of Kankurgachhi). There are Five Star, Four Star, Three Star and Two Star honours to be won, plus the Puja that Cares and True to Tradition titles.        
	TSP 2010 is partnered by CESC, Calcutta police, West Bengal Fire Services, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Pollution Control Board, The Bengal and others.

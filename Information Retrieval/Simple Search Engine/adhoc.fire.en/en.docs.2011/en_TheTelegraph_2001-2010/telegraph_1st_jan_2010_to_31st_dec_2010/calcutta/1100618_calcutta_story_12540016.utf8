The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blockades hit Bypass traffic
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Blockades hit Bypass traffic
          A STAFF REPORTER                           The chaos at the Park Circus seven-point crossing on Thursday afternoon. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Neha Kejriwal, 33, was in for a shock when she saw a crowd blocking the Darga Road and Park Circus connector with barricades used by traffic police on Thursday.        
	Nobody knew what was happening. People were scared and confused, recounted the homemaker from Kankurgachhi, who was on her way to Park Circus to fetch her son from Don Bosco School.        
	Kejriwal was not the only one to be caught in the mid-day chaos triggered by blockades  at the Park Circus seven-point crossing, below the footbridge on the Park Circus connector and the Topsia crossing  that continued for close to two-and-a-half hours.        
	According to a sergeant on duty, the back-to-back blockades by nearly 500 protesters over a disputed institution threw traffic out of gear from the EM Bypass to Park Circus and beyond.        
	Students of the junior and middle sections of schools located within a radius of one km of the Bypass connector bore the brunt of the snarls. Classes in most of these schools give over between 11am and 1pm.        
	In the past one hour, my car has not moved an inch. Why dont these people realise the harassment they are subjecting us to for no fault of ours? wondered Shibaji Roy, en route to his Beleghata home after picking up his son from South Point School.        
	With bridge number 4 cut off, cops diverted traffic from Parama Island towards Ruby General Hospital, while Bypass-bound traffic was diverted along Suhrawardy Avenue and Sundari Mohan Avenue towards Phillips Island.        
	The impact was felt as far as Moulali and Creek Row as movement of all south-bound vehicles from Entally was restricted and vehicles were forced to take AJC Bose Road, said a sergeant.        
	East-bound traffic from the AJC Bose Road flyover also came to a grinding halt along with both Sealdah and Gariahat-bound traffic.         
	Motorists were advised to avoid the seven-point crossing, Mullickbazar and the Park Street-AJC Bose Road crossing through electronic message boards and bulk SMS.

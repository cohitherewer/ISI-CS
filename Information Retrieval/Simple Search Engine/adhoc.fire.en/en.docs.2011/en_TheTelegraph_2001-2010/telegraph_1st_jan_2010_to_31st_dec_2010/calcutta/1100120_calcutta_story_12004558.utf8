The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chaos for Basu, quiet for Mother
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Chaos for Basu, quiet for Mother
                              Mothers body being taken to St Thomass Church                            
	Usha Uthup, a follower of Mother Teresa and an admirer of Jyoti Basu, tells Metro why the two final journeys were so different.              
	Jyotibabus funeral today was more about contrasts than comparisons for me when I remember Mother Teresas. Yes, both were massive and the turnout was unbelievable. There was mass hysteria today which was there during Mothers time as well but the places where she was kept  both Netaji Indoor Stadium and St Thomass Church at Loreto Convent, were far more disciplined.        
	I dont know if its because she was a spiritual head, but there was more sanctity. I was like a zombie when Mother died and all the four days she was kept at Loreto, I was there. There were streams of people pouring in every day the rich, the poor, people from different faiths but there was discipline. There were so many foreign guests as well but there wasnt a glitch.        
	I was there singing and looking after the sound while so many others came and sang. It was a different kind of a scale spread over so many days. What a huge thronging of humanity but it wasnt hysterical. One had to come in at a particular time and follow certain decorum. There was something very international about the way things were arranged. Everyone came and paid respect. There was no screaming and shouting.         
	The frenzy to see Jyotibabu today assumed hysterical proportions. Things were really not in order. The stampede, the fright and the fear made it very different.         
	Once when I was in front of him, it was nice and beautiful even though by then, the hysteria had robbed the situation of its gravity. There should be dignity in death.

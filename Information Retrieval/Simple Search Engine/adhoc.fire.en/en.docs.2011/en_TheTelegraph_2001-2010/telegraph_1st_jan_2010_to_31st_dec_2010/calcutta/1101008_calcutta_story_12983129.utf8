The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Look back at she the martyr
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Look back at she the martyr
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                          Pritilata Wadder                                   
	What made a 22-year-old woman take her life after leading her team to a successful venture? Seventy-eight autumns from the day Pritilata Wadder took cyanide after an armed raid on the European Club in Pahartali, Chittagong  that killed one woman and injured 11 people  the question rent the air at Bethune College, where she was once a student.        
	The college was hosting a seminar to mark the birth centenary of Pritilata, who was the first, and perhaps the only, woman martyr since the Rani of Jhansi.        
	Womens role in society was restricted to the home and hearth. Even when they joined the freedom movement... they were to wield the charka, weave khaddar, help in hiding documents and cook for male comrades..., Malini Bhattacharya, the chairperson of the state womens commission, said.        
	Agreed Manini Chatterjee of The Telegraph. Masterda (Surya Sen, who steered the armed rebellion against the British in Chittagong) allowed women to join the movement because of tactical compulsions when the top leadership went behind bars or underground. Ideologically, he was opposed to it, said the author of Do and Die: The Chittagong Uprising 1930-34.        
	Pritilatas end raises many questions. Chatterjee, who has an insiders perspective as the daughter-in-law of Pritilatas friend and comrade Kalpana Joshi (nee Dutta), said Masterda had told Kalpana that Priti had insisted on suicide to show our people that women too can fight and die for their country, for their menfolk.        
	During the Puja holidays of 1930, Kalpana and Priti were debating if either could slaughter a goat. Priti said she could not kill an innocent creature. So how could she be an armed revolutionary? When I am ready to give my own life for the countrys freedom, I wont hesitate a bit in taking somebody elses life, too, she said.        
	On September 24, 1932, she did both. Perhaps it is this end that lends such an aura to her persona. Who knows how she would have been remembered had she lived on till a doddering old age? Chatterjee wondered.

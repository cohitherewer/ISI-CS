The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Marks of 10,000 revised
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Marks of 10,000 revised
  - One-fourth HS applicants gain or lose, examiners called          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	The faults in the higher secondary (HS) evaluation system came into sharp focus on Monday with the marks of around 25 per cent students who had applied for a review being altered.        
	The revelation  following the first season of review in HS  prompted the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education authorities to announce that the examiners found guilty of negligence in checking answer scripts would face stern action.        
	If the marks change for around 25 per cent of the total applicants for review, it clearly indicates that the evaluation has not been up to the mark. Teachers responsible for causing such inconvenience to the students will have to be answerable for not having examined the scripts properly, said Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, the councils president.        
	According to records available with the council, marks obtained by over 10,000 students  out of over 40,000 review applicants  have been revised. Board sources told Metro that the glitches in marking were spotted across science, arts and commerce.         
	The marks of many students have changed significantly after the review. For many the marks have increased. There are others whose marks have decreased after the review. We are concerned with both the trends, said Adhikari.        
	In a bid to avoid the embarrassment of review results and send out a strong signal, the council has decided to summon all the examiners whose evaluation of answer scripts was found error-prone and show them the reviewed answer scripts. They will have to explain why the students had not been awarded the correct marks, said a source.         
	The council has introduced the system of reviewing answer scripts from the current year. Students earlier applied for post-publication scrutiny, a system by which the council only checked that all the answers had been examined and the calculation of total marks was correct.        
	It is not possible to blacklist examiners who do not examine the answer scripts properly because there is an acute shortage of examiners. The idea behind introduction of a review system is to make the examiners more cautious, said a council official.        
	Most students whose marks have increased following the review will not benefit in the short run as their college admissions were governed by the original marks.

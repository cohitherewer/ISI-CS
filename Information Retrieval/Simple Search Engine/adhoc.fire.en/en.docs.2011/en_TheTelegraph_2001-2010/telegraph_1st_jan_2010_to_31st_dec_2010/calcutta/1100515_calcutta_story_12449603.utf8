The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Accident haunts kids
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Accident haunts kids

	Thursdays mishap on BT Road has left the two schoolboys who were injured with mental scars deeper than the physical ones.         
	Arkaprabha Banik of Class II and Somnath Roy of Class IV received stitches on their heads after a private bus carrying 23 students of Ramakrishna Mission Centenary Primary School rammed into a divider and a mini-van.        
	My son is mischievous but has been quiet since the accident. He refused to speak till late on Thursday and only said bhalo lagche na (I am not feeling well) after that, Arkaprabhas mother Soma recounted.         
	She saw him shudder in his sleep. It could have been a nightmare or he might have been writhing in pain, said Soma.         
	On Friday, the mishap was what the child, who had received eight stitches, kept thinking about. It seemed 10 bombs had gone off at once, he told Metro.        
	When I saw the bus, I did not know how to react. I could have lost my son, said Arkaprabhas father Subrata.        
	The boy is also worried about his examinations in mid-June. He asked me how he would write the exam with his head bandaged, said Soma. A diligent student, Arkaprabha had ranked third in the Class I final exam.        
	Somnath, who escaped with two stitches, is also struggling to put the mishap behind.         
	The windscreen of the bus was smashed. My shirt was covered in blood and Arkaprabha was bleeding even more profusely. I was very afraid. I hope it never happens again, recounted Somnath.        
	His parents have decided to take him to school for now. He was trying to avoid talking about the accident. He has not yet told me what had exactly happened yesterday, said Somnaths mother Shipra.        
	Given how young the boys are, it is natural that they are traumatised. They would need time and support from peers and parents to get over the incident, said Tapashi Mitra, a psychologist at the Institute of Child Health.

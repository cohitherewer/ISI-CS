	BSNL launched live television on cellphone and other 3G video services in the city on Friday.        
	Thirty-two channels are currently part of the BSNL bouquet with many popular ones missing. The company plans to add channels in future.         
	Only about half of Calcutta is currently covered by the companys 3G network. BSNL expects to cover the entire city by July this year.         
	To watch a channel, a subscriber does not need GPRS. He or she will just have to key in the channel code and press the call button, said A.K. Garg, the chief general manager of Calcutta Telephones.        
	The charge will be Rs 5 per minute for BSNL 3G subscribers. Video calls and video conferencing are the other 3G services launched on Friday.        
	Many BSNL subscribers with 3G SIM cards complain that they fail to make even normal phone calls from places where there is no 3G connectivity.         
	The BSNL bosses said the situation was improving and the connectivity would soon be seamless.

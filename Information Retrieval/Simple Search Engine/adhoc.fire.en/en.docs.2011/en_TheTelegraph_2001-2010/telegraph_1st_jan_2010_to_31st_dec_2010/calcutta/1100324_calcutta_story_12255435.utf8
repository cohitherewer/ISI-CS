                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      45 holders and an official trustee
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          Stephen Court in 1984, when the top two floors of the Park Street icon were added. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Whoever owns the building must be punished, fumed Somini Sen Dua, the owner of an office on the first floor of Stephen Court, minutes after managing to save herself from the menacing blaze.         
	But catching the culprit and pinning blame may not be all that easy.         
	According to civic records, there are as many as 45 apportioned share holders of the building, with addresses ranging from 18-A to 18-M. Interestingly, there is No. 18-I. The official trustee of the building is someone named P.C.E. Paul.         
	Some residents said that they had never seen the owner. There is a middleman  Kishanji  who is supposed to run the show but does nothing at all. At night, there are taxis parked near the building. Apparently, he owns them, said Sen Dua.                        The fire engulfs the top three floors of Stephen Courts eastern side on Tuesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal      
	Stephen Court, approximately 80 years old, has been declared a grade-II heritage building by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) for its architectural value. According to norms, no addition or alteration is allowed on the main structure of heritage grade-II buildings but a new construction on vacant land on the same campus is allowed if it is architecturally compatible with the original building.        
	CMC officials said the total amount of outstanding civic property tax from 21 assessees of the building had crossed Rs 93 lakh.        
	We will start pulling down the unsafe parts of the building only after the forensic team collects all necessary samples, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	Those who rushed inside Stephen Court to rescue people on Tuesday afternoon said that they were initially stumped by the maze-like interiors of the building, which comprises four interconnected blocks. There is one lift for each block.         
	A resident said the occupants till the fourth floor were tenants, while flats on the top two floors have been leased out. The top two floors were added in 1984 and have 32 apartments.         
	The building houses hundreds of offices and commercial establishments. From beauty parlours to computer training centres and stock broking firms to a heavy engineering companys office... theres a bit of everything at Stephen Court.         
	In the middle of the four blocks of Stephen Court is a courtyard that doubles as a parking space. On Tuesday afternoon, it became a resting place for tired policemen and fatigued fire-fighters.

	The city zoos newest guest kept its most seasoned hands on their feet on Tuesday.         
	The centre of attention on the Alipore premises was a four-month-old elephant calf, deserted by her herd a day after she strayed from it on the banks of the Subarnarekha.        
	Some villagers, angry with the herd for the damage it inflicted on crops, had tortured the baby on Sunday. She was reunited with the herd later that day but the other elephants, including her mother, refused to let her return to the fold.        
	Forest department officials rescued the calf at Danton, West Midnapore. She travelled over four hours in a mini-van to reach the zoo on Tuesday morning.        
	After government veterinary surgeon S.K. Ghosh checked her for illness and injury, mahout Muhammad Sanir and his team got busy trying to make her feel at home. She was scared and morose but started feeling better after naps and baby food, said Sanir.        
	The calf is being fed 1-1.5 litres of baby food mixed with minerals, vitamins and a digestive every two hours. Her new home is a 30m x 25m enclosure with a bed of straw and a tarpaulin sheet on the roof.        
	Shes small and weighs only about 100kg, said Ghosh, whos been monitoring the calfs condition every two hours. Apart from a bruise on her back, she isnt carrying any major injury or illness. However, the next few months are critical as she needs her mothers milk and care, he added.        
	Visitors will not be allowed to see her. We will take care of her till further instructions from the forest department, said S. Bhattacharya, the assistant director of the zoo.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Winners duel and a dark horse
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Winners duel and a dark horse
										      Civic Poll 2010                          
	ward war  
	 Ward: 88  
	 Location: Between Rashbehari Avenue in the north and Budge Budge rail bridge in the south, and SP Mukherjee Road in the east and Tollys Nullah in the west         
	 Area: 1.5sq km (approx)        
	 Population: About 50,000        
	 Voters: 22,251        
	 Major civic problem: Drinking water shortage in parts of the ward        
	 Battle basics: Theres a saying that Congress candidate Mala Roy, wife of party leader Nirbed Roy, cannot lose a Calcutta Municipal Corporation election. She won the last three elections in the ward representing three parties. The script, however, could be different this time with Trinamul fielding a five-time councillor and the CPM too confident of a strong showing.                        
	Name: Sanjib Ganguly        
	Party: CPM        
	Age: 49        
	Educational qualification: BA, LlB        
	Occupation: Advocate        
	Election experience: Is contesting civic elections for the first time. He was involved in student politics and had campaigned for two-time councillor Swadesranjan Das.        
	Agenda: To improve the quality of life of slum dwellers, who constitute 40 per cent of the areas population. He also wants to improve educational facilities for the underprivileged and form self-help groups for them.         
	On his opponents: For 15 years, Mala Roy has done nothing for the ward. Even Mysore park, which she claims to have built, has turned into her garage, said Ganguly, known as Rana in the locality.        
	Trinamul has always fared poorly in this ward. Anup Chatterjee is a poll veteran but he is an outsider. The Trinamul-Congress vote split would prove a boon for us, added Ganguly.        
	Voters voice: We need more public toilets and proper sanitation facilities in our area but the sitting councillor has not done anything. Ganguly promises to solve our problems but we understand that all politicians are the same, said Rajen Maiti, a rickshaw-puller who lives in a shanty in the area.        
	Least likely to do: Park his campaign vehicle in Mysore park.                  
	Name: Mala Roy, sitting councillor        
	Party: Congress        
	Age: 53        
	Educational Qualification: BA        
	Occupation: Printing business and social work         
	Election experience: In 1995, she contested on a Congress ticket and won by 576 votes. In 2000, Roy beat CPM candidate Swadesranjan Das by 3,205 votes contesting on a Trinamul ticket. In 2005, she represented the Nationalist Congress Party and defeated CPMs Utpal Kumar Ganguly by 673 votes and Trinamuls Kakali Ghosh Dastidar by 1,900 votes.        
	Agenda: To complete projects for the improvement of roads and parks and solve the water problem in the area.        
	On her opponents: Chatterjee may have won elsewhere but this ward belongs to me. Chatterjee, along with his leader Mamata Banerjee, had tried to malign me last time but that did not help. There is a loyal CPM vote bank in the area. But I am confident that my people will re-elect me, said Roy.        
	Voters voice: Mala has improved the parks and roads and installed street lights. She is helpful, said Amiya Dutta, a retired bank employee.        
	Least likely to do: Print Trinamul leaflets in her printing press.                      
	Name: Anup Chatterjee        
	Party: Trinamul Congress        
	Age: 55        
	Educational qualification: BCom         
	Occupation: Business        
	Election experience: Won five consecutive times from a neighbouring ward (84), where he lives. Contested from 1985 to 1995 on Congress tickets. Has represented Trinamul since.        
	Agenda: Slum development and solving the drinking water problem.        
	On his opponents: Roy developed the already developed areas and did not pay attention to those living near the Adi Ganga. She won elections using her husband Nirbed Roys name. As for Ganguly, people have rejected the CPM and all those who represent the party will lose, said Chatterjee.         
	Voters voice: I have been seeing Chatterjee for the past few days. He is an outsider but I have heard that he has done wonders for his own ward. I am in two minds, smiled Jaya Bhattacharya, a 59-year-old homemaker.        
	Least likely to do: Praise Pranab Mukherjee within Mamatas earshot.       Text: Tamaghna Banerjee

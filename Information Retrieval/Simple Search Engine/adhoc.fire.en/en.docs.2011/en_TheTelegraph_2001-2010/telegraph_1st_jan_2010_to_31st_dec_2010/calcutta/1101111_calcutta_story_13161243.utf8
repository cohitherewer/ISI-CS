          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday directed the police officer probing the Stephen Court blaze to state whether he had identified the persons responsible for turning the Park Street landmark into a tinderbox.        
	The bench of Chief Justice J.N. Patel and Justice Asim Roy also wanted to know whether the probe had zeroed in on the persons who had allowed the Stephen Court occupants to get electricity connection without the fire departments clearance and whether the suspects had been arrested.        
	The officer will have to reply to the questions and state other details of the probe in an affidavit to be submitted within a fortnight.        
	The bench raised the queries while hearing the bail petitions of Sushil Sureka, Pradip More and Sanjay Bagaria  the directors of Stephen Court Ltd, which is responsible for the upkeep of the building.        
	The trio got their interim bail extended, though the bench did not grant their plea for confirmation of the bail.        
	The directors are responsible for using electricity without the fire departments approval, the public prosecutor said while opposing the trios prayer.

                      India through Western eyes                                    Indias spectacular architecture, the immense natural beauty of her landscapes and the great diversity of its people have inspired many Western artists. The first visual representations of India were of imaginary landscapes and settings. They were based on the written accounts of travellers to India from across Europe, beginning with the explorer Marco Polo in the 13th century. The search for spices and precious materials motivated further exploration and the establishment of European trading companies in Asia. The trading activities of the English East India Company, founded in 1600, led to the growth of British communities in India, an environment which encouraged artistic patronage. Professional European artists began to travel to India in the 18th century and painted, for the first time, scenes based on direct observation. Their passionate interest in this new and exciting land led to the creation of a comprehensive pictorial record of India, in a visual style familiar to Western audiences. Indian Life and Landscape by Western Artists: Paintings and Drawings from the V amp;A, 1790-1927, the ongoing art exhibition, features masterpieces of art created during this time; priceless works that bear silent testimony to a bygone era. Hosted by The Victoria Memorial Hall and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London and supported by the World Collections Programme.

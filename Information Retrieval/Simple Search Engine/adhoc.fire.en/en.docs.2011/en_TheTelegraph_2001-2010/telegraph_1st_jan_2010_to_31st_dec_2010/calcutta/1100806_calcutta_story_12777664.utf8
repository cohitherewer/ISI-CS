The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Push for safe idol paints
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Push for safe idol paints
          JAYANTA BASU                              
	Kumartuli artisans have agreed to use lead-free colours to paint idols in the coming festive season provided the non-toxic dyes make the grade in workshops.        
	The condition set at a meeting on Thursday prompted the representatives of five paint companies to announce that they would organise two workshops where the artisans can verify whether lead-free paints are as good as the traditional ones.        
	Representatives of the Forum for Durgotsav, an association of puja organisers, and members of a government committee set up to study the impact of lead on public health also attended the meeting.        
	We expressed our fear that lead-free paints would not lend the same gloss to the idols as the conventional ones, said Babu Pal, the secretary of an idol-makers association in Kumartuli.        
	If the results at the workshops are satisfactory, many artisans may switch to lead-free paints. I hope a few hundred idols would be painted with such colours this year.        
	Last year, only 30 idols had been painted with lead-free colours. Nemai Pal, an artisan, said: We have asked for shades of yellow, red, orange, white, black, brown, green and blue for the workshops.        
	Partha Ghosh, the vice-president of Shivmandir Puja Committee, who attended the meeting, said: I feel at least 50 members of our association will agree to the use of lead-free paints. The marginal rise in cost resulting from the switch wont be an issue.         
	Krishnajyoti Goswami, a member of the government committee, feels the best part of the days deliberations was that the artisans had vouched for non-toxic paints on health grounds.

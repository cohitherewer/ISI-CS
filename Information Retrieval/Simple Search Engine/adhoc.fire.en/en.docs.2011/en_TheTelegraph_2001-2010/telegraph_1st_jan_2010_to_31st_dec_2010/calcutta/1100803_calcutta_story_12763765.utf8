The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Maoist mountain to climb                                                                                                                            3                                                                                      Maoist mountain to climb     - Rock climbers, trekkers robbed of happy hunting ground          PRONAB MONDAL AND ROMILA SAHA                           A rock climbing camp of the Nature Oriented Venturous Association at Bansa in Purulia   Trekkers at a nature camp in Purulia organised by the city-based Nature Oriented Venturous Association                                        
	The adrenaline addict and the budding backpackers favourite playground has become a Maoist battleground.        
	The rugged Ayodhya hills and the verdant trekking trails in Purulia that used to host regular rock climbing expeditions and nature camps have all become out of bounds for the city-based adventure seeker looking for a spot so near and yet so far.        
	A couple of sites are said to be still accessible with prior official permission but few dare take such a risk in Maoist country.         
	District magistrate Avanindra Singh confirmed that nobody had turned up in the past six months to seek permission for a rock climbing or trekking trip.         
	Even if we had received applications, chances are we would have had to reject most of those given the circumstances in Purulia, he said.        
	Sources in the district administration said more than 50 organisations, including schools and amateur clubs, would apply for permission to hold climbing or nature camps every year till Maoist activity increased. The number was down to five last year.         
	For students being initiated into adventure sport, spots like Mathaburu and Gajaburu were their safest training ground.         
	Camp organisers preferred Purulia because it was the best low-cost destination for high-adrenaline adventure.         
	The South Calcutta Trekkers Association (SCTA) charges Rs 1,200 for a five-day camping course in the district while a weekend rock-climbing practice trip can be done for as little as Rs 250 per person.        
	North Bengal is an option but the costs are much higher than Purulia. The north Bengal forests are also denser with a greater threat of running into wild animals. The Ayodhya range, with its shallow rivers and the option of venturing into the forest while maintaining proximity to nearby villages, used to be the perfect combination of adventure and safety for the beginner, said Brijes Day, an instructor at the 27-year-old SCTA.                          
	Joydeep Ghosal, the expedition coordinator for the International Award for Young People scheme, is now organising coastal treks along Shankarpur and camping programmes in Panchalingeshwar, in Orissa, instead of Purulia.        
	Shaw Public School in Behala had planned to take a team to Sushunia recently as part of its initiation into the International Award scheme but was forced to cancel it.                    Trekkers at a nature camp in Purulia organised by the city-based Nature Oriented Venturous Association      
	It would have been the first such activity for our students, and they were all so excited about it. But I didnt want to take a chance with safety, said principal Anjana Saha, who now intends taking the kids on a coastal trek as an alternative.        
	Livelihood has been affected along with lifestyle. The Adivasis living in and around the popular Purulia adventure sites would once supplement their earnings supplying food to expedition teams or working in the nature camps.        
	Parthasarathi Dutta, who founded the Nature Oriented Venturous Association and has been a regular for over 10 years, even set up a library and installed a computer for children in Bansa village, the hills near which are ideal for rock climbing courses and adventure camps.         
	I have been unable to return since last year. Although Bansa is safe, the approach route to it is not. A youth from Jhalda who had been asked to teach basic computer skills to the kids has stopped going to the village as well. My plan to hold a workshop on solar cooking has also been put on hold, rued Dutta.        
	Even if the authorities clear a trip to a relatively safer area, most back out if any untoward incident precedes the journey.         
	We had organised a rock climbing camp at Sushunia for 25 students of IIT Kharagpur in February last year but the trip fell through at the last moment. The IIT authorities refused to sanction the trip saying they did not want to take a risk, said Day of SCTA.        
	It hasnt helped that the police have become suspicious of everyone. In 2008, Rathin Chakraborty, the editor of the travel magazine Jara Jajabar, and some friends were picked up from a spot near the Sirka dam on suspicion of being Maoists because they hadnt informed the police of their visit.        
	We had gone there to scout for a site to hold a nature study camp and were harassed despite our explaining the reason for our visit. Although we were allowed to leave that night, we were picked up again the next morning. They finally let us go but we were asked to leave the area immediately, recalled Chakraborty.

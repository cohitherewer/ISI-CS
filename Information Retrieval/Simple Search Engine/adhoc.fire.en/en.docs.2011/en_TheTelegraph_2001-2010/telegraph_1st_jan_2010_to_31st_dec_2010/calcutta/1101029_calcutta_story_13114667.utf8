										      RITWIKA MITRA      Youngmetro                          Children perform during the annual show of Dance Feetish at Gyan Manch on October 24. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta              
	It was Star Wars II of a different kind for the audience at Gyan Manch on October 24. Little children performed the tale of Lord Shiva beheading Ganesha in a creatively choreographed dance programme, organised by a studio, Dance Feetish.         
	Parvatis anguish following the beheading of her son Ganesh and Lord Shivas attempts to console her were beautifully depicted by the dancers, as they tried to match steps to a recorded version of Ganesh Vandana and a narration by Sneh Choudhary, an instructor at the school.        
	The occasion was the studios second annual show. The participants included its students, who were also marked for their performance.        
	Young dancers also mesmerised the audience with their depiction of a typical morning when they have to rush to school.         
	The youngest of the students of the school displayed a lot of energy on stage as they swayed to the soundtrack Aal Izz Well, from 3 Idiots.         
	There were some funny moments, too, when some little ones forgot their steps and just did their own thing, much to the delight of the audience. The older ones managed to display a lot of emotion in their performance. Most claimed they were participating for the love of dancing and not to win good grades.         
	Being part of the competition is more important than winning. I am excited to perform on stage, said a young participant, Akanksha Gupta.         
	So, was she nervous before her performance? Not at all, pat came the reply from the Class VII student of Delhi Public School, New Town.        
	Lisa Sanganeria, another young enthusiastic participant chipped in: Our instructors always stress on us composing our own steps. We love doing that on and off. It has helped us gain confidence on-stage, too.          
	There was a young singer amongst the dancers. Eleven-year-old Amay Lakhmanis rendering of Bollywood hits like Maa and Give Me Some Sunshine was much applauded.        
	The children were awarded stars as grades. It gives them the push to perform better, added Choudhary.

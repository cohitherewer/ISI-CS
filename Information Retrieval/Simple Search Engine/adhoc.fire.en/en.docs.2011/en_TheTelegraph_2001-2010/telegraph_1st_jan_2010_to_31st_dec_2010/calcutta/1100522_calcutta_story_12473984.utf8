          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                      
	I am not sure whether to be happy or worried at Bikash becoming the mayor of a corporation that citizens often refer to as Chor-poration        
	Outgoing mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyyas wife Iva, when her husband was assuming office in 2005        
	The scramble for a ticket to contest the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) elections belies the bad name that every councillor-in-waitings family is supposedly wary of.        
	From the homemaker to the professional, few seem able to resist the chance to contest a CMC poll despite the infamy that ostensibly comes with the title of ward councillor. So why is a Rs 4,000-a-month councillors role in a city beset with civic problems such a coveted job? Metro follows the trail of cash and clout              
	MONEY MUSCLE        
	The CMC may be short of efficiency, transparency and accountability but not funds. The civic bodys annual earnings are in the region of Rs 3,000 crore with taxpayers contributing almost half of it as charges for services that they seldom get to enjoy.        
	On paper, a councillor too stands to gain little from the overflowing CMC coffers  his five-year honorarium of Rs 2.52 lakh is less than 50 per cent of a corporation sweepers earnings from salary during the same period. His only perks are free health insurance, a paltry telephone allowance and an additional Rs 250 a month for attending council sessions.        
	But scrape the statistics and you unearth a geyser of lucrative opportunities for the councillor willing to work the system.        
	According to the record books, the CMC spends over Rs 1,500 crore annually on construction and repair of roads, slum development, street lighting, maintenance of parks, removal of garbage and even pest control. Most of this is executed through contractors well versed in the ways of the corporation, where rule number one is to keep the councillor happy. A contractor entrusted with executing a scheme will invariably spend between 30 and 65 per cent of the total allotment and share the rest with the local councillor and CMC officials, says a deputy chief engineer (civil) in the civic body.         
	Sources in the CMCs audit department say councillors, contractors and officials pocket not less than Rs 600 crore of the taxpayers money every year. Around 2.5 to 10 per cent of this goes directly to the councillors, says an official.        
	In return, councillors often issue completion certificates for schemes that were never undertaken, let alone completed. Another money-making tool is false authorisation of work extension, mostly in slum development on which Rs 120 crore is apparently spent annually.        
	The councillor-contractor-official nexus doesnt spare the mid-day meal scheme for schools either. There are more than 250 schools under the CMC with around 60,000 students but the actual enrolment wont be more than 12,000. So the money meant to fund mid-day meals for up to 48,000 students is up for grabs and the local councillor is obviously a prime contender, says a CMC veteran.        
	Contractors working on schemes implemented under the Calcutta Environmental Improvement Project, the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission or the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority are also required to share their ill-gotten booty with local councillors.        
	A contractor needs to keep a councillor happy to ensure that he doesnt file a complaint about shoddy work in his ward. In this system, your nuisance value also fetches you equal value in terms of money, smiles former mayor Subrata Mukherjee.              
	DIAL C FOR CLOUT        
	From unauthorised construction to encroachment, power-tapping to illegal night parking, the local councillors blessings are a must.                                
	Unlike an MLA or an MP who may not be accessible, a councillor is one among you. More importantly, he or she gets those things that matter done for you  arrange for a residential certificate or recommend a ration card, a water connection, widows pension or even a hospital bed, says a former civic representative.         
	Police often turn to the local councillor for help if there is a law-and-order problem in that area. The best part of the job is that he or she enjoys power and pelf with low accountability, which is the envy of other politicians.        
	According to sources, two current MLAs of the ruling party were so eager to contest the May 30 civic polls that the Left Front had to delay announcing the list of candidates to convince them to back down.              
	PASSAGE TO POLITICS        
	For aspiring MLAs and MPs, a stint as a councillor is a stepping stone to mainstream politics where the stakes are higher. Several current legislators were councillors not long ago.

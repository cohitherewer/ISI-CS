                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Last days of Gunga Din
                              Bhisti Md Afaz goes about his work. (Bishwarup Dutta)                            
	Spraying blood-red paan spittle as he barked, an agitated Md Asamul exclaimed that he had no time for scribes. That was around 4pm, close to Bow Barracks.        
	When I met him about five hours later in his digs in the underbelly of a new apartment block in Market Street, he was having dinner along with five other men with whom he shares a pokey little room. Several goatskin bags called mashaks, that is the mark of his calling, hang outside his room.         
	Md Asamul and his colleagues are members of the vanishing tribe of bhistis, who, at one time, were indispensable for maintaining the citys water supply for both public and domestic purposes.        
	He explains that the supply of meetha paani  that is water supplied by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) at fixed hours  stops exactly at 4pm. This water is best suited for cooking and baths. So he loses his cool if anybody wastes his time then.         
	There are innumerable eyewitness accounts of how bands of bhistis carrying their mashaks were employed to water the dusty streets of the city long before hydrants were introduced. It is said that pretty much like upcountry labourers, these water-bearers, immortalised by Kipling in Gunga Din, would mouth a ditty so that they could do their job rhythmically.        
	Once they used to be corporation employees, but soon they lost their prime position as suppliers of water after carriages bearing water were introduced. Plumbing only made things worse. But thanks to the CMC and the ancient plumbing in many buildings, water did not reach all houses regularly. So bhistis became indispensable.        
	Not very long ago, bhistis were a familiar sight in central Calcutta and the Park Circus areas as they filled up buckets and tubs in the huge bathrooms of crumbling buildings occupied by Anglo-Indians and Chinese.         
	Now that most of these houses have been replaced by modern apartment blocks, bhistis too are on their way out. Tullu pumps have taken their place.        
	I discovered another gang of bhistis in a tiny room above what used to be a khatal in Metcalfe Street. The bare room is in a rundown building mostly occupied by labourers from Bihar. Md Afaz shares the room with four others, two of them bhistis. Earlier, a band of about 30 bhistis used to operate in the neighbourhood.         
	We are in dire straits. Neighbourhoods have become more crowded, so more and more people use the roadside tap for bathing and drinking water. So we hardly ever get the chance to reach the tap. Most tubewells are sealed and this has pushed us to the edge, says Afaz.         
	Their day begins around 6am, and they work continuously till noon. They cook their meals and rest till 3pm. Back again to the tap, and the shift continues till 6pm. They cant save more than Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 each month, meant for remittance.        
	About 15 years ago, a sculptor from New York had come down to Calcutta and created a cast-iron piece using mashaks as his mould. In a few years time, this sculpture bought by an industrialist will perhaps be the only reminder of Calcuttas bhistis.                    SOUMITRA DAS

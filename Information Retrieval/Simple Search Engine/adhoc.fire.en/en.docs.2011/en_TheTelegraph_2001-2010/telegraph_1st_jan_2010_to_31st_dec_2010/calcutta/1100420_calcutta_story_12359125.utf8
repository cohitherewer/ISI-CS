The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fans amp; fantasy Knights
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fans amp; fantasy Knights
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                                            
	At an emotionally charged Eden Gardens backing the Kolkata Knight Riders like never before, the mood on Monday evening was as much of celebration at the fall of each Mumbai wicket and each Sourav Ganguly boundary as of introspection over a season that had promised so much yet delivered too little.        
	We erred in choosing the domestic players. The foreign players proved weightier in name than in performance. Above all, except Dada, no one played with passion and pride, rued La Martiniere Class XII student Rounaq Basu.        
	Sumit Bhalotia, another die-hard KKR supporter, put the dismal showing down to the constant chop and change. We are the only team to have played so many players. Next year we should find a winning combination.        
	With the KKR finishing IPL 3 as the only team never to have made the semi-finals, Metro turned 50 of the most fervent fans in the Club House upper tier and J block into super selectors.        
	They chose a dream XI from among the four semi-finalists of 2010 and the current Knights to lead the team to the IPL 4 crown in 2011.        
	Only two Knights retained their spots  emotional choice Sourav Ganguly and crowd favourite Chris Gayle. Coach Dav Whatmore too made the crowd cut.        
	And the message for Shah Rukh Khan? Jeetega bhai jeetega, KKR jeetega, they chanted at each step towards an inconsequential victory.        
	For Eden, korbo and lorbo are done, now its time for some jeetbo re. For that, its over to the dream team picked by our Eden selectors.

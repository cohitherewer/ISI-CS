                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      GenX revs up for Roadies challenge
  - 2,000-plus boys (and some girls) audition          PRIYANKA ROY                                                
	Are you young, have the stomach for dare and can do just about anything to see yourself on television? Then chances are you were at Swabhumi on Wednesday.        
	Young Calcutta revved up for Roadies, with close to 2,500 aspirants turning up at MTVs first stop for the reality show hunt, partnered by t2 in Season 8.        
	Calcutta always throws up an interesting mix of contestants. Roadies is all about being yourself and, more often than not, we have seen Calcutta candidates have an individual personality that sets them apart, said Aditya Swamy, the head of MTV India, who was present at the 10-hour-long audition.        
	The best thing about Calcutta contestants is that you can see the fire to make it to Roadies in their eyes, said Raghu Ram, the creator of the TRP-topping reality show of and for the youth.        
	There was no missing that fire as aspirants queued up at the Swabhumi gates from dawn. I follow Roadies religiously and I have the drive and the strength of mind to ace the show, smiled Shurjo Dasgupta, 21. The Beleghata resident was in front of the gates from 5am.        
	Roadies is a passion and I will keep auditioning till I get there, said Amit Sundas from Sikkim, taking a second crack at qualifying.        
	Swabhumi was a sea of GeNext  but almost all male. Traditionally, boys always outnumber girls. We really cant help it if the girls choose not to land up, shrugged Swamy.        
	If the boys flaunted their Roadies audition as a badge of macho honour, the few girls who turned up, most with boyfriends in tow, fought shy of the spotlight. My parents would be livid if they knew I had come for a Roadies audition, said Brinda Nath (name changed).        
	But for most girls who queued up, there was a highest common factor: Roadies anchor Rannvijay! We dont care whether we get selected. We are here to just gape at him, gushed a group of college girls.

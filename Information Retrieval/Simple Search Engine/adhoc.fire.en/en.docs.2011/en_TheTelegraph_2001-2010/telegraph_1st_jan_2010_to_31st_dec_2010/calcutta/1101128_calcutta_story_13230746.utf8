                              A Tagore painting                            
	However much people may love Rabindranaths poetry and prose, his paintings often leave them cold and confused. One of the reasons behind this could be the impossibility of viewing all of Tagores paintings and doodles in a single book so that one can make up ones mind.         
	It was to bridge this huge gap that the culture ministry is supporting a massive project to publish 1,800 of his paintings and doodles in four volumes. Titled Rabindra Chitravali, to be published by Pratikshan, the book is due in April as part of Tagores 150th birth anniversary celebrations.        
	Announcing this project, Rajat Kanta Ray, vice-chancellor, Visva-Bharati, said at the Town Hall on Friday that the Prime Minister had greenlighted four projects in connection with the birth anniversary and Chitravali, without which Rabindranath studies would be incomplete, was one.         
	Rabindrasangeet and his paintings were bound inextricably, Roy stressed.        
	Jogen Chowdhury said the book should clear the confusion there was in popular thinking over Rabindranaths paintings. Sankha Ghosh said this new project could yield a treasure trove.        
	R. Shiva Kumar, who teaches art history at Visva-Bharati and has curated major exhibitions of the masters who worked in Santiniketan, will write the text and edit a vast amount of material. The book will include everything that Rabindranath wrote on art, including on his own output, and the documents published in connection with exhibitions of his work, mostly held abroad.         
	The book will lead to a better understanding of why Tagore took up painting in the last 16 years of his life. It is priced at Rs 20,000 but subscribers will get it for the half that sum.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cyclone Jal blocks cold wind
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cyclone Jal blocks cold wind
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A cyclonic formation along the southern coast, which meteorologists insisted would not affect the Calcutta weather, ended up pushing the citys minimum temperature by six degrees above normal on Monday.        
	The mercury was on the rise in Calcutta on Monday because of Cyclone Jal. The system has drastically altered the wind-flow pattern in the region, resulting in hot and humid weather, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The days minimum temperature was 24.6 degrees Celsius, while the maximum was two notches above normal, at 32.1.        
	The cyclone made landfall to the north of Chennai early on Monday and dissipated into a well-marked low-pressure area over Karnataka.        
	The residual formation has blocked the flow of cool northerlies and northwesterlies across south Bengal. Warm, moist easterlies are now blowing across the region instead of the usual wind from the north, Debnath said.        
	The hot and humid condition is likely to continue for another 48 hours, the weatherman added.        
	Meteorologists said the forecast of little or no impact of Cyclone Jal on south Bengals weather was made in the context of rain, thundershowers and squalls.        
	A scientist at Noidas National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting predicted that the weekend would be cooler in Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Robbery on Howrah train
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Robbery on Howrah train
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A gang robbed 15 passengers travelling on three reserved coaches of the Down Hardwar Express while it was travelling through Jharkhand on Wednesday night.        
	This was the second robbery on a Howrah-bound train within three days.        
	The passengers of the Hardwar Express lodged a complaint with the Howrah GRP on Thursday morning, stating the gang had taken away jewellery, cash, clothes and cellphones.        
	Police said the robbers took away the bags and suitcases after cutting off the handles chained to the seats while the passengers were asleep. On waking up after midnight, the passengers found the empty bags and suitcases dumped in toilets.         
	Witnesses said around 16 unauthorised passengers boarded the S2, S4 and S7 coaches at various stations after 10pm.        
	According to railway rules, passengers other than those who had booked seats in advance cannot board reserved coaches after 8pm. We went to complain against the unauthorised group but could not find any ticket checker or cop, said Aditi Ghosh, one of the robbed passengers in S4.        
	Those people were standing between berths and on vestibules connecting two compartments, Ghosh added.        
	One of the passengers in S4, Abinash Debnath, said he could not find his luggage when he woke up after the train left Jasidih station in Jharkhand well past midnight.        
	He raised a hue and cry which jolted the other passengers out of their sleep. Three of them found their bags gone. The unauthorised passengers, too, could not be seen. One of the robbed passengers checked the S4 toilets and found the empty bags dumped inside.        
	The unauthorised people were still in the coach when I went to sleep around midnight. When I woke up hearing Debnaths scream, I glanced under my berth but could not find my bags, recalled Ghosh. She claimed that her bag contained clothes, jewellery and some important documents.        
	The additional director- general of police (rail), Dilip Mitra, said: I cannot comment on the theft as it occurred in Bihar.        
	On the night of February 22, an armed gang had robbed 20 passengers of the Down Amritsar Mail and injured three of them (see grab).

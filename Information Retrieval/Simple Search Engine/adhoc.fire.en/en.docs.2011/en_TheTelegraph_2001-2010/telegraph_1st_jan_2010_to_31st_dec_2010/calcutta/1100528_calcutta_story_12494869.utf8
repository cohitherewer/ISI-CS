The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bypass flat burgled
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bypass flat burgled
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A ninth-floor apartment in a tightly guarded highrise complex off the EM Bypass was burgled of cash and jewellery worth over Rs 8 lakh when the elderly couple living there were attending a wedding in another part of town.        
	Amiya Ghosh and wife Manju, both in their 70s, returned to their home in the Udita complex from Dum Dum in north Calcutta around 8pm on Wednesday, only to find the main door open and the cash and jewellery missing from an almirah and a cupboard.        
	An officer of East Jadavpur police station said a preliminary investigation suggested the involvement of one or more insiders.         
	Given the security arrangements in the complex with every visitor having to go through a registration process before being allowed in through any of the four gates, it almost seems impossible that the burglars could have sneaked in unnoticed, the officer added.        
	The elderly couple, whose only daughter lives in Australia, have a cook and a domestic help, but neither of them stays in the flat. Investigators said the duo were interrogated on Thursday along with the guards at the housing complex.         
	The culprit(s) could be among the other people who work in the complex. We are drawing up a list of those who work in the block where the couple reside, said an officer.        
	Ghosh, who was unavailable for comment through the day, told STAR Ananda in the evening that he was sure the burglary was an inside job with more than one person involved in it.        
	According to the complaint lodged by the couple with East Jadavpur police station, they had left their home for Dum Dum on Wednesday afternoon after locking the main door.        
	On their return, they spotted tell-tale signs on the doorframe suggesting a break-in. The thieves had apparently used a hacksaw to gouge out the lock and then ransacked the almirah and the cupboard.        
	None of the couples neighbours saw anyone either entering or leaving the apartment, said a police officer.         
	There is also no mention of a visitor to the couples apartment on Wednesday at any of the four gates. In any case, the security drill is such that the guards check the bags of visitors leaving the complex. The boots of taxis are also scanned. This robbery was most likely planned and executed by someone who knew the security system in the complex very well, the officer added.

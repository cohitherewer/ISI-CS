The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Israel eyes Bengal tie-up 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Israel eyes Bengal tie-up 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Israel is exploring the possibility of forging economic ties with West Bengal.        
	The Israeli ambassador to India, Mark Sofer, met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Building on Tuesday and talked about possible collaborations in various sectors.        
	We had a very concrete discussion for co-operation in areas that are relevant to both of us, Sofer later said. Among the possible areas of cooperation are water management, dairy farming, alternative energy and food processing.        
	There is a possibility of a major company in the dairy farming sector coming to West Bengal, said Sofer.        
	The envoy also expressed interest in bringing to Bengal hi-tech tools for mango harvesting, especially through private-public partnership.        
	Food processing is another area where there can be fruitful tie-ups. I was told that about 35 per cent of the food products are wasted because of lack of processing. If we can help prolong the shelf life by even 25 per cent, it is going to be a big gain, the ambassador said.        
	A senior official at Writers Buildings said that during the 45-minute meeting, the chief had expressed interest in collaboration in water management technology.        
	Metro fine: A 26-year-old youth was fined Rs 250 by the Metro Railway for pulling the chain of a train at Kavi Nazrul station so that his friends could get on board. Sandip Das, who was identified by co-passengers, apologised to the station master for his action that delayed the departure of the train by four minutes. He requested us not to hand him over to police, so we let him off with a warning after collecting the fine, said an official. For pulling the chain without a valid reason, a person can be fined Rs 250 and/or sent to jail for three months.        
	Swimming pool: The chief minister on Tuesday voiced concern over pollution and the fate of water bodies. The government, civic body and the people have to take a strict stand against filling up of waterbodies, especially in Behala, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at the inauguration of Ashapurna Devi Swimming Centre near Garia bus stand.        
	Mishap: A retired teacher died after being hit by a speeding jeep on National Highway 6 around 5pm on Tuesday. Police said Anal Ghosh, a resident of Bagnan, was heading for the local market.        
	Stabbed: A 17-year-old boy was stabbed by a gang in the port area on Monday night. Police said Bablu Bind and his friends had prevented a group of men from stealing mangoes from trees in the neighbourhood on Sunday. Police suspect some members of the group had killed Bablu.         
	Taken ill: Around 70 residents of Jaipur village in Uluberia fell ill on Tuesday after eating prasad of a community puja. They were taken to a health centre from where most were released after treatment. Around 20 villagers have been admitted to a bigger hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Writers under lock amp; key
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Writers under lock amp; key
          RITH BASU                          One of the three gates of Writers Buildings through which the employees enter. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	A Trinamul Congress office in Writers Buildings was forced shut on Tuesday proving that the green armys penetration into the seat of governance has some way to go.        
	The State Government Trinamul Employees Federation office at Writers pleaded helplessness as its members failed to breach the bandh barrier and enter the red bastion.        
	All three gates through which employees can enter Writers  numbers one, three and six  were under lock and key from Monday evening.        
	As were the 70 other locks hanging on the giant doors of various departments inside the building, turning the state secretariat into a ghost house.        
	Some employees did turn up but were debarred. Samir Bhattacharya, a resident of Duttapukur in Bongaon, had stayed over at a relatives house in Bowbazar so that he could attend office on Tuesday.        
	I reached gate number three of Writers at 10.30am but was asked to go to gate number one and sign a register kept with cops and leave or else apply for a CL (casual leave) on Wednesday. I refused to sign, said the accountant with the animal resource and development directorate.        
	According to Mangalmoy Ghosh, the president of the State Government Trinamul Employees Federation, around 300 employees were turned away from the gates. When there is a bandh called by the ruling party no one is allowed to enter office or work, he alleged.        
	The general secretary of the CPM-backed State Government Coordination Committee Ananta Bandyopadhyay saw nothing wrong in that.        
	The gates were closed because the PWD staff who open them stayed away in support of the bandh. So, the handful of employees who turned up could not enter the building, said Bandyopadhyay.        
	Any given Tuesday, the footfall at Writers is around 1.5 lakh. On Tuesday the 27th of April, it struggled to cross 100, that too all concentrated in the corridor leading to the chief ministers chamber.        
	The chief minister came at the usual time as did some of his ministers, including Asok Bhattacharya and Surjya Kanta Mishra. All the secretaries, including the home secretary and chief secretary, also attended office, said Biswanath Pandey, the officer-in-charge of Writers.        
	Bhattacharjee, his ministers and top bureaucrats entered the building through the central gate, while the rest who reached Writers ran into gates under lock and key.        
	When Asok Mohan Chakrabarti was asked about entry being barred, he said: That is not correct. I came in through the central gate and left word that those reporting for work should be allowed to enter through the same gate.        
	His word was obviously not enough for the central gate to open for the employees.        
	The chief secretary did admit though that attendance at Writers Buildings was negligible on Tuesday. It was quite thin, he mused, blaming it on the failure of the transport machinery.

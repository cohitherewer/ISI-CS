	The state cabinet on Wednesday approved the governments decision to allow part-time teachers of state-aided and state-run colleges to continue in service till the age of 60, without a break in tenure.        
	The state higher education department had issued the order on Tuesday, which also said that all part-time teachers who were retrenched or whose contracts were not renewed on or after January 1, 2008, would be engaged in the same posts.         
	The order, which will come into effect on October 1, has also hiked the pay of part-time teachers.         
	Teachers working for less than four years will be paid Rs 9,450 instead of Rs 7,000 per month. For those working between four and 10 years, the monthly salary has been enhanced from Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,800. Those working for more than 10 years will be paid Rs 13,500 instead of Rs 10,000.

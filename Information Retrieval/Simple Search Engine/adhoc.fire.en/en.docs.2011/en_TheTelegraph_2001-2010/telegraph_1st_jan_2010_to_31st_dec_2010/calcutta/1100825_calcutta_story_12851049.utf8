The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Govt hits back at hotel for minister scan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Govt hits back at hotel for minister scan
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state government still feels health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra was harassed when guards at Hyatt Regency wanted to frisk him and has decided to ask the hotel management to explain its conduct.        
	The hotel management would be asked to explain its position. It was the hotels responsibility to adequately brief the security personnel about the profile of the guests expected for the event, home secretary Samar Ghosh said on Tuesday. The organisers (of the event) should have done the same but their mistake was an omission. The hotels mistake was a commission, he added.        
	The Hyatt management refused comment.        
	The government  which, along with Mishra, has been nursing a bruised ego since the August 21 harassment  is unwilling to accept that the hotel guards were only doing their duty by frisking visitors in their attempt to keep the premises safe.        
	Mishra had gone to the hotel last Saturday to take part in a meeting with his Union counterpart Ghulam Nabi Azad. When he was stopped for the security scan, Mishra called senior state officials who summoned the police. The cops later secured an apology from the hotel personnel. Azad blamed the hotels security staff for the mess.        
	The identical reaction of the two ministers from two rival parties  the CPM and the Congress  shocked Calcuttans as the hotel guards do not appear to have broken any rules.        
	What seems to have irked the government was the guards insistence on frisking Mishra, like an ordinary citizen, even after he revealed his identity. Even if the security personnel did not know the person in question was a minister  which is absurd because the person in question has been a minister for two decades they should have relented when he introduced himself, home secretary Ghosh said.        
	A senior police officer who refused to be named had accused the hotel staff of being discourteous. What about the courtesy of letting the security personnel do their duty at a time terror threats are becoming the order of the day?        
	The Telegraph editorial Insecure ego, published on August 23, pointed at another definition of courtesy by which the minister, perhaps with a little smile, allows himself to be frisked by an unsuspecting guard and then pats the guard on his back for doing his duty well.

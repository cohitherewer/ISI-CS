          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday directed the city detective chief to verify the academic credentials of Ranajit Sen, the general secretary (headquarter) of the Indian Science Congress Association, and file a report on July 2.        
	Justice B. Somadder passed the order after Sen, who had moved the high court alleging that the premier scientific organisation had not allowed him to function as the general secretary in violation of a lower court order, could not furnish documents to back his claims.         
	Sen, who had said he was a doctorate, a professor and a colonel, was elected to the post last year. Soon after, he applied for a six-month leave to avoid furnishing his certificates, said association counsel Tapas Mukherjee.        
	The association had slapped a showcause notice on Sen last August and then suspended his membership for not furnishing his academic certificates.        
	Challenging the suspension, Sen had moved the Alipore district judges court. The judge issued an injunction on the suspension. The association had appealed in the high court last December against the district judges order.        
	Justice Somadder on December 20 directed the district judge to hear the case again.        
	Earlier this month, Sen had moved the high court saying that the association had violated the district judges order. On May 14, his lawyer produced documents to back his academic claims, which did not satisfy the court.

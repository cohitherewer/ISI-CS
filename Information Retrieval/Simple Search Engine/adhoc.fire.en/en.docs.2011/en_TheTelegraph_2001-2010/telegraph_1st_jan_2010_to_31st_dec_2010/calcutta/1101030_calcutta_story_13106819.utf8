The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gateway of shame to city of sloth
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Gateway of shame to city of sloth
  - If you cant do it yourself, privatise it                                                    
	TT for city: aargh! airport  
	Sabyasachi Mukherjee, the citys biggest brand in fashion designing, hates to fly but flies a lot. And being a die-hard Calcuttan, he has to constantly fly in and out of the Calcutta airport. Reacting to the Metro campaign Aargh! Airport, the man who wants to take baby steps to make his city a better place to live in, voices an impassioned plea for the change to take-off from the airport  
	An airport is as important to the city as a foyer is to a hotel or a living room is to a home.        
	It is the gateway to any city. The first impression of the place  whether civic sense, work ethics, organisational powers or infrastructure  is completely based on the airport.        
	Whether a city is able or not able, politically charged or not, whether corruption breeds or not, whether professional people are working to bring it to life or not it can all be made out with one trip to the airport.        
	An airport is like a billboard of the city, it is how you can be looked at by the eyes of the unknown.        
	You want investors to come for business to your city? They wont exactly come by rail! Forget wanting to invest, going to the Calcutta airport is almost like going to a filthy house and wondering whether you should drink the water that is being served to you.        
	The only person who will be inspired seeing our airport is Dominique Lapierre if he is writing City of Joy II!        
	People have accused Bengali film directors of selling poverty to the West but the Calcutta airport in its current state can only appeal to the super-rich who are on a self-discovery trip (think Madonna and Kabbalah) and might find the disorganised face and chaos of Calcutta airport cute. And it might actually inspire them to do more social work in the city!        
	As money flows and big malls open and people fly in and out for the weekend, for many an airport is a flight of fancy, it is aspirational.        
	An airport can become a huge commerce tree if one sets up entertainment zones, opens up more shops        
	In short, if you cant do it yourself, privatise it.        
	Just because you are not capable that doesnt mean people have to suffer.        
	When I visit other cities and I look at their airports, it makes me want to know their city better. Its true. An airport is a reflection of how the city is progressing.        
	In Calcutta, people love to just sit back and blame the government. If they cant do it for you, get it done or do it yourself. Its all about baby steps. If you want a good body and keep putting off the treadmill till tomorrow, nothing will change.        
	You have to start today. Take baby steps to improve the airport. How long can we remain ashamed of it and not do anything about it?        
	Here I have to give an example of China. The Chinese government is as wary of the people as the people are wary of the government. But look at the result: a city (and an airport) like Shanghai!              
	(As told to Shradha Agarwal)

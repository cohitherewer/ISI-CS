                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CM raps cops for hospital violence

	The chief minister on Sunday criticised his police for not booking people accused of unleashing violence at hospitals, despite the enactment of a law aimed at curbing such crime.        
	The recently enforced West Bengal Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Act 2009 empowers the police to book persons accused of destroying hospital properties or assaulting doctors or other employees under non-bailable sections.        
	A person convicted under the act can be jailed for up to three years and fined up to Rs 50,000.        
	Despite the existence of the law, it has been observed that such acts of hooliganism are rampant in hospitals in the city as well as in the districts, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said on the concluding day of the three-day 18th state conference of the Association of Health Services Doctors (AHSD), West Bengal.        
	I will seek a report from the police and the administration on what is preventing them from taking action under the new law. I will review the report and ensure that proper actions are taken to prevent such acts of hooliganism, added Bhattacharjee, who is also in charge of the police department.        
	I feel bad seeing a doctor being beaten up by a mob. On most occasions, the doctors are not at fault.... Doctors can make a mistake but there are ways to take action against them. One must not take law into their own hands, the chief minister said.        
	Doctors at the programme alleged that the police often refused to invoke the law. Cops are not registering cases under the act. They rather prefer to book offenders under bailable acts, alleged Satyajit Chakraborty, the general secretary of the association.        
	The doctors submitted a charter of demands to the chief minister, asking for proper implementation of the new law, among other things.        
	The chief minister also criticised red-tapism in state-run hospitals which prevent patients from getting proper services.        
	Even if an elevator at SSKM goes out of order, the file passes from one department to another. Will the repair work wait till the file is cleared by all departments? This attitude must change, said Bhattacharjee, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra looking on.

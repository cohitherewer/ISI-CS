The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | College nook for US books
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      College nook for US books
          A STAFF REPORTER                          US consul general Beth A. Payne at the launch of the American Corner at Presidency College. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                  
	An American Corner has been opened at Presidency College where reading material for American studies will be available.         
	The joint initiative of the American Center in Calcutta and the colleges department of English is a bid to encourage students to study American literature.        
	The major problem that students face when they opt for American literature is lack of resources, especially books. This is the first step towards solving the problem, said Sanhita Sen, a professor of the department.        
	It offers American literature studies as an optional paper in the undergraduate course. The postgraduate course also has a paper on American literature.        
	On Monday, US consul general Beth A. Payne gifted 201 American books to the college to officially launch the American Corner. The collection includes books on American literature, history, politics and society.        
	I am a book lover and I hope these books will not stay on the shelves. Books come alive only when they are read, said Payne leafing through a copy of John Steinbecks Grapes of Wrath.        
	Although the American Corner will be housed in the English department, students and faculty members of the social science departments, I am sure, will also gain access to books on American literature, history and politics, said Payne.        
	Presidency is the first college in the state to get an American Corner. Similar facilities are being planned in other colleges too.        
	An institution in Patna has the largest American Corner in eastern India with books, journals and DVDs.        
	Reading fictional works is the best way to understand a country and its culture. When I want to learn about India I dont turn to history books but read novels. Similarly the best way to learn about America is through its literature, said Payne.        
	The head of the department of English, Debaleena Banerjee, and the principal of the college, Amitava Chatterjee, were present at the book donation programme.

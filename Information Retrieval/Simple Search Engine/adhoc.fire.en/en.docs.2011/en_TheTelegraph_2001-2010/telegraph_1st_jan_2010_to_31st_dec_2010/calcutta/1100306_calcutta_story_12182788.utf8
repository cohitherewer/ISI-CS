          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A man was stabbed and allegedly robbed of Rs 3,000 under Vidyasagar Setu by four youths on Friday. Police said Ramprakash Mishra, 28, a resident of Golmohar rail quarters in Howrah, was admitted to hospital in a critical condition.         
	Passers-by spotted him groaning in pain and bleeding and alerted us. He has a deep stab wound on the left side of his chest, said an officer of Shibpur police station.         
	Mishra, who works as a cook in a hotel in Salap, said he was walking down a deserted stretch around 3pm when the youths tried to rob him. When I tried to resist, one of them drove a knife into my chest and took away the money. They fled in a taxi.         
	Mishra said the officer on duty at the police outpost near the bridge refused to take his complaint. I then trudged up to the flyover but collapsed on the pavement, he said.

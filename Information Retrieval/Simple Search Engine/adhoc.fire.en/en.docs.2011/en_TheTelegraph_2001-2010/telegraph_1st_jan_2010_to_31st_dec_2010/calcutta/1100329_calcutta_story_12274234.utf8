The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Why politicians dont want illegal floors demolished (as if you didnt know already)
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Why politicians dont want illegal floors demolished (as if you didnt know already)
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY              united colours of politics on dubious square feet            Nandram market : Political unity has not allowed the upper floors to be demolished despite a Supreme Court order and a blaze            Stephen court: Will it open a can of worms?            174 CR avenue: The building has been declared illegal by the apex court. But who dare demolish it when local politicians want it to stand?                          
	 Fourteen years have passed since a Supreme Court bench ordered the demolition of the illegal building at 174 CR Avenue. Local politicians of all hues played their part to ensure that no action was taken. The 10-storeyed building, illegal from plinth to roof, stands tall with offices, shops and homes. So much for the rule of law.        
	 Twenty-three years have passed since the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of all floors above the sixth at Nandram market. The Burrabazar building was pruned, from 23 to 13 floors. The top two floors went up in flames in January 2008. The unsafe parts of the 12th and 13th floors were demolished. With the CPM soft-pedalling and the Trinamul and the BJP singing a no-demolition duet, Nandram, now 11-floor tall, towers above Brabourne Road.        
	Calcutta  led by its politicians  has a thing for illegal constructions.        
	Left to us, we would have carried out the demolition orders within three months, as stipulated by the court. But the system is such that no axe can be wielded on any illegal structure without political sanction. And that is a no-no given the remarkable political consensus on this count, rues a retired official in the civic building department.        
	But why are politicians determined to protect rather than demolish illegal buildings? The answer lies in a combination of cash and keys.        
	Lets begin at the basics. A builder would buy an old house, demolish it and start illegal construction. With nothing official about it, the construction was not bound by building rules like mandatory open space. There was no monitoring of materials used or engineering norms followed.         
	More importantly, for an illegal construction on a four-cottah plot, roughly 1,000sq ft was gained per floor. A 10-floor building meant 10,000 extra square feet. That even back in the early 1980s when the illegal buildings boom happened would yield an additional Rs 1.5 crore.        
	Of this, the builder would have no problems keeping the vicious circle  borrowing chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees words to describe the nexus enabling the rise and rise of illegal buildings  satisfied and silent, by showering up to Rs 20-25 lakh, says a veteran realtor.        
	Who would be the beneficiaries of an illegal building  or floors added illegally and then regularised  in the area? In the first phase the local tough, the local politician, the civic official and the local police (the last-mentioned mainly to muzzle protests, if any). In the second phase, the water supply and drainage officials would reap the benefits and in the next phase, the assessment inspector  not just for immunity but also to ensure that in the civic records, the old building would remain. That meant lower taxes and no scrutiny.        
	For example, many five-six storeyed apartment blocks in the city, especially in the added areas of Jadavpur, Behala, Tiljala and Beleghata, remain in the CMC records as hut roofed with tin.        
	Old-timers recount that in the pre-Left period, the vicious circle starred local toughs, the councillor, the alderman, the municipal commissioner and above, apart from the police.        
	In the CPM era, the local party office and the local party leadership became the prime players, backed by the local councillor and local police. A glaring example of the benefits of illegal buildings is a councillor who started out hawking cinema tickets and is now one of the richest councillors of the city, says a retired civic official.        
	For the larger commercial addresses, he adds, the party fund came into play directly. Alimuddin Street was the man of the match with the mayor-in-council playing a crucial supporting role.        
	Along with cash, keys played a crucial part. It became the norm for builders to give the key political players in every large square feet deal the keys to a flat. Most politicians in or on the fringes of the so-called vicious circle have been gifted flats by builders or fixers, says a leading realtor.        
	But why has no politician ever cried foul? Because of the all-for-one-one-for-all political anthem ringing out of every illegal square feet in town. Sharing of spoils has been the name of the game and every political entity with any clout near any illegal construction gets a piece of the pie, says a retired top cop.        
	Take the maze with moneybags called Burrabazar. Burrabazar is a congested, largely illegal jungle from where the least number of plan sanctions come to the CMC, says a building department official.        
	Demolition is a bad word to use here, cutting across party lines. We shall hit the streets if the government undertakes any demolition drive here, says a state BJP functionary, resisting any move to cut Nandram down to size.        
	With less than two months to go for the civic elections, it would be a blunder on the part of the government to demolish illegal buildings, warns a member of the CPMs Calcutta District Committee.        
	A Congress general secretary says demolition at this juncture is not an option and suggests drawing up a list of illegal constructions and convening an all-party meeting.        
	A Trinamul legislator from central Calcutta is the most candid, on condition of anonymity. All mainline parties are in cahoots with realtors and the CMC to promote illegal construction. Without backing from local councillors, irrespective of party affiliation, illegal construction is not possible. It is difficult to stem the rot in the system because everyone is involved.        
	Thats what they call the united colours of politics.                    WITH BARUN GHOSH

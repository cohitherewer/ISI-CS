                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rape accused bail cancelled
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          The Telegraph report on the alleged rape                                  
	The high court on Wednesday cancelled the bail granted to three students who were arrested in February last year for raping a 21-year-old.        
	The trio  Tanmoy Mayukh Borai, 21, Saptarshi Sanyal, 21, and Rishin Sengupta, 22  had spent more than a year in custody and were granted bail by the Alipore sessions judge on April 28.        
	The court cannot treat the crime leniently and grant bail to the accused just because they are students. The crime they had committed was serious, the division bench of Justice Amit Talukdar and Justice M.K. Chowdhury said while cancelling the bail of the trio.        
	The bench gave police the liberty to arrest the accused again.        
	The high courts order followed a petition by the alleged victim, who had challenged the validity of the Alipore courts order that granted bail to the accused even after charges had been framed against them.        
	The alleged victim, who was a student of an engineering college in the city, had claimed in the FIR that Tanmoy, Saptarshi and Rishin had on February 8 called her to a Santoshpur flat where they drugged and then raped her.        
	On February 9, Tanmoy had taken her to a doctor. The morning after, he had accompanied her home to Malda.        
	The accused were arrested on February 15 last year and have been charged with wrongful confinement, administration of sedatives/drugs, rape and criminal conspiracy, public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami submitted before the high court bench.        
	Goswami also told the judge that some youths in Jadavpur had been threatening the girl with dire consequences if she did not withdraw the case.

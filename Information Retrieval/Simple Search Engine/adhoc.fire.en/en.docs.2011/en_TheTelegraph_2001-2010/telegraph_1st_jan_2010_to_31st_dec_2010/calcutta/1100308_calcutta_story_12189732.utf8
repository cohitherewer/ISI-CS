The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Exam power promise falls flat
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Exam power promise falls flat
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Power cuts are back midway through the examination season, adding to the agony of a fiery start to summer.        
	I had read in the papers that there would be no power cuts during exams this year. What happened to the promise? asked ICSE candidate Deepshikha Paul from Shyambazar, fretting over hour-long power cuts on Friday and Saturday evening.         
	Most parts of the city and its neighbourhood faced loadshedding for at least an hour each over the weekend despite CESCs power-generation units performing above capacity.         
	Officials blamed the power cuts on the state-owned power utilitys failure to contribute its share of electricity to CESCs transmission network because of a coal shortage.        
	The CESC units have been generating around 1,250MW, against their capacity of around 1,225MW. But the peak-hour demand has been over 1,500MW, for which we need to import power from the state utility. But supply has been restricted to 200-225MW, resulting in a shortfall of around 70MW on Friday and 50MW on Saturday, said a spokesperson for CESC.        
	Officials of the state power department confirmed that a shortage of high-quality coal was responsible for lower generation, affecting areas serviced by the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd the most and those under CESC to a lesser extent.        
	Apart from the shortage of quality coal, a 300MW unit at Sagardighi has been causing problems, an official added.        
	 He failed to explain why a back-up wasnt ready despite examination schedules  from Madhyamik, which ends on Monday, to CBSE, ICSE and ISC that began last week  being announced nearly six months ago.         
	The rise in temperatures has added to the problems of examinees.        
	As in the past 10 days, the minimum temperature on Sunday was five notches above normal at 24.8 degrees Celsius while the maximum was three degrees above normal at 35.6.         
	Hot and dry continental winds following the western disturbances in south Bengal have been pushing the mercury up, explained an official of the India Meteorological Department in New Delhi.         
	The bad news is that the heat is going to get worse.        
	According to the weatherman, the next few days are likely to be hot and sultry with the maximum temperature rising steadily.

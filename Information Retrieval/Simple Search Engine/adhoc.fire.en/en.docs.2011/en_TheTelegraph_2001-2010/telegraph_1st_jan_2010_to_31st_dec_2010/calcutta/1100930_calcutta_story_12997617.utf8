The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Free seat prod to schools
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Free seat prod to schools

	The citys top schools would soon need to set aside 25 per cent of their seats for underprivileged students against a grant from the government on a par with the allocation per student to state-aided schools.        
	The plan to implement the Right to Free and Compulsory Education in Bengal was formally communicated to unaided English-medium schools during an interactive session with the heads of some prominent private institutions at Writers Buildings on Wednesday.        
	According to the act, state governments need to provide necessary financial assistance to unaided schools to offer free education to poor students. In Bengal, the bone of contention has been the quantum of assistance to schools in lieu of their providing free education to a section of students.        
	We are still working on the package to be offered to the schools for providing free education to the extent of reserving 25 per cent of their seats for poor children, school education minister Partha De said after the meeting.        
	Although the government intends fixing the allotment per student on a par with the amount given to state-aided institutions, heads of private schools have demanded that the amount be raised in accordance with the quality of facilities provided by them.        
	We were told at the meeting that we would be paid between Rs 7,000 and Rs 8,000 per student annually. But the final figure is yet to be worked out, said a principal who attended the meeting.         
	Private schools are also worried about whether students admitted under the new reservation rule would get the required support system at home to cope with the standard of education in their institutions. Language could be a problem for such parents when it comes to helping their children with homework, Seema Sapru, the principal of The Heritage School told Metro.         
	The government has promised the schools a set of detailed guidelines on how to go about solving these problems.         
	The act states that those enrolled under the 25 per cent poor students quota must be from genuinely backward and economically weak families. There is, however, confusion among the private schools about the definition of backward and economically weak.        
	The principal of a reputable Christian missionary school in south Calcutta said: We already provide free education to a considerable number of students from our community. It is not clear whether the 25 per cent quota includes students who are already being educated free of cost.        
	The legislation states that seats need to be reserved right from kindergarten to the highest class. If a high school starts a nursery section, the 25 per cent reservation rule will automatically extend to that unit, said the principal of St James School, Terence Ireland.

                      When love is in the air...                    A day devoted to love and affection, Valentines Day derives its name from one or more early Christian martyrs named Valentine. It is traditionally a day when lovers express their love for each other by presenting flowers, offering confectionery and sending greeting cards (known as valentines). The day first became associated with romantic love in the circle of Geoffrey Chaucer in the High Middle Ages, when the tradition of courtly love flourished. This year, City Centre Mall New Town is celebrating this special occasion in its unique way, with a line-up of daily events and competitions leading up to a grand finale to be held tomorrow, on Valentines Day. Yesterday and today, two sets of 30 couples each are participating in various fun-filled, innovative preliminary events based on themes of love, from amongst whom couples qualifying for the finals will be selected. Tomorrows finalists will be called upon to sing, dance, ramp-walk, act and find hidden treasure, before the winners are declared and awarded.

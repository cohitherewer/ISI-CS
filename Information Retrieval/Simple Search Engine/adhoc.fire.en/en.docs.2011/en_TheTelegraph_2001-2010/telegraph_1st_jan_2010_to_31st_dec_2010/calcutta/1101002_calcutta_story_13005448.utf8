The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Drug twist to Oxytown kill
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Drug twist to Oxytown kill

	Oxytown resident Mausumi Ghosh and her maid Parul were possibly drugged before they were murdered, police said on Friday on the basis of a preliminary post-mortem report.        
	Officers probing the case said three cups with traces of tea were found atop the television set in the ground-floor room at P 19A Oxytown where the bodies were found on Monday evening.        
	The way the bodies were found  blindfolded, with the limbs tied and throats and wrists slashed  suggests the women could hardly resist the killers, said an officer of Thakurpukur police station.        
	None of the neighbours had heard either woman cry out for help. The women must have surrendered meekly under the influence of a drug.        
	The sleuths suspect there were not more than two or three killers. A large group would have invited the attention of the neighbours, said an officer.        
	The police were also looking for a sari seller who had visited the house on Monday evening, before the bodies were discovered. Some of the neighbours had seen the woman enter the house, said a police officer. No one has been arrested in the five days since the murder.                                                        
	Neighbours had found the women in pools of blood after they were alerted by the cries of Mausumis two-year-old son Avirup.        
	Mausumis husband Avik is the prime suspect according to an FIR filed by her father. Shankar Dutta has accused his son-in-law of torturing his daughter for dowry.        
	Avik has been questioned every day since he walked into the police station on Tuesday afternoon.        
	Aviks mother Sandhya Ghosh was the only other adult at home before the murder. She was away when the murder took place. We have questioned her several times since Tuesday, an officer said.         
	Even five days after the murder, the police have not been able to make a single arrest.        
	The sleuths have got in touch with their counterparts in Munger, Bihar, where Avik works. Although Avik has produced a train ticket from Munger to Calcutta but we want to be sure if he made any trips to the city just before the murder, said a police officer.

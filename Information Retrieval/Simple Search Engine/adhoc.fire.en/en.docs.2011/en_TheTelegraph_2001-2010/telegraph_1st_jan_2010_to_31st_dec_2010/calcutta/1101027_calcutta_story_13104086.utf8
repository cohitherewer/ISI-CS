The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Paul gets second life in lights
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Paul gets second life in lights
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                          Chandernagore artist Babu Pauls creation of the season                                  
	Paul is dead. Long live Paul.        
	The late, lamented octopus whose uncanny predictions of World Cup 2010 match results had made him a worldwide celebrity  and who died in his sleep on Monday in an aquarium in Germany  is set to enjoy an extended life in the city and beyond this festive season.        
	Paul the psychic, who had even rivalled Tagore the poet as the subject of illumination themes for Durga Puja, would be seen lighting up pandals from north to south right till Raas Utsav in late November, according to artistes from Chandernagore.        
	After attracting eyeballs at Sreebhumi Sporting Club in Lake Town and 95 Pally Sarbojanin in Jodhpur Park during Puja, the two Babu Paul-designed illumination panels showing Paul correctly making a choice between Netherlands and Spain are set to travel elsewhere for Kali Puja and other subsequent festivals.         
	The panel seen at Sreebhumi will do Kali Puja duty at Suri, in Birbhum, and then travel to Fatakgora in Chandernagore for the four-day Jagaddhatri Puja. The next booking is for the immersion procession of the Birpara Jagaddhatri Puja in Ranaghat, followed by Kartik Puja at Bansberia, in Hooghly district. The octopus lights will finally be switched off at the end of the Raas Utsav organised by ABCD Club at Santipur in Nadia.        
	Paul is a craze. I had refused five to six more requests for the same illumination piece in the run-up to Durga Puja, Babu Paul told Metro.        
	The panel that was put up at 95 Pally will also be seen at a Kali Puja on Lake Road, off Rashbehari Avenue. It has been booked for Kartik Puja and Jagaddhatri Puja as well. I have not accepted any Raas offer yet as requests are still coming in, said Babu Paul, keen to make the most of Pauls popularity.        
	Fellow artiste Asim Dey is unsure about the fate of the static octopus he had created using LED lamps. The model was created with Paul in mind for a puja in Guwahati. Now that Paul is dead, it might not be right to offer a theme associated with sadness, he said.        
	But Babu Paul, who spent up to 22 days working on each panel, is confident of finding takers for Paul even for Saraswati Puja early next year.        
	What were his first thoughts on hearing about Pauls death? I was shocked, says the artiste, who had been to Sreebhumi to check the crowds reaction during Puja and was delighted to see kids stop and point to Paul.        
	Facebook and Twitter were flooded with tributes to Paul. Jab tak World Cup football rahega/ Paul the Octopus tera naam rahega!, said a fan.        
	Red Rose Club at Suri, Birbhum, is contemplating putting up a placard saying that the light panel depicting him at its Kali Puja pandal is a tribute to his memory. We are happy that Paul lived the full life span of an octopus, said club secretary Kallol Bhattacharya.        
	Given his fan following, Octopus Paul, who spent most of his life at the Oberhausen Sea Life Centre in Germany, might like to be reborn in Bengal and predict the winner of the next East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan clash.

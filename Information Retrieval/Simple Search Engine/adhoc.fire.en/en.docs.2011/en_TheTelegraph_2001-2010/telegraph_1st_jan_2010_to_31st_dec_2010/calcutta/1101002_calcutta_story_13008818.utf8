The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SPY SOMETHING FISHY OR FILMI, CHIEF MINISTER?
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      SPY SOMETHING FISHY OR FILMI, CHIEF MINISTER?
                              Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the inauguration of the fish festival in Nalban on Friday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                            
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has done it again. The chief minister on Friday mistook a fish festival for a film festival, less than a fortnight after he had mumbled jodi sarkar thake (if this government remains in power) and less than a year after he had muddled his astronomy with astrology.        
	This film festival is of great importance, Bhattacharjee started off after lighting the inaugural lamp at the four-day national fish festival in Nalban.        
	As a murmur went up among the dignitaries for Ben Aqua 2010 on the dais, the CM  whose pet project remains an annual film festival at Nandan  carried on, This film festival is an important event for our state.         
	Desperate situations call for desperate measures. Madhumita Mukherjee, director of the fisheries department, standing behind the chief minister, did the dirty: Sir, fish festival, not film festival...        
	Buddha stopped, mid-tide. Oh yes, its fish. What am I saying? Film? Sorry..., smiled the chief minister who is known to dig small, non-oily fish, but maybe not as much as a Fellini or a Ray film.        
	Did he have any of these fishy films in mind, we wonder...              Jaws
  The Steven Spielberg blockbuster franchise about a killer white shark. Er, Mamata Banerjee on your mind, Sir?
  Free Willy
  A young boy risks everything to free a whale from aquarium owners. Want to break free, Sir?
              
	Jal Bin Machhli   Nritya Bin Bijli
  A V Shantaram classic. Feeling like a fish out of water, Sir?     Chemmeen
  Path-breaking Malayalam film on the 
  belief of Kerala rsquo;s fisherfolk linking 
  safety with fidelity. Thinking of 
  comrade Karat, Sir?

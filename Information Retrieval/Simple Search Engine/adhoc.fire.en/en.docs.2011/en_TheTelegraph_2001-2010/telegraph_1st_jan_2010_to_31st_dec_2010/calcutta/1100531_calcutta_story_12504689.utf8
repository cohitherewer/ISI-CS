The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Race of three front-runners   Cops in a tizzy over convoy
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Race of three front-runners     - Probable mayoral candidates keep their cool on V-day          DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                  (From top) Sudhangshu Sil of the CPM, and Sovan Chatterjee and Javed Ahmed Khan of the Trinamul Congress.                                       
	After the hurly-burly of campaigning, the three men tipped to be in the race for the mayors chair came out looking relatively relaxed on their day of reckoning.        
	Left Front front-runner Sudhanshu Sil stepped out of home claiming he was feeling tension-free, Trinamuls word-of-mouth-favourite Sovan Chatterjee said the sun was making him sweat more than the heat of the poll battle and party colleague Javed Ahmed Khan quoted from the Quran before declaring that he would win.        
	Metro tracked the probable mayors-in-waiting on poll day.              
	SUDHANGSHU SIL        
	Tea and cigarettes kept this former legislator ticking through the day as much as the trends coming in through his poll agents stationed at various booths of ward 20 in north Calcutta. Mine is a trouble and tension-free ward. I have done my job and have nothing more to worry about, he told Metro around 10.30am, completing a round of the booths.        
	By 11am, Sil  Mintuda to his supporters in the area  was at Oriental Seminary along with wife and son to vote. The sight of the long queue at the booth elicited a smile. We organised small rather than large campaign meetings this time where Mintuda interacted with families and urged them to cast their votes in the first half of the day. We are glad it has paid off, said an aide.        
	As Sil was leaving, a couple approached him. We arrived from Mauritius this morning. Our flight was delayed by an hour and we were worried about not being able to vote, the husband said.        
	Sil, hands folded, simply nodded. So does the veteran see himself as the next mayor? No machine has been invented to know what people are thinking, he chuckled.              
	SOVAN CHATTERJEE        
	The five-time councillor may have been the most confident mayoral contender with a STAR Ananda-AC Nielsen survey earlier picking him as the citys choice if a Trinamul civic board came to power. But the death of childhood friend Debabrata Gayen upset Sovan Chatterjees plans. I was hopping from one booth to another when I got the news of Debus death around 11.45am. I left for his Parnasree residence immediately, Chatterjee, contesting from ward 131, said of his friend and party colleague.        
	But there was little time to mourn the death with Mamata Banerjee calling Chatterjee at 1pm to enquire about polling trends and the confusion triggered by faulty EVMs in some wards. The heat also seemed to get to Chatterjee, who woke up at 4.45am on Sunday, a quarter of an hour before the 5am alarm rang. I usually get up around 7am but today is a special day, although a tad too hot for comfort, he said. Chatterjee returned home around 4.30pm, had a bath and finally sat down for a lunch of rice, dal and fish at 5pm. I have had a hard but satisfying day, he said.                          
	JAVED AHMED KHAN        
	He left home along with wife and fellow candidate Rafat Javed at 6 in the morning, eyes weary from sleeping barely a couple of hours but looking forward to the day that would decide their political careers for the next five years.        
	Trinamul leader Javed Ahmed Khan, contesting from ward 64 for the first time, dropped his wife in ward 66 of Topsia  where she is the Trinamul nominee  before heading for a round of the sensitive polling stations.        
	Around noon, Khans brothers and their families joined him in his office opposite the Park Circus tram depot, from where they headed towards Topsia in three cars. Within minutes of the convoy reaching the Topsia Childrens Academy booth, three police vans screeched to a halt. It turned out that the police were misinformed about goons arriving in three cars to capture the booth, said an aide of the Trinamul strongman.        
	Khan the voter wasnt ruffled. As he would say, reading the Quran keeps you calm.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth was arrested on Sunday in connection with the murder of a homemaker, allegedly by a promoter, in Tiljala.         
	The decomposed body of Huma Nasir, 24, was found in Bhojerkhal off the EM Bypass on Saturday. Investigation revealed that promoter Sheikh Hannan and his associates had allegedly killed her. The youth, Kalu, had got the gunny bag in which the body was carried to the canal.        
	Preliminary examination revealed Huma was strangled to death in a room of the building where she had booked a flat. No sharp weapon was used to avoid blood stains, said an officer of Tiljala police station. Huma had booked the flat paying Rs 60,000. But when Hannan refused to give her possession of the apartment she threatened to drag him to court. At this Hannan decided to kill her, added the officer.        
	Eight persons were involved in the killing. Hannan and five others have been arrested so far, said S.K. Chaudhury, the additional superintendent of police of South 24-Parganas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rush and rakes derail AC Metro 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rush and rakes derail AC Metro 
  - High-tech doors add to shopper crush        SANJAY MANDAL                          The AC rakes first run on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Monday, 4.10pm, Chandni Chowk Metro station: The platform is chock-a-block and there is a sense of anticipation. Esheche, esheche (Its come its come), a man exclaims at the first glimpse of a north-bound train. Hain, eita AC ta (Yes, its the AC one), shouts a youth, struggling to break free of the hive at the end of the platform. Both had apparently bypassed several non-AC trains to board this one.        
	Inside the first compartment of the train a girl headed for office is standing near the glass door so that she can step out the moment it opens. The train stops and she puts a foot out, only to be pushed back by more than 20 people trying to get in at the same time. She screams but nobodys listening. The girl finally manages to get off at the next station, Central, but her kurti is torn and her faith in the safety of a Metro commute shattered.              
	The citys long-awaited tryst with air-conditioned Metro travel has been marred by a mismatch between supply and demand and technology old and new.        
	If overcrowding by commuters eager for a joyride on the new-look Metro is triggering chaos at the stations, the sensor-based technology that drives the doors of the AC rakes is letting the transport lifeline down at crucial moments.        
	On Monday evening, one of the two AC trains in the Metro fleet left Dum Dum at 4.52pm and reached Tollygunge an hour and 22 minutes later with a door open for most of the journey. Officials had tried evacuating the train at Chandni Chowk station on safety grounds but commuters allegedly refused to get off, adding to the delay that also threw the rush-hour schedule haywire.         
	Metro personnel were stationed near the open door to keep commuters from falling out when the train was in motion. The sensor-fitted doors are programmed in such a way that if there is any obstacle within 30cm of the two flaps, it will automatically open and close thrice. Until then, the train cant move, explained an official.        
	The hi-tech doors also take more time to open and close. Add to this the Puja shopping rush and theres a massive problem on our hands. At almost every station, one door or the other has been opening at least thrice with commuters sticking their hands, feet or bags between the flaps in a bid to board the train before the doors close, said the official.        
	So why doesnt Metro Railway do what Delhi Metro does? Our rakes use a different technology. The doors dont open thrice when something comes in between the flaps. That helps us maintain our four-minute frequency, a Delhi Metro official said over the phone.         
	The two AC coaches that have been commissioned so far were built at the Integral Coach Factory near Chennai.        
	A Railway Board official insisted that the sensor-based technology used on the doors was the latest. In fact, the same technology is used at Calcutta airports entry and exit doors.        
	Where Metro Railway has gone wrong is that nobody foresaw the problems associated with heavy traffic. We should have had more trial runs before deploying these rakes, an official admitted.

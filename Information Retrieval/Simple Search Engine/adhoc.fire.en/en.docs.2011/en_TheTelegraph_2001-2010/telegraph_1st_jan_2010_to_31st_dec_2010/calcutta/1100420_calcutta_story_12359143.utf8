	Gariahat Market, sprawling across two acres, has earned the dubious tag of becoming the longest standing unfinished market complex in the city. Though it houses the newest e-centre of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on its third floor, the 24-year-old market stands like a 60-year-old dilapidated structure because of lack of maintenance.        
	It is the second civic market in the city after New Market where everything under the sun from fish, vegetables to jewellery and garments are available under one roof. But Gariahat Market has been neglected since its birth in 1984. Despite clocking a daily footfall of over a lakh and raking in the second highest revenue after SS Hogg Market, the civic authorities have never felt the need to give it a facelift in the last 24 years.        
	Former Trinamul mayor Subrata Mukherjee had visited the market in 2004 with the purpose of renovating it, so that there was better utilisation of space. But differences between the mayor and other mayoral council members and subsequent changes in the CMC board put paid to the revamp plans.        
	Senior Left leaders in the CMC have no answers when asked why Gariahat Market has been left to languish all these years. Even when the present CPM-led board inaugurated an e-centre within the market complex with financial grant from the UK-based DFID, it still did not consider renovating the market.        
	Gariahat Market is a four storey complex stretching from Gariahat Road to Fern Road with 800 registered stall owners. The CMC earns around Rs 13 crore from this market every year.                     The lift in Gariahat market is in a decrepit state		      
	But the condition of the market complex is appalling. There is only one lift that connects the fourth floor to the ground floor but the path to the lift is strewn with decomposing garbage. The lift is in such a decrepit state that an accident may occur any time. It has been so for a decade, say market regulars.        
	The market came up in 1984 but the second floor still remains deserted. Those who had purchased space or stalls on that floor have not opened shop because of lack of infrastructure.         
	With the lift in such a state, one is forced to take the staircase, which are home to stray dogs and cats. Stall owners find it more lucrative to rent out their stalls as godowns rather than to open shops in such miserable conditions.         
	Hawkers keep their goods in the rooms after paying rent to the owners of those stalls, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the secretary of the Gariahat Market Trader Association. As a result, after sunset the upper floors remain dark and turn into a haven for gamblers and drug addicts.         
	There is only one lift that goes directly to the third floor that houses the CMCs licence, assessment and building departments. The staircases are never cleaned or washed though over 20 sweepers are in the civic payroll for Gariahat Market. The overall look of the CMC office on the third floor is shabby, with broken chairs, steel almirahs, defaced walls and broken railings.         
	Citizens voice: What is the use of an e-centre if the work culture of the civic employees remains unchanged? If I knew any one of the employees of DFID, which funded the e-centre here, I would have requested them to visit the market before investing in anything here, said Tapas Mukherjee a resident of Kasba.        
	Commissioners voice: The market is riddled with problems, particularly infrastructure. Rampant encroachment is its biggest bane. However, recently we have decided to develop the market, said joint municipal commissioner Sahidul Islam.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Boy injured in pool car mishap

	An unlicenced Maruti Omni pool car ferrying five students to school toppled over after being hit by a private bus at the Deshapriya Park crossing on Tuesday morning.         
	Debangshu Mukherjee, a Class III student of Hartleys Public School, sustained four cuts on his head and injuries on his right arm. The other four students, between 3 and 10 years old and from the same school, escaped with minor injuries.         
	It was a miraculous escape. The accident could have been fatal, said Subhra Mukherjee, Debangshus mother at their Regent Colony home.         
	According to police, the Omni (WB02R0939), which was coming from Triangular Park, was taking a right turn towards Lansdowne when it was hit on its left by the Gariahat-bound bus (WB04D9244). The impact made the car topple over on its right.         
	The window glass to my left broke and some of the pieces got lodged in my head. Then all the other students fell on me when the car overturned, said Debangshu.         
	Pedestrians rescued the students by opening the rear door of the Omni.         
	Cops blamed the bus driver for the mishap but Debangshus father felt both drivers were guilty of negligence.        
	What I gathered by speaking to people who saw the accident is that both the drivers expected the other to stop and did not slow down, said Debashis Mukherjee, a chartered accountant.         
	Debangshu, too, said the car was speeding. The owner of the Omni, who was seated to the drivers left, took the injured boy to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan for treatment.         
	A cop said the Omni was not registered as a commercial vehicle and hence was being used as a pool car illegally.         
	According to an apex court guideline, a pool car must have a first-aid box but the Omni did not.         
	 The bus driver Gurtej Singh, 45, was arrested. He has been charged with rash and negligent driving, said an officer of Tollygunge police station.

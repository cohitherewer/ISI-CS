The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Scent of a scam in sergeant shuffle
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Scent of a scam in sergeant shuffle
  - Lalbazar abuzz about 11 transferred officers bagging postings of choice          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	A regulation reshuffle of sergeants that was revised barely a fortnight after the transfers has Lalbazar buzzing with allegations about some sidelined officers bribing their way back to plum postings.        
	Documents collected by Metro show how 22 of the 100-odd transfers notified through a circular issued on November 30 (TDPO No. 4996) were revised on December 16 (TPDO No. 5256), ostensibly in public interest.        
	But sources in the police headquarters insisted that the revision was solely in the interest of 11 sergeants wanting to either stay put or be transferred to cash-rich traffic guards.        
	The new list makes it clear that those sergeants who were transferred from lucrative to low-transaction zones are the ones benefiting from the revision. We are sure about money exchanging hands before the fresh list came out, said an officer of the traffic department.        
	The deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Dilip Banerjee, contested the allegations.        
	Whatever changes have been made are in public interest. It was an administrative decision, said the deputy commissioner.        
	On whether he suspected that some officers had paid money to get their transfers reviewed, he said: I have no idea whether any such thing happens.        
	Three of the sergeants transferred afresh had selected the Beleghata traffic guard as their preferred posting.         
	Beleghata is a sought-after posting because there is money to be made there. This guard oversees the EM Bypass and Beleghata Main Road, where traffic movement is always heavy, an officer revealed.        
	Sealdah traffic guard is also considered a lucrative posting because it oversees the movement of goods carriers in and around the busy Koley Market.        
	Although the rulebook stipulates that no sergeant should be posted in a particular traffic guard for more than two years, officers allegedly often get transfer orders cancelled by bribing seniors.        
	Those angling for better postings allegedly even promise to share the booty in return for being transferred to the traffic guard of their choice.

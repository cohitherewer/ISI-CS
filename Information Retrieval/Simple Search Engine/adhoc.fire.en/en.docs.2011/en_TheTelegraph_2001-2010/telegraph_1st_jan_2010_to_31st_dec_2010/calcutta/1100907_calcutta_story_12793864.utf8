          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	From cutting-edge design to prize-winning poetry films, contemporary art and music to the science of restructuring libraries, Calcutta can expect a fair slice of todays Germany in the run-up to the pujas.        
	The Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan, the seat of German arts and culture in the city, has lined up a clutch of events over the next three months to strengthen the bond with Bengal, with a focus on all things contemporary in Germany.        
	A must-visit will be an exhibition at the ICCR by Ulm Design School, which shaped German industrial design for many decades and has had a huge influence on students from around the world, according to Reimar Volker, the director of Max Mueller Bhavan (MMB).        
	To be presented by arts historian Daniela Baumann, the exposition (September 25 to October 7) will focus on research into and visualisation of the Ulm Model, tracing its impact on the way we live, work and create, right up to the present day.        
	The famous travelling show will use tools like large-format photos, text panels, an illustrated synopsis, models, graphics, a tower of books and videos to illustrate the broad spectrum of intellectual approaches, procedures and results of the schools work, Volker explained.        
	A selection of prize-winning poetry films  a new genre gaining currency in art-house Europe  from the archives of the ZEBRA Poetry Film Festival will be presented by Christiane Lange, a theatre critic and arts journalist on September 12 at the MMB auditorium.        
	Adornos Night Music, a lecture-recital featuring the works of composer Theodor W. Adorno with readings by Wieland Hoban (MMB, August 30), will include Ravel (1930), The development and forms of new music (1952) and Beethovens late style (1937).        
	MMB, which recently refurbished and re-formatted its library, will present an illustrated lecture by Klaus U. Werner, the chief librarian at Berlins Free University. Werners domain is the library of the future, which will be the topic of his talk.        
	Brief sessions on the contribution of Helen Meyer-Frank, Tagores most dedicated German translator, will be presented by Tagore scholar Martin Kaempchen on September 8. Kaempchen found Tagores letters to Meyer-Franck in Hamburg and joined them with her letters and those of her husband, Heinrich Meyer-Benfey, to piece together the only consistent correspondence Tagore had with a German personality.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Youth killed in godown
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Youth killed in godown
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sadaf Akhtar Hossain                                  
	An 18-year-old son of a slipper-manufacturer was found dead with a gunshot wound in their rented godown near Rajabazar early on Monday.        
	Police are clueless about the motive for Sadaf Akhtar Hossains murder but suspect the attacker was known to the victim.        
	The preliminary post-mortem report suggests Sadaf was killed between midnight and 1.30am. He took a bullet under his right armpit. The neighbours apparently did not hear the gunshot, said an officer of Amherst Street police station.        
	Sadafs father Shamim Akhtar owns two slipper-manufacturing units in the Rajabazar area. The Keshub Chandra Sen Street godown where the youth was killed was taken on rent last month.        
	The 200sq ft godown is located in a building which also houses a room where a mason named Manoj, the key accused in the murder of a man in his 70s in his Baithakkhana Road house on Sunday morning, lived. Manoj is still absconding.        
	Family sources said Sadaf used to sleep in the godown with a labourer, Sadafat Hussain.         
	The labourer had gone to Murshidabad over the weekend and returned on Monday morning. Since Sadaf had not returned home in the morning and calls on his phone went unanswered, we asked Sadafat to visit him. When he went to the godown, the door was partly open. A part of Sadafs body was on the bed while the lower portion was on the floor, said the youths uncle Shahid Akhtar.        
	There was no sign of confrontation. The assailant was probably known to Sadaf, said an investigating officer.

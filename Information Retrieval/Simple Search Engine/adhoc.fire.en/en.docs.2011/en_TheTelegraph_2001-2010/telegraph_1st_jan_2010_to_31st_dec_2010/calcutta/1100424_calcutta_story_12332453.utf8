The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tug of war over pavement trees
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tug of war over pavement trees
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The pavement skirting Salt Lake stadium. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                   
	A row of trees on a pavement off the Bypass has led two state departments to cross swords, one in the name of convenience, the other greenery. The pavement in question is the one skirting Salt Lake stadium. It is home to a row of eight-year-old deodars.         
	The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has written to the deputy conservator of forests, Eden Gardens, asking his department to remove the trees from the footpath around Yuva Bharati Krirangan as they inconvenience morning walkers.         
	The CMDA letter says that walkers have complained about finding it difficult to use the pavement as the trees are planted right in the middle.        
	The forest department turned down the CMDAs request saying that before cutting the trees, it must identify adequate land for planting an equal number of trees, if not more.        
	These trees were planted seven to eight years ago in consultation with the CMDA. Unless we have a ready afforestation plan, we cannot go about cutting down trees, said Nilanjan Mullick, deputy conservator of forests.        
	Forest department officials cited instances of trees being uprooted or removed only after alternative arrangements were made to replant an equal number within the city.         
	We will have to cut down several trees for the construction of the Park Circus-Paroma Island flyover. We will replant them along the Rashbehari connector, said a senior official of the department.        
	Environmentalists are aghast at the CMDAs attitude. Trees help reduce the damage caused by emissions and other pollutants. We cant do away with trees, said activist Subhash Dutta.         
	The CMDA, however, insists that it is empowered to cut down the trees along the stadium wall as the land belongs to its parent body, the urban development department.        
	We know about compensatory afforestation. But if the trees are causing problems to the majority of the residents, what can we do? asked a senior official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Drapes down the ages
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Drapes down the ages
                            
	From home-grown Balucharis and Kantha embroideries to a handkerchief embroidered with gold thread from Kashmir and textiles from the Northeast, a wide range of textiles from across the country was on display at an exhibition recently organised by the Indian Museum. Most dated back to the 19th century.         
	Part of the collection was a beautiful off-white, black and gold Jamdani with jamevar buti that had been made in Dacca, part of Bengal then. A Baluchari sari that showed a European couples in a mayurpankhi boat. Rich Benarasis had lost nothing of their lustre despite time. A cotton and cowrie shell apron from Bellary was exquisite.         
	While there was variety, some pieces showed proof of neglect: they were damaged or moth-eaten. Also many of the specimens had a contemporary emporium quality: the textiles from the Northeast or the phulkari from Punjab are easily available in city showrooms. Perhaps the museum could have gone back to an older time.         
	Perhaps the museum could also have organised better publicity. When Metro visited, there was not a single visitor present.

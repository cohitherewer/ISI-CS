The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | ... Despite the party-poopers   Permission sham for rally shame
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      ... Despite the party-poopers   Permission sham for rally shame
          OUR BUREAU                          Mamata Banerjee in Metro Channel. Pictures by Pradip Sanyal and Tamaghna Banerjee                                  
	A childs innocent plea may not have stopped a Metro Channel meeting but it did force Mamata Banerjee to justify her traffic-choker rally two days before Christmas.        
	We are holding this rally with permission, she declared to the roar of the 10,000-strong Thursday afternoon gathering of the Trinamul faithful.        
	Has change arrived, wondered those used to Mamatas unapologetic ways.        
	When was the last time a political leader in Bengal spoke about seeking permission for a rally, pondered some.                  
	Amra manusher oshubidha kore kichhu korina (We dont do anything by disturbing people). We dont call meetings on holidays or during festivals, Mamata continued, trying to give the impression that Trinamuls blockade of the city centre was a political compulsion.        
	An 11-year-old girl had written an open letter to Mamata Maam  published in The Telegraph on Thursday  requesting her not to block the way to New Market, the traditional shopping destination for Christmas. The girl wrote that she could not visit New Market to buy a Christmas tree and a cake because of rallies one after the other, each day of the week.        
	Although Mamata didnt heed her plea, it did seem to haunt her throughout Thursdays rally. Bandh-o korbo na, micchil-o korbo na, abarodh-o korbo na (We wont call bandhs, rallies and blockades). But when we are pushed to the wall, we have to reply to bullets through ballots, she told the rally.        
	The Trinamul leader had earlier promised not to call bandhs to prove that she was pro-development, not pro-disruption.         
	The rider came on Thursday. No bandh does not mean no gherao or no blockade.        
	No point telling her that disruption is not a fair political tool. Amader gyan deben na (dont lecture us). We will listen to what we have to, she thundered.        
	But the little girl would not leave her mind so easily. She is innocent and possibly ignorant, Mamata said. Kono shishu chhoto thekei gyan labh kore na. Abhigyatar modhye diye boro hoy (No child is born with knowledge. A child grows up while gathering experience).         
	Mamata then trained her guns on the CPM for the city not having a permanent venue for rallies where citizens wouldnt be disturbed.        
	There are no grounds to hold meetings. Had there been one, we would have gone there. In 35 years, they have not been able to create a ground for meetings. If you hold a meeting at the Brigade Parade Grounds, there is pollution. Does that mean we will not protest? she demanded.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had addressed a traffic-choker rally at the same venue on Wednesday.        
	According to the law, all rallies disrupting traffic are illegal. So the police are not entitled to give permission to a rally that is blocking Chowringhee Road under any circumstance.        
	The only place where the police can legally allow a rally is under the shadow of Shahid Minar, about 500 metres from where the chief minister was on Wednesday and the chief minister-in-waiting was the day after.                                
	A senior officer in Lalbazar admitted that the police could only give permission to hold a rally, not to block the road.        
	Political parties send applications to Calcutta police seeking permission to hold meetings. And when too many people gather in such a small place, we are forced to block roads and divert traffic. While okaying a rally date, our only concern is to ensure that the schedule of two parties dont clash, he added.        
	When the two main parties of the state are in agreement on blocking roads and the polices only task is to ensure that they are not at the same place at the same time, Calcuttans have no choice but to resign themselves to wading through choked traffic till at least the polls.         
	Now they (the Left Front) are building Brand Bengal. Tin mash pore batil kore debo. (I will scrap it three months later), Mamata threatened on Thursday, perhaps unaware that the rest of the world has long branded Bengal as a no-hoper.         
	Ask the 11-year-old who was denied her Christmas cake.

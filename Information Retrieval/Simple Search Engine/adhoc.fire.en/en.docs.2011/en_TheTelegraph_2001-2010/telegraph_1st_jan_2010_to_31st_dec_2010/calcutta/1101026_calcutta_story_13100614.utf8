                       Darkest day: Metro commuters being evacuated from the train that derailed near Central station on October 20 and cops and Metro officials try to locate the cause behind the derailment. Telegraph pictures                                       
	I used to be a regular Metro commuter from its inception in 1984 till 1995, when I left India.           
	Now, I understand from various reports that Metro Railway has become as crowded as surface transport in Calcutta and quite unreliable too. The comfort of travel we used to enjoy in the earlier days of Metro has gone for good ever since the extension of services up to Garia and then up to New Garia.           
	The recent derailment has added one more dimension  the fear for life. From now, I will think twice before boarding the Metro during my annual visits to Calcutta. But I will certainly cherish the memories of the excellent and comfortable services provided by Metro Railway when I lived in Calcutta.

	Regarding the question What must Metro do to restore your faith in it?, October 22, here are some short-term measures that may help:                       
	1. All trains should not ply till New Garia station; alternate trains should be routed back from Tollygunge. At present, all trains are loaded to 150 per cent to 200 per cent of their capacity between Kalighat and Dum Dum stations. Within available resources, we have to increase the frequency of trains between the above-mentioned stops.           
	2. There should be an arrangement for alternative power supply/inverter/generator within 10 minutes of any breakdown in power supply. A power failure beyond 15 minutes can turn fatal.           
	3. Plainclothes policemen must patrol stations and trains to discipline unruly passengers.

	Address not given                               
	Some of the steps that might help the Metro Railway authorities to resume normal services:           
	1. Services on the extended route (beyond Tollygunge) must be limited to a few runs a day till procurement of new rakes.           
	2. Three to four shuttle trains from Dum Dum to Chandni Chowk stations and Tollygunge to Park Street stations can run from 9am to 10am and 5pm to 6pm to cope with the peak-hour pressure.           
	3. The recruitment of maintenance staff should be conducted through the UPSC to prevent politics from colouring the choice of candidates.           
	Sandip Ray,           
	Baranagar                               
	I hope the following suggestions can restore the normal services of Calcuttas pride, Metro Railway:           
	1. Pre-shift inspection of tracks and coaches by senior officers should be made mandatory. The tracks and power supply lines should be checked every morning.           
	2. Maintenance should be carried out at night in the presence of senior executive officials of Metro.           
	3. The emergency staff should be present at Dum Dum, Tollygunge, New Garia and a few other important stations. Rescue teams should be available at all stations.           
	4. Hydraulic jacks and line maintenance teams should be available at least in alternate stations. Emergency ladders should be kept in all coaches. Sufficient spares should be available in all stations.           
	5. Uninterrupted power should be ensured. Sufficient lighting from an alternate source is a must in case of a power failure.           
	6. The public address system should work during emergencies. Metro officials should ensure seamless communication with the nearest stations on either side of a station.           
	7. The ventilation system should be upgraded.           
	8. Commuters should be given proper guidelines about what to do in case of emergencies.

	In response to the question: Are you scared of travelling in Metro, October 21, I feel Metro Railway  once the pride of Calcutta  has become a scary ride. Earlier, people felt at ease travelling by Metro but now they fear boarding the trains. The discomfort level among passengers is palpable. The derailment of a Metro compartment on October 20 not only jeopardised the lives of people but also put the city to shame.             
	My daily commute from MG Road Metro station to Rabindra Sadan station has become a nightmare also because of the crowd surge. The extension of Metro services in August 2009 and again on October 7 this year without the necessary increase in number of rakes has led to the Metro mess.           
	I also feel cellphone coverage inside Metro should be upgraded as the mobile link will become vital in case of an emergency underground.           
	Kayenat Kamal,           
	Address not given                               
	Accidents happen everywhere, be it in air, on land, in water or underground. Every mode of transport is susceptible to danger. But that does not mean that we will stop travelling. Thus, Calcutta Metro, even after the derailment, will continue to transport people every day. After all, how long can the lifeline of a city continue to scare people?           
	The fear has to pass and people will again get on with their daily lives.           
	Amrita Mallik, Salt Lake                               
	Im really scared to take the Metro now. Metro rail is worsening by the day. We should boycott Metro till it becomes safe again.           
	Mohit Dugar,Address not given                               
	Yes, I am scared, especially when I think I may be stuck in a dark tunnel while travelling by Calcutta Metro.           
	Earlier this year, I rode the Metro in New York. I felt totally safe and comfortable during the journey, though the NY subway is over 100 years old.           
	But In Calcutta, one cannot have a smooth ride in Metro as there is always the fear of an accident or a truncated journey, mostly because of suicides on the tracks. I have decided not to take the Metro at least till the year-end.           
	Shaunak Das, Serampore, Hooghly                               
	I have been a Metro regular since 2001, mainly because of its punctuality. But for the last one year, taking the Metro has been a hellish experience. There is some delay or mishap nearly every week. Now, after the derailment, Im scared to avail of Metro daily. Had the extended route been made operational after proper upgrades, passenger safety and comfort wouldnt have been compromised. But vote-bank politics won over these concerns.           
	Politicians have an easy way out, too. In the event of a mishap, they simply accuse their rivals of sabotage and the issue gradually fades from public memory.           
	Deepan Kumar Sarkar,Tollygunge                               
	I am not scared to take the Metro despite the derailment. But I am really concerned about the decline in the quality of service of Metro Railway over the years. Snags and accidents occur the world over but such snags have become a regular feature for Calcutta Metro these days.           
	Since Metro is the only rapid transit system available in Calcutta, where even hand-pulled rickshaws constitute an important source of transportation, an improvement in the quality and safety standards of the services cannot be over-emphasised.

	VIP Road                                         
	To answer the question: Who do you blame for the Metro Railway mess?, October 21, I must say that we cannot blame only the Railway authorities because this is our Metro too and we all are responsible for our pride being eroded.             
	We fail to form a queue before boarding the Metro. We rush to bag a seat without caring for elderly, young or disabled passengers. No wonder the citys pride has turned into an embarrassment.           
	Rupen Prache,Address not given                               
	I blame myself for the Metro Railway mess since I do not know how to use public property. We, the passengers, violate rules, restrictions and instructions almost every day. We often cross the yellow line on the platform and stand too close to the tracks. We push our way into a train. We do not want to stand in queue.           
	It is, in fact, surprising that despite our delinquent nature, Metro has managed to provide almost flawless service for years. We are fortunate that there has been no major accident till date.           
	Secondly, the Metro Railway administration is to be blamed. They should have scrapped the age-old rakes long back. This is nothing but a callous approach towards public safety. They should have a professional attitude similar to that of private companies.           
	Thirdly, the trade unionism of Metro employees is to be blamed. Hooliganism in the name of trade unionism has upset the work culture of Metro Railway.           
	Sanjib Dawn,Dalimtala Lane                                         
	The comments by railway minister Mamata Banerjee (picture above) on day of the Metro derailment were childish (Hundreds stuck, 11-hour halt, October 21).             
	As usual, she instantly commented that it was a minor incident that had been blown out of proportion. For her it was a small incident because she does not travel by Metro. But for the thousands who take the Metro, the disruption was a nightmare.           
	Accidents and snags are bound to happen in any transport system but not as frequently as they occur in our citys Metro. But the minister seems least bothered.           
	Mamatas comments have become predictable too. If a major accident occurs, she terms it sabotage while the rest are small or usual incidents.           
	A reshuffle of the Union cabinet is on the cards. The Prime Minister should bifurcate the railway ministry  one person should be made to look after the workings of the ministry while Mamata handles the duty of laying foundation stones and flagging off trains.           
	Raj Bagri,Ho-Chi-Minh Sarani                                         
	Derailed is a common word in newspapers these days. And the ministers are, as usual, not really concerned. They are busy planning their next election gimmick. The lives of people are not of any importance to them.             
	Unfortunately, the parivartan (change) that has come about is definitely not the change we seek. God knows how this change will manifest itself in future. All I can say is that such change has put the lives of commoners in peril.           
	Biplab Paul,Address not given                                         
	Apropos the report Metro warned of backlash, October 21, the remarks made by police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti about a possible backlash against the irresponsible statements made by railway minister Mamata Banerjee were very dangerous and could have led to mob frenzy after the derailment.             
	A.S. Mehta, New Alipore                                         
	The first time I read about the new AC rakes, I saw the faces of suffocated passengers and I shivered. I told someone in Calcutta about this and he thought I was crazy.             
	But we are still a long way away from enjoying facilities that most of the world takes for granted. When will we stop talking big and get down to basics: safety, security and service to the customer?

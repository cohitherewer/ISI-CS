The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kin grope for suicide cause
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Kin grope for suicide cause

	A sense of bafflement, along with the pain of loss, gripped the Shyambazar house of young scientist Titas Pal, who apparently committed suicide in her Trombay flat on Wednesday night.        
	Why did she do this? She was so happy and full of life. There was no reason for her to take her life, rued a relative at Titass Akshay Bose Lane house. The body of the 27-year-old was cremated at Nimtola burning ghat on Friday.        
	Titas, a scientific officer with Bhaba Atomic Research Centre, was found hanging by the windowsill in her 14th-floor apartment hours after she returned happy from Calcutta.        
	She looked so happy when we celebrated her birthday here on Sunday. There was never any sense of something being amiss. Its still difficult to believe, Titass uncle said.        
	Father Subroto, who brought home Titass body, was yet to get out of shock. She was keen on a transfer to Calcutta. She wanted to settle down here after marriage. I cant imagine what went wrong.         
	Relatives said at Sundays gathering, Subroto announced that his daughter would get married to a doctor with whom she was in a relationship for some time.         
	The family never objected to their affair. No one can make any sense of what happened, said a family friend.        
	According to a neighbour, the doctor called Titas around 4.30pm on Wednesday. She took the call and said she would call him back later. She never did. She did not answer any call after that.

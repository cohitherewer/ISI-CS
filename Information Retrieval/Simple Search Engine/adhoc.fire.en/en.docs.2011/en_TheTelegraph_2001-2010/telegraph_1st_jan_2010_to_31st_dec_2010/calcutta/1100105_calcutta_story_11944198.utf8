The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Boy kidnapped, rescued
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Boy kidnapped, rescued
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mohammad Irfan                                  
	The 12-year-old son of a Howrah trader, who was kidnapped while he was playing near his home on Saturday evening, was rescued by police from Metiabruz late on Monday.        
	Two men found in the house where Mohammad Irfan was kept hostage have been detained for questioning. There was no confirmation of ransom being paid.        
	Hours after Irfan went missing, his father received a call saying the boy would be returned for a ransom of Rs 30 lakh. The kidnappers rang up the family repeatedly  15 times in three days  and allegedly reduced the ransom amount to Rs 10 lakh during the last call, which came in at 1.25pm on Monday.        
	Irfans father Haji Abdul Aziz, 52, runs a dyeing unit on the ground floor of his two-storey house in Bankra. Eighteen people work in the unit.        
	Police said the boy, a Class III student of a local school, was last seen playing with friends in a field near his home.        
	Aziz went looking for his son around 5pm but could not find him. He enquired with Irfans friends but no one had a clue where he was.        
	At 9.20pm, a call came on Azizs cellphone. When a relative answered the call, the man on the other end asked for Azizda. On being told that he was not around, the caller abused the relative before saying: Tell him we have abducted his son. We want Rs 30 lakh.         
	Around midnight, the family lodged a police complaint. On Sunday, the family received 11 calls, which were traced to various phone booths in Metiabruz, Kidderpore, and Nazirganj in Howrah. The caller repeated that the boy would be returned only if the family coughed up Rs 30 lakh and warned Aziz not to contact the police.        
	On Monday, the family received four calls. During the last call, the kidnapper lowered the demand to Rs 10 lakh. The money must be brought in a red bag. The carrier must wear a black cap and sit in a trekker at the spot from where Domjur-bound vehicles leave, he told the family.        
	Police sources said they were keeping watch on the phone booths in the areas from where ransom calls were being made. That led to the boys rescue, said an officer.        
	On January 29, 2008, Yash Lakhotia, the seven-year-old son of a Howrah-based businessman, was abducted from near his school. His body was found two days later behind a bush off Foreshore Road.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City boy in capital bomb hoax
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City boy in capital bomb hoax
          OUR CORRESPONDENT IN NEW DELHI                              
	Hoax calls threatening to blow up planes in New Delhi have been traced to an HS examinee in Calcutta. The boy reportedly told cops that he made the calls as he was bored and unable to sleep.         
	Delhi police said on Tuesday that Debasish Banerjee, 18, had made two calls to IndiGo airlines on March 12 and 13.         
	On March 12 midnight, the police station of the domestic airport received a call about a bomb being placed on a Delhi-Bangalore IndiGo flight. Another call was received the following night at 3.25am about a bomb on IndiGo flight No. 6E183 from Delhi to Mumbai, said an officer. Both calls were initially received by the IndiGo call centre, he added.         
	A probe revealed that both calls were made from a cellphone number registered in Calcutta and a Delhi police team left for the city.         
	The sleuths, along with officers of Calcutta police, tracked down the person in whose name the cellphone number was registered, Kamal Banerjee, a resident of Belghoria.         
	Banerjee told the cops that his cellphone was with his son Debasish, who was appearing for the ongoing Higher Secondary exams. He said his son had taken the phone to listen to the radio. We then spoke to Debasish, who admitted that he had made the calls after noting down the toll-free call centre numbers of IndiGo from a hoarding, said the Delhi police officer.         
	The boy said since he was not feeling sleepy at night, he made a phone call about a bomb on board the flight. He also said he had made a similar call the following night, said the deputy commissioner of police (IGI), O.P. Mishra.         
	The police have filed a case against Debasish in a Dwarka court for spreading mischievous and false information. The cellphone from where the calls were made has been impounded by the police.

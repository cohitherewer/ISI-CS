The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Artworks fly off the wall
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Artworks fly off the wall
          SOMAK GHOSHAL                               
	Snaking queues, jostling crowds, urgent queries, high emotions: the opening day of the three-day Art Mela, organised by CIMA Gallery, proved to be a heady affair.        
	A restless mass of people spilled down the steps of the gallery on Friday morning even before the gates were opened on the dot of 11. And within the first half an hour, nearly all the big names had been sold out.        
	Crestfallen faces stared at the empty walls still bearing tags saying Lalu Prasad Shaw, Jogen Chowdhury, Suhas Roy and Ramananda Bandopadhyay. This quick disappearance was hardly surprising, given the incredibly affordable prices at which these paintings and sketches were given away.         
	Sonali, a first-time visitor to the fair, was not surprised by this craze for the modern masters, although she was strongly impressed by some of the younger artists as well. Sayak Mitras digital prints, in particular, caught her eye.        
	As the initial rush subsided, curious and appreciative glances were also cast at the newer, and less conventional, names. Tribal art from Madhya Pradesh and patachitra from Bengal seemed to be a great hit with the latecomers. Fashion designer Sarbari Dutta, for instance, was delighted to have picked up some exquisite drawings made by the members of various central Indian tribes.        
	The presence, and enthusiastic participation, of students and young professionals were also noted. Moumita Banerjee, a college-goer and a budding connoisseur of art, was all agog, full of questions about the provenance of distinctive styles and processes of printmaking.        
	But what impresses me most is the range of prices, she said, admiring some lovely animal paintings by Sumitro Basak selling at throwaway prices. I had scarcely imagined that I would be able to buy an original work of art suited to my paltry budget, she beamed.        
	It is always heartening to find common people, and especially the younger generation, showing such an avid interest in art, said Samir Aich, whose works are on display. Every artist hopes that his work would reach a wide cross-section of society, he added, looking at the ever-growing press of buyers around the payment counters.        
	Shakila, whose brooding but beautiful collages drew a lot of attention, was moved by the excitement as well. I like to attend this event because it is completely different from conventional art exhibitions, she said.        
	That the Art Mela has its own distinctive register is quite evident. The event tries to bring art closer to real life. Informal discussions are organised every evening on the gallery premises. It is during these sessions that visitors get a chance to exchange ideas with their favourite artists over a steaming cup of tea or coffee. And for those looking for something more, there are the delicacies of KC Das and even yummy phuchkas to tuck into.

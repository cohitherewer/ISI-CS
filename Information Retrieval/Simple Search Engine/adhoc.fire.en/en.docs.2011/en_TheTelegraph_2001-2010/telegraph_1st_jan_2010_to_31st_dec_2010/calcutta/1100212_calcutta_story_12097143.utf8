                      Shot on location                    Featuring a collection of images shot without any specific purpose, Double Exposure, the ongoing exhibition of photographs by Dr Gautam Basu and Suvomoy Mitra, is the result of the travels by the duo, either together or separately. An interesting aspect of the show is that a subject has often been shot from literally two very different points of view, offering disparate perspectives of the same idea. Nevertheless, all the images are direct representations of whatever the photographers actually saw. Not a single one has been digitally modified to suit aesthetic ends; each is pure, fresh and deeply meaningful. Offering double visions, parallel sights, differing inclinations and complementary styles, the works generate enough confusion and easy fun to the most casual observer.                  Event: An exhibition of photographs by Dr Gautam Basu and Suvomoy Mitra When: Till February 14; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, 2nd floor

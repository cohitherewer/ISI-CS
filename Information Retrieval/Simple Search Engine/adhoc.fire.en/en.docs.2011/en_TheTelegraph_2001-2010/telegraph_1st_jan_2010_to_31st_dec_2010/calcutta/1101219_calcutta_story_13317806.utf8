                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tagore versions
                            Kanu by Nandikar and (below) Usha Ganguli in Rangakarmees Chandalika				                                 
	Tagore with five and Tendulkar with four performances top the chart at the 27th Nandikar National Theatre Festival (December 16-25) at the Academy of Fine Arts. The festival was dedicated to Rabindranath Tagore for his upcoming 150th birth anniversary. The arrival of so many Vijay Tendulkar plays was unplanned, says Nandikar director Rudraprasad Sengupta.         
	The inaugural show saw a presentation of orchestration by Debojyoti Bose (sarod) and Bickram Ghosh (tabla) to show how while composing songs Tagore often created new ragas for which he could have taken credit had he not been so modest, said Bose.        
	On subsequent days there was a version of Tagores Raja, Raja ebong Anyanya, by Prachyanat, a group from Bangladesh and Tendulkars Kanyadaan directed by Bratya Basu for Swapnasuchana, Calcutta. Purba Paschims Raktakarabi, directed by film-maker Gautam Haldar was followed the same evening by Tendulkars Please Mat Jao by Third Bell of Bhopal.         
	Coming up on Sunday (December 19) is a play developed from Tagores poem Abhisar by Purbaranga of Guwahati. Says director Gunakar Dev Goswami: I was able to use it to show the modern generations obsession with power, pyar and paisa (love and money).         
	Tendulkars vintage plays, Sakharam Binder, produced by Himachal Culture Research Forum and Theatre Repertory, and Jaat Hi Poochho Sadhu Ki staged by NSD directed by Rajinder Nath will be staged on December 22 and 24 respectively.        
	Among the plays directed by their writers are Subodh Pattanaiks Fula on environmental issues by Natya Chetana of Bhubaneswar (December 19), Sushama Deshpandes Bayaa Daar Ughad based on the poetry of women saints of 13th and 18th centuries.         
	Kanu by Swatilekha Sengupta, about how the innocence of a young boy can illuminate a dark and selfish world, will be staged for the first time on the concluding day of the festival by Nandikar (December 25 at 3pm)               
	Lets get intimate        
	Calcutta will soon get intimate, the way London or New York is.         
	Theatre group Rangakarmee has drawn up plans to set up an intimate studio in the city, a small theatre with all the necessary technical requirements.         
	I was in London and I saw quite a few intimate studios. The Calcutta studio wont house more than 75-100 people, said Rangakarmee head Usha Ganguli.        
	The theatre, which we hope to open by 2012, will be named after veteran Bengal actresses from Bengal, Binodini Dasi and Keya Chakraborty, added Ganguli, now preparing for the 35th year celebrations of her group next year.         
	The actor-director recalled how Rangakarmee had started out in one room with 15 actors. Today it is one of the most renowned theatre groups in the country with over 300 actors and many powerful and experimental plays in its repertoire.         
	Ahead of Rabindranath Tagores 150th year celebrations, Rangakarmee will perform Chandalika in Hindi.         
	On January 16, its foundation day, Rangakarmee will invite noted actors to stage short performances to kick-start the intimate theatre trend, followed by a National Tagore Festival, Rabindra Natya Yatra, from February 3 to 6.                          SEBANTI SARKAR AND MADHURIMA CHATTERJEE

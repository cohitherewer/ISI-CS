The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Destination Kashmir
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Destination Kashmir
          SAIONEE CHAKRABORTY                                    
	A day after former Jammu amp; Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah went on a taxi adventure in the city, the northern states tourism minister came calling to woo Bengalis for an adventure of a different kind.         
	Bengal has been our main market. One lakh tourists from Bengal visited the Kashmir valley last year, said minister Nawang Rigzin.         
	Rigzin scoffed at reports of J amp;K being unsafe despite terrorists striking at the heart of Srinagar on Wednesday, killing a policeman and breaking a two-year lull in insurgency.         
	Kashmir is as safe as any other place in the country.... There are small agitations, which happen everywhere, even in Calcutta. In terms of militancy or insurgency, there has been nothing, he said.        
	Urging tourists to explore various destinations in J amp;K, Rigzin said: Sonmarg, Pahalgam and Gulmarg are popular with Bengali visitors. They should go to places like Verinag and Kokernag, too.        
	The minister also promised to urge J amp;K tourists to visit Bengal and announced 2010 as Visit Kashmir Year at a press meet organised by the J amp;K Tourism Development Corporation.        
	Tanveer Jehan, the secretary (tourism) of J amp;K, said: Bengalis unusually visit in October. But please come in April also, to see the best tulip gardens in Asia.        
	Asked about Abdullahs taxi ride from the airport to Salt Lake the day before, Rigzin laughed.        
	I would not blame the West Bengal government for any security lapse. He is known for this kind of flamboyance. He would just take off on his own. He often does this in Kashmir too, said the tourism minister.

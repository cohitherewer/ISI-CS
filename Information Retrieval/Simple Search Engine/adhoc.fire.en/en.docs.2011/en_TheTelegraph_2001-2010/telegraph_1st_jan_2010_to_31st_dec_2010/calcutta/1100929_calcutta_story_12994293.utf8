The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Girls inspire special cop team to take on harassers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Girls inspire special cop team to take on harassers
										      OUR BUREAU      Tt for city - STOP THAT                              
	Mrinalini, 23, had got off at Shyambazar Metro station to catch an auto home. Three young men near the auto stand started passing lewd remarks; one of them even brushed past her. Others stood and watched. She suffered in silence, not knowing who to turn to.        
	Now, help will be at hand for the countless Mrinalinis in the city as Calcutta police sets up a special team to tackle eve-teasers.        
	The wake-up call? The Safe City campaign launched in New Alipore on Saturday by harass victim Brinda Dasgupta, 22, and her friends, in partnership with Metro. The campaign aims to make one area in the city at a time safer for women to be in by raising awareness and taking the fight to the harassers.        
	Its a very welcome step taken by the girls. We can take action if more women protest against such wrongdoing, said police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	How will the new cop team work? One of the roles of the anti-rowdy squad is to take action against eve-teasers and so the officers in this section have formed a special team, said Chakrabarti. When we get such a complaint we will send the team to monitor the area for a few days or weeks. They will step up vigil and carry out arrests till women feel safe again.        
	In the Brinda case, vigil has been intensified in New Alipores F Block and a kiosk set up where she was harassed on September 16. The formation of a special cell is a very positive step. Harassers will be more cautious now, said Brinda.        
	The police advisory for women to stay safe would read something like this:        
	 On the move? Carry a pepper spray or deo.        
	 Home alone? Keep a mini fire extinguisher handy.        
	 Being followed on the road? Turn around and confront him. Ring the bell of the nearest house for help. (Never guide the stalker to your home.)        
	 Returning home at night? Avoid dark stretches, parking lots. Try and walk in a group or with a friend. If harassed, shout out. Run to the nearest place where you can find people.        
	 Being followed by a car? Switch to the opposite pavement. If the car is in your path, scream. Dont freeze.        
	 Being tailed by another car when youre at the wheel? Drive into the nearest public place, like a hospital or hotel, which always has guards. If stuck in a neighbourhood at night, blow the horn continuously.        
	 Living alone for weeks/months at a stretch? Install a door chain and a magic eye. Be extra careful while allowing plumbers, electricians and strangers in. Keep a phone handy.        
	 Want to complain? Go to the nearest police kiosk or police station, call 1090/100, contact the Womens Grievance Cell (22505175), fax the police commissioner (22145424), email him at cpkolkatapolice.gov.in.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Taxi operators on Friday deferred the indefinite strike which was to start from March 23 because of board exams.        
	We hadnt taken into account the board exams when we had announced the strike on Monday. We might strike after the exams are over, said Bimal Guha, the general secretary of the Bengal Taxi Association.         
	The strike was called to protest transport minister Ranjit Kundus refusal to raise the minimum taxi fare from Rs 22 to Rs 24 following a hike in fuel price.

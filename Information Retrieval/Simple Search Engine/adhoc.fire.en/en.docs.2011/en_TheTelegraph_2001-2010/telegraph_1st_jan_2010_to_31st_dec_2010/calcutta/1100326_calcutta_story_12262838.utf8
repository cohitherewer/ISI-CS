The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Their dad held on in hope
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Their dad held on in hope

	Sixty-five-year-old Radhakrishnan was holding on to the iron grille of the fourth floor of Stephen Court and hanging for nearly two minutes, hoping against hope that firemen would rescue him.        
	But that was not to be.        
	Some people threw him a rope but he failed to grab it thrice. Finally, in a desperate bid to escape the flames advancing behind him, Radhakrishnan took a plunge that turned out to be fatal.        
	There were no external injuries. My fathers cellphone and watch were intact. I think he suffered a heart attack before hitting the ground, said Radhakrishnans son Rajesh Nair.        
	Rajesh feels his father, who was head accountant at Guru Ispat, on the fourth floor of the building, could have been saved had the fire department brought the hydraulic crane or skylift in time.        
	It took 24 lives for the fire minister to realise the significance of keeping a skylift ready nearby. It is so sad, said Rajesh, a manager at a private firm in Salt Lake Sector V.        
	On Thursday afternoon, Rajesh brought his mother Girija and sister Dipa, who has arrived from Cairo where her husband works for a construction company, to the site of devastation. The Lake Gardens residents had their moist eyes fixed on the fourth floor of the desolate Stephen Court.        
	Rajesh pointed at the window through which he later learnt his father had come out on the parapet after remaining trapped in the office for several minutes.        
	He could come out because his cubicle was close to the window. His colleagues couldnt do that and most of them were charred to death, said the grieving son.        
	Rajesh was familiar with the layout of the office as he had been there several times.        
	Radhakrishnan had called his wife around 1.15pm on Tuesday. My mother later said he was in a good mood. That was their last conversation, added Rajesh, who broke the tragic news to his mother on Wednesday afternoon, an hour before the final rites.        
	The family had to be cautious as Girija was a heart patient and had undergone a bypass surgery a year ago. Rajesh said his father was a true Calcuttan, who had come to the city 42 years ago and never felt like going back to his hometown in Kerala.        
	Dipa felt thankful that her fathers body could at least be identified. There were many victims who were charred beyond recognition.

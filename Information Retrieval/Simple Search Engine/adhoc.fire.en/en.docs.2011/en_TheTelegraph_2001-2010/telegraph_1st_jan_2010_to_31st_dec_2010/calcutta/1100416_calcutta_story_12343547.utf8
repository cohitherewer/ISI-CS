The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Promise of rain, power breather
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Promise of rain, power breather
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Bearable weather and uninterrupted power supply for the first time in 10 days heralded Poila Baisakh in the city.        
	The maximum temperature remained normal for the fourth consecutive day on Wednesday at 36.1 degrees Celsius.         
	Chances are the mercury might dip below normal with the Met office predicting rain and thunderstorm on Friday.        
	Thunderstorm activity accompanied by rain is likely across the state in the next 24 hours. A Norwester, followed by rain, is likely in the city and its adjoining areas towards Friday evening or night, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Thunderstorm and rain should make the weather comfortable for a couple of days. Flow of abundant moisture from the Bay of Bengal has helped normalise the situation over the past four days, Debnath added.        
	For the first time since April 5, the city as well as the rest of the state did not suffer any power cut.        
	CESC successfully met the peak demand of 1,373MW, sending out 1,146MW and importing 227MW from the state grid.        
	There were no disruption in supply in the CESC-served areas on Friday. Poila Baisakh being a holiday, there was a significant drop in demand which help improve the situation, said an official of the utility.        
	Residents of Salt Lake were happy on Bengali New Years day.        
	Salt Lake has been the worst hit among urban areas since April 5. For the first time after 10 days there was no power cut during the day. We hope the situation will remain the same for the rest of the year, said AJ Block resident Kartik Chakraborty, 37, an engineer.        
	An official of the power department, however, sounded out a warning.        
	The demand was substantially less because of the improved weather and the fact that demand is much lower on such holidays. The situation might be dismal tomorrow, he said.

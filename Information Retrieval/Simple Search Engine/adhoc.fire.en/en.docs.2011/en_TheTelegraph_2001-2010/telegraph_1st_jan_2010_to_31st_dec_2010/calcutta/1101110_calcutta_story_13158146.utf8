                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Civic body eyes theatre halls
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Trinamul-run civic body wants to buy Uttam Mancha on Manoharpukur Road and take over the management of Ahindra Mancha which is now looked after by the information and culture department.        
	Mayor Sovan Chatterjee said talks on both halls were on.        
	Uttam Mancha was built in memory of Uttam Kumar following his death in 1980. But the ownership went to a nationalised bank after its private owners failed to repay their loan.        
	Sources said the Calcutta Municipal Corporation would have to pay as much as Rs 2 crore to buy the hall, which has around 800 seats. We hope the bank will offer us some concession, the mayor said.        
	Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi is said to have prevailed on the mayor to buy the hall in his locality.        
	Ahindra Mancha, named after stage actor Ahindra Chaudhury, was built by the Calcutta Improvement Trust in 1978. It had a revolving stage that stopped moving a decade ago.        
	Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said the mayor had approached him on the hall but added that everything depends on the culture department, which remains the chief ministers fief. Mayoral council member Firhad Hakim said an overhaul of the hall would cost Rs 50 lakh.

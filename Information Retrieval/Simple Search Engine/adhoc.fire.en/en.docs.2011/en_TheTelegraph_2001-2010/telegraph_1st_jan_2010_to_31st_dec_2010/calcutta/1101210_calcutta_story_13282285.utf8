	This is Surajnagar. A township that runs on renewable energy. We want our city to be like this, said Satantika Biswas of Class IV, as she pointed to a model town lit entirely by solar and tidal energy.        
	I try to stop the wastage of natural resources in simple ways. I tell my mother to reuse the water she has washed her vegetables in to water her potted plants, said Class IV student Dhriti Roy Chowdhury.        
	The message of conservation was loud and clear at Carmel Primary School, where classes I to IV organised an exhibition  Living in Harmony  on biodiversity, non-conventional energy and the adverse effects of plastics recently.        
	We are doing our bit to maintain a clean and safe environment. We wanted the students to learn through practical knowledge, said Sister Arpitha, the headmistress of the primary section.         
	An awareness rally was flagged off four days ahead of the exhibition, in which the tiny tots were dressed as animals and flowers to underline the need for an inclusive environment.

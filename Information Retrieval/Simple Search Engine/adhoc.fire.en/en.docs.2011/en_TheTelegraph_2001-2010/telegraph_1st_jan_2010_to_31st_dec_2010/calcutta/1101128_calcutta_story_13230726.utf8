The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Light at the end of tunnel 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Light at the end of tunnel 
                              Crossing hurdles: Sutanwi Lahiri                            
	Halfway into college, Sutanwi Lahiri did not know where her next years tuition fees would come from. Today, the Deshapriya Park girl is a scientific officer at the Bhaba Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in Mumbai, working on a secret government project on nuclear energy.         
	My father was ill for a long time and my mothers earnings were not enough to fund my studies at a private engineering college. When I cracked the joint entrance examination and wanted to study chemical engineering at the Haldia Institute of Technology, my mashi (aunt) stepped in, recounts the 23-year-old.         
	But her mashis husband retired after two years and Sutanwi was again without funds. Thats when the determined girl found out about the Udayan Shalini Fellowship and applied for it.         
	Launched five years back, the Shalini programme of the NGO Udayan helps meritorious needy girls with funds and mentoring to complete their studies in high school, college or vocational courses.         
	As part of the scholarship, Sutanwi received around Rs 18,000 a year plus the opportunity to attend various grooming and counselling workshops organised by Udayan. Add to that the affection, understanding and encouragement from her mentors and the Aamir Khan fan was all set to soar.         
	Statistics show that most girls drop out of school after Class X because of financial constraints, lack of guidance and parental pressure to get married. Another stumbling block is the passage from school to college. That is why we concentrate on these age groups, says astrologer and t2 columnist Kusum Bhandari, who is organising the induction of the latest batch of Shalinis.        
	The induction will be held at Kala Mandir on Sunday in the presence of governor M.K. Narayanan.

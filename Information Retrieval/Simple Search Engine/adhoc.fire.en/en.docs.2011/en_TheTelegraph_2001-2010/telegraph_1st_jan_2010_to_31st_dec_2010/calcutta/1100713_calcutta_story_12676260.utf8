The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CMC to levy drainage fee
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CMC to levy drainage fee
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Citizens and realtors planning to construct buildings will have to shell out a drainage development fee to the civic body while getting their plans sanctioned.        
	The Trinamul Congress-run civic body has reintroduced the fee scrapped two years ago, though the groundwork for the move was done by the previous Left Front board.        
	The mayoral council had last Friday ratified an enactment allowing the civic body to levy the drainage development fee, fixed at Rs 10 per square feet and to be collected while sanctioning building plans.        
	The fee will be collected with retrospective effect. The building department has been asked to collect the drainage development fee while sanctioning building proposals, said mayor Sovan Chatterjee, who also looks after the building department.        
	The fee will help create drainage infrastructure in the added areas which lack such facilities, the mayor added.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation sanctions more than 300 building plans in a year. Officials said the civic bodys annual revenue from the drainage development fee had been Rs 30 crore since 1999, when it was first levied.        
	In 2008, the high court had ordered the civic authorities to scrap the fee as the CMC Act did not have any provision for levying such charges. The ruling followed a petition by some realtors who challenged the legality of the fee.        
	The then mayor, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, had moved the Supreme Court challenging the high courts order.        
	In January 2009, the apex court returned the case to the high court. In its second ruling, the high court ruled that the CMC could collect the drainage fee after making proper legal provisions.        
	The municipal affairs department then brought about necessary amendments to the CMC Act, which subsequently got the governors nod.        
	Last week, the state government had written to the CMC, giving the go-ahead for the collection of the drainage fee.

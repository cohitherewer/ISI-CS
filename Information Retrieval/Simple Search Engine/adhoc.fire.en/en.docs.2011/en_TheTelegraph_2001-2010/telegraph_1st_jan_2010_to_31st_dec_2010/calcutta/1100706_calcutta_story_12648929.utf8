The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Welcome to city at standstill
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Welcome to city at standstill
                                  
	Thousands were inconvenienced and harassed as the 12-hour bandh called by Left parties to protest the fuel price hike brought the city to a halt on Monday. Metro checked out some key points of disruption

	The airport wore a deserted look as most of the flights scheduled to arrive or leave during the bandh were cancelled.        
	Only 45 flights operated (28 arrived and 17 took off) against a total of 100 on a normal day.        
	The food kiosks are closed and most of the Group D employees stayed away from work, a CISF inspector at the airport gate said during the strike.        
	Many passengers who arrived from Delhi at 9.30am were stranded at the airport. Some had to cough up exorbitant fares to reach their destinations. The touts are demanding Rs 500 to arrange for a taxi that will take me to Beleghata, said Mihir Ghosh, who arrived from Delhi.        
	Almost 95 per cent of the airport employees did not turn up for work today, said an official of the Airports Authority of India.        
	The air-conditioned buses and minibuses to and from the airport did not run during the day.              
	Trains                    A Sealdah platform that is usually a hive of activity is deserted      
	Countless passengers got stranded as many long-distance trains were cancelled, rescheduled or stopped on the way.        
	The Howrah-Mumbai Duronto Express and the Howrah-Mumbai Gitanjali Express were cancelled. Eastern Railway cancelled 26 long-distance trains in the Sealdah and Howrah divisions while South Eastern Railway cancelled 10.        
	The New Delhi-Howrah Rajdhani Express was stopped at Gomoh in Bihar around 8am while the New Delhi-Sealdah Rajdhani Express was stopped near Asansol around 8.45am. Both trains were allowed to leave in the evening.        
	Among the other trains that were stranded at Asansol were the Howrah-bound Upasana Express and the Tata-Chhapra Express as well as a few local trains.        
	Trains were stopped at several stations such as Rishra, Bhadreswar, Burdwan, Katwa, Dum Dum Junction and Naihati, said an Eastern Railway official.        
	RPF officers said that at some places they could persuade bandh-enforcers to lift the blockades and allow the stranded trains to move. The Howrah-bound Mithila Express, Yashwantpur Express and Kalka Mail were allowed to move after we had a talk with bandh-backers, said an officer.        
	The passengers of the trains that managed to reach the city could not leave the stations as the bandh had crippled public transport. We couldnt find a single taxi. Even the ferry service was shut, said Marie Dewevre, 60, a French tourist who had arrived at Howrah in a morning train from Bodh Gaya.        
	In France, we do have strikes. But the city never shuts down completely like this. The government makes adequate transport arrangements, added Marie, who walked along with friend Anne Marie Gibeaux, 65, to a hotel in central Calcutta.              
	Sector V                    A car is intercepted by bandh supporters in the tech hub      
	The attendance at IT companies in Salt Lake Sector V was 20 to 25 per cent less, said S. Ahmed, the chairman of the Nabadiganta Industrial Development Authority. One reason for the drop in turnout was that the firms serving American clients were closed on Monday because of the independence day holiday (July 4) in the US.        
	Several employees who had their offices open did not leave home following reports of trouble in some pockets.        
	The roads were empty. I was determined to attend office but reports of trouble in different parts of the city put me off, said a 30-year-old Dum Dum resident, who works in a software solutions company.                    Bandh enforcement with flag and stick at New Town      
	Most firms that functioned during the day got their employees ferried to office by 7am to avoid a face off with bandh supporters.        
	Citu supporters stopped some vehicles ferrying employees in front of Technopolis around 7.30am. The bandh-backers relented after Nabadiganta officials spoke to senior leaders.

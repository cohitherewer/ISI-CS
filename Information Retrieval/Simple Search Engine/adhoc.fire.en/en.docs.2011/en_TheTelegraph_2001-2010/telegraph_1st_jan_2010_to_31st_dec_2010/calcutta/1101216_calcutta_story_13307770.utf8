  - Calcutta Polo Season, from Dec. 17 to 25, promises big thrills          A STAFF REPORTER                                                         
	When over 100 horses trot into town, it must be for something big. And Calcutta Polo Season 2010 starting on Friday  organised by the Fort William Riding amp; Polo Club on behalf of the Headquarters Eastern Command, in association with The Telegraph  sure promises big. Big names and big thrills.        
	The city, which houses the oldest polo club in the world still in existence  Calcutta Polo Club  will host the season from December 17 to December 25 at the Pat Williamson Polo Grounds on the Maidan.        
	This is the only ground for modern polo in eastern India. And the oldest one in the world thats still in use, says Lt-Col Shakti Rathore of Eastern Command.        
	The action trots off at 2pm on Friday with a league match of The Rising Sun Polo Tournament (six goals). After another round of league matches on December 18, the finals of this tourney will be held on December 19. Then theres the 10-goal Fort William Challenge Polo Tournament (see box) and exhibition matches.         
	The season will draw to a close with the Army Commanders Cup on December 25. Calcutta has a rich tradition of equestrian sport  the city goes to the races on New Year and enjoys polo on Christmas, smiled Lt-Col Rathore, a +2 handicap player who will turn out for the Army Service Corps team.  
	One of the season highlights will be exhibition matches between two Manipuri teams, demonstrating the game of Sagol Kangjei, from which modern polo was developed by British army officers in the 1850s and 1860s.  
	The Manipuri teams, which play seven a side against a polo team rsquo;s four, will turn out in their traditional attire on December 23 and 25.   
	Some of the biggest names in India are expected to come to town for the matches, including three of the four-member Indian polo team mdash; Tarun Sirohi (+3 handicap), Ravi Rathore (+4) and Vishal Singh (+4). In polo, unlike golf, the higher the handicap the better the player.   
	Some others on horseback to watch out for are Vishal Chauhan, Ransher Singh and Jai Shergill.  
	After sundown, the action will shift from Pat Williamson to the cosy confines of pubs and discs across town, where budding players, polo enthusiasts and the glam brigade can rub shoulders with the best in the business.  
	A unique event is the stable dinner, to be held at the makeshift stalls set up under the maze of flyovers at Hastings. The season rsquo;s grand finale will be held at The Oberoi Grand with the Polo Ball on Christmas.

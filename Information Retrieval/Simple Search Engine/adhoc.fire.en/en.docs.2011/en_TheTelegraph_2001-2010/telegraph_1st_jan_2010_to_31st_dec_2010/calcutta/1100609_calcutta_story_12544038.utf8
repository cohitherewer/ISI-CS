          NALIN VERMA IN PATNA                                     Farzana   Alam		      
	Nalanda is waiting to greet its daughter Farzana Alam  Bihar ki beti, as she is lovingly referred to in her home district  who has been selected deputy mayor of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	Farzana, the second woman deputy mayor of the civic body in 86 years, has decided to come home to Kagzi Mohalla in Biharsharief, the headquarters of Nalanda district, a week after taking oath of office as councillor.        
	Yes, following pleas from family members and friends I have agreed to visit my native place on June 20. I am eager to meet my family and friends, said the 46-year-old.        
	She, however, asserted that she was very much a Calcutta woman and all her energies would be directed at improving the life of Calcuttans.        
	We are looking forward to welcoming her, said brother Khalid Alam Bhutto. Ours is a political family and she has inherited the trait. She has been actively involved in politics since her school days though she was good at studies, too.         
	Mother Roshan Ara, now in her 80s, is proud of her daughters feat. But we would have been happier had her father been alive. He would have been elated seeing her become so successful in Bengal politics.        
	Farzanas father Sadre Alam was a prominent Congress leader in Bihar, close to the late Satyendra Narayan Sinha, a former chief minister. His home served as a party office for decades till the 1980s.        
	Sadre Alam died in 1991 leaving behind five sons and five daughters. Farzana is the fourth sibling.        
	Farzana  who studied in Nalanda, also the home district of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, and Patna  thanks the liberal values of Bengal, Didi (Mamata Banerjee) and her husband (Abdul Momin, a lawyer) for her rise in politics. As a woman I was not supposed to take part in outdoor activities like politics. The women-friendly liberal values of Bengal helped me fulfil my aspirations, Farzana said.

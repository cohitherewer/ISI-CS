          A STAFF REPORTER                          One of the two children injured in Sundays mishap. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	A truck hit a woman, then the taxi she had just got down from and smashed through the guardrails of Chitpur bridge before falling with the cab on four vehicles parked five feet below.        
	Chhabi Prasad, in her mid-40s, died on the spot. She was returning from a hospital where her son is admitted.        
	Her two granddaughters, husband, other son, daughter-in-law and mother-in-law, who had got down from the taxi before her, escaped with bruises as they had moved away by the time the vehicles came crashing down.        
	Witnesses said the driver of the north-bound truck lost control on the northern slope of the Cossipore Road bridge while trying to avert a collision with a vehicle coming from the opposite direction.        
	The vehicle overtook a taxi and was about to collide with the truck. The truck driver veered left and rammed into a stationary taxi from which Chhabi and her family members had just got down, said Dharmesh Yadav, who lives in the locality. Chhabi was paying the taxi bill when the mishap occurred.        
	Bindubashini, the victims mother-in-law, said she and others in the group were heading for the stairway leading to Jagannath Temple Road below when they heard a bang and screams of a woman.         
	Then we saw the truck and the taxi tumbling down. I couldnt see my daughter-in-law anywhere.        
	The body was found under the truck when a crane lifted it. Chhabis head was smashed.        
	The drivers of the truck and the taxi fled. We are looking for the truck driver. We will find out whether the brakes of the truck had failed, said Dilip Banerjee, the deputy commissioner of police, traffic.        
	Traffic on the stretch was suspended for two hours.

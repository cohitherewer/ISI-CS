The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HC orders remote fume check
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HC orders remote fume check
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          A van fitted with a remote-sensing unit                                  
	The high court on Thursday asked the state government to buy more remote-sensing units within three months to keep tabs on vehicular emission in Calcutta, Howrah and North and South 24-Parganas.         
	The state will have to file a compliance report after procuring the machines, the bench comprising Chief Justice M.S. Shah and Justice K.J. Sengupta ruled.        
	A remote-sensing gadget, armed with photo-sensors and pollution checking units, can scan automobile emission without stopping vehicles. The gadget, usually fitted in a van, takes pictures of moving vehicles and simultaneously analyses the content of their tailpipe emission with the help of photo-sensors.        
	The order followed a statement by advocate-general Balai Ray that the government had bought a remote sensing unit to check vehicular pollution in Calcutta, Howrah and North and South 24-Parganas.        
	From November to May, the machine had tested 4 lakh vehicles in the city and the three districts. Around 37,000 vehicles were found to be grossly polluting. Action has been taken against them, Ray said.        
	The bench held that one machine was not enough for testing emission in four districts and directed the state to procure more such gadgets.        
	The court also directed the state pollution control board to find out whether auto-emission checks were carried out regularly and ordered the police, public vehicles department and the civic authorities of Calcutta and the three districts to provide adequate manpower to the board to perform the job.        
	The orders came during the hearing of a petition filed in 2005 by environment activist Subhash Dutta, who had alleged that trucks entering the city at night were a major source of pollution.        
	Dutta had suggested that the state be asked to stop the entry of trucks to the city. The trucks should be stopped at entry points and the goods ferried to the city in smaller vehicles, Dutta had said.

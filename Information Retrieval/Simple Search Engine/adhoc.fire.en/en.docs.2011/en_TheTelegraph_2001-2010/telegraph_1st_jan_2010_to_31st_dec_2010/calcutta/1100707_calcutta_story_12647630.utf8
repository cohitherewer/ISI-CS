The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Varsities prepare for UGC tag
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Varsities prepare for UGC tag
  - election triggers scurry to fill vacancies          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta and Jadavpur universities, which have already attained the University Grants Commissions centre of excellence status, are now preparing for another tag to be bestowed by the national watchdog  the centre with potential for excellence in a particular area.        
	The primary objective of the UGC in granting such status, which brings with it a cash grant of Rs 7 crore for five years, is to encourage universities to strengthen their academic and research facilities and promote the standard of teaching, learning and evaluation process in chosen areas with a multidisciplinary approach.        
	While CU has identified the department of biological sciences to develop it under the new scheme, JU has set up a committee to identify its thrust area before applying for the tag.        
	We have recently received a letter from the UGC asking us to submit a proposal for the centre with potential for excellence in a particular area status, said CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.         
	The scheme aims to help a department achieve international standards and serve as a benchmark for other institutions in the country. We have identified our biological science department as our thrust area.        
	Siddhartha Dutta, the pro vice-chancellor of JU, said: We are working overtime to complete the formalities and identify the department which we want to be awarded the special status.        
	A higher education department source said Calcutta and Jadavpur universities are among a dozen institutions across the country which the UGC has asked to apply for the centre with potential for excellence in a particular area status. The proposals have to reach the national body by July 30.        
	All 12 institutions had earlier achieved the centre of excellence honour. JU had won it in 2005 and CU two years later.        
	The fund of Rs 7 crore which a selected university will get has to be spent on project-oriented collaborative research in multidisciplinary activities, salaries for academic and research staff, and development of the library and faculty. The money cannot be used for setting up physical infrastructure, such as buildings.        
	Under the centre of excellence scheme, CU and JU had received Rs 30 crore each for five years.        
	The UGC has kept its doors open for all registered universities to apply for the centre with potential for excellence in a particular area scheme, provided they fulfil certain criteria.        
	The UGC has set a target to grant the tag to a maximum of 25 universities across the country in the Eleventh Plan period.

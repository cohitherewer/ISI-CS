The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Govt rules out fare hike
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Govt rules out fare hike
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The government on Wednesday ruled out a hike in the fares of buses, minibuses and taxis and warned the transporters of stern action if they went on strike.        
	At a meeting on Wednesday afternoon, transport minister Ranjit Kundu held his ground even as the operators threatened to pull vehicles off the road if the fares were not raised following the recent hike in fuel prices.        
	Some of the transporters walked out but senior leaders sat through the two-hour meeting. Kundu later said: The operators profit may reduce with the rise in the price of diesel but the situation does not warrant a fare hike.        
	The price of diesel has gone up by Rs 1.95 a litre to Rs 39.94 after the latest revision. The state government has decided to offer a subsidy of Re 1 for every litre of diesel consumed by taxis and buses. But the relief will be limited to 20 litres a day for taxis, and 50 litres for buses and minibuses.         
	Transport department officials said the operators were exaggerating their woes. They will not have to take vehicles off the road if the fares are not raised. Only their profit margin will come down to some extent, said an official.        
	Trinamul Congress MLA and the principal leader of the bus operators, Swarnakamal Saha, said: Every bus owner has to incur an additional burden of Rs 9,000 a month for every bus because of the fuel price rise.         
	Bus, minibus and taxi operators will meet on Thursday under the leadership of Saha to decide their course of action. The decision would be declared before next week.

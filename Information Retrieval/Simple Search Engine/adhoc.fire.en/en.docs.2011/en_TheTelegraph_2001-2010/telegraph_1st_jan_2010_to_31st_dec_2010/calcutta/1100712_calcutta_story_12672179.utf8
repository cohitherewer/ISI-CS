The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain relief from swelter
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rain relief from swelter
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The swelter over the past two days gave way to a comfortable weather on Sunday afternoon following a cloud cover and occasional rain, conditions that are likely to prevail over the next couple of days.        
	Rain is on the radar and the weather is likely to stay pleasant for at least another 48 hours, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The rain and the cloud cover were triggered by an upper-air low-pressure trough extending from east Uttar Pradesh to the north Bay, passing through Gangetic Bengal. The trough is likely to persist for a few days, Debnath said.        
	Sundays maximum temperature rose a degree above normal to 33.1 before spells of light to moderate rain brought the mercury down by two to three notches.        
	The minimum was three degrees above normal at 28.9 degrees Celsius.         
	Adding to the discomfort was the high humidity, which ranged between 90 and 74 per cent, normal for this time of the year.        
	High humidity is a precondition for normal rainfall in the monsoon, said an official in the India Meteorological Department.        
	The temperature had shot up because of clear skies over the past few days, which allowed unhindered heating of the surface by solar radiation.        
	The IMD has forecast heavy to very heavy rain in parts of Bengal over the next 48 hours but it does not foresee the same for the city.        
	The forecast is for the state as a whole and not specific to south Bengal. While some parts of the state might receive very heavy rain, Calcutta and its neighbourhood are likely to get a little more than moderate rainfall, said an official.        
	Monday, the weatherman said, will be partly cloudy, with possibility of rain or thundershowers in some areas in and around the city.         
	The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to dip by a degree or two because of the rain on Sunday evening.

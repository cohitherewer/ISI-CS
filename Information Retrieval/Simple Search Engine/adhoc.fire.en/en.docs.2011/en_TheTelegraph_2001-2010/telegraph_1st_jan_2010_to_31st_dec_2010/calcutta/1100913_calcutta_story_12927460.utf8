                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Agents default leaves doctors stranded
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Several doctors and their family members were left stranded on a Bangkok street for over six hours on Saturday night with the Thai partner of their Indian travel agent refusing to provide them with dinner and hotel accommodation.        
	Mridul Phukan, the Indian travel agent who had allegedly paid the Thai agency Rs 7 lakh less than what he should have, was arrested on Sunday morning after the members of the Urological Society of India (Eastern Zone), lodged a complaint with the airport police station on their return.        
	The urologists had gone to Pattaya in Thailand for a seminar from September 8-10. The doctors and their families  92 of them in all  flew to Bangkok on September 11 for a days stay.         
	Phukan, the CEO and owner of the Guwahati-based AM PM Travels, accompanied them throughout.        
	We had arrived late in Bangkok and so the local travel agent advised us to go on a city tour before checking in at the hotel, said Sekharjit Singh, the head of urology department at the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences, Imphal, and organising secretary of the conference.        
	Two coaches took them around the city and dropped them at a shopping mall at 8.45pm (local time). We were told we would be taken for dinner from the mall. We waited on the road outside the mall till 10.30pm but none contacted us. Some members of the group were in their 80s, said Singh.        
	The doctors then learnt that Phukan was yet to pay Rs 7 lakh to his Thai partner. The group went to the hotel but was not allowed to check in.        
	We were let in at 3.30am after we managed to raise the money and pay the local operator, Singh recalled.        
	A police officer said Phukan had admitted to not having paid the full amount to the Thai agent.        
	People should buy package tours only through agents registered with the International Air Transport Association to avoid such harassment, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.

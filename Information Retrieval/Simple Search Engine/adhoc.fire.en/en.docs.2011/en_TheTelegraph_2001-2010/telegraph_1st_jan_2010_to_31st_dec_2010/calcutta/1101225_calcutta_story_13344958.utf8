The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Onion as Santa gift
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Onion as Santa gift
          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          A buyer gets his free onions at the central Calcutta shop on Friday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	A computer accessories trader is cashing in on the spiralling price of onion, offering the bulb as a freebie with every item he is selling in the festive season.        
	The spurt in the footfall at his Metcalfe Street store in central Calcutta suggests Tushar Ramka could not have picked a more rewarding freebie, for himself as well as his customers. Onion sold at around Rs 65 a kg in the city on Christmas eve.         
	Yesterday we had 40-odd customers against the average daily turnout of 20-25 during this time of the year, said Ramka, the owner of Yashujee India Automation and manufacturer of ICON inkjet and laser toner cartridges.        
	The onion is among the most prized items now. So instead of giving a cake or a pendrive as Christmas present, as we did in previous years, we thought of gifting onions, said Ramka.        
	The deal: 2kg of onion for an ICON laser toner cartridge worth Rs 1,700; a kg of onion for a refill of the cartridge worth Rs 250-500; and half a kg of the crop for a refill of two inkjet cartridges worth Rs 300.        
	The shop has put up packets of onion at the entrance. Tied to them are pamphlets with the reassuring words: Stop crying over onion price hike, get it free.        
	The offer clinched the deal for Amit Sharma, a regular buyer of computer accessories. I was passing by when I saw the pamphlets at the store, announcing the offer. I had to buy a cartridge anyway, so why not from Yashujee where I would get two kg of onions free. Yesterday, I bought onions for Rs 70 a kg.

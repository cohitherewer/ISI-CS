                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Teacher bail plea rejected
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sanjay Smart. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The bail plea of Sanjay Smart, the La Martiniere for Boys teacher accused of demanding a laptop for promoting a student, was rejected in Bankshall court on Tuesday. He has been remanded in judicial custody till June 14.         
	Police had prayed that the teacher be kept in judicial custody to stop him from tampering with evidence.        
	Smarts lawyer claimed that the SMS the teacher had allegedly sent to the students father asking for a laptop had been tampered with.         
	The investigation is at an early stage. The accused may abscond. The other person named in the FIR, school principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi, is yet to be arrested, Basudeb Dutta, the public prosecutor, told the judge.         
	Smart was arrested on May 17. He was charged under sections 506 (criminal intimidation), 384 (extortion) and 109 (abetment of any offence) of the Indian Penal Code.        
	He had initially been remanded in police custody till May 28, and then in judicial custody till June 1. He had filed for anticipatory bail in the city sessions court and high court but his pleas were rejected.        
	Partha Pratim Banerjee, the father of 10-year-old Srijan, had filed an FIR with Shakespeare Sarani police station on April 2, accusing Smart of persecuting his son after being refused a laptop as bribe.         
	The teacher had apparently texted to Banerjee: Can you give me a laptop with Internet connection, I will be in constant touch with you and I can provide exam question papers.        
	Banerjee, fearing that Smart would target his son, sent him a second-hand desktop but that did not satisfy him. Srijan was twice detained in Class IV.

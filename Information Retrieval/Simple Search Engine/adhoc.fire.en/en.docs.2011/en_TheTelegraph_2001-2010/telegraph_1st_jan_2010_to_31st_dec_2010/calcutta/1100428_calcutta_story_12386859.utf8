                                                                                                                         3                                      Letters
                     
	I liked our beloved chief ministers slogan Do it now and in the same vein, I would say Legalise these now.                       
	Power theft: Community worship is a part and parcel of Calcutta and without proper illumination, the pandals will never be attractive. How power is supplied to these pandals is an open secret. Let the government legalise power theft and tap the devotee votebank.                     
	Power cuts: The government should make daily loadshedding mandatory as Marxists are supposed to shun all luxuries. Also, this way more power can be supplied for keeping the ACs on at Writers Buildings.                     
	Police harassment: A complaint lodged against a party cadre will never see the light of the day. The implication is that those speaking against the party bosses and their bodyguards are against the Marxist government and such non-Marxists must be harassed by the police as punishment.                     
	Indoctrination: After the Left came to power, schools, colleges, universities and educational boards have become branches of Alimuddin Street, the CPM headquarters. So, the indoctrination machinery should be legalised.                     
	Kalyan Mitra, Dhakuria                       
	Apropos Just do it on street illegal, dated April 24, after legalising hawkers by giving them identity cards in the run-up to the 2011 Assembly elections, the government could now turn its attention to legalising:             
	Country liquor dens           
	Eve-teasing           
	Bursting banned crackers on busy roads           
	Blaring microphones at all times           
	Honking near hospitals           
	Bribes           
	Copying in exam halls           
	Black marketing           
	The dowry system           
	But what a shame! How could the government think of issuing ID cards to hawkers, overlooking the inconvenience of pedestrians? Although the government and ruling party are one and the same, the administration should function independently of the party. After the Stephen Court blaze, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had pledged to take stern action against the vicious Circle responsible for the tragedy. But even after one month, he has done nothing on that count.           
	Asok Kumar Chatterjee,Konnagar, Hooghly                     
	Here is a short list to be added to Metros list of illegal things that may be legalised in the city, which believes whats wrong is whats right.           
	Using mobile phones while crossing a road or while driving           
	Overtaking by reckless drivers           
	Painting two-stroke autos green to pass them off as new LPG-run three wheelers           
	Attacking any vehicle, including a doctors car or an ambulance, for daring to defy a bandh call           
	Felling of trees           
	Blocking roads of any and every trivial matter so that even fire tenders cannot reach a fire site           
	Jaya Ghosh, Dr Sarat Banerjee Road                     
	Please add the following to the Metro list of things to be legalised in Calcutta:           
	Breaking public water taps, puncturing of water pipes           
	Nailing hoardings on trees and chopping off thick branches for better display           
	Storing sand and other building materials on the road never mind if it results in fatal accidents           
	Smoking pot and drinking hooch in local parks           
	Tapping electricity           
	Setting up clinics and pathological labs without the necessary checks           
	All these steps will surely help the Left retain power in Bengal!           
	A.S. Mehta, New Alipore                     
	I wish to add the following to the Metro list:           
	Legalise spitting on roads. In fact, the government should offer incentives for consuming pan masala, khaini and gutkha.           
	Legalise urinating in the open.           
	Legalise all makeshift auto stands that have come up on the important street corners, from Gariahat to Shyambazar.           
	Debasish Chatterjee, VIP Road                     
	The government should also legalise jumping signals on the road.           
	Nabi Kanta Jha, Sweden                     
	The government should legalise eve-teasing. Retaining this harmless-sounding term itself  elsewhere in the world its called sexual harassment  is indicative of how this serious menace is considered a trivial irritant. Any woman on the road, in a park, cinema hall, mall or commuting by bus or tram in Calcutta has no immunity from being groped, lunged at, pushed, or sidled up to. Everyone turns a blind eye, no one cares.           
	Raj Lalvani, Address not mentioned                               
	Apropos Hawker takes all in pavement war, April 22, I was shocked to learn that the state government is planning to issue identity cards to hawkers, thereby legitimising the illegal practice of occupying pavements meant for pedestrians. Earlier the fertile brain of the mayor had allowed hawkers to occupy one-third of the pavement to spread their wares, as if he had a mechanism to measure the portions occupied!             
	Pedestrian are forced to use the roads jeopardising their lives and           
	motorist are deprived of proper roadspace. I would urge the authorities to desist from issuing ID card to hawkers.           
	Swadesh Majumdar, Address not mentioned                               
	By giving ID cards to hawkers, the state government and CMC are yet again trying to legalise something illegal, guided by political pressure in view of upcoming municipal and Assembly elections. The opinion expressed by a senior official of the CMC in the article Hawker takes all in pavement war shows a strand of rational thinking which is usually absent among political groups. He says that by giving hawkers ID cards, they would become de facto title-holders of the public property they occupy. The official is right. Hawkers would occupy their illegal space on public property without having to buy it, or pay taxes for it, and hold on to it for generations.             
	Worse, a leader of a hawkers union has suggested that the ID cards bear the house number and postal address of the place where a hawker would ply his trade. This will ultimately translate into the hawker claiming ownership of the space in front of the house where he squats. The squatting will quickly move to erecting a semi-permanent structure, then a permanent one. Soon the hawker will stake claim to a part inside the premises as well, based on the address proof!

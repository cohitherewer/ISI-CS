          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University has chargesheeted a teacher of the biochemistry department who has been accused of molesting a student.        
	A sexual harassment complaints committee of the university, comprising a woman member of the syndicate, probed the allegation and recently submitted its report.        
	The teacher has been asked to give his views on the charges against him by December 15, a senior official of the university said.        
	The teachers reply will be placed before the syndicate, the institutions highest policy-making body. The syndicate will decide what action is to be taken against the teacher, said the official.        
	According to a ruling of the Supreme Court, a teacher found guilty of sexual harassment can be suspended or even dismissed.        
	A student of the biochemistry department had lodged a compliant stating that the teacher had molested her by trying to shove an ice cube into her dress in a laboratory in March.        
	The student said some of her classmates were playing with ice cubes after a practical class when the alleged molestation occurred.        
	Sources in the university said the teacher had confessed to throwing an ice cube at the student but without any bad intention.        
	Indubhusan Mondal, a reader at Calcutta Universitys Viharilal College of Home and Social Sciences in New Alipore, has been under suspension since the sexual harassment complaint committee found him guilty of harassing a student.        
	Mondal, a Bengali teacher, had molested the student in a computer laboratory in 2007. He had offered to train her in operating a computer after class. Not suspecting his motive, the girl accompanied Mondal to the laboratory, where he molested her.        
	Blockades: Cycle van and rickshaw pullers blocked the CIT Road-Beleghata Main Road crossing for 30 minutes from 1pm on Thursday protesting excessive prosecution by police. Also on Thursday, Trinamul supporters blocked Chiria More for around 15 minutes from 2.25pm demanding the arrest of a local goon.

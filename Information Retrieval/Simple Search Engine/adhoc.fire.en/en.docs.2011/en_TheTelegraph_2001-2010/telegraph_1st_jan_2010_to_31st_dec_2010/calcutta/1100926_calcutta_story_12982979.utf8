The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | What in, whats out this Puja
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      What in, whats out this Puja
                        Ekchala protima                                      
	PANDAL TREND  
	IN  
	Temples, not ethnic cottages, seem to be the abode of the goddess this Puja. While the Singhi Park pandal will be modelled on the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the FD Block puja in Salt Lake will recreate a temple that folklore says stood at the place before the township came up. Ekdalia Evergreen is bringing the famous Somnath temple of Gujarat to Calcutta.   
	Puja organisers are also going big with the Bengalis favourite theme for anything  Tagore. What better way to celebrate Rabindranath Tagores 150th birth anniversary than by dedicating Durga puja to him? gushed an organiser in south Calcutta.                                     
	OUT  
	Outlandish themes with an eye on awards. In 2006 Dakshinee Sangha made a pandal with 24,000 Horlicks bottles. Last year, Poddarnagar Sarbojanin Durgotsab had set up a pandal of noodles. Puja committees are aiming for neat pandals. Says Neelajan Deb of Deshapriya Park: Pujas that are held along the roads are still looking for innovation to draw the crowds, but those with more space want to create an ambience, tradition and ethnicity.  
	IDOL TREND  
	IN  
	Several organisers are going for the traditional ekchala protima (where Durga and her four children stand against one backdrop).   
	Usually only home pujas demand the ekchala protima. But this year I have received a lot of orders for ekchala protimas for even baroari (community) pujas, says Babu Pal, the joint secretary of the Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskrity Samity. At Samity president Nemai Pals studio, more than half the idols are being made in the ekchala form. Large eyes and a traditional round face are what the organisers want, says Nemai Pal. Think Baghbazar Sarbojanin.                          
	OUT            
	Theme idols. In 2006 a puja in south Calcutta had gifted the goddess a hint of African features and a darker complexion, Naomi Campbell-like.   
	Big faces, tiny hands, strange forms... all such monstrosities in the name of theme idols are out. Such idols were on their way out for the past two-three years, but this time they are out for good, smiles Babu Pal. Added an idol-maker at Kumartuli: They may have been good artwork, but we didnt enjoy making them as they didnt inspire devotion.                           
	CLOTHES  
	IN            
	For her: knee-length kurtas teamed with leggings in contrasting colours is a fashion must-have. Designer Agnimitra Paul suggests bright jewel tones like ruby and emerald. Discard the dupatta and pep it up with net as trimmings on a cotton kurta or sheer sleeves with a tunic. Jazz up your jeggings, denims and capris with funky festive tops and tunics. Just in case it rains, go for the easy-to-dry option in saris: glass nylon, net, chiffon or georgette .  
	For him: Dhotis and kurtas equal timeless sexy. You can experiment with Jodhpurs and jackets. Nil of designer duo Dev R Nil suggests a pair of patialas and slim pants.                           
	OUT  
	Long kurtas for women. Opt for a long kurta only if you are wearing an Anarkali, says Agnimitra. Men, stay away from acid washes, shiny shirts and figure hugging tees.             
	ACCESSORIES  
	IN  
	Statement pieces, statement pieces and more statement pieces. Invest in a big, chunky neckpiece or a large cocktail ring, advises jewellery designer Vasundhara Mantri. Resin jewellery is a good bet for the monsoon. Go big with the clutch or slip on a sling bag.   
	OUT  
	Chandelier earrings are as dated as Shilpa Shetty. Dump those potli bags. Choose your footwear with care. Rains dont give you the licence to slip into CROCS.   
	FOOD            
	IN  
	Seafood. Live crabs, pomfret, Basa fish (from Vietnam) and jumbo lobsters (1.5 to 2kg apiece) are on our Puja menu, says Rajesh Dubey, corporate chef, Speciality Restaurants, which is the parent company of Mainland China. Agrees Sharad Dewan, executive chef, The Park: Seafood is definitely in, despite the pocket pinch. This year we sold more ilish items than ever before. If the weather permits and the catch is good, ilish will be our top-seller during Puja, says Dewan.  
	If healthy equals stir-fried and steamed, it also means the barbecued and the grilled, well-marinated and flavoured with spices like aniseed, lemongrass, galangal and cinnamon. Instead of bhaaja, look out for bhapa, says Dewan.                     
	OUT  
	Fried food and red meat: Takers for red meat have dropped compared with even two years back. I expect ilish to do much better than kosha mangsho, says Dewan.  
	MUSIC amp; DANCE  
	IN            
	All things desi. Bring out your dandiya sticks. Practise that twist with the dhunuchi that made you the para stud last year. Be mindful of a creaking waist. The city will hold at least three big dandiyas during Puja. Durga puja and Diwali mean Bolly beats, says DJ Harish.   
	The song of the season is, of course, Munni badnam hui from Dabangg. I also expect a lot of remixes of old tracks, adds Harish. Being Puja, any number with dhol beats is an instant hit.         
	To match the music, keep your steps simple and easy, suggests choreographer Chandan Verma. The signature steps of Munni badnam hui and the title track of I Hate Luv Stories are hugely popular, he says. Reserve the chyangra steps for the bhashan.                           
	OUT  
	All your David Guettas and Shakiras. This is not the time for Inglis music.   
	HANG-OUT  
	IN            
	The sane leave town. The passionate hit the streets and let the swelling masses squash them till they reach the next big pandal. Overrated and much-derided it may be, but Maddox Square is still the first name that pops up when you think Puja hang-out. Ballygunge Cultural comes a close second.   
	South Calcutta scores over north when it comes to hangout options: Bagbazaar Sarbojanin, College Square and Md Ali Park may be crowdpullers, but at Maddox Square, Deshapriya Park, Jodhpur Park, Ballygunge Cultural and Samaj Sebi, the adda warms up. Those in Salt Lake swear by Laboni Estate.         
	Or carve out your own hangout zone at the para puja. Then go for a midnight snack at Flurys. The Park Street hub is open 24 hours on Saptami, Ashtami and Navami.                     
	OUT  
	Malls. You have completed your shopping well before Sashthi. So theres no excuse for going there. Give the movies a miss too.   
	HOLIDAY HEADWAY  
	IN            
	The ratio of people departing from and arriving in the city during the pujas is roughly 7:1, says Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India.   
	This October, Southeast Asia seems to be where the holiday-mood Calcuttan is headed. Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia are still topping the international destinations because its cheaper to go there than to Delhi or Mumbai.         
	Easy visas are also a factor  Thailand offers visa on arrival, Singapore and Malaysia ask for few documents for the visa to be processed. From October 13 till 27, Air Asia is sold out, says Punjabi.                   
	Vacationers are also checking out a bit of Europe  the UK, France, and even Switzerland, despite the chill, with the Eurail pass that takes you around Europe in 10 days or more. Domestic destinations on the in list are Delhi (for Vaishnodevi, Agra), Mumbai (for Goa), and Kerala. Closer home, Shillong and Mandarmani are pop picks.                          
	OUT  
	The hills: Darjeeling, the Bengalis favourite anytime-getaway, has seen a drop in tourist footfall because of the trouble in the hilly region. Shillong is a good option for those still wanting a walk in the clouds. Holiday spots in Maoist-affected areas are also off the Puja travellers map. The floods in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have robbed tourists of another hill destination.   
	WHAT TO DO  
	IN            
	Home is where the party is this festive season. Reserve one Puja evening for calling friends over, put up those pandal-worn feet and let your hair down. Home is also where you can party the longest, with the cops in no mood to extend the deadline for serving drinks on the festive nights at watering holes. Keep-it-simple is the mantra for house parties. The packed Puja schedule wont give me any time to put together an elaborate menu. Ill order in, says Suranjana, a software developer in Ballygunge.   
	Deck up your house. A string of fairy lights on the balcony can be your party strobes for the night.                           
	OUT  
	Partying at a disc like it was just any Saturday night.   
	THE BUZZ  
	IN  
	You cant get through the para pandal adda without debating who is hotter: Priyanka Chopra or Akshay Kumar as the host of Khatron Ke Khiladi. Says Salt Lake resident Neha Dutta: Piggy Chops is looking hot, but shes more about flirting with the contestants than flirting with danger. Akshay did that and how! Husband Ajay disagrees. Which other woman, let alone heroine, has such guts (and legs)? he demands. The argument continues.   
	Commonwealth Games and its can of worms are sure to find their way into your adda too.                           
	OUT  
	Discussing Sourav Ganguly the quizmaster is so last season. During the happy days of Durga puja, give the poribartaner hawa a break. Steer clear of political talk.

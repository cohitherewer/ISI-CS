                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court heat on police officer 
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                              
	The consumer court of North 24-Parganas on Thursday asked the officer-in-charge of airport police station to appear before it and explain why he had not complied with an order to arrest three promoters.         
	The judge had ordered the arrest of the three promoters a month ago after they flouted an order to compensate a man they had duped.         
	Shyamal Mukherjee, the resident of Salua, under Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, had purchased a three-cottah plot in the BH block of the civic body in 2007. He had paid the trio  Parthapratim Bose, Babla Mondal and Biswajit Samui  Rs 3.3 lakh to build a house on the plot.        
	From the first day of construction, they had not been following the sanctioned plan. Every time I asked them about the violations, Bose assured me that his relative was a councillor of the municipality and hence, I would not face any problem, said Mukherjee.         
	He refused to take possession of the house when it was completed in 2009 because sub-standard materials had been used to build it.        
	Mukherjees counsel T.J. Banerjee said: My client moved the district consumer court in mid-2009. When the case was turned down, he moved the state commission. We won there and the state commission asked the district court to take steps so that my client was compensated Rs 3.2 lakh.        
	The officer-in-charge, Tapan Mishra, refused comment.        
	The superintendent of North 24-Parganas police, Rahul Srivastava, said: We will abide by the court order.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civet in hospital cabin
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Civet in hospital cabin
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A civet was caught in a cabin reserved for VVIPs in the Woodburn block of SSKM Hospital on Monday afternoon.        
	Hospital officials suspected that a thief had broken into the locked cabin after noticing that a portion of its false ceiling had collapsed and alerted police.        
	Cops opened the door to find the civet, about 2ft long and 1ft tall, inside.        
	Forest department officials later caught the animal with a pair of tongs after throwing a piece of cloth over it.        
	How the civet entered the room and broke the false ceiling could not be ascertained. The civet also damaged the air-conditioner in the cabin and a dressing table.

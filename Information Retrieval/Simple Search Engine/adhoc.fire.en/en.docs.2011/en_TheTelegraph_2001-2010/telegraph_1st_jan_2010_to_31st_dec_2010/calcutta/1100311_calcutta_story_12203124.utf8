                One person died and three were injured on Wednesday morning allegedly while they were making bombs in the Chhainabhi area of Salt Lakes ward 23. Police said Sujit Saha, 32, who lost his limbs in the explosion, died on way to RG Kar hospital. Shankar Roy, Suman Das and Samir Nath were admitted with burns. The blast occurred in a deserted one-storey house near a CPM office, said an officer. The cops suspect the bombs and a revolver found at the blast site were being stored for the Bidhannagar municipal polls.     Jayanta Patra, 22, was found hanging in the kitchen of NRS hospital on Wednesday. Police said the resident of Baleswar in Orissa worked as a contract cook at the hospital. A suicide note said Patra was suffering from depression after he broke up with his girlfriend in Orissa.     The high court on Wednesday issued an interim stay on a police investigation against the CMC ordered by a Sealdah court on the basis of a complaint by Eastern Railway. The railway had alleged that some of its officials were beaten up by CMC hooligans when they went to measure a plot in Ultadanga, where 450 shanties were gutted recently.   The police is directed to stop investigating the alleged harassment of some railway employees by some people till March 26, when the case will come up for hearing again, said Justice Asim Roy in his order. The civic body had appealed against the earlier order.    A 55-year-old security guard was found dead on Wednesday in front of the private company he worked for in Sonarpur. Police said Ram Avatars head was smashed. Cops are probing whether he was killed by robbers in a bid to enter the office.

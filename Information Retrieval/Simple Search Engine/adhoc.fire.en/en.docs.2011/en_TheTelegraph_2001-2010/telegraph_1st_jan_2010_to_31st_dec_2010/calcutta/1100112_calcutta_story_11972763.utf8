                      Musical homage to Swamiji                                    Amusician par excellence, Swami Vivekananda believed that music is the highest form of worship. His belief was rooted to his self-realisation and, of course, on Indian mythology, philosophy and science. According to their principles, a living human body is the micro-cosmic representation of the macro-cosmic universe. Omkaar, the anaahat (un-struck) aadi-naad (first sound), is operative through the subtlest nerve (sushumna) inside the spinal cord of a living being. This celestial, un-struck sound becomes aahat by means of a stroke or friction of objects, nerves or vocal cords. Such sound, organised and harmonised, is the base of transient worldly music. But moving from the broad-based sound-waves to the finely-tuned waves, this worldly music again moves towards celestial purity  towards the Almighty God. To mark the auspicious occasion of Swamijis 147th birth anniversary, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture hosts a day-long festival of music, featuring performances by both veteran and upcoming artistes. Programme: Pushpraj Kosthi (surbahar), Jaytirth Mevundi (vocal) and a saxophone-flute duet by Kadri Gopal Nath and Ronu Majumdar during the morning session, beginning at 9 am. Odissi dance by the troupe of Orissa Dance Academy, Rais Khan (sitar), and Farhan Khan (sitar) in the afternoon session, beginning at 2 pm. The evening session starts at 6 pm and features performances by Rashid Khan (vocal) and Hari Prasad Chaurasia (flute).

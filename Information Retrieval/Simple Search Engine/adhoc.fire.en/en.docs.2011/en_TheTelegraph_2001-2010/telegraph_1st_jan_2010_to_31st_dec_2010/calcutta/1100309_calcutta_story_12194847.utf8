                      Creations on silk                    In Latin, seri means silk, and in Greek, graphos means to draw. Thus, a serigraph is a fine art print, which has been produced using the screen-printing method. The serigraphs in the ongoing show, The Complete Collection  an exhibition of Limited Edition Serigraphs, by Sakti Burman are made using inks and paper of archival quality. All the serigraphs are numbered, titled and signed by the artist himself. Each serigraph is accompanied by an individual Certificate of Authenticity, giving details about the title, image size, paper size, paper quality, edition, year of release, and assuring that only archival materials have been used in the making of this serigraph and guaranteeing that no more serigraphs of the same image will be produced. In Burmans art, the past is never past, nor is it ever singular. Various Indian and European pasts inhabit the floating present tense of his paintings and serigraphs: they are spoken and acted in his frames by protagonists drawn from Greek and Hindu mythology, west European art history, Bengali popular culture and family folklore. The Mughal gardens that once surrounded the Taj Mahal are re-animated here, as are pastoral scenes of revelry by the rivers of France, both visions long lost under the impact of industrial modernity and its ideology of relentless speed and progress.                  lEvent: An exhibition of limited edition serigraphs by Sakti Burman lWhen: Till March 13; 11 am - 8 pm lWhere: Gallery Sanskriti, 5C Alipore Park Road

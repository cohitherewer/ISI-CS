The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 1500 doctors back to work
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      1500 doctors back to work
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Junior doctors in four medical colleges in the city withdrew their ceasework on Tuesday evening following a threat from the chief minister and a plea from the health minister.        
	The decision was announced after 10 representatives of the junior doctors met medical education director S.N. Banerjee and police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, and around 700 protesters marched from Calcutta Medical College and Hospital to Shahid Minar.        
	More than 1,500 junior doctors had struck work at SSKM, Calcutta Medical, RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and National Medical College and Hospital, demanding safety on campus. The ceasework was triggered by an assault on some junior doctors by relatives of a patient who died at SSKM on Saturday morning.        
	The authorities have promised to improve the infrastructure of the hospitals, ensure supply of emergency medicines and boost security on campus. So we have decided to call off the strike. The situation will soon be reviewed, Avishek Samaddar, a house staff at RG Kar, said at the Shahid Minar ground at 5.30pm.        
	We apologise to the people for the inconvenience... we had no option but to go on strike, said Saikat Mitra, a junior doctor at SSKM.        
	The doctors claimed that they had been promised CCTVs in all wards and within and outside the emergency department but Lalbazar did not seem so sure.        
	We have heard out the junior doctors. A meeting, chaired by the home secretary, will be held on Wednesday to decide what steps need to be taken. There are some CCTVs in the hospitals. We will find out how they are working. Some more may be installed, said Javed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police.        
	On Monday, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had urged the striking doctors to resume work, failing which the government would take stern action against them.        
	On Tuesday, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said: I beg the junior doctors to call off the strike.        
	Bhattacharjee was unsure whether his threat would work, even after the governments noon deadline for doctors to return to work had passed. Dekhun ki hoy (Lets see what happens), he said at 1.30pm, when asked whether normality would be restored in the four medical colleges.        
	By evening, the hint of a smile was back. Yes, yes, the CM said when asked whether the strike had been called off.

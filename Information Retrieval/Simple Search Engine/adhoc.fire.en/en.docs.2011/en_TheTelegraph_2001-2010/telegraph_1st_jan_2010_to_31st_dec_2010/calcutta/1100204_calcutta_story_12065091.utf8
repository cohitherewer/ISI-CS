The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pragati hits, Milon misses
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pragati hits, Milon misses

	Mamata Banerjees dream of converting Milon Mela into a Pragati Maidan might not come true anytime soon, but the agency responsible for the Bypass site would do well to take a leaf out of its national counterpart that maintains Delhis permanent fairground.        
	India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) officials said the process of booking space for stalls at Delhis Pragati Maidan required all participants to mention micro details of their requirements, including power consumption, much ahead of the fair.        
	This ensures that there is no communication gap or misunderstanding at any point, said Jayanta Sengupta, the marketing manager of ITPO. The system is not unique to Pragati Maidan. We follow this wherever we let out a space for fairs, including in metros such as Chennai.        
	Sources said such rigorous advance check was never carried out by the West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation (WBTPO), the custodian of Milon Mela.        
	The 34th Calcutta Book Fair at Milon Mela has around 600 stalls, against the 2,000-odd stalls at World Book Fair which is being held at Pragati Maidan. But the city fair has been stumbling from one glitch to another since its inauguration on January 26, culminating in the night-long blackout on Saturday, something unheard of in the much bigger event in the capital.        
	At Pragati Maidan, the participants have to inform the ITPO about the number of halogen and spotlights they will use. We make arrangements accordingly. Besides, there are substations on the premises to take care of any sudden spurt in demand, said a senior ITPO official.        
	As for Calcutta Book Fair, sources in WBTPO said the Publishers and Booksellers Guild had only given them a rough estimate of the power requirement. We went ahead with the assumption that a transformer that had been recently installed on the ground would ensure uninterrupted supply, said an official.        
	Saturdays dark disaster has prompted the government to instal another transformer but it seems to be a temporary arrangement.        
	Also, unlike the Delhi body, WBTPO does not have any crowd management plan.        
	There are 19 permanent halls at Pragati Maidan with a total built-up area of 60,000 square metre. Stalls can be set up only on 60 per cent of the space and the rest has to be left open for crowd movement, the ITPO official said.        
	The WBTPO pleads helplessness in preparing a crowd management plan, citing a staff crunch. Those on the job are on deputation from the state industrial development corporation. Besides, this is the second Book Fair at Milon Mela and we are far from ready, said an official.

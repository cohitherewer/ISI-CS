                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Call centre gutted in morning blaze
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The office after the blaze. (Tamaghna Banerjee)                                  
	An Elliot Road call centre that had worked till 4 on Sunday morning was gutted in a blaze that broke out barely two hours later, possibly following a short-circuit in an air-conditioner.        
	The sound of breaking window panes woke up local residents who saw to their horror thick black smoke billowing out of the windows of the 1,200sq ft fourth-floor office in the seven-storey Omar Khayyam Palace.        
	The central Calcutta building also houses a hosiery factory, a Montessori and residential apartments.        
	I was jolted out of my sleep by the sound of a glass being shattered and looked out of my window, recalled Mohammed Haider Ali, who lives in a nearby building. The locality was covered by smoke. I immediately called up the emergency helpline numbers of the police and fire brigade.        
	The call centre, belonging to Global IT Consultants, works for companies in the UK and Australia and deals in knowledge and telecom outsourcing. It has been working out of the building for the past 11 months.        
	Our employees had worked till 4am. After that, we shut down the office and left. Thankfully, no one was in the office when the fire broke out. All our computers, furniture and valuable documents have been gutted, said an official of the company who did not want to be named.        
	Residents said firemen reached the spot within minutes of the first call. Six tenders doused the flames in two hours.        
	Fire officers later lodged an FIR with Park Street police station, alleging poor fire-safety measures in the office.        
	The office was stacked with computers, electronic goods, papers and wooden furniture. There was also a false ceiling with papers and cartons stacked on it. The office lacks fire-safety measures. There was not even an emergency exit, said an officer.        
	The company official, however, said there were fire extinguishers in the office. We would have upgraded our safety measures soon.        
	Fire department sources said the blaze seemed to have been triggered by a short-circuit in an air-conditioner. A forensic team will visit the office on Monday.        
	Sheikh Anwar Ali, whose father owns Omar Khayyam Palace, said the building now housed 10 residential flats and 15 commercial establishments.        
	Civic director-general (building) Debasis Kar visited the building later in the day and promised to look into its papers.                                                              
	The power supply to the building was switched off by the CESC till late on Sunday.                          
	The residents of the building also raised questions about its safety and the presence of the unauthorised commercial establishments.        
	There were only residential flats in the building when it was built in 1974. However, over the years, the commercial establishments have outnumbered the residential apartments. There are offices schools and even factories in the building, said Abhijit Saha, a resident.        
	All these offices run air-conditioners and there have been several small fires in the building earlier. Just imagine what would have happened had the fire broken out at night, he added.

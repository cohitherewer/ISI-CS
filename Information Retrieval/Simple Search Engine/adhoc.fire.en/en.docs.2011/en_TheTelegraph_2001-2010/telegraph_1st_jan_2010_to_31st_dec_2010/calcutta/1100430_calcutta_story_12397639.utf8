  - Charger amp; I-card pop out after two hours          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Calcutta polices bomb disposal squad was tested for two-and-a-half hours on Thursday afternoon by a briefcase containing a cellphone charger and a voter identity card that was found abandoned on a city pavement, coinciding with a terror alert.        
	By the time the mystery of someones missing briefcase was solved, traffic along the busy Shakespeare Sarani stretch was thrown haywire while man, machine and sniffer dogs stood on the Maidan staring at the harmless articles that an X-ray scan had shown to be a possible circuit.        
	The X-ray scan around 4.40pm confirmed that there were no explosives inside the briefcase but it did indicate that there could be a circuit, complicating things, said an officer of the bomb squad.        
	The identity card revealed trader Tekan Chand Dugar, 80, as the owner of the briefcase. He had lodged a complaint with Bhowanipore police station after losing the bag in the afternoon. The person who stole it took the Rs 8,000 he found in the briefcase and dumped it on the pavement, said an officer.        
	Shakespeare Sarani police station received a call around 3.15pm about the abandoned bag being found on the pavement next to Sri Aurobindo Bhavan, opposite The Kenilworth hotel. But it wasnt until 5.40pm that the suspense ended. We needed a bomb trailer to carry the bag to the Maidan. The trailer was delayed because of traffic snarls, claimed an officer.        
	Lalbazar has convened an emergency meeting with mall managers on Friday to discuss security issues. Home secretary Ardhendu Sen confirmed that the government had received intelligence on a possible terror attack at the airport.        
	Security has been stepped up in crowded places and marketplaces.

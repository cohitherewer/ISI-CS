                      Abuse of womanhood                    Based on a little-known story from The Mahabharata, Nandikars Madhabi tells the tragic tale of its eponymous heroine, who is consciously used by different men as a pawn to serve their individual, selfish ends. Reaffirming the truth that men have always repressed, exploited and dominated the lives of their womenfolk, the story uncovers the tempestuous journey of a woman who confronts a hierarchy that is steeped in moral pretence and demonic in its desperation for status and power. Expected to fulfil the impossible, both in duty and in love, Madhabi raises questions on faith, on her identity, and on being used, abused and misused over and over again. The play shows how women, represented by Madhabi, have functioned as a substitute for money whenever there has been a clash of male egos. Drama: Bhisma Sahni. Adaptation, music and direction: Swatilekha Sengupta.

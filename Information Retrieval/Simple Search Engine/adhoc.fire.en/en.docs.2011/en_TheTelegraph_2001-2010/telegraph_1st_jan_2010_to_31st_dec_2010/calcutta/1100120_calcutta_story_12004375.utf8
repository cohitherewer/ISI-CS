The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chaos mars starry salute
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Chaos mars starry salute
          KUSHALI NAG                  
	Unruly behaviour by a gang of lawyers and lapses in crowd management sullied Jyoti Basus final farewell in the Assembly on Tuesday afternoon.        
	The 400-strong group of lawyers tried to barge in through the north gate of the Assembly to pay homage to Basu, causing chaos that even threatened to turn into a stampede.        
	Actor Biplab Chatterjee fainted while stage veteran Usha Ganguli and singer Usha Uthup almost tripped in the crowd crush.        
	Earlier, mourners as well as sources in police had alleged that minister Kanti Ganguly was letting his people enter the Assembly complex through the north gate, which was reserved for VIPs.        
	The mourners in the queue demanded that they, too, be let in through the north gate. This led to a jostle which left a few people injured. The police commissioner was very upset over the developments, said an officer who did not want to be named.        
	Sources blamed the chaos on the clash of egos between the police chief and the minister.        
	Ganguly denied the allegation, saying: I helped the police commissioner bring the situation under control.        
	The minister was also responsible for managing the Tollywood stars, who had walked to the Assembly from Netaji Indoor Stadium.        
	The artistes were waiting outside the north gate, which was then closed, when a few lawyers demanded that they be allowed to enter first.         
	Suddenly, around 400 lawyers who had been gathering there for some time tried to force themselves in.        
	The artistes  including Debasree Roy, Usha Uthup, Usha Ganguli, Jeet, Arindam Sil, Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Rimjhim Mitra, Anindita Sarbadhicari, Badshah Moitra and Kanchan Mullick  got trapped in the melee.        
	Please dont push. Listen to me. We cannot enter like this, Sabyasachi shouted, as he and his colleagues were being pushed from all sides. Witnesses said there could have been a stampede had not the gate been opened in time.        
	Biplap Chatterjee fainted and was carried to a police van stationed nearby. The actor and CPM man, however, regained consciousness shortly and joined his team.        
	Even if one person had tripped, there could have been a tragedy. How could lawyers, of all people, be so irresponsible? wondered Arindam Sil, who had invited the stars on minister Gangulys request to be present in the Assembly to pay homage to Basu.        
	I was worried about the two ladies in front of me. People were pushing from all corners. The security arrangement should have been better, said Jeet.        
	Debasree Roy did not go up to the podium where Basus body was kept. Anything could have happened. I was so nervous and scared, she was heard telling Usha Uthup.        
	The only Tolly star who escaped the chaos was Rituparna Sengupta, who arrived around 3pm. The security people knew my car number and when I would arrive. So, they made arrangements accordingly.                    WITH INPUTS FROM MOHUA DAS, IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

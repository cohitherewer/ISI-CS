                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Buddha prod for second zoo
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Wednesday instructed the forest department to speed up work for the construction of a satellite zoo near Sonarpur in South 24-Parganas.        
	The issue was discussed at a meeting of the Wildlife Advisory Board, presided over by the chief minister, at Writers Buildings.        
	State forest minister Ananta Roy said after the meeting: The chief minister wants the satellite zoo constructed at the earliest. He told us at todays meeting that disputes relating to land acquisition in Sonarpur should be settled quickly and the construction work started. We will need 390 acres and the project cost will be about Rs 11 crore.        
	According to him, the plot earmarked for the satellite zoo has human settlements for decades. These people are demanding compensation and a job for each evicted family. We are not averse to paying compensation. But providing jobs is difficult and we cannot agree to that. If the Sonarpur land creates problems for us, the chief minister told us to look at other locations in South 24-Parganas.         
	The state government plans to transfer tigers, crocodiles and hippopotamuses from the Alipore zoo to the satellite one. In the satellite zoo, tigers will be able to roam freely, unlike in Alipore. However, visitors will not be able to go on a safari in the Sonarpur zoo, added Roy.

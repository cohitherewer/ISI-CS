                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Five farewell stops

	The stops on Jyoti Basus final journey were thronged by faces known and unknown. A few got close to the leader, most couldnt. Metro provides glimpses of what went on:                
	Alimuddin Street: More than a hundred top CPM leaders from across the country were waiting at Muzaffar Ahmed Bhavan, the party headquarters on Alimuddin Street, when Basus body reached there around 8.05am. The former chief minister had last set foot in the building on February 21, 2009.         
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Prakash Karat, Brinda Karat and Sitaram Yechury carried Basus body inside and placed it on an ice slab wrapped in a red cloth bearing the party symbol on a table in the portico. Veteran leader Samar Mukherjee was the first to offer respects. When his turn came, Sukhendu Panigrahi took out a comb from his pocket and combed Basus hair.        
	Around 9am, Bhattacharjee, the Karats, Yechury, Nirupam Sen and Surjya Kanta Mishra carried the body outside amid slogans and placed it on a truck, decorated with a large cut-out of Basu and flowers.         
	Writers Buildings: Jyoti Basu the chief minister used to reach Writers Buildings at 11am sharp. On Tuesday, he was an hour and two minutes early. Current chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who had come to office even earlier at 8.57am, was waiting for the body at the central gate along with other ministers and senior officials.        
	As the chief minister and chief secretary placed wreaths on a chair near the body, onlookers raised the slogan: Jyoti Basu amar rahe Jyoti Basu tomake amra bhulini bhulbo na.        
	The bells of the adjacent St Andrews church rang to announce it was 10am  time for the hearse to move on to the Assembly.        
	In the commotion, some common people managed to sneak inside the barricade in the hope of offering their last respects to the leader. But that was not to be.        
	One of those who broke the barricade, a middle-aged employee of the health department, said she along with two colleagues had been waiting on the road since 6am to place a wreath near Basus body. We must pay our respect to someone who guided us for so long, they said and headed for the Assembly, wreath in hand.        
	Assembly: The cortege arrived at the Assembly around 10.35am, where scores of VIPs and thousands of commoners were waiting. The body was placed on a podium at the entrance to the west verandah, opposite the lawn where Basu had laid the foundation stone for a new building.        
	The queue of ordinary visitors started moving past the body soon after armymen draped Basu in a national flag. As the wreaths mounted at the foot of the bed, many complained that they could not see the body at all.        
	An army officer who stood guard on the podium took cellphones from visitors and clicked pictures of the body for them. Even VVIPs lingered on the podium and clicked pictures on their cellphones.        
	By the time the body was carried out at 3.25pm, the single file of common visitors had increased to five.        
	He was the last surviving member of the nine founders of the CPM, said Sandwep, the 32-year-old grandson of party co-founder Harkishen Singh Surjeet who flew in from Delhi.         
	Citizens Park: The gathering outside Citizens Park was the largest among all the stops on the way to SSKM Hospital. The sight of the army gun carriage heading to the park gate around 4.20pm prompted people to break the police barricade on the other flank of the road and rush to the median divider. They squatted on the ground straining for a last look at the leader till the vehicle started for SSKM with his body around 4.40pm.        
	SSKM Hospital: Hundreds of people had been waiting outside SSKM Hospital for hours when Basus body arrived around 4.45pm. Inside, hospital employees had gathered to see the former chief minister for the last time.        
	Six armymen carried the body from the gun carriage and placed it on a flower-bedecked stretcher and removed the national flag. Four hospital employees carried the body into the anatomy department. The door closed at 4.48pm.

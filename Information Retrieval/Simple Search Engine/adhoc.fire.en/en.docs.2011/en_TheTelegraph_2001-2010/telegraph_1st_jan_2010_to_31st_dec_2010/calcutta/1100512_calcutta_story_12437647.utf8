          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Students of the Vinod Gupta School of Management at IIT Kharagpur have notched up prized placements, a sign of the B-school coming out of downturn blues.        
	The final placement,which began in December, saw students bagging an average salary of Rs 11.37 lakh per annum, a little less than the Rs 11.44 lakh average the institute had recorded in 2008, before the downturn set in.        
	Last year, we did not even touch the double-digit mark. This year, there has been a 29 per cent increase in the average salary, said Saurabh Mishra, a student of the institute and coordinator of its corporate and media interface wing.        
	Around 38 per cent of the 80 students in the final-year batch have opted for consulting jobs with firms such as Avalon Consulting, Deloitte, Deloitte-USA, IBM, Infosys and KPMG.        
	Twenty-two per cent of the students opted for operations with firms like Balmer Lawrie, Bhel, ITC, Mahindra and Mahindra and Tata Motors.        
	The other top preferences were analytics, with pricing emerging as one of the most exciting profiles, and finance roles. Five per cent of the students opted for IT and human resource firms each.

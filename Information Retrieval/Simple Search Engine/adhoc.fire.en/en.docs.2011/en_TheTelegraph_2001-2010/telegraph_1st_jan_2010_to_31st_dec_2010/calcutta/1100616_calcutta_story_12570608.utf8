          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has asked forest minister Ananta Roy to speed up the process of relocating the zoo to Bhagawanpur in Sonarpur, about 25km south of the city.         
	The prod came in a review meeting of the forest department, attended by Roy and senior officials, at Writers Buildings on Tuesday.         
	The chief minister is eager to see that the work is done without further delay. A compensation package has been readied for the settlers, said Roy after the meeting.         
	The government had decided to shift the zoo from Alipore to Sonarpur in 2003 but settlers at the proposed site were not willing to part with their land.        
	According to Roy, 373 families living on the 500-acre plot will be given a one-time compensation of Rs 4 lakh. Sources said some of the settlers also want jobs.

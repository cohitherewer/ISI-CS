The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | NRS six face scam charge
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      NRS six face scam charge
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Police are set to file chargesheets against six employees of NRS Medical College and Hospital, including the head nurse, in connection with the medicine theft racket busted over 10 months ago.         
	Our investigation has clearly indicated the involvement of the six employees along with some outsiders. The chargesheets will be filed by the end of the month, said an officer of Muchipara police station, which is probing the case.         
	According to him, supplementary investigation will continue after the chargesheets are filed.        
	The racket came to light with the arrest of Naresh Rajak, 45, from his house in Serpentine Lane in Sealdah last July. A large quantity of medicines and other items stolen from state government hospitals, worth more than Rs 2.5 lakh, was seized from the house.         
	Further investigation revealed life-saving medicines worth lakhs were being smuggled out of the hospital for at least four years in connivance with Group D workers, mainly of the emergency and gynaecology wards. Five hospital employees, including the head nurse, were arrested.        
	We found that there was no proper system to monitor the medicine stock. The employees never listed the medicines that reached the hospital from central drug stores, another officer said.        
	We have also established the link between Rajak and the six hospital employees who used to sell stolen hospital supplies to traders in Bagri market, he added.        
	The investigator alleged that officials of the state health department and NRS hospital did not cooperate with the cops and did not provide the list of life-saving drugs sent to state-run hospitals in the past few years.        
	Despite several reminders, they failed to provide us with the details we sought. However, we have found enough evidence to nail the six NRS employees, he said.        
	L.K. Ghose, the superintendent of NRS hospital, denied that the hospital authorities did not co-operate with the investigators.         
	Let them file the chargesheets. I do not want to comment now. Law will take its course, he said.

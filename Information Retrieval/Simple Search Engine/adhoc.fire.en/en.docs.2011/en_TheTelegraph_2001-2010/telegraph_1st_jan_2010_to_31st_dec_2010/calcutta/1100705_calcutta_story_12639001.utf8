The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mortuary to come up on cemetery land
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mortuary to come up on cemetery land

	Calcutta will soon have its third mortuary  Abode of Rest  which will come up on a six-cottah plot at Bhowanipore cemetery.        
	The mortuary, to be set up next to the cemetery gatehouse, will have space for eight bodies. There will be a lawn with seating arrangements and a 100-seat meditation hall with a platform to lay down bodies.        
	The Indian Church Trustees, a wing of the Church of North India that owns the land, has approved the proposal for building the funeral parlour.        
	We need more mortuaries. The only two that are there in the city are in a sorry state, said Barry O Brien, a nominated MLA, referring to Peace Haven and Madeiras.         
	O Brien has sanctioned Rs 35 lakh from his MLA fund for setting up the mortuary.        
	Earlier, mostly Christians used to wait for a few days before the last rites. But now, a lot of people (from various religions) have their children living abroad. Hence, the families need to preserve bodies till they return, said O Brien.        
	Homemaker Denise Tankha who had lost her mother in 2007 tried to book a space at Peace Haven but to no avail. Three of the freezers were booked by police, two were not functioning and one had a body in it. I had to keep my mother at home, she said.        
	For Christians burying the dead is like a resurrection. We need a place in the city where there will be dignity in death, said Dominic Gomes, the project in-charge of the Catholic archdiocese in Calcutta.        
	The mortuary will be built by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation but will be maintained and run by the Bhowanipore cemetery committee.         
	The committee includes chairman bishop Ashok Biswas, vice-chairperson Vimla Subaya, secretary Nigel Pope and others.

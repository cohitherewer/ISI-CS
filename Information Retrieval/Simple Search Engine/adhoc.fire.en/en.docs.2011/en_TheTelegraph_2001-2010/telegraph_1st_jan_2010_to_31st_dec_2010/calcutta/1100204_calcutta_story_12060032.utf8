The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Minority panel finger at cops 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Minority panel finger at cops

	The state minorities commission has written to the police commissioner alleging that Muslim candidates had been discriminated against during a recent police recruitment drive. Of the 550 candidates selected as sub-inspectors and sergeants, only 11 were Muslims.        
	One hundred and six Muslim boys and girls were called for the interview but the final selection list showed a different picture. It smacks of discrimination, reads the letter, signed by Jawaid Akhtar, the member-secretary of the commission.        
	The letter (a copy of which is with Metro) was sent to police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti on Tuesday. I request you to provide a detailed report to the commission regarding the total number of candidates who appeared for the selection test, number of candidates called for the interview, process adopted by the selection board and the composition of the recruitment committee and the interview board, the letter reads.        
	S.S.Z. Adnan, the chairman of the commission, said he would take up the matter with the government after getting the reply from the police chief. There has been discrimination and thats why we want to know the recruitment process, said Kalyan Chaudhuri, the vice-chairman of the commission.         
	A senior IPS officer denied there was any discrimination. According to him, about 20 Muslim candidates had to be rejected in the interview as they did not know Bengali.         
	We are planning to send a proposal to the government so that we can select from next time candidates who do not know Bengali. They will be asked to learn the language after joining the force. Even IPS officers have the option to learn Bengali after joining the force, he added.        
	The issue has assumed significance as both the Left Front the and Trinamul are trying to woo Muslims by welcoming the Ranganath Mishra panels recommendation for Muslim quotas in government jobs.

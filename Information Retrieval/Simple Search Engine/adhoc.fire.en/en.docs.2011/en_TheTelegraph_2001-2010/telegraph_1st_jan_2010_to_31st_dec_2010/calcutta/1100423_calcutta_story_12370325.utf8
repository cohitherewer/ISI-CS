	The education department on Thursday issued a circular asking all schools in the state to change their schedules to give students some respite fr- om the soaring temperatures.         
	The schools can either hold classes in the mornings or bring the summer holidays forward, said Dibyen Mukherjee, the director of school education.         
	Senior officials of the department met on Thursday and decided that the district magistrates would meet the district school inspectors (DI) and school authorities and decide on the steps to be taken.         
	The schools must consider various factors like keeping adequate number of working days while altering their schedules. They must also keep the mid-day meal scheme in mind, said Mukherjee.        
	The decision taken at the joint meetings would be applicable to all schools in a particular district, he added.         
	An earlier government circular had asked district primary councils to ensure that primary classes were held only in the morning. Thursdays circular is meant for all schools  primary, secondary and higher secondary.        
	State-aided schools usually close for the summer vacation between May 15 and May 21. But after Thursdays circular, schools are expected to close next week.        
	Till the vacation starts, teachers have been requested to make students feel as comfortable as they can and allow them to drink ample water, said a senior official of the education department.         
	The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education had earlier asked all affiliated schools to hold the sessions first unit tests by the first week of May. However, after Thursdays circular, the board decided to allow the schools to hold the tests at any time that suited them.

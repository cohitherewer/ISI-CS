The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cracker of a filmi Diwali
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cracker of a filmi Diwali
  - Bolly biggies, Holly laughathon and a slice of Tolly          PRIYANKA ROY                                    BOLLYWOOD BECKONS: Action Replayy and Golmaal 3 promise to light up the festive weekend                  HOLLY HA!: Due Date				                                       
	Get set for fireworks this weekend  at a movie hall near you. With big-budget Bolly (Action Replayy and Golmaal 3), rip-roaring Holly (Due Date) and politically-charged Tolly (Tara) jostling for space, the curtain go up on a cracker of a Diwali.        
	 Its a Friday bonanza for the film buff and the good thing is that there is a film for everyone. Some will catch Golmaal on the first weekend no matter what, others are targeting Action Replayy while a few will bypass Bolly and queue up for Due Date, says Shunali Shroff of Fame Cinemas.        
	When most plexes threw open advance bookings on Monday instead of Wednesday to cash in on the tremendous buzz, the two Bolly releases found instant takers.        
	The buzz is very positive and we hope to see good footfalls. Its going to be a rib-tickling Diwali with both Action Replayy and Golmaal 3 bringing in their own audience, says Virendra Marya of INOX. Lots of queries and encouraging advances for the Diwali releases is the word from Big Cinemas and Bioscope as well.              
	Action Replayy, a retro comedy boasting Akshay Kumar and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, and Golmaal 3, the third instalment of the blockbuster comic franchise starring Ajay Devgn and Kareena Kapoor, hit screens after a two-week lull and a season that has had far more flops than hits.        
	Golmaal 3 is nudging ahead in the pre-release race. In Calcutta, Golmaal 3 is the clear favourite, says Shroff of Fame. The films local connect? Mithun Chakraborty joins the Rohit Shetty franchise in round three.        
	With the festive season guaranteeing multiple trips to the cinemas, Action Replayy too seems set for a big weekend. Action Replayy is for the family during the festive season. And the film will hit more screens than Golmaal 3, says Debashish De of Aum Moviez which is releasing the Vipul Shah entertainer across 100-plus screens in Bengal.        
	Despite the Bolly big fight, Hollys Due Date may emerge as a dark horse. The fun road movie from the Hangover team starring Robert Downey Jr and Zach Allan Galifianakis is grabbing eyeballs. After Hangover, Due Date has managed to generate tremendous buzz, despite the Bolly releases. We decided to release it in India along with the rest of the world because fun films always work during Diwali, says Denzil Dias of Warner Bros India.        
	Bringing up the rear this festive weekend is Tara, a Maoist tale of corruption and conflict with Prosenjit and Paoli Dam. And Prosenjits four-week-old Autograph is still going strong, giving Tolly a boost before the Bolly brandwagon rolls in.

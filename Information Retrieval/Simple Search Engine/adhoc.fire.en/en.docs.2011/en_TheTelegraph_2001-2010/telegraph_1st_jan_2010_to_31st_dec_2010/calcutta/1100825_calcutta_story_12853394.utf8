The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 9-minute scare on dark runway
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      9-minute scare on dark runway
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta airports main runway turned pitch dark for nine minutes from 9.45 on Monday night, creating a potentially dangerous situation for two planes that had just been cleared for landing.        
	Officials blamed a glitch in the power back-up for the scare, saying it failed to take over supply within the stipulated 15 seconds of a blackout.         
	Had one of the planes touched down when the runway was dark, the pilot would have had to depend solely on the aircrafts headlights to spot the tarmac. That is considered a serious safety hazard, a senior official admitted.        
	It was the second close call at the city airport this month after the collision scare on August 2, when the pilot of a plane cleared for landing spotted another aircraft on the runway and did a go-around.         
	On Monday, two SpiceJet flights from Jodhpur and Mumbai were forced to hover over the dark airport from 9.45pm till the lights came on nine minutes later. Two other aircraft cleared for take-off IndiGos Calcutta-Delhi and SpiceJets Calcutta-Mumbai flights  were stranded in the parking bay, sources said.        
	Although power was restored, the runway lights continued to stutter till late in the night. Around 10.30pm, the lights went off for a few seconds even as a Singapore Airlines flight was approaching the runway, an official said.        
	Sources said the Precision Approach Path Indicator, a unit of four lights that indicates the correct glide angle when a plane lands, had also malfunctioned around the same time. An aircraft lands at an angle of three degrees. If there is an error, it will either nosedive or overshoot the runway, an official said.        
	Capt. Sarvesh Gupta, a senior pilot with Jet Airways, said landing on a dark runway was not only unsafe but also illegal. But if an aircraft has already landed, then the pilot has no option but to slam the brakes and call for ground assistance, he added.        
	An inquiry has been ordered to fix responsibility for the power back-up failure.         
	Airport director R. Srinivasan said a preliminary inquiry suggested that the power sub-station where the generator is installed developed a glitch during the downpour on Monday afternoon.         
	The back-up system, however, functioned properly during a power cut at the airports domestic and international terminals from 10pm till 11.36pm.

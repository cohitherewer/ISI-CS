The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Monsoon dry days in flop fear   Monsoon ifs and buts in forecast

	Two days of swelter after a solitary day of monsoon showers have prompted sweat-weary Calcuttans to wonder whether weather scientists have got their predictions of an active monsoon wrong.        
	The forecast for the first 48 hours of the monsoon, which had hit town five days behind schedule on Sunday, was several spells of rain and a Celsius dip that was supposed to make conditions cool and comfortable. Monday and Tuesday were not only rainless but hot and humid as well.        
	Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, said a newly formed cyclonic circulation over the northeast Bay of Bengal, near the Bangladesh and Myanmar coast, had temporarily arrested the monsoon flow over south Bengal.        
	The lull over the last two days has been because of this circulation. The normal monsoon flow over south Bengal should be back on track after a couple of days. There is no reason to apprehend an abnormal monsoon, assured Debnath.        
	Last year, the monsoon had arrived early riding on Cyclone Aila but remained dormant for the most part.                    
	There is no reason to be pessimistic. A forecast that goes wrong for a couple of days does not mean the entire season will go wrong, said a senior scientist of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida.        
	In the short term this year, the monsoon is expected to live up to expectations. On an average, Calcutta in June receives 259.9mm of rain with 12.3 rainy days. As on Monday, the city had recorded 83.2mm of rain with six rainy days.        
	There is still nearly a fortnight to go in June and the city should do better than the average, both in terms of the number of rainy days and the total rainfall, said O. P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of a private Met agency.        
	June 2009 was the worst monsoon month in the worst monsoon year in 37 years. The city received only 98.1mm of rain this month last year.         
	Calcutta had also witnessed freak heat spells last year until the onset of an early winter in November.        
	According to doctors, Celsius and humidity fluctuations like those Calcutta has faced over the past year were bad for general health. Last year, each spell of abnormal weather had brought with it a plethora of diseases ranging from viral fever and respiratory trouble to malaria and dengue.

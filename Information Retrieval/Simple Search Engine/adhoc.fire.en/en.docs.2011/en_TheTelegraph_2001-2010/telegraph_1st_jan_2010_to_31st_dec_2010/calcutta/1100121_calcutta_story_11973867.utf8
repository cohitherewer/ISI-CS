The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City to host women writers meet 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City to host women writers meet 
          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                          Nabanita Dev Sen and (below) Mahasveta Devi                                          
	Come January end, women authors of several Asian countries will arrive in town for the launch of Speaking For Myself: An Anthology of Asian Womens Writing on January 31. Earlier that day, Prabha Khaitan Foundation and the India International Centre (IIC), New Delhi, will host a round-table conference on Asian womens writing.        
	Calcutta will host so many Asian women writers for the first time. Our aim is to provide a platform for a cultural and intellectual debate, said Sundeep Bhutoria, a trustee of the foundation.        
	The events, to be held at the Indian Institute of Cultural Relations (IICR) on Ho Chi Minh Sarani, will bring together several Asian authors including Donia Gobar (Afghanistan), Kishwar Naheed (Pakistan), Kunzang Choden (Bhutan), Manju Tiwari (Nepal) and Putsata Reang (Cambodia).         
	The two-day programme is being organised as a tribute to Rabindranath Tagore and all the authors will be presented with a bust of the bard.         
	On January 31 morning, the authors will participate in a talk in the presence of Calcutta icons Nabanita Dev Sen, Joy Goswami, Krishna Bose, Jogen Chowdhury, Bani Basu, Pabitra Sarkar, Amalendu De, Dibyendu Palit and moderator Mahasveta Devi.        
	In the evening, Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar will be present with chief guest Sunil Ganguly for the book launch, to be chaired by Kapila Vatsyayan of IICs Asia Projects.         
	Women, in any role, are an important factor in bridging borders. The book is a brave first step that brings previously unheard voices from one half of the world to the other, not as the subservient women of the East, rather as an overlooked power with much to say, said author Donia Gobar.        
	Published by Penguin India and edited by Dr Sukrita Paul Kumar and Dr Malashri Lal, the book is a compilation of writings from 34 Asian countries. The book talks about the transmission of culture, and it was hard getting these stories, many of which are not available elsewhere, said Kavita Sharma, the director of the IIC.        
	The next day, the authors will call on Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Mamata Banerjee is yet to confirm her interaction with the authors.

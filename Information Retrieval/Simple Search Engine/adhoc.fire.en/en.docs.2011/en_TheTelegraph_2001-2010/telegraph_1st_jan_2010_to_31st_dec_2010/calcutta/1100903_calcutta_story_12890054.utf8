The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ray lifts Buddha mood
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Ray lifts Buddha mood
          MOHUA DAS                          The chief minister at Nandan on Thursday. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was a picture of poise with a smile on his lips and a twinkle in his eyes at an event on Thursday to celebrate 25 years of Nandan, in stark contrast with his fist-clenching, teeth-grinding tirade against Mamata Banerjee two evenings ago.         
	It was 1977. I was the information and cultural affairs minister, thinking all the time about how to promote the arts, theatre and films in our state. One day, I met Satyajit Ray to propose a cinema hall that would also be a centre for film-based discussions and activities. Had to overcome a lot of doubts though before I did that, chuckled the chief minister, turning back the clock to recount the formation of the film hub.         
	Bhattacharjee had walked in with writer Sunil Gangopadhyay, greeting those standing in the aisle with a smile. He sat down next to film-maker Goutam Ghose and chatted with him before stepping up to the mike to talk about happier times, when there was no Mamata hot on his heels.        
	The chief minister chuckled some more remembering how Ray, too, seemed a bit hesitant when asked to design the Nandan logo.        
	On Tuesday evening at Netaji Indoor Stadium, all he had spoken about was the Centres reluctance to provide more funds to Bengal and Mamatas lies.        
	Bhattacharjee rounded off at Nandan by announcing a festival of short films and documentaries from September 20 to 22 to encourage budding directors.

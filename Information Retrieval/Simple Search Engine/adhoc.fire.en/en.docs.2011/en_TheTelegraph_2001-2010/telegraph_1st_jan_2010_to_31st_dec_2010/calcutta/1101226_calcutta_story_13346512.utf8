	Theatre lovers can usher in 2011 with drama, thanks to the ministry of culture. Anya Theatre, which could not organise its night-long theatre bash on December 31 for the past two years because of lack of funds, is set to revive the festival this year with money given by the ministry.         
	The theme of the Natya Sankalpa festival this year is Teen Banrujje (or the three Bandyopadhyays  Bibhutibhushan, Tarashankar and Manik). These writers, born within 11 years of each other, deserved the Nobel Prize. They took Bengali literature to new heights. We have asked theatre groups to present plays based on their works to pay a tribute to the trio, said Bibhas Chakraborty, the director of Anya Theatre.

	The event will start at the Academy of Fine Arts at 6pm on December 31 with a talk on the writers. The action will soon shift to Rabindra Sadan, where there will be readings and discussions. At midnight the audience will be treated to some music by a band from Presidency College.  
	The plays will start after midnight. Directors Bratya Basu, Koushik Sen, Ramaprasad Banik, Ashish Chattopadhyay and Adrija Dasgupta have come up with new plays on the occasion.        
	Basus group Bratyajan will stage a play on Bibhutibhushans story Canvasser Krishnalal. Sen has chosen to dramatise Maniks story Chhoto Bokulpurer Jatri.         
	Festival of coins                   An 1835 British India double mohur.   (Sudeshna Banerjee)      
	A lesson in Indian history, a tour around the world, tips on how to spot fake currency  all this and more are on offer at Mudra Utsav being held at Haldiram Banquet Hall in Ballygunge Park. The event is on till December 26. The Numismatic Society of Calcutta is holding the exhibition as part of its silver jubilee celebrations.         
	Individual dealers usually interact directly with collectors and charge them whatever they fancy. Here there are many dealers under one roof, so one has the option of comparing prices, says Sandip Jain, the president of the society.         
	Individual collections are also on display. Basant Kumar Rathis British India coins date from 1835 when uniform coinage was introduced. The double mohur was equivalent to 30 pieces of silver rupee. Few people know that till 1969 our mint used to strike these William IV mohurs as personal souvenirs, he said.         
	Also on display were Saibal Basus collection on Mughal India, especially the Nisar coins, which were issued since Jehangirs rule for the express purpose of showering them on subjects on occasions like the emperors birthday.         
	Kunal Chatterjees collection of Republic of India coins shows how the mint, from where a coin is issued, leaves its mark. If you find a dot under the year of issue, it is from Noida, a diamond indicates Bombay, a star Hyderabad. If there is no mark, it is from Calcutta, says Ravi Shankar Sharma, the societys secretary.         
	The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has set up a stall, from where leaflets are being distributed on how to detect fake notes.         
	Many had lined up before a grading agency where international coins and bank notes were being graded for a charge.         
	I found a coin with the East India Company insignia on one side and Ram-Sita on the other, said Abhijit Goswami of Naktala. He was told that it was a fake.         
	The exhibition is open from 10am to 6pm. Entry is free.

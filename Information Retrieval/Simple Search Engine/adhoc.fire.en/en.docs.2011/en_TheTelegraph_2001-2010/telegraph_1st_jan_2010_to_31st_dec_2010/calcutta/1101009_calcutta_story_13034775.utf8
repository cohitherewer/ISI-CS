The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Outlet robbed of lakhs in night raid
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Outlet robbed of lakhs in night raid
  - Pre-Puja strikes on shops in city and beyond        A STAFF REPORTER                           Packets and items lie scattered at the Vishal Megamart outlet in Barasat. A Telegraph picture                                        
	A gang of 10 looted a department store in Barasat early on Friday after allegedly holding the guards at gunpoint.        
	The three-storey Vishal Megamart outlet, which sells garments, groceries and electronic goods, was stocked to the full five days before Puja.        
	This is a big loss for us. We had made bulk procurements before Puja, said Amit Das, the stores administrative manager.        
	A rough estimate by the store states the gang took away garments, LCD monitors, DVD players and mobile phones worth over Rs 5 lakh.        
	But police said the claim had yet to be verified. They have lodged a complaint but we cannot tell the exact amount before we receive a detailed list of the missing products, a police officer said.        
	The robbers came in a Tata Sumo and allegedly overpowered the two guards at the stores rear gate.        
	They held the two securitymen at gunpoint and broke the rear shutter of the store. One of the guards fled after the gang entered the shop, said an officer of North 24-Parganas police. The gang entered the shop around 2.30am and spent 30 minutes inside the store at Dakbungalow More, one of the busiest areas of Barasat.        
	After the gang fled, the lone guard present called up the managers.        
	When we reached the shop around 4am, we found the ground and first floors strewn with boxes and various products, said a store official.        
	The sleuths were surprised at the store authorities practice of switching off the closed-circuit TV cameras at night.        
	Also surprising is the fact that such a big store has only two guards at night, said an officer.

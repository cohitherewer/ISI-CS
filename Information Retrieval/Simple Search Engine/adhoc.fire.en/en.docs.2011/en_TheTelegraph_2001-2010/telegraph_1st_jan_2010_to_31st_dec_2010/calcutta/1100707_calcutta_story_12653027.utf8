The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taxi strike deferred
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Taxi strike deferred
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Taxi operators have decided to wait one more week for a fare hike before threatening to go off the road                                   
	Taxi operators on Tuesday deferred their plan for an indefinite strike, giving the government time till July 15 to decide on a fare hike, while bus and minibus operators chose to wait and watch.         
	Taxi operators had threatened to go on an indefinite strike from July 8 if the government did not increase the fare by July 5. The price of fuel was recently increased by Rs 1.95 per litre.        
	Taxi operators unions decided in a meeting that they would wait till July 15 for a favourable decision by the government.         
	We are giving the government an extra week to declare a fare hike. If it fails to meet the deadline, we will go on an indefinite strike from July 15, said Tarak Nath Bari, the secretary of the Calcutta Taxi Association.        
	Around 35,000 taxis ply in and around the city daily.        
	Taxi operators had proposed a Rs 2x+6 formula, where x is the reading on a digital meter, for the revised fare. Currently, the taxi fare is double the meter reading plus Rs 2.        
	When the operators had met transport minister Ranjit Kundu a week ago, he had neither committed to a fare hike nor ruled it out.         
	If they want to go an a strike, let them. What can be done about it? the minister said on Tuesday evening when asked whether the government would declare its decision on a fare hike before July 15.        
	I havent decided yet. There must be more meetings and a thorough assessment of the situation. I cant jump to a decision because some operators are threatening to go on a strike, he told Metro.        
	The bus and minibus operators had given the government time till July 10 to state its stand.        
	We have not yet decided on a strike. Let us see what the government does. There is still some time, said Trinamul MLA Swarnakamal Saha, the president of the Bengal Bus Syndicate. Abashesh Daw, the general secretary of the Minibus Coordination Committee, echoed Saha.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Code replaces cane in class
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Code replaces cane in class
  - Rein on teachers, onus on students        MITA MUKHERJEE                                                  
	Ask, dont tell  thats the new code of conduct for teachers of the La Martiniere schools in matters of indiscipline on campus.        
	If a student is found doing something wrong, a teacher can ask whether he/she thinks the act is right or wrong. The teacher is barred from giving an opinion or expressing anger, an official said, giving a peek into the draft code that is set to take effect after the Puja vacation.        
	So how will discipline be enforced if teachers cannot tell students where they have gone wrong?        
	If they admit their mistake, then students may be asked to write an apology saying that they wont repeat the mistake. If they dont, they would be required to explain why they think a particular act wasnt a mistake, the official explained.        
	The guidelines, drawn up against the backdrop of the Rouvanjit Rawla suicide case, includes a chapter for parents.         
	Although the code is meant for teachers, it also has a chapter containing guidelines for parents. That makes the document different from the service rules for teachers, Sunirmal Chakravarthi, the principal of La Martiniere for Boys, had told Metro days before he and three teachers were arrested on the charge of torturing Class VIII student Rouvanjit.        
	One of the main objectives of our new code is to ensure that every parent is a partner to the school for the holistic development of their wards, principal Chakravarthi had said of the initiative to maintain discipline without using force.        
	The draft guidelines recommend that teachers write to parents regularly about their childrens progress. It also explains what actions the school can take step by step if parents consistently do not co-operate with the institution.         
	Once the code takes effect, a committee comprising members of the school management, parents and teachers will be formed to review serious issues and suggest remedial measures to the principal.         
	With the implementation of the new code, the school alone will not shoulder the responsibility of students development. Parents will also have to actively participate in the process, said an official.        
	The draft code was drawn up following a directive from the Church of North India in the wake of Rouvanjits suicide on February 12, four days after he was caned and the day he was hauled up for indiscipline in class.        
	Principal Chakravarthi, who has admitted to caning Rouvanjit but contested allegations that it drove him to suicide, was charged under section 324 of the IPC, for voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means. The section is bailable but if proven can be punished with imprisonment of up to three years, or with fine or with both.        
	The head of the middle school, L.J. Gunnion, and David Ryan were charged with punishment for voluntarily causing hurt, which can amount to more than one year of imprisonment or a fine of upto Rs 1,000 or both and punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation, which can amount to up to three months of imprisonment or fine of upto Rs 500, or both. Partha Dutta was only charged under the Juvenile Justice Act 23.        
	All four were granted bail by Rabi Ranjan Chakraborty, the chief metropolitan magistrate, when the case came up for hearing at the Bankshall court on Monday afternoon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mob razes shops
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mob razes shops
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Residents of Kankinara Bazaar, on the northern fringes, destroyed about 25 illegal roadside shops after an 11-year-old schoolboy was run over by a truck on Thursday morning.        
	Raja Mahato, a Class V student, was forced to cycle down the middle of Ghoshpara Road because of encroachments on the sides, said witnesses. The truck carrying jute bales hit the cycle from the back and crushed the boy when he fell down.        
	The driver managed to escape. A mob first burnt down the truck and then razed the roadside shops. Residents said they destroyed the shops as the local administration and Bhatpara municipality did not do so despite repeated pleas.        
	The chairman of the municipality blamed the sub-divisional officer for not conducting drives to remove encroachments. According to the rule book, the chairman and the officer can conduct drives by themselves or jointly.

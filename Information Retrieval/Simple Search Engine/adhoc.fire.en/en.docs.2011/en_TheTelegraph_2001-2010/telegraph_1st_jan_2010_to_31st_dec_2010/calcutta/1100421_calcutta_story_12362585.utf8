The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Salt Lake houses allowed extra floor
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Salt Lake houses allowed extra floor
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	House-owners in Salt Lake can now build an extra floor.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Tuesday approved a proposal to allow vertical growth of the township, meeting an old demand of the residents.        
	The new rules state that a G+2 building can come up on two-cottah land while a G+3 structure can be built on a plot measuring three or four cottahs.         
	An individual allotted a plot of eight or nine cottahs can raise a G+5 building while those with a 10-cottah plot can get a G+8 structure built.        
	Salt Lake residents have long been demanding relaxation of building rules so they could add a floor to their buildings. Recently, Salt Lake municipality, too, had requested us to sanction vertical growth of the township, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said at Writers Buildings on Tuesday.        
	Bhattacharyas department had asked the municipality to call a citizens meeting and discuss the issue. Around 90 per cent of the residents attended the meeting and demanded that they be allowed to build an extra floor.        
	Bhattacharya said the government was in a position to meet the demand as the sewerage system of Salt Lake had improved and the East West Metro was expected to provide some relief to road traffic.        
	Also, each family is growing. There is a demand for extra accommodation, which the government will have to provide. Letting Salt Lake residents raise an additional floor would ease the pressure on us to acquire land for buildings, the minister added.        
	The floor-area ratio (FAR)  which indicates the space that has to be left vacant while raising a building  has also been increased for the township.

          MOHUA DAS              calcutta calendar            Oct 9: Arrives in Calcutta. A visit to Mother House in the afternoon followed by   a meeting with victims of trafficking in the evening.  Oct 10: Visit to St Peter rsquo;s Church and hospices in Behala, including Florence College of Nursing, Shanti Nivas and Oxford Mission. A thanksgiving ceremony followed by a civic reception at St Paul rsquo;s Cathedral in the evening.  Oct 11: Seminar on ldquo;contextual theology rdquo; at Bishop rsquo;s College. He will leave Calcutta in the evening for the rest of his India tour.                          
	The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, 60, will visit Calcutta between October 9 and 11 as part of a two-week private visit to India.         
	The highest-ranking non-royal in the United Kingdoms order of precedence and a member of the House of Lords, Williams will spend three days in the city visiting the Missionaries of Charity, hospices, NGOs and Bishops College.         
	We are aware of his scheduled visit but are awaiting an official communication. We will be very happy to host his grace. If the archbishop would like to visit a particular home, we will make all arrangements, said a sister at the Missionaries of Charity.        
	After his arrival on Saturday, October 9, the archbishop will visit Mother Teresas tomb at Mother House, followed by a discussion with trafficked women in the evening. The archbishop wants to meet anti-trafficking organisations and women who have been rescued from trafficking. We are talking to some NGOs in Calcutta, said a source at Bishop House.        
	The archbishop will spend Day 2 visiting hospices in Behala such as the Florence College of Nursing, Shanti Nivas, Oxford Mission and St Peters Church before heading for a grand reception at St Pauls Cathedral in the evening.         
	The archbishops visit is important as he is the head of the worldwide Anglican communion. We were earlier a part of the communion and the first bishop of Calcutta, Rev TF Middleton, was sent by the then archbishop of Canterbury. We at St Pauls are organising a service of thanksgiving for him before the civic reception begins because this year marks 163 years of St Pauls Cathedral and 196 years of the diocese of Calcutta, said Revd. Andrew Simick, representative-in-charge, St Pauls Cathedral.         
	He said the church would invite nearly 30 church leaders from Calcutta, including The Methodist Church, Marthoma Church, Salvation Army and the Orthodox Church for the reception.         
	Next in line is a civic reception with governor M.K. Narayanan as chief guest. The guest list includes the chief justice of Calcutta High Court, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, mayor Sovan Chatterjee, sheriff Utpal Chatterjee and Sister Prema from the Missionaries of Charity as well as Sourav Ganguly and Usha Uthup.         
	On Day 3, the archbishop, acknowledged as a theological writer, scholar and teacher, will spend the day at Bishops College on AJC Bose Road, where he will attend a seminar on theology and meet students and Indian theologians.         
	Bishops College was founded by the Church of England. The archbishop will not be here to preach but to interact with the people and experience the city that has historical fraternal links with his communion, said Bishops College principal Sunil Caleb.         
	The contextual theology seminar will include theologians from Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta. William will leave the same day for the rest of his trip that includes Patna, Ranchi, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and Thiruvananthapuram, where his wife Jane was born.

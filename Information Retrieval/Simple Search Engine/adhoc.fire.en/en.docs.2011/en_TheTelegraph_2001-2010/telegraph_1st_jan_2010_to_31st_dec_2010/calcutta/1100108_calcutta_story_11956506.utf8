	Supporters of the Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad and the SFI hurled bombs and bricks and shot pellets at one other for two hours at Harimohan Ghosh College in Garden Reach on Thursday.         
	The clash, over the filing of nominations for the students union elections, left six Trinamul supporters and four policemen injured. The students were admitted to SSKM Hospital with pellet and splinter injuries. The missiles damaged four buses.         
	Trinamul supporters put up a roadblock around 1pm, protesting alleged atrocities by SFI activists. The violence started when SFI supporters protested against the blockade.        
	Initially, bricks were being thrown indiscriminately. Then the supporters started hurling bombs at each other. A group of activists later started shooting pellets from airguns, said a cop.        
	Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee called on the police to arrest those responsible for the clash.

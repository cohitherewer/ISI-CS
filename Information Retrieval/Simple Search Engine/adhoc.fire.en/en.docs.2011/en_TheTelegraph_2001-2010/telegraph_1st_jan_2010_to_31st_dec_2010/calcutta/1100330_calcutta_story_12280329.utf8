The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dawn of hope amp; happiness
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          Dawn of hope amp; happiness
          SHAMLU DUDEJA                                    Steve Waugh rsquo;s first trip to Udayan rsquo;s Barrackpore unit                
	Udayan means dawn. And, indeed, it was a bright dawn for the first group of 11 children from homes of leprosy patients around Barrackpore, when on March 25, 1970, Rev. James Stevens moved these youngsters away from their lives of sorrow, hunger and social rejection to a sanctuary of security, of love, care, comfort and education, where they could grow to become honourable and contributing citizens of India.        
	January 26, 1998, marked a new dawn in my life, as I walked through the gates of the Udayan complex, first built in 1979 with the assistance of Dominique Lapierre, his wife, Dominique, and scores of their European and American friends. I was in deep, dark depression since the death of my son, Kabir, a year earlier. I came to Udayan with a handful of gifts, hoping to bring some small joy to the lives of what I thought were these unfortunate children.         
	Instead, what greeted me was a sea of happy faces, shining with the brightest of smiles, and singing the cheeriest of shouts Good morning, Aunty, with their small hands seeking mine for a caress  It was the most overwhelming moment in my life. My spirits lifted immediately, and I was transferred to another world.                          Rev. James Stevens releases balloons to mark Udayan rsquo;s Ruby celebrations on March 25, 2010.       
	After a short flag-hoisting ceremony, the boys clamoured to show me around. I had expected sadness and squalor, but instead, with scores of mango and lemon trees and coconut and date palms, surrounding an acre of open space, happy children wandered about, their brows asking: Now, who is this? One small lad, who was particularly proud of his home, took my hand, and along with Rev. Stevens, led me on a tour of the dormitories, where each boy had clean bedding of his own, rolled up tidily. Others tagged along  a few shy children tucked behind the older ones  chit-chatting and pointing out their beds.        
	I soon realised that something was missing. Why are there no girls rooms? I asked. No money, said the reverend. And no one to organise it. I instantly decided that Calcutta Foundations focus for 1998 would be to raise funds for a home to house girls. How? And where the money was coming from, I did not know.        
	Exactly 50 days later, I sat by the bedside of my terminally ill husband, Vijay, in a nursing home, watching India and Australia play cricket, my mind far away from my pledge to Rev. Stevens. Later that night, reading The Telegraph, a glimmer of hope appeared. Steve Waugh (now an ex-cricket captain of Australia) mentioned in an interview that he liked to help childrens charities. That was my pointer!        
	Thanks to his script, Australia lost the match to India on the fourth day, which meant the fifth day was free. Divine intervention, I thought to myself. Immediately, I sent off a letter inviting Steve to visit Udayan on his free day. He agreed.        
	We set off at 8am the next morning, that fine March day, with a journalist and a team photographer. Ninety minutes later, as Steve and I entered the Udayan gates, the boys recognised him  and his Australian team cap  and jumped up and down, shouting, Steveda! Steveda! Overwhelmed, Steve picked up one of the boys, placed him on his lap, and said, Hey! Guys! You have a bat?                          Steve Waugh at the crease at Barasat in 2000,       
	Someone fetched a bat, and soon, they got down to business, with Steve bowling first; one of the older boys hit a four. The entire ground went up in a loud cheer, Then, Steve came to the crease with a childs bat. Tapan Mahato, a fast bowler, all of 14 or 15, bowled him out! To even more deafening cheers! One young Udayan worker then mumbled in Bengali: We will have to build a bust of this guy to honour him.        
	Steve wanted to learn more about these children and their problems, so we drove off to meet their families, in their homes. I assured him that there was no risk to his health  85 per cent of all leprosy patients are not contagious, and can live on their own.         
	Soon, Steve was standing amidst 10 or 12 men and women, each severely maimed by the disease. He shook hands with the patients, sat on their beds, posed for photographs and even played cricket in the narrow lane. One old woman, with gnarled fingers and a face oozing with love, resting by the side of a hut, said to me, Didi, you have brought God to us!        
	Steve was quick to see my point: how the lack of similar facilities for girls remained a problem, and promised me, Shamlu, you are on! I will be the patron of Calcutta Foundation, and I will come back to Calcutta to raise funds for a girls block!                          Steve Waugh with Udayan rsquo;s first batch of girl inmates.      
	In the next couple of weeks, after Steve declaring just these intentions to the press in Bangalore and Sharjah, calls flooded my office from suppliers of toys and folding beds from England and Australia, from the print and the electronic media, and from friends all around  everyone wanting to know the details of the forthcoming fundraiser by Calcutta Foundation, how it would help daughters of leprosy patients and how they could help. We moved forward quickly and set a date in July. Udayans past success  with the past and continuing assistance of Dominique Lapierre, who first brought it to the worlds attention  and Steves huge popularity in India, combined to create a surge of interest in the girls block. A group of volunteers, socially conscious Calcutta ladies, came forward to help Calcutta Foundation organise U Nite with Steve.        
	On May 10, Vijay passed away peacefully, 15 months after Kabir. A monumental loss, but this project was so overwhelming, that there was no time for tears or self-pity.        
	That July, Steve returned to Calcutta, to host U Nite with Steve at Taj Bengal. More than 300 people paid for entry, and attended. Many of Steves teammates donated T-shirts, jerseys, or other cricket memorabilia, to be auctioned off, including an autographed bat from Don Bradman, all helping to make the event a success. We raised enough money for the much-needed girls wing.        
	Even more importantly, Steves enthusiasm for the cause sparked the medias broader interest. Australias Channel 9 made a film about Udayan, Rev. Stevens role in the lives of the children and Steves involvement. These efforts have helped foster greater awareness and compassion, and enhance international understanding, about combating the scourge of leprosy.        
	A year later, in January 2000, Steve returned to India, to inaugurate Nivedita House. The first group of 80 girls romped up and down on the jungle gyms, and swung merrily under the clear blue skies, against a backdrop of yellow-headed lush green mustard fields.                          Author Dominique Lapierre with the boys      
	Many, many others have contributed to Udayans success, both Indians and foreigners alike, from Europe, North America, South Africa, and Japan. Rev. Stevenss wife, Lalitha, has been steadfast by his side, and a few young men, from the earliest batches of students, also help run the facility. One woman, a house-mother, has been with Udayan since it started 40 years ago.        
	Because of these efforts, Udayan now cares, feeds, houses and educates nearly 300 boys and girls. And like all those who fight against leprosy on many different fronts, Udayan must constantly seek more funding to continue and expand its operations. Yet, none of its success would have been possible without the vision and compassion of Rev. Stevens. Instead, the dawn may never have broken for the thousands of children who have passed through Udayans portals in the last 40 years.         
	March 25 was the occasion for Ruby celebrations at Udayan, as a reunion for the present children and those in the past, who are now adults. And, indeed, it was a joyous occasion. The grounds were covered with colourful pandals, with Christmas-like decorations. There was music and dancing, and merry mach past by children of all ages, waving Udayan flags and wearing Udayan caps. Calcutta Foundation had hosted a festive lunch, with a 65-lb chocolate cake (sponsored by Stacey Clarfield Newman) for all the 500 people present there. Over 100 ex-residents of Udayan were present, some with their spouses and children, feeling very proud, content and happy with their lives, wishing Rev. Stevens, and his wife Lalitha well.         
	My personal blessings to Fraan Caterini, who started Calcutta Foundation with an orchestra, and gave me an opportunity to carry on with the Foundations motto: Wipe a Tear, Spread a Smile.        
	On March 27, Rev. Stevens addressed a small group of men and women, and announced the concept of Friends of Udayan. Anyone who wishes to join the group with the intention of working towards prevention of the spread of leprosy and helping those afflicted with it, can write to:

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Decks cleared for Peerless probe
          OUR BUREAU                          Ground-floor windows of Peerless Hospital damaged by the mob on April 13 have still not been repaired. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                                   
	The state health department on Wednesday started formulating the process of inquiry into the alleged denial of treatment by Peerless Hospital to some accident victims on April 13.        
	The families of the victims said the hospitals refusal to start treatment without a monetary deposit resulted in the death of a 10-year-old boy, which triggered a mob attack on the Bypass property.        
	The four-member inquiry committee set up by the health department will conduct hearing at Swastha Bhavan in Salt Lake. A notification for the hearing will be issued in newspapers, said a health department official.        
	The panel members met on Wednesday and decided to issue the notification this week. The hearing dates will be decided in a day or two, the official said.        
	Private hospitals, yet to get over the shock of the April 13 vandalism, said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had not responded to their request to call a meeting to discuss ways to tackle mob violence at healthcare institutions.        
	The Association of Hospitals of Eastern India had on April 16 sought an audience with Bhattacharjee.        
	We have not yet received any communication from the chief ministers office, said a source in the association.        
	We will call a meeting this week to discuss our course of action, he added.        
	Normality is yet to return to Peerless Hospital even eight days after the vandalism.        
	Admission of patients, suspended the day the hospital was ransacked, has not yet resumed. The patient lift was damaged in the attack and is yet to be repaired. Some crucial laboratory equipment that were damaged have to be replaced, said Sudipto Mitra, the medical superintendent of the Bypass hospital.        
	Hospital sources said the outpatients department was still closed.        
	Only 74 patients are being treated in the wards. All of them were admitted before April 13, said the source. The hospital has 300 beds.        
	The hospital is also facing problems from the Citu-backed Contract Staff Union, which is demanding that contractual workers be paid by the management instead of their salaries being routed through the hiring agencies. We have lodged an FIR against the housekeeping staff union, said an official.

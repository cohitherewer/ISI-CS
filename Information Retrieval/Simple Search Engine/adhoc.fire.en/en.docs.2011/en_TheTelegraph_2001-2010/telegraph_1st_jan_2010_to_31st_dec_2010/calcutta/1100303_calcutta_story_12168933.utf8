The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Doctor held for trespass
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Doctor held for trespass
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A doctor in her 50s, who was recently transferred from RG Kar hospital, was arrested on Tuesday after the authorities accused her of breaking the lock of a room and trespassing on the hospital premises.        
	Anuradha Das, a radiotherapist, was later released on a personal recognition bond.        
	The hospital authorities said she had been transferred to Midnapore Medical College and her release order was issued on February 4, but she was still visiting RG Kar hospital and occupying her room forcibly.        
	Das denied the charges and accused the authorities of trying to implicate her in a false case. There is no infrastructure for radiotherapy at Midnapore Medical College. A radiation safety officer has not been appointed there, which is a basic step. There are also no radiation technicians, she said.        
	Das worked in the radiotherapy department of Chittaranjan National Medical College and Hospital from June 2001 to March 2007 before being sent to RG Kar hospital on deputation.        
	Das said she had moved the high court against the transfer order. The court issued a stay order on February 24 and the next day, I submitted it to the hospital authorities, she said.        
	However, the authorities were not allowing me to sign the attendance register or treat patients, added Das.        
	The high court issued a status quo order, which practically means the release order should be implemented. So Das was asked not to sign the attendance register or use her doctors room, said L.K. Vaid, the medical superintendent of the hospital.         
	On Tuesday, after consulting senior health department officials, the hospital authorities locked the door of the room earlier allotted to Das. She broke the lock with the help of outsiders. So we lodged a police complaint, said a hospital official.        
	I did not break any lock. I only want to treat patients, said Das.

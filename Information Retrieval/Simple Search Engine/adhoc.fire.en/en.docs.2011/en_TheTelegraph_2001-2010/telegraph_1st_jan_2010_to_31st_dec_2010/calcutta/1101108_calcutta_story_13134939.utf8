The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Germany focus in global trade show
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Germany focus in global trade show
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	One of the biggest mining and machinery trade shows in the continent is set to showcase modern technology and best practices from leading nations in our backyard to make our coal mines safer and more productive.         
	Germany will be the focus country at the International Mining amp; Machinery Exhibition 2010, to be held on the Salt Lake stadium premises from November 10 to 13. Sixteen German companies will bring their latest equipment to the show.         
	This is a landmark industry event in Calcuttas calendar, with over 70 overseas participants. The exhibition also marks the biggest German participation in an Indian trade show and presents an opportunity for local companies scouting for overseas tech partners, observes Rajesh Nath, the managing director of VDMA (the German Engineering Federation)s India chapter, headquartered in the city.         
	The German participants will showcase the best available technology for machinery and equipment for the extraction and preparation of raw materials and the tasks connected with these procedures. Germany is among the most important suppliers for the Indian mining market besides the US and China.         
	More than 300 exhibitors will participate in the trade fair, 10 per cent more than the last edition in 2008. This will include 70-plus overseas units, with 40-odd participants from partner country Australia and the rest from the US and the UK, among others.         
	Since Calcutta is the mining capital of the country and home to Coal India Ltd, a trade show of this magnitude is relevant here, feels B.G. Roy, the regional director of the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce, Calcutta chapter.         
	Coal is still the principal energy driver in India, with over 58 per cent of power coming from the black diamond.         
	Safety of miners and containing mine fires will be among the other critical issues to be addressed at the German pavilion, says Nath.        
	The globally televised operation to rescue trapped miners in Chile had a lot of German technology at its core. All of that will be on display and the German team has already submitted a handholding proposal on stopping mine fires like the recent one in the Jharia coalfield, which is now under perusal of the coal ministry, Nath adds.

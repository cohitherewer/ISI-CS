The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SC denies stay on food order
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      SC denies stay on food order
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT IN NEW DELHI                              
	The Supreme Court on Monday refused to stay a Calcutta High Court order asking the states Legal Services Authority to assess the quality of food served by caterers to patients in government-run hospitals.        
	Acting on an appeal by the state against the high court order passed on August 27, the apex court bench of Justice R.V. Raveendran and Justice A.K. Patnaik said it was in two minds on whether the ruling should be quashed.        
	One part of us says that the (high court) order should be quashed. Another part says that something may come of it  if someone inspects, some of these poor people may get something. Its been a month (since the order was passed). Let it go on. Lets see what reports come.        
	Justice Raveendran said the order was salutary but felt it would die its own death, as busy lawyers could not possibly do what the government with all its paraphernalia had failed to achieve.        
	The states contention was that the high court order had encroached on the executive domain.        
	Following a submission by state lawyers, additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium and Pijush Kanti Roy, the bench clarified that the high court order would not prevent the government from setting up its committee to look into the food quality in hospitals or any other drawback in the health system.        
	The high court had turned a litigation between those bidding for contracts to supply food to government hospitals into a public interest writ petition and directed the Legal Services Authority to survey government hospitals through its state-wide network.

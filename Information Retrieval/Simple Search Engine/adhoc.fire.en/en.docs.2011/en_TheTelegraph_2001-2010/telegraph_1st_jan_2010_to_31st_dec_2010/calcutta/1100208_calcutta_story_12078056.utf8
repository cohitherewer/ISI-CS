The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Green norms go for a toss
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Green norms go for a toss
                              Waste littered at Milon Mela. (Bishwarup Dutta)                            
	Milon Mela or the Maidan  when it comes to organising the Book Fair, flouting green rules seems to be the norm. The high court had forced the Book Fair out of the Maidan in 2007 for causing widespread damage to the greens. But Metro finds the Milon Mela fair as foul as the Maidan one, with most norms set by the environment department being violated.        
	 Guideline: Sufficient water sprinkling on the ground and the adjoining car park.        
	 Reality: Sprinkling was done on a large part of the fairground but not at the car park, which remained perennially shrouded in dust.        
	 Guideline: Plastic bags were to be ideally avoided. If they were to be used, they should not be less than 12inchX16inch in size and thinner than 40 micron        
	 Reality: Many stalls flouted the norm.        
	 Guideline: Proper collection and disposal of solid waste.        
	 Reality: The Publishers and Booksellers Guild had installed about 70 bins  one for every 9,000 sq ft and 1,000 visitors. Experts said the figure was inadequate. The fair ground is spread across 6 lakh sq ft and registered an average daily footfall of more than 70,000. Garbage was scattered across the ground, more so in the food court.        
	 Guideline: Temporary sanitary toilets and urinals were to be set up and linked to the public sewer system.        
	 Reality: Toilets, though connected to the sewer system, were too few compared with the footfall, forcing many visitors to relieve themselves in the open.        
	 Guideline: Trees and plants not to be illuminated.        
	 Reality: The trees were illuminated and many of the potted plants were seldom watered.        
	 Guideline: Noise and emission from diesel generators were to be restricted.        
	 Reality: Old diesel generators producing noise and fume beyond the permissible limits were used.        
	Sudhanshu De, the ground secretary of the guild, blamed the West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation (WBTPO), the custodian of Milon Mela, for not setting up adequate infrastructure to hold a big fair.        
	He, however, admitted that banned plastic bags and polluting generators were used, and blamed the civic body for the dust in the parking zone.        
	Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer in the environment department, said it was the civic bodys duty to inspect whether fair organisers were following the norms.        
	What does the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has to say? According to mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, the organisers of an international fair were expected to abide by all norms.         
	WBTPO officials could not be contacted for comment.                    JAYANTA BASU

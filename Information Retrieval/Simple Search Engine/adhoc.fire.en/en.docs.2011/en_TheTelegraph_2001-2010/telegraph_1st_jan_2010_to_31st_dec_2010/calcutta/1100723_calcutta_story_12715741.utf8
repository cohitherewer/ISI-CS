The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plea to port trust to sink idol dispute
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Plea to port trust to sink idol dispute
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Green activist Subhash Dutta has petitioned Calcutta Port Trust to help clean the Hooghly of clay idols immediately after the Durga puja immersions.         
	The city stretch of the river is highly polluted with clay idols and other immersion debris floating all over despite a high court order to fish these out soon after the annual festivities.         
	The courts order has apparently not been properly implemented because of bickering between Calcutta Port Trust and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	Duttas petition to the port trust lists several other violations that have contributed to river pollution. Dredged mud is seldom lifted from the riverbed, which affects the tidal flow. Dumping of solid waste in the river is also a chronic problem, he said.        
	nFire: A fire broke out in a Naktala watch showroom on Thursday morning. Two fire tenders doused the flames within an hour. Nobody was injured.        
	nRescued: Two Class IV girls who had fled home for fear of failing in an exam were rescued by police and handed over to their parents on Thursday. Cops found the duo roaming around in Ekbalpore Lane.        
	nDead: Amiya Poddar, 56, died when the verandah of a two-storeyed building in Beleghata collapsed around 7.30am on Thursday. He was declared brought dead at NRS hospital.

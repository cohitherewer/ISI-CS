The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Scan respite from airport queues
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Scan respite from airport queues
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	An in-line scanning system being introduced in the domestic terminal of the airport will spare fliers the woes of standing in a queue to get their registered luggage checked.        
	The new system will also reduce chances of pilferage by loaders, a common problem faced by passengers.        
	The new in-line X-ray baggage handling system will be operational in about a months time. The installation work is in progress, airport director R. Srinivasan said on Tuesday.        
	The imported system is being fitted into three conveyor belts in the departure lounge of the domestic terminal.        
	A truncated form of the system is now being run experimentally. Once fully operational, four of the five manual X-ray machines in the lounge will be removed. The one that will remain will only be used for scanning oversized baggage.        
	Passengers, after entering the segregated area, will not have to stand in a queue. They can go straight to the check-in counter and the registered luggage will be automatically scanned on the conveyor belt, said Srinivasan.        
	The system will conduct a four-level scan. In Level I, the screening will be undertaken by a high-speed X-ray machine with automatic explosive detection facility. The baggage not cleared by this level will be analysed by experts at a remote workstation.        
	Multiple pictures of a baggage will be taken from various angles while it is moving on the conveyor belt. Those images will be analysed by the expert within 15 to 20 seconds, said an official.         
	If a baggage fails to clear the second level, it will be diverted to a section where the scanning will be done manually.        
	If the baggage fails the third test, too, then the passenger will be summoned, he said.        
	Each belt will have 50 to 60 sensors, which will track a baggage from the moment it is being put on the belt till taken off and put in the luggage van, said an official.        
	If a baggage is lifted midway and then put back, the sensors will immediately set off an alarm. The security personnel will get to know that the baggage has been tampered with.        
	A shaded area has been created on the apron side of the airport to house the new system.         
	The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has spent Rs 25 crore on installing the in-line baggage system which has been imported from Holland. Air India has been hired to scan passenger baggage using the new system for three years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Repoll in 3 booths today
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Repoll in 3 booths today
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The State Election Commission has ordered repolling in three booths under different wards of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation on Tuesday.        
	Repolling will take place on Tuesday (from 7am till 3pm) in polling stations 15A of ward 83, 13A of ward 94 and 21 of ward 101 of the CMC, said state election commissioner Mira Pande.        
	Votes polled afresh in these three booths will be counted along with the rest on Wednesday.        
	Malfunctioning electronic voting machines necessitated the repoll in a booth each in wards 83 and 94.         
	In ward 101, trouble over a Tripura State Rifles jawan firing at alleged political goons  one person was injured  prompted the poll panel to order repolling in that particular booth.        
	The presiding officer of polling station 13A in Jubilee Park (ward 94), off Prince Anwar Shah Road, was forced to suspend polling on Sunday after a mismatch between the number of votes cast and the number displayed on the machine.        
	In the first hour of polling, 48 people had cast their votes but the machine registered only one, an official told Metro.        
	Polling station 15A (Deshbandhu Girls School) in ward 83 on Sadananda Road had faced similar problems.        
	Forty-two votes were cast in the first 75 minutes, but the machine showed only eight votes.        
	A team of technical experts will investigate the snags that necessitated repolling. We will know soon enough why the EVMs malfunctioned, said S.N. Roychowdhury, the secretary of the State Election Commission.

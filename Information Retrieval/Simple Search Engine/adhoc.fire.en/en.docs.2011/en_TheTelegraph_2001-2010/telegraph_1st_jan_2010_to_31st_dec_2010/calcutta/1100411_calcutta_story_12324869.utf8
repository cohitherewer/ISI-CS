	If a picture says a thousand words, then Dayanita Singhs photographs tell as many stories. One of the most gifted artists of our times, Singh is a much loved figure in Calcutta. A frequent visitor, she has photographed many eminent Calcuttans, who are part of her collection of portraits, Ladies of Calcutta (2008).        
	Apart from its unique gem-like clarity, Singhs black-and-white work seduces the viewer with what she describes as a novelistic plot. You have to read her images as you would a novel. She spends months sequencing each body of work until she has told her tale, Singh explained at the launch of her latest book, Dream Villa (based on the exhibition in Delhi earlier this year), at Max Mueller Bhavan on Thursday.         
	Dream Villa looks like an engagement diary, but holds within itself a world where nothing is quite what it seems. The gutter runs through every image, says Singh, as though I have slaughtered my own pictures. But if you look hard enough, you can see the full thing, though it leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling. There are no page numbers, and the binding is such that the book snaps shut if you try to keep it open on a table. You have to hold it in your hands and read it.        
	It is also the fruit of a strange accident. A few years ago, Singh had run out of black-and-white film while photographing a factory. So she used daylight film after sunset, and the effect was stunning. That experiment led to The Blue Book, and then to Dream Villa.         
	Singhs books owe a great deal to their maker, Gerhard Steidl, who is an institution of sorts in Germany. Described by Singh as a completely eccentric man, Steidl has worked with artists like Joseph Beuys and Gnter Grass, and is one of the most respected publishers of photo-books in the world.         
	A thoroughly unpredictable man, Steidl inspires unconventionality. He has no time for fancy theories, or any patience with curators dictating the content of his books, which he sets apart from catalogues that are random assortments of images.         
	From choosing the end paper to the logic of the sequence, he expects the artist to be involved at every stage of the production. The experience is as humbling as it is hands-on. When I started working with Gerhard, he gave me scissors and scotch tapes: thats how I was supposed to edit my book, gathering up the sheets in my hands, feeling the weight and the texture of the final product, Singh recounted, The Macs and the big computers would come later, Gerhard said.

	Steidls marketing strategies are equally fascinating. When Singh made her first artists book with him, called Chairs, she did not want it to be sold. Instead she would have it gifted, in editions of 10, to friends, who would then give it away to people they wanted to. This secret distribution system was a great success: from bus-drivers in Berlin to the artist, Saul Levitt, in Connecticut, the book travelled to distant corners.         
	Singhs work can be discovered in strange places. Sent a Letter, a collection of little accordion-fold books of pictures taken in six Indian cities is on display at Satramdas Dhalamal on Park Street.         
	Since I am not a writer, I would cut and paste images from my contact sheets after each trip and send a photo-letter to any friends who had travelled with me, Singh explained. When I sent one such letter to Gerhard, he wanted to publish it, and thats how Sent a Letter started.        
	This small format book lends itself to private exhibitions in peoples living rooms or in shop windows, as in Park Street. (For the curious, the paanwallah and the three beggar sisters who live on the footpath outside are the self-appointed guides to the work.)        
	This is precisely the reach that Singh wants to have. If there is any merit in my work, she says, I hope it would be on the streets one day, next to posters of Hrithik Roshan and Shah Rukh Khan.

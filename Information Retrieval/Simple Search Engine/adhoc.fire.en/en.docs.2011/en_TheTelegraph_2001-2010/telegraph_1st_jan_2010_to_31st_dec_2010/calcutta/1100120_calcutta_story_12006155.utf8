                      Shared perceptions        For Bangladeshi artist Najma Akhtar, abstract paintings reveal meanings of things otherwise unknown. Science, we know, has a long way to go to decipher the lsquo;true rsquo; meaning of different aspects of the natural world. Yet, she admits, the universe is full of surprises and revelations. In her art, Akhtar refuses to confine her perception within the periphery of the empirically known world. Her creative vision allows her to listen to the song of nature even without understanding its literal meaning. Her new series, Secret Notations, is a celebration of her own perception, and also an attempt to share her partial understanding of the natural world. Her works are very direct and, to some extent, deal with the complex truth of our time. However, this complexity is perfectly balanced with her simplicity of purpose and execution. In fact, her works are not fully abstract either. Her sufferings and joys are camouflaged in her canvas. There are rivers, people and other elements of Bangladesh beautifully integrated with the architecture of her canvases. At the same time, however, her paintings successfully carry a universal thought and meaning. In one sense, they are reflections of her own personality and her inner world.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cabbies push for ad permit 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cabbies push for ad permit 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A section of taxi operators on Tuesday gave state transport minister Ranjit Kundu a fortnight to either allow backlit advertisement boards atop cabs or hike fares.        
	A delegation from Bengal Taxi Association, to which the owners of about 45 per cent of the city taxis are affiliated, led by its general secretary Bimal Guha met Kundu in his chamber at Writers Buildings in the morning.         
	When the minister refused to allow advertisements on taxis, a heated exchange ensued between the operators and him.        
	Taxi owners can earn about Rs 800 a month from each vehicle by installing the backlit boards. Each driver can earn Rs 300 per month from the advertisement. Why wont the government allow this? asked Guha.        
	Kundu rejected the proposal for the second time in two months. It will not happen. I have said earlier that advertisements can be allowed on the sides of the vehicles but not on top, he said.        
	The operators insisted on advertisements atop taxis since those on the sides do not yield as much revenue.         
	When the minister refused to budge, Guha demanded higher fares to meet the additional expenses taxi owners have had to bear since diesel got dearer. We need higher fares if you will not leave us any alternative. An upward revision in the fare structure is a must given the circumstances, the taxi union leader said.        
	Kundu ruled out a fare hike and asked operators not to reiterate such demands.         
	The state government, by paying a subsidy of Rs 2 per litre on diesel, to transporters, has done everything within its reach, the minister said later.        
	Guha warned that taxi operators would increase fares on their own, like auto operators. We give the government a fortnight. If it does not hike fares, it must permit us to install backlit boards, said Guha.        
	Kundu dared Guha to carry out his threat. Let them try and increase the fares on their own. We will remove their taxis from the roads. We will not increase fares or allow them to do so on their own. We will take the necessary steps, Kundu said in the afternoon.

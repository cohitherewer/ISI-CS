                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Open door for burglar
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A house in Shyampukur was burgled on Tuesday night as the family slept with all windows and doors ajar to beat the heat.         
	Dhananjay Chakrabarty, an advocate of Bankshall court, said thieves had entered his two-storeyed house on Raja Nabakrishna Deb Street and decamped with cash and jewellery worth Rs 3 lakh.         
	Police said the thieves had entered the house through the roof door. There was no sign of forced entry, said city detective chief Damayanti Sen.        
	Chakrabarty said he and his wife were sleeping on the ground floor while his aunt and a help were in the first-floor bedroom.         
	It was so hot, we kept all the windows and doors open. None of us heard any sound at night and did not realise when the burglars entered the house, Chakrabarty told the police.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Palestine amp; menopause

          caleidoscope                            Suad Amiry at a book-reading session in the city; (below) Andrea Berrini. (Sanat Kumar Sinha amp; Rashbehari Das)                     
	Palestinian author Suad Amiry chats with Sudeshna Banerjee about Hamas, sexuality, democracy and her mother-in-law               
	Suad Amiry is a lively raconteur. Her eyes light up, her hands create arches in the air, her deep voice is animated, she stands up, telling a tale before an audience that breaks into guffaws at her accounts of life back home. But speak to her alone, and her fingers grip a pen, etching a map, and then bold strokes mark out what is left of it to call her homeland. It tells you chillingly what it means to live in Palestine.         
	Living in occupied territory makes it a challenge to retain your humanity. That is why I have decided to speak of the drama of our lives by making fun of the absurdity of the drama, she says.         
	Amiry is touring India with her book Menopausal Palestine and spent a couple of days in Calcutta last week. An architect by profession, she became an author by accident  thanks to Sharon and my mother-in-law, both of whom made me suffer so much.         
	Sharon is Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Premier who sent the army to lay siege on Ramallah, her hometown. They started demolishing the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) headquarters almost over Chairman Arafats head. There was no water, no light for 42 days. That made her bring home her mother-in-law, all of 91 and living alone. There were Israeli soldiers out in the garden. Her mother-in-law kept asking whether there was enough sugar or food. When she slept, I emailed to friends daily. A friend forced these emails out in the European Parliament in Brussels.        
	That book, Sharon and My Mother-in-Law, translated into 20 languages, did not spur a second; the victory of the right-wing Hamas over the PLO in the 2006 elections did.         
	We have a group of women friends who left their country to join the Palestine movement. She is the daughter of a Palestinian refugee who fled to Jordan when Israel was created out of Palestine. But I chose to come back.         
	Once a month, the women meet over dinner and discuss Hamas and sex, democracy and sagging buttocks. The waiters at the restaurant are eager to serve us so they can eavesdrop, she grins.         
	When Hamas was elected, the group was in shock. In their personal lives, for us, menopausal women, it was a time for reflection on our past as well as anxiety over our sexuality. It was a similar moment of crisis for Palestine.        
	Her stories are from life around her. I probe why each of us worked for PLO. A Syrian friend became liberal because a grandmother asked her not to go out in the streets.         
	Her next book, Murad Murad: Night Hunters, too, has been wrung out of her by another crisis  the building of a wall around Israel, making 200,000 workers, who made a living in Israeli territory, illegal.         
	Milan merchant        
	Andrea Berrini, CEO of Metropoli dAsia from Milan, has come in search of a Bengali novelist who writes about contemporary Calcutta in a language that young people would be able to identify with. The silver-haired and bearded Berrini is himself a writer of creative non-fiction and an expert in micro-credit whose company operates in Latin American and African countries. But Metropoli dAsia is a publishing house that brings out Italian translations of latest modern fiction written in Asian countries like China, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and India.        
	Berrini says in Italy there is a new awareness that Asian countries are becoming important. Magazines carry plenty of articles about people in Mumbai, Jakarta and Shanghai. There is a consciousness that many Indians and Asians now live the same kind of life as people in the West. They wake up and take the Metro to office, return home and watch TV. The old perception  a wrong perception, Berrini admits  was that India is a rural country.

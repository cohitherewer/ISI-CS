The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cashless quandary creeps into town
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cashless quandary creeps into town
  - Doubts over insurance vs hospital bill battle           RITH BASU                                                  
	Ian Zacariah, 66, had to spend 30 extra hours in hospital earlier this week because the third party administrator (TPA) for his insurance company failed to sanction the hospital bill, though it was less than his total sum assured.        
	The freelance writer finally left for home after signing a post-dated cheque for Rs 3,78,718 and wondering if the public sector unit healthcare insurance companies are suspending cashless facilities in Calcutta too.        
	For those not in the loop, the cashless facility was suspended in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore earlier this month amid allegations of overbilling by hospitals. The facility has already made a comeback to all the cities apart from Chennai.        
	I was discharged from Woodlands on July 19, three days after undergoing angioplasty. But the TPA kept delaying approving the bill. Does that mean that PSU medical insurance companies are suspending cashless transactions in Calcutta? wondered the Ballygunge resident.        
	Zacariah is not the only one asking that question. According to S.B. Purakayastha, CEO of Ruby General Hospital, almost every patient covered by medical insurance  which is 30 per cent of all those admitted  is inquiring if the cashless promise is still being honoured in city.        
	An official of a TPA company told Metro that patients in Calcutta need not worry about the suspension of cashless transactions just yet.        
	There is confusion because National Insurance, New India Assurance, Oriental Insurance and United India Insurance have stopped the cashless facility in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore earlier this month, he added.        
	Industry estimates put the medical insurance market share of these four players at an overwhelming 90 per cent in Calcutta. The remainder is shared by private players like Reliance, ICICI and Bajaj.        
	Partha Mukherjee, the distribution manager (east) of National Insurance Company said the cashless card was still being given to new customers in Calcutta but admitted that the future was uncertain. We dont know what instructions we will get next month.        
	The PSU insurance companies have demanded city-specific uniform packages for similar medical procedures in hospitals of the same category. This, they said, would replace the cashless method to prevent overbilling. But the hospitals have refused to toe the line, forcing the cashless system back in most metros, said the TPA official.        
	The answer, said the CEO of Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals Rupali Basu, lay in all the stakeholders being flexible and coming to an understanding. The hospitals can see where they can prune bills while insurance companies can change certain rules and patients too have a role to play, she said.        
	Among the need-to-change norms Basu mentioned the fact that most policies dont cover procedures that take place in day-care, forcing the patient to get admitted.

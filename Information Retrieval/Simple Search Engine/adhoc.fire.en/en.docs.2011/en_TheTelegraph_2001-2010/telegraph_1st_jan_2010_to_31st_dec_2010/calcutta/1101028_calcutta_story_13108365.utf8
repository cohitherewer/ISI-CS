          A STAFF REPORTER                                      Manoj Bhansali      
	Sleuths probing the murder of Howrah trader Manoj Bhansali suspect that the 24-year-old was riding pillion on the motorcycle of a former business partner when he was shot early on Tuesday.        
	The former partner, a resident of Andul in Howrah, has emerged as a prime suspect though police would not officially say so.        
	Sukhes Kumar Jain, the additional superintendent of police (town), said: We are talking to many persons to know the antecedent of the man on whose bike Manoj was riding pillion.        
	Manoj, a resident of Narasingha Dutta Road, ran a sari business in Burrabazar with father Sekhar Chand and younger brother Virendra. He saw off a Jamshedpur trader, Manish Khemka, at Howrah station and was returning home riding pillion on a red motorcycle when two bullets went through his skull a kilometre from his home.        
	Police sources said Manoj had started a share trading business with the Andul resident (his identity is being withheld as the police have not officially named him) four years ago. The suspect, however, left the business following a row over sharing of profits.        
	The sources said the suspect often demanded money from Manoj even after the two parted ways.        
	Some family associates said Manoj started distancing himself from the Andul resident after learning about his underworld links. Manoj later wound up the share business, said a person close to the family.        
	Asked about the suspect, Sekhar Chand said: How would I know whom Manoj had befriended. He was an adult. The police are also verifying the statements of Khemka, who regularly bought saris from the Bhansali store.

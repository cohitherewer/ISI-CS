  - The homeless                            WAITING TO GET HOME: Elderly residents of Stephen Court sit on Park Street, opposite the burnt and blackened building that is home, on Wednesday morning. (Pabitra Das)                                  
	Till lunchtime on Tuesday, they were proud residents of Park Street. But by the time Wednesday dawned, they could do little but sit on Park Street  quite literally  and gaze up at the blackened and burnt walls of their homelessness.        
	Hundreds of residents and occupants of Stephen Court despaired to get back into their homes and offices on Wednesday, some to take stock of the devastation and others because they had nowhere else to go.        
	K.K. Saha, a retired insurance officer, spent the night on the Flurys footpath with his wife and two children. We hear that the fire has spared our house on the fifth floor but the cops are not letting us in. All we want is to see how things are and to fetch some clothes and some money, pleaded Saha.        
	Also spending the night on Park Street was Sandeep Chokhani, 34, dealing in computer parts from an office on the fourth floor. The office, with computers and gadgets worth several lakhs, lies unlocked. I have been trying desperately to enter the premises just to secure my office, said Chokhani, brandishing five locks.        
	Hitesh Ratnani, a resident of the second floor was seen pleading with a policemen posted outside the Middleton Row gate of the building. I just want to retrieve my fathers medicines and prescription. He is a heart patient, said Hitesh, who had fled the building with his 70-year-old father and 62-year-old mother.        
	A few got lucky. I had been trying to enter my house on the fifth floor since last night. Finally I was allowed in around 11.30am with some cops. I brought out whatever I could save. The cops said they would demolish the upper two floors. I dont know where we will go now, despaired Arun Agarwal.        
	He and some others were resigned to spending another night on the Park Street footpath, just below what used to be home.

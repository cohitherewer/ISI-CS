                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Song snip for Sundari
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The makers of Ogo Bodhu Sundari have decided to delete the three songs copied from Uttam Kumars 1981 film of the same name and also change the logo, though the high court division bench hearing the case filed by the producer of the earlier film is yet to pass a verdict.        
	I had taken the copyright of the songs from Inreco Records but some loopholes in the copyright have surfaced. The case is still on but weve decided to re-shoot the songs, change the logo and release the film in October. We will change the lyrics of the songs too. The re-shoot will cost us Rs 10 lakh more but these songs are vital in carrying the story forward, said the films director Sunando Mitra on Friday, with leading man Babul Supriyo by his side.         
	Housefull case: Three sons of late Prakash Mehra moved the high court on Friday to stop Sajid Nadiadwalas film Housefull being telecast on STAR Plus with the song Apni to jaisi taisi. Mehra was the maker of the 1981 hit Laawaris that featured the song. When Housefull had released a few months back, the Mehras had moved a petition demanding deletion of the song from the film. On Friday, Justice K.J. Sengupta passed an interim order allowing STAR Plus to telecast the film on August 29 without the song.

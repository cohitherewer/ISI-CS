The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chased by the bullet   Remains of a bloody day
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Chased by the bullet   Remains of a bloody day
          KINSUK BASU AND AMRITA GHOSH                          Roshan Chhetri at Bodyguard Lines on Friday. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Roshan Chhetri did not know it was judgment day for Aftab Ansari. Maybe, he just doesnt want to know.        
	Limping to his Bodyguard Lines room, on an artificial left leg with a crutch jammed under his armpit, the 33-year-old was determined to shut out the American Center attack that changed his life forever.        
	Has the judgment been delivered? the Armed Force constable, whose left femur was shattered by bullets sprayed by the two motorcycle-borne assailants on the morning of January 22, 2002, asked Metro. I am not bothered. Please lets not talk about it.        
	At the home of Suresh Hembram, in Khardah Brambhanpara of Howrah, however, his family members were eager to share their relief over Fridays judgment.        
	My brother was innocent. The terrorists chased and shot him dead, said Sonaram Hembram, the elder brother of American Center victim Suresh, and also a constable with Calcutta police. I am happy that the court has not been lenient with the main men responsible for his death.        
	His wife Srimati added with a shudder, I have not forgotten the day when police came to our house to inform us that Suresh had been shot dead.        
	And however hard he may try, Roshan Chhetri cannot shut out that January dawn of bullets and blood. He keeps himself busy pushing files at his small office in the Motor Transport Section of the Bodyguard Lines in Alipore, but images of the attack just refuse to die.        
	On rare days, he blurts out to his friends how he is haunted by a face covered with a monkey cap and a pair of grey trousers opening fire.                           
	His one regret? I wish I had not fainted (from the bullet wound) or else I would have got them.        
	Friday was not such a day. I am fine now with my wife, son and my parents. I just want to move on, he says, slipping into his quarter number 44, where his six-year-old son greets him with a broad smile.        
	Life has moved on.        
	As it has for Sujit Hembram, who was just 11 month olds when he lost his father to bullets of terror.        
	Now, the eight-year-old lives with his mother Saraswati and his maternal grandparents in Baliguri of Tarakeswar, shielded from Aftab Ansari and his appeals in Calcutta courts.

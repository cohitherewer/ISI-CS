The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 81-yr-old run over by bus
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      81-yr-old run over by bus
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An 81-year-old ex-serviceman died after being run over by a private bus on Prince Anwar Shah Road on Tuesday. Police said Alokesh Bhattacharya was trying to cross the road near Dhaka Kalibari at 12.30pm when a bus on route 37 knocked him down and crushed his legs.         
	The family members of Alokesh, who worked in the civilian wing of the army, said he was rushed to Sri Aurobindo Seva Kendra but was refused treatment. He was then taken to AMRI Hospitals, Dhakuria, where he was declared dead on arrival.         
	The doctors at AMRI told us that he could have been saved if he had received medical attention earlier, said Angshuman, Alokeshs son.        
	He would have required ICU care. But all the beds were full, an official of Sri Aurobindo Seva Kendra said. A commuter who had taken Alokesh to the hospital, however, alleged that he was left unattended for 30 minutes before being denied admission.         
	After the mishap, residents broke the window panes of the bus (WB19D8380) and demanded better policing on the stretch. The signal was green when the bus ran over the man, said Dilip Bandopadhyay, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic).        
	The driver and conductors of the bus fled. The driver has been booked for rash driving and causing death due to negligence, said an officer.        
	Alokesh lived in Haripada Dutta Lane at Golf Green with his wife, daughter-in-law and granddaughter. His elder son had died in an accident years ago. His daughter is married and his younger son, Angshuman, lives in Santoshpur.

          OUR BUREAU                                            
	For some, the nightmare of the Stephen Court fire will only end at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL).        
	With nine families claiming four charred bodies and many still searching for near and dear ones, DNA tests seem to be the only option.        
	Tomorrow, we will hand over samples from the three female bodies and one male body to the CFSL authorities, through police, for DNA sequencing, said Pradip Mitra, the director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medicine and Research on Thursday.        
	Usually, two to three days are needed for DNA matching but in these cases, it might take more time, said CFSL director C.N. Bhattacharyya.        
	He led a four-member team to SSKM Hospital on Wednesday and explained how samples should be collected from charred bodies.         
	DNA sequencing of the bodies will be difficult as they have been charred and contaminated. The quicker the samples are received, the better the results, said Bhattacharyya.        
	We have asked the hospital authorities to collect samples from deep muscles of the body, which would be less affected by fire and heat, and marrow from long bones, he added.        
	The blood samples of those who have claimed the body will also be sent to the CFSL.        
	The DNA sequencing unit of the laboratory is a centre of excellence and receives samples from across the country as well as neighbouring Nepal and Bhutan.        
	The DNA is first isolated from the collected biological sample at the sequencing laboratory and then its quality and quantity are checked. The sample is then amplified three times on a polymerase chain reactor (PCR) machine and genotyping is done in a sequencer machine. The genotypes of the victims and that of the claimants are matched for confirmation.        
	Sajid Rasool, whose sister-in-law Fathma Farheen Ansari is missing, said the police had informed them that blood samples of Fathmas immediate family members would be collected on Friday. The family claimed one of the female bodies, as did two other families.        
	Many bodies have been handed over to families. If those bodies had been wrongly identified, some of those whose blood samples are being taken would not get to perform the last rites, pointed out a senior police officer.        
	Family members of one youth who has not been seen since Tuesdays fire, Amit Jha, complained that Shakespeare Sarani police station refused to lodge a missing complaint.        
	Policemen are asking us to visit Stephen Court, hospitals and morgues to identify my brother. We have seen 17 charred bodies but did not find Amit, said Sheila Jha.

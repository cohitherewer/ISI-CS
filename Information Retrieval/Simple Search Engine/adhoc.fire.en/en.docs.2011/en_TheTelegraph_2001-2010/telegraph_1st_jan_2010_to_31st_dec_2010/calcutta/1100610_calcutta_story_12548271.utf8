          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 15-year-old boy has lost his left hand, allegedly because of an orthopaedic surgeons negligence at Howrah District Hospital. Sumit Sarkars relatives lodged a police complaint on Wednesday. Sumit, a Bally resident, broke his left hand while playing on Saturday. After seeing his hand and performing an X-ray on it, the surgeon allegedly asked the boy to come back on Wednesday.        
	After Sumit complained of pain on Sunday, he was taken to two state-run hospitals, where doctors said his hand would have to be amputated as gangrene had set in. The operation was performed in a nursing home later in the day. The Howrah hospitals superintendent said the surgeon would be punished if found guilty.

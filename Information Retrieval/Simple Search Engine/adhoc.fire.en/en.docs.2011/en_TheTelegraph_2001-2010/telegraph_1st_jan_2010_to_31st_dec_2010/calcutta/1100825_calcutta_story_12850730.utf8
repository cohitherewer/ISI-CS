The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Howrah road caves in
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Howrah road caves in
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The cave-in spot on Drainage Canal Road. (Gopal Senapati)                                   
	A Howrah road caved in early on Tuesday, creating a 6ft x 8ft crater through which water gushed out in a fountain and leaving most of the town dry.         
	Civic engineers blamed a crack in the water mains 12ft below the ground for the subsidence on Drainage Canal Road, off Kona Expressway.         
	All 44 wards in the core area of the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) went without water throughout Tuesday because of the fault.        
	Traffic flow on the road was also disrupted on Tuesday.        
	HMC sources said the ground caved in around 12.30am and water started jetting out immediately. Within minutes, a part of Drainage Canal Road and Sarat Chatterjee Road was under knee-deep water.        
	Howrah mayor Mamata Jaiswal said: Our engineers are working on a war footing to repair the crack in the pipeline and restore water supply. I hope to resume water supply by Wednesday morning.        
	Ashis Sen, a civic engineer, said: The crack developed on a part of the pipe where welding was done earlier. We will weld the crack again before resuming water supply.         
	Samir Saha, in charge of water supply, said: We know the residents of Howrah town are suffering but we are helpless. It was not possible for us to send water tankers to all the 44 wards.        
	Arun Roy Choudhury, the opposition leader in the HMC, predicted many similar incidents if old pipes were not replaced.

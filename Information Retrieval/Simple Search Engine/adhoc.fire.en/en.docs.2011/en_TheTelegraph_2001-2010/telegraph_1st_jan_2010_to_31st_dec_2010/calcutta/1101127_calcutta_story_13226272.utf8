                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Robbery bid on wheelchair
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three siblings, one of them confined to a wheelchair, allegedly tried to loot a jewellery showroom in north Calcutta on Friday morning but ended up behind bars.        
	The youngest, 20-year-old Chandan Mullick, entered the shop at 77/1 Bidhan Sarani minutes after it opened around 11.30am and asked for a gold chain. The lone employee in the shop asked him to wait till the owner arrived. At this, Chandan picked a fight with him.         
	While the two were quarrelling, Chandans 22-year-old sister Uma rushed into the shop and tried to make the employee unconscious by covering his nose with her gloves that had been dipped in chloroform, said an officer of Burtolla police station.         
	The owner reached the shop at this point and closed the collapsible gate so that the three could not escape. The eldest of the Mullick siblings and the alleged mastermind, 25-year-old Ramesh, who was sitting on his motorised wheelchair outside the showroom, immediately opened the gate and tried to stop residents and pedestrians from rushing into the store.         
	The three, originally from Chhapra in Bihar, live with their parents in Cossipore.        
	For the past two days, Ramesh had been sitting in his wheelchair studying the shop from the opposite side of the street. The siblings claimed they had decided to loot the store to overcome a financial crunch, said an officer.

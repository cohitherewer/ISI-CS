The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | College polls clubbed to prevent violence
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      College polls clubbed to prevent violence
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARYYA                              
	The North 24-Parganas district administration has announced that the colleges in each sub-division will hold their student union elections on the same day, the move aimed at curbing mobilisation of outsiders and ensuring peaceful polls.        
	The elections for setting up the managing committees of the schools, too, will be held on fixed dates. The same-day polls in schools and colleges in a sub-division will minimise chances of trouble, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	A probe into the series of unrest over school and college polls last year had revealed that a set of around 200 supporters of the CPM and Trinamul were responsible for the troubles.        
	The supporters, most of whom are no longer students, used to turn up at each college on the poll day and foment trouble. If the elections in a sub-division are held on the same day, the trouble-makers will be denied a chance to invade a campus en masse, said a senior official of the district administration.        
	There are 57 colleges and 1,200 schools in the five sub-divisions of the district, where elections are due between December and February.        
	The student union elections in all 27 colleges in the Barrackpore sub-division will be held on January 29. The managing committee polls in 62 state-aided schools in the sub-division will be held on December 19 and January 9.        
	The elections in the three colleges in the Bongaon sub-division will be held in the second week of February. As for the schools, we have asked them to conduct the polls only on Sundays, said Bongaon SDO Sanjoy Mukherjee.        
	The dates for the Basirhat, Barasat and Bidhannagar sub-divisions are yet to be fixed.        
	Were happy with the move, said Ashoke Ranjan Thakur, the vice-chancellor of West Bengal State University in Barasat, to which all colleges in the district are affiliated. We hope the elections in all 57 affiliates will be peaceful.        
	The higher education department had last year issued a circular stating that college polls in each district be held on the same day. North 24-Parganas becomes the first district to carry out the order, though in a modified form.

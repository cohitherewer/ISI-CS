The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Quarter rent for book fair
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Quarter rent for book fair
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The crowd at Book Fair 2010 at Milan Mela                                  
	The government has decided to slash the Milan Mela rent to almost half for commercial fairs and a fourth for non-commercial ones, sources in the industries department said on Wednesday.        
	The Calcutta Book Fair, which enjoys the chief ministers patronage, is likely to be classified as non-commercial and its organisers will thus have to pay Rs 75 lakh, instead of the original Rs 3.14 crore bill, to hold the event in the complex off the EM Bypass.         
	According to the sources, the Rs 12.25 lakh-a-day rent announced last week has been reduced to Rs 6 lakh a day for fairs of commercial nature and to Rs 3 lakh for those that are non-commercial.        
	After the latest revision, the book fair organisers will have to pay Rs 75 lakh for 25 days booking, said an official of the industries department.        
	The organisers had paid Rs 38 lakh for this years edition of the fair.        
	The Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which will hold The Industrial India Trade Fair from December 24, will be asked to pay Rs 1.2 crore in place of Rs 2.5 crore that had been demanded from it last Friday, added the official.        
	On Saturday, industries minister Nirupam Sen, whose department controls Milan Mela, had said they (the book fair organisers) only do business there.        
	The rate slash will be approved by the industries minister after he returns to the city this weekend, said an official of his department on Wednesday.        
	Sources said finance minister Asim Dasgupta had spoken to Sen, now in Hyderabad for a party programme, at the chief ministers behest. Dasgupta on Tuesday negotiated a discount for the chamber after it threatened to pull out of the fair.

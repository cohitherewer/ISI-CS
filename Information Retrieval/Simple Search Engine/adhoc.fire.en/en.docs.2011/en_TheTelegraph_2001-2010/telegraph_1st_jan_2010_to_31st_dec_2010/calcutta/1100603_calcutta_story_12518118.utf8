										      POULOMI BANERJEE AND CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE       women won 68 wards out of 141

	In the drawing room of Congressman Ram Pyare Ram, the seasoned politician is jubilant. Not because he has won, for a ninth time. But because his wife has won.        
	Hema Ram, 52, has been elected councillor from ward 80. This will be her second stint at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). She had first won in 2005. Ward 80 became a womans ward and my husband needed a candidate he could trust. So he chose me, she says.        
	I knew I would win, she says. In fact, that was her first thought after the municipal poll results were announced on Wednesday. Two factors that she thinks helped her win in the Port area were the years of good work put in by my husband and the help and efforts of the party-workers.        
	Hema is one of the 68 women who have won the municipal polls this year. But this time, the ward was not reserved for women. She seems to have come some way after being chosen to fill a seat.        
	So many women in the CMC  about a half of it is female. And about a third of the elected women won from unreserved tickets. For some of them, its an achievement.                  
	For 26-year-old Sweta Indoria, too, victory was never a doubt. She fought on a Trinamul ticket, from an unreserved ward. I was pretty confident about the results, says Sweta, a resident of Zakaria Street near Mohammad Ali Park.        
	Not only is the political science graduate the only Hindu candidate in the Muslim-dominated ward 43, but also the only female contestant among the 12. She puts her second win on the trot down to her work with the women of the ward and her campaign to bring more young people in to vote.        
	CPM candidate Sheila Kapoor, who won from ward 46, contested from an unreserved seat, defeating 13 male candidates to be councillor for the second term. Her direct contact with people and her hard work are the primary reasons for her victory, feels Kapoor. Being a woman made her chances even better.        
	My ward for me is an extension of my home and I treat the residents of my ward as my family members, says she, a painter and a homemaker.         
	But if a third of the women, such as Hema Ram, won from unreserved wards, about the same number, including Hema Ram, have male political heavyweights as relatives.         
	Tanima Chatterjee, 51, who has won from ward 87, the Southern Avenue area, is Subrata Mukherjees sister. It brought tears to my eyes to see him so happy, she says.        
	Rubina Nazz walks out of the counting office in Alipore with her father-in-law Shamsuzzaman Ansari, the veteran who won from ward 136. Her husband is waiting for her outside. Rubina, 22, was fielded by her family as the Trinamul candidate from ward 135 when it was reserved for women. The burqa-clad Rubina has little to say for herself. Many of her answers are prompted by her husband and father-in-law.        
	Women politicians are expected to bring more approachability and cleanliness, literally and metaphorically. But they are also feared to be the mouthpiece for the men, from their family and their party. They are more malleable, it is felt.        
	Which of the stereotypes will the newly elected women at the CMC conform to? Or will they just do good work?

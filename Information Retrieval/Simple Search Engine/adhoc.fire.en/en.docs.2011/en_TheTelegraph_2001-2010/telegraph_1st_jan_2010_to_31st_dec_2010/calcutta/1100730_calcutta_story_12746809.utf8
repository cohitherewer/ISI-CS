                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Body in morgue for a month
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The body of a young woman, which was dumped on the SSKM Hospital premises a month ago, is still lying in a morgue as no one has turned up to claim it.        
	Police are clueless about the circumstances leading to the womans death.         
	It was an unnatural death but we are yet to come across any lead. We have sent a message to all 48 police stations in the city as well as our counterparts in the rest of the state, said an officer in the detective departments homicide wing.        
	The post-mortem revealed that the woman, who was spotted lying in a pair of jeans and a T-shirt in front of the emergency ward by a homeguard on June 29, was poisoned to death.        
	Doctors found traces of poison in her stomach. However, there was no mark of sexual assault, said Damayanti Sen, the joint commissioner of police, crime.        
	The officer said the authorities would wait for a few more days for any claimant to turn up. The body is in the police morgue in central Calcutta.        
	We generally dispose of unclaimed bodies after waiting for two weeks. In this case we have extended the deadline, said another officer.        
	Police suspect someone who wanted to save the woman brought her to the hospital after she had been poisoned.

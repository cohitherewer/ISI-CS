	The owner of Seetala Udipi Hotel in Chandni Chowk, where a fire had broken out on Monday night killing two employees, was arrested on Tuesday.         
	P. Gangadhar Rao has been booked under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC. He was produced in court and remanded in our custody till December 10, said joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim.         
	The cops started the case after the fire services department lodged an FIR against the owner of the eatery at 103 Prinsep Street with Bowbazar police station.         
	Rao, 35, a resident of 152 RL Mitra Road in Beleghata, did not have the clearances from the fire services department and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation that are necessary to run an eatery with a kitchen under the same roof.         
	The eatery did not abide by any fire-safety norm. Several gas cylinders were stacked on the top of the false ceiling. A lot of precautions need to be taken if gas cylinders are stored in a room but the eatery owner did not take any, said divisional fire officer Tapan Ghosh.         
	Rao has also been booked under sections 11j, 11c and 11l of the West Bengal Fire Services Act. We have charged the owner of the eatery for negligence in fire protection and not having an NOC from the fire department, added Ghosh.         
	Sources in the fire services department told Metro that such serious charges by both the police and the firemen are rare.        
	Littu Singh, a cook, and Mahesh, a waiter, were trapped on the mezzanine floor after the fire broke out in the ground-floor kitchen. They had lost consciousness after inhaling poisonous fumes by the time they were taken out. The two were declared brought dead at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.        
	A forensic team visited the eatery on Tuesday and collect samples. It is too early to say what caused the fire, said an officer.        
	According to insiders, preliminary investigation suggests an electrical short circuit sparked the flames.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Train disabled by axle jam
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Train disabled by axle jam
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Forty-eight hours after two coaches of a Metro train packed with passengers were derailed near Central station by an axle cap that came undone, services were hit on Friday when the axle of an empty rake got jammed near the crossover point of Kavi Subhas (New Garia) station.        
	According to Metro officials, after passengers had disembarked, the empty rake was trundling along to make the switch and start its journey towards Dum Dum when the wheels ground to a halt and the train was stalled.        
	The cause? An axle fault.        
	The effect? Another reason for the Metro passenger to be wary of boarding a transport system struggling under the strain of age and apathy.        
	With the rake that derailed on Wednesday still out of action and the one that suffered Fridays fault struggling to get back on its wheels, the overstretched underground system is now down to 17 rakes, including two AC rakes that only make one trip a day.        
	The incident happened at 9.58am. Since the rake had stopped just before the first crossover point, the trains moving towards Kavi Subhas were stopped at various stations, said a Metro official.        
	The driver then somehow took the rake past the first crossover point and stopped near the second point. Once the first point was cleared, train services resumed from 10.10am, he added.        
	Senior officials from the electrical engineering section rushed to the spot to repair the damage.        
	The damage could not be repaired till late on Friday. We could not risk bringing the rake back to the Tollygunge maintenance depot. If the train stalled again, the entire service would have gone haywire, said an official.         
	An axle is a rod that connects a pair of wheels. When the axle is jammed, the wheels also get locked.        
	The wheels refused to roll and since the driver had to keep the first crossover point clear to allow services to resume, he dragged the wheels with the jammed axle past it. As a result, the wheels were badly damaged, said another official.        
	Dilip Mukherjee, the general secretary of Metro Railway Mens Union, alleged that the rake that stalled on Friday was one of the oldest in the fleet. It is not fit to run anymore. The authorities are taking a huge risk in plying these Metro rakes. Even the periodical overhauling of the trains is not done properly, he said.        
	The Metro passenger count has dropped since the derailment dread on Wednesday. Friday being Lakshmi Puja, the pressure was even less.  FRIDAY FAULT
    An axle got jammed, locking the wheels and forcing an empty rake to a halt. When the driver tried to clear the tracks for other trains to pass, the wheels were badly damaged  WEDNESDAY SCARE

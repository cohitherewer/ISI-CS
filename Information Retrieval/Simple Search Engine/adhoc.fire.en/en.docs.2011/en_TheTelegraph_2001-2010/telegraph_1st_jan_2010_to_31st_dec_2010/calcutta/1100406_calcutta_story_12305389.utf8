          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                           Stephen Court on March 23. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The high court on Monday modified an earlier order and allowed the residents of two blocks of Stephen Court unaffected by the March 23 blaze to enter their flats freely.         
	The court also asked the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and police to draw up a plan on how to keep belongings housed in the affected portions safe and secure.         
	The CMC and the police will have to submit the formula on April 8, after which the court will pass its order, said Justice G.C. Gupta.         
	The judge asked two agencies to decide whether more than two persons could be allowed to enter each flat. The orders were passed in response to pleas by two residents of Stephen Court.        
	Shaktinath Mukherjee, the lawyer appearing for resident Devraj Sharma, said: My client has a flat on the third floor in the unaffected portion of the building. But as the court had passed a general order, my client is being prevented from entering his home.        
	The court then exempted the two unaffected blocks from the previous order.        
	L.C. Behani, the advocate appearing for the other resident, Mahendra Golcha, said his clients flat had been affected badly.         
	My client lost his mother in the fire. Civic officials are not allowing his family to take away valuable items like washing machine, refrigerator and almirah, said Behani.        
	Suman Ghosh, the lawyer appearing for the police and the fire services, produced photographs to show that Golcha and some others had entered Stephen Court in violation of the court order.         
	The court had asked the CMC and police to allow only two persons to enter each flat. But Golcha and some of his associates did not obey the court order, he pointed out.        
	Golchas counsel told the court that his client feared the articles in his flat might be lost if left unattended.        
	At least the court should ask the CMC to remove the articles and hand it over to my client, he said.         
	When the civic body declined to take up the responsibility, the court passed the order asking the CMC and the police to come up with a safeguard formula.

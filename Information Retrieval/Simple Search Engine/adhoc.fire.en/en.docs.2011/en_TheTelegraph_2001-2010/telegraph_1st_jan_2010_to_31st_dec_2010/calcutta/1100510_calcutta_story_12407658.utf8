The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City cops for Bypass traffic
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City cops for Bypass traffic
          KINSUK BASU                          Traffic on the EM Bypass has increased                                  
	The state government is set to entrust Calcutta police with traffic management on the entire 19.5km EM Bypass but shortage of cops could prove a roadblock.        
	The South 24-Parganas traffic police currently manage the 5km stretch south of the Ruby rotary. According to the plan, Beleghata traffic guard would take over the responsibility. Ultadanga traffic guard would continue manning the Bypass stretch north of the Maniktala Main Road crossing.         
	While an official announcement is awaited, Writers Buildings has asked the top brass of the city police to prepare for the switch, said a source. We have scanned the stretch to figure out how things would work and made arrangements. Whatever is required to ensure proper traffic management would be done, said Ranvir Kumar, the special additional commissioner (traffic police).        
	The April 13 mishap on the EM Bypass that killed five and led to the ransacking of two private hospitals had raised questions about traffic policing in the high-speed corridor.        
	According to Calcutta police officers, ensuring an improvement in traffic management would be difficult with a combined strength of 13 officers, five assistant sub-inspectors and 100-odd constables in the two traffic guards.        
	We have written to the state administration for increasing our staff strength, added Kumar.        
	Between the Ruby rotary and Maniktala Main Road, there are 20 beats (or crossings) and three constables have to be deployed at each in three shifts. Policemen also have to be posted near Salt Lake stadium and Mani Square.        
	The other problem is lack of bus bays, guard rails and other traffic management tools on the 5km stretch. Lanes have not been marked on the stretch. Even zebra crossings are absent. The bus stops have been built too close to the intersections, said a senior officer.         
	At the Ruby rotary, vehicles coming from the north and heading towards the Rashbehari Avenue connector do not have a dedicated lane to make a right turn. Drivers have to figure out by themselves, said a senior engineer of the urban development department.        
	A 2007-8 survey by the transport department had revealed that over 50,000 vehicles cross the Parama rotary from 8am to 8pm daily. Over the past two years, the vehicle count has grown making the Bypass one of the busiest arteries in the city.

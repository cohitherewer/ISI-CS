The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Birthday band, DIY vuvuzela 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Birthday band, DIY vuvuzela 
                          Bhoomi band members                    
	The first year we couldn rsquo;t even contemplate a concert. We were just glad to have lasted that long, rdquo; says Bhoomi singer and songwriter Soumitra Ray. The group is just about to celebrate its 11th year.  
	 Soumitra and Surojit Chatterjee, two independent experimenters of urban-folk and Western music, had come together to form the group with original songs. Today these two vocalists are accompanied by Hemanto Goswami, Abhijit Ghosh and Robin Lai. Jatra Suru (album) had a dream debut. It was followed by Udaan, Bhoomi Isspecial, Lokgeetir Deshe and seven other albums. They are working on their 11th album at present.				   
	Bhoomi has spent five anniversaries abroad, performing at the Montreal Jazz Festival and at a special concert at the United Nations where they presented an original English number For A Better Day.				   
	But home is home and anniversaries spent here are ldquo;a chance to meet all those who have been with us on this journey rdquo;, says Surojit. Bhoomi will dish out old favourites for the anniversary function at GD Birla Sabhagar on July 24, such as Barandai Roddur. Entry to the show is by invitation only. ldquo;We hope someone turns up with cakes hellip; rdquo; says Soumitra.				             The team near the peak       
	On top of Nandaghunti																								   
	Six members of the mountaineering club Parvat Abhiyatri Sangha successfully scaled the 6,309m Nandaghunti peak in the Garhwal Himalayas in mid-June. The six were part of a team of 11.  
	 ldquo;The expedition was special as this is the golden jubilee year when an Indian civilian team made it to the peak, rdquo; says team leader Shyamal Sarkar. The group started their trek on June 1.				   
	Nandaghunti is said to be a test of endurance rather than demanding technical skills. The approach to Nandaghunti, located on the outer rim of the Nanda Devi sanctuary, is through dense rhododendron and pine forests.
  ldquo;Reaching the base camp took four days of constant uphill walking, which is longer than it takes to reach most base camps, rdquo; says Subrata Banerjee, one of the team members. 
  This year rsquo;s group had included six young members, of whom one had no mountaineering experience.               South City International School organised its own intra-school ldquo;World Cup rdquo;. The final match was played on Saturday. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha       
	Mohua the football
  This goes out to all women in the city with the name Mohua. Nothing had prepared a young journalist by the name for this onslaught when she reached a news conference for the launch of a regional TV channel of the same name last week. 
  As she walked in, a man in black at the mike smiled and declared: ldquo;We rsquo;re ready to welcome Mohua. Mohua is here to give others a lot of competition. rdquo; She started to wonder about her infinite possibilities. ldquo;Soccer stars Romario and Branco are coming to Calcutta for Mohua! rdquo; She almost squealed in delight. ldquo;Mohua could become a football! rdquo; What? The scribe was reed-thin, rather like a wicket than a football. ldquo;I mean a football club! rdquo; the man corrected himself. 
  As she was about to step out, she was stopped. Pointing towards her someone told a channel official, ldquo;Have you met her? She rsquo;s Mohua... rdquo; ldquo;Oh, I thought she was a journalist! rdquo; the official replied.            Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands blows a vuvuzela. (AFP)      
	Dum maro dum on vuvuzela  
	The Dutch have blown it. And so have the Germans, Argentines, French, Brazilians, Americans, Spanishand now a Calcuttan. Not in the stadiums of South Africa, but on the streets of central Calcutta.         
	A 27-year-old woman, for whom football had so far meant a smoking hot Cristiano Ronaldo, was the first one to lay claim on the instrument when her colleague brought a vuvuzela to the office.         
	Then began the search for the ideal spot to let the drone out. Not anywhere near the office, was the verdict. The favourite cha stall won. The proud owner of the vuvuzela, which was done up in the flags of the playing nations, showed the way. After all, she had mastered the art the day before when Brazil had battled on the field. And she with the vuvuzela. She had won. Blow it like a conch, she advised.         
	Ronaldos admirer followed. Dum maro dum, she smiled.

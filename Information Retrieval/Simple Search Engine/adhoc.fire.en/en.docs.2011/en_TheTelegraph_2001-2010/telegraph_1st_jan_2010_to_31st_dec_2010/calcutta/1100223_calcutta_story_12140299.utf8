                      Creative collage of poetry and dance                    Eight young classical dancers and art enthusiasts, with the efforts of a common friend, collaborated from across India and agreed to fulfil a common ambition: to create a unique, innovative theme-based production in Indian classical dance, imbibing the mystic elements of theatre, music, poetry and fine arts. Thus was sown the seeds of Uttarayan (the ascent), a dance theatre and musical presentation that narrates a mythical tale of the ascent of the human spirit from the mortal to the divine. A combination of many colours, interpretations and explorations, it depicts the salvation of the female protagonist, right from her creation as music, her youth, pride and valour, her realisation of herself, her subsequent self-mortification and remorse, and finally her uddhara or sublime deliverance by the Sun-god and her blossoming into a goddess. It is a choreographic experiment to combine similar elements and emotions (both human and divine) around the world. Using excerpts and legends from three distinct classical mythologies: Greek (Hellenic), Egyptian and Indian (Hindu), it will be artistically be depicted in three Indian classical dance styles Odissi, Kathak and Bharata Natyam, as well as contemporary dance and performing yoga, and woven together in Greek drama format through pantheistic English poetry. Written and directed by Mirajur Rahman.

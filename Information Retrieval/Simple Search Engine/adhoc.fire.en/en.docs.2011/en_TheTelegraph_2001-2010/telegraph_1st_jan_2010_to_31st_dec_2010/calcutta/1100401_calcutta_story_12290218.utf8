  - How everyone with anything to do with Stephen Court was to blame          SAMBIT SAHA                                                  
	Who is to blame for the worst fire tragedy in post-Independence Calcutta? Everyone who had anything to do with Stephen Court.        
	Metro puts the principal actors under the spotlight of the human tragedy on Park Street.              
	Official Trustee of West Bengal        
	According to the will of Peter Earnest Charles Paul of 1919, the then Official Trustee of Bengal became the owner of the property. Today the Official Trustee of West Bengal owns the building at 18A Park Street but refuses to take any responsibility for it.        
	The administrator-general of the Official Trustee of West Bengal, Nirmal Kumar Ghoshal, said it was a passive owner with only rent-receiving interest. In such a long-term lease, he claimed, the lessee  in this case Stephen Court Ltd  became the de facto owner.        
	But legal experts consulted by Metro clarified that the Official Trustee cannot completely absolve itself.        
	There was negligence on the part of the Official Trustee as it never bothered to scrutinise the state of affairs at the building. Why did it not periodically send people to the building and why did it allow the lessee and the inmates to do whatever they wanted? they asked.        
	And that, allegedly, includes Stephen Court Ltd building additional floors without seeking the permission of the Official Trustee.              
	Stephen Court Ltd        
	Representatives of the company, that in the records of the Official Trustee remains the lessee of Stephen Court, maintained that they had little to do with Stephen Court with only four-five units rented out directly and the rest having been sub-leased or assigned.        
	The company claimed there were 83 owners in the property.        
	Legal experts said unless such owners were assigned  a legal position by which the new lessee becomes the original lessee of the Official Trustee  Stephen Court Ltd would still be responsible for the upkeep of the property.        
	More importantly, the locked grille leading to the roof that denied at least 17 occupants their last escape route from the fire, could invite charges of criminal negligence against Stephen Court Ltd, said sleuths.        
	The company has admitted it held the roof rights as it had the sanction to build another floor.        
	A lease deed available with Metro also confirms that Stephen Court Ltd retained control over the maintenance and operation of the lifts, lighting of the common areas or passage, watch and ward staff, sweepers, plumbers and other building maintenance staff, maintenance of the water pump and supply of water, maintenance and general upkeep of common areas and passage, and maintenance and water-proofing of the terrace.              
	Stephen Court Residents Association        
	As with most old and litigated buildings in the city, the rents were just too low for anyone  the Official Trustee was getting Rs 8,000 a year from Stephen Court Ltd, which in turn was getting peanuts from the property  to take active interest in the upkeep of Stephen Court. The residents could have made a difference, but their association has been defunct for years. It is, ironically, being revived now.              
	Stephen Court Maintenance Committee        
	All the four blocks of the building had committees comprising residents to look after the maintenance, claimed a representative of Stephen Court Ltd.        
	A document accessed by Metro names 12 office-bearers  three from Block I, four from Block II, three from Block III and two from Block IV  of a maintenance committee.        
	But residents said there was no formal maintenance committee, just volunteer groups of residents who would carry out SOS maintenance work on a crisis-to-crisis basis.        
	But no one in that death trap called Stephen Court  the de jure owner, the de facto owners, the occupants  saw the crisis of March 23 coming.

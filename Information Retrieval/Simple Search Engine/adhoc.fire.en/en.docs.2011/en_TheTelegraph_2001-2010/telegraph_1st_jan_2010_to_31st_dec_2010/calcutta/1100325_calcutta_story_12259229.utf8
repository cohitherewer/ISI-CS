                      Photo fest                    Photography is perhaps the best interpreter of society and its true social structure. Launched in 1948, Photographic Association of Bengal (PAB) was originally conceived by a group of photographers as a platform to work upon, meet, exchange views, demonstrate skills achieved through practice and experiment, and so on. The group also wanted to create awareness in the minds of photographers about artistic expression and scientific manipulation, besides exploring possibilities of applying photography as an aid to visual communication and scientific research. Over the last 60 years, the Association has indeed come a long way. Since 1987, it has been hosting biennial international salons, fulfilling its social and cultural responsibility to the country and the photographic world through the exchange of aesthetic and cultural values. To be inaugurated today at 5.30 pm, the 10th PAB Biennial International Digital Salon 2010 features works by photographers from all over India and the world. The nature section of the exhibition is also hosted by The Agri-Horticultural Society of India. Digital shows at 5.45 pm and 6.45 pm daily.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU to scrap entrance test plan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CU to scrap entrance test plan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Calcutta University (CU) is likely to abandon the plan to admit postgraduate students through entrance tests.         
	Opposition to the proposal by students unions  especially the CPMs arm SFI  forced the university authorities hand. They are now exploring the option of admitting students to MA, MSc, MTech and MCom courses on the basis of marks.         
	The authorities are examining whether marks obtained by applicants in their Class X and Class XII exams could be considered apart from their performance in the graduation examination while preparing the merit list.         
	Till last year, students had been admitted only on the basis of marks obtained in their graduation exams.         
	The university syndicate will hold a meeting on Wednesday to finalise the postgraduate admission procedure, said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.         
	A decision needs to be taken by next week as postgraduate admissions are scheduled to start from the beginning of July.         
	The university had last year announced the plan to conduct entrance tests for postgraduate courses to treat graduates from its affiliated colleges and autonomous colleges on a par.        
	Both Left and anti-Left students lobbies opposed the move, prompting the authorities to form a committee of syndicate members to suggest a suitable admission procedure.         
	One of the panels recommendations is that the university admit students on the basis of marks. Another recommendation is that the authorities select the postgraduate students through interviews after a preliminary screening on the basis of marks.         
	We cannot introduce entrance tests as students are opposed to it. The other option is to admit students on the basis of marks. A directive from the University Grants Commission has made it clear that the university cannot discriminate against students from autonomous colleges, said a member of the syndicate.        
	Calcutta University decided to change its admission policy last year after 12 students from St Xaviers College, the first affiliate to be granted autonomy, filed a case in Calcutta High Court alleging that the university had discriminated against them while fixing the postgraduate admission criteria.         
	They had complained that the university had adopted a faulty statistical tool to bring about parity between the marks obtained by St Xaviers students and those from affiliated colleges.         
	They pointed out that graduates from the Park Street college had lost CU postgraduate berths to students from its affiliates who had scored lower marks.         
	The court too directed the university to ensure that both sets of students were treated equally.

           Perfect poise: In response to the question Is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan the most beautiful woman to visit Calcutta this year?, November 15, I think in recent times none in Bollywood can match the beauty and charm of Aishwarya. She has won many a heart among cinegoers.     Ajit Kumar Guha,
  Baishnabghata                                  
	Baishnabghata           
	It is unfortunate that Jadavpur University (JU) is gradually losing its academic glory and heritage. (Students boycott and block exam, November 20).           
	The golden days of JU are gone, it seems. The campus is increasingly becoming a hotbed of politics, rather than education.           
	The students agitation is not the outcome of a day or two. Ever since education had been politicised and academic institutions came to be controlled by the ruling party, the atmosphere of Jadavpur University has been damaged. The education system has collapsed.           
	A senior faculty member has rightly said that the examination boycott call was unprecedented in the 55-year-history of the university. Another teacher has lamented that had the authorities taken a tough stand, the students would not have dared disrupt classes at the drop of a hat. But the question is when the entire administration is indirectly governed by the party line, who dares take proper action?           
	Unless education is freed from dirty politics, no remedy will be enough to restore the educational ambience in JU.           
	Mihir Kanungo,

	The report State hospital turns away two-year-old gasping for breath, November 15, exposes the inhumanity of government hospitals that the common man has to face in Buddhababus West Bengal.             
	It is difficult to make out why the government maintains such huge buildings with staff, infrastructure, specialists, all at a huge cost. If none of these hospitals can attend to such a simple emergency case, why do these white elephants exist? And the minister always remains a non-committal chief executive.           
	Sumitra De,           
	Barisha                               
	Regarding the report Pool car crash kills, injures, November 13, strict action against pool car drivers and operators may be the need of the hour but one must not overlook the role of school authorities in helping irresponsible pool car operators flourish.             
	While principals and headmasters advise parents to check the condition of pool cars, a section of teachers and staff of the same school might be hand-in-glove with the pool car operators.           
	School authorities should deal firmly with the operators, because they too have a role to play in ensuring the safety of their students.           
	Indrani Dutta,           
	Salt Lake                     
	Pool car accidents in and around the city have become almost a weekly phenomenon. Given that most pool car accidents occur either because of rash driving or random use of cellphones, errant drivers should be severely dealt with by police.           
	Prahlad Agarwala,           
	Majdia, Nadia                     
	School buses should be made mandatory for all schools and these should be governed by the state transport board that should share the responsibility with the respective schools. No other mode of transport should be allowed for ferrying schoolchildren. Taking care of our next generation is the responsibility of the state too.           
	Setaki Dasgupta,           
	Address not given                     
	I feel repeated and collaborative drives by the public vehicles department and police can curb the menace of illegal pool cars and errant drivers. Our transport minister, I hope, is sufficiently equipped with the means and measures to deter such unfortunate incidents.           
	Alok Pal,

	Brand consciousness among kids is a major problem globally (Is brand consciousness among kids a problem? How can it be addressed?, October 27). In India, its the behaviour of parents that leads to brand consciousness among kids. The adults send their children to elite schools, their visits are limited to famed restaurants, shopping malls, spas, resorts and other high-profile destinations. Counselling students and parents can help tackle the problem in case children engage in non-academic rivalry.             
	Abhijit Banerjee,           
	Madhyamgram                               
	Harassment by pre-paid taxi operators at the airport and the taxi drivers has become a regular affair now (Taxi-ing time at terminal, November 17). In the last week of November, I arrived from Guwahati around 4.45pm. After standing in queue for nearly 20 minutes, I was given a slip with a taxi number that would take me to my home in Joka.             
	I started looking for the designated taxi but it was nowhere in sight. Suddenly a man walked up to me and offered to help me locate it.           
	Though I refused, he seemed determined to help me. In no time he arrived with the taxi. He then picked up my bag without asking for permission. I started running after him, shouting to leave me alone. There was no policeman in sight.           
	After placing my bag in the taxi, the man demanded money for his help. When I refused to pay for his unsolicited help, he hurled abuses. My harassment did not end there. After reaching Joka, the cab driver demanded more money for driving so far to a suburb. And, of course, abuses followed when I refused to give him any extra money.           
	Currently, with no other taxi operator being allowed a booth inside the airport, it seems we have no option but to suffer in the hands of these politically-backed musclemen. I think allowing private operators to run pre-paid taxi booths would help travellers immensely.           
	S. Mittal,           
	Joka                     
	Metro has compared the city airport with those in Mumbai and Delhi but I think Calcutta airport is worse than even Bhubaneswar or Lucknow.           
	One can reach Calcutta from Ranchi in 50 minutes but from the NSCBI airport to Salt Lake, it takes more than one-and-a-half hour because of the long queue at the pre-paid taxi counter.           
	In other metro airports, one finds several taxi options  starting from AC to non-AC, radio cabs to normal taxis  but Calcutta offers no such option to fliers.           
	Manish,           
	Salt Lake                     
	I think the pre-paid taxi services at the airport should be privatised without delay. It will help passengers have a smooth transit from the airport. I request the people concerned to allow private operators to run the show at Calcutta airport.           
	Indranil Nag,           
	Address not given                     
	I want private taxi counters at Calcutta airport for passenger convenience during odd hours. The monopoly of the Citu-backed services needs to end soon.

	It was shocking to learn that two chemistry laboratories with important documents were gutted in a fire at Presidency University. The mishap could have been averted had the authorities taken fire-preventive measures (Dawn flames lick Presidency labs, October 30). It is surprising that the labs were bereft of the necessary fire-fighting equipment. The fire department has woken up to the fact that many educational institutions might be running without the necessary safety measures.             
	Why does the department wait for a major mishap to occur before taking action? Why cant they be more pro-active?           
	Sayantan Bhaduri,

	Apropos Seal on hawker right to pedestrian path, October 28, hawkers in Calcutta are a class by themselves. They are neither bothered about court directives nor administrative initiatives to remove them from arterial roads. Hence, legalising the hawkers right to occupy one-third of a pavement is meaningless.             
	Hawkers of this city will continue to encroach on the entire pavement. However, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee must realise that one always worships the rising sun and not the setting sun. The hawkers will align themselves with the political party that is likely to come to power, irrespective of the populous measures adopted by the previous regime.           
	A.S. Mehta,

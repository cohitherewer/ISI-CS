The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Patients in OT denied their right to know
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Patients in OT denied their right to know
          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	Lal Mohammed, 19, went to SSKM Hospital to get his deformed right index finger set right with plastic surgery but ended up losing it in the OT.        
	If the doctor had told me that there was any chance of things going wrong and my finger having to be amputated, I would definitely not have gone in for the surgery, said Lal, lying distraught on the hospital bed, after things went horribly wrong on January 28.        
	I was told it was a minor thing and that the finger would easily be repaired, said the student from Nalhati in Birbhum who was the victim of a common medical malady in the city  lack of information flow from the doctor to the patient.        
	The doctor didnt maintain a detailed information sheet about the procedure and the risks of the surgery which he should have given to the patient before the latter signed the consent form, said a member of the probe committee set up by SSKM. Lals family has filed a complaint with Bhowanipore police station.         
	The risk-benefit ratio has to be explained to a patient in a manner well understood by everybody. A doctor has to be aware about the difference between counselling and salesmanship, said cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar.        
	In Europe and the US there are booklets with all details and a doctor or counsellor helps the patient take a decision, he added.        
	According to doctors and health department officials, most state-run and private hospitals do not follow the prescribed norms of the information consent form a patient must sign before surgery.        
	We have provided a guideline to all healthcare institutes and doctors about the consent form (see box). A patient then has the option to accept or reject the line of treatment, said Dilip Kumar Ghosh, the registrar of the West Bengal Medical Council.        
	But the rule remains just on paper. Take the case of Dipti Sen, a 67-year old homemaker from Ballygunge. A diabetic for 32 years, she suffered a mild heart attack last April and a coronary angiogram revealed she had blocks in five coronary arteries.        
	On May 8, she underwent angioplasty under cardiologist Aftab Khan at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Calcutta, who implanted five stents. She then suffered renal failure and died on May 22. The doctor had not informed us about the risk, alleged Deepak Sen, her husband.         
	The family filed a complaint against the doctor with the Medical Council of India. We are conducting an inquiry and all documents have been sought from the doctor, said a state council official. Khan could not be contacted.        
	Back at SSKM, A. Sarkar, who had performed the surgery in which the vein and artery of Lals finger were damaged, refused comment. The procedure to save the two bones failed (forcing amputation), said Debasis Bhattacharyya, the medical superintendent.        
	B. Majumdar, the head of department of plastic surgery at SSKM, pointed a finger at the consent form. The form is inconclusive. We have requested Swasthya Bhavan repeatedly to send us proper forms but we are still waiting.

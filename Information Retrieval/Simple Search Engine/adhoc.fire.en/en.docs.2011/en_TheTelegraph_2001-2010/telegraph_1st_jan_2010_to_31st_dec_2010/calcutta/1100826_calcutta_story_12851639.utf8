	A wheelchair-bound Calcuttan and his wife were left stranded in a foreign airport by the callousness of an airline and then put on a plane to Delhi, where they were forced to spend a night in the lounge.        
	Murlidhar Belani, 79, and wife Lila, also in her seventies, finally arrived home on Sunday without their luggage and determined to sue Lufthansa for their ordeal.        
	We had boarding passes and yet the airline left us behind. We are still waiting for our luggage, which the airline claims is in Delhi, Belani, who is suffering from renal failure and other complications, told Metro.        
	The Chowringhee Lane couple were returning to the city from Madrid in Spain, where their daughter Kanta J. Daswani lives, when they missed the connecting flight from Frankfurt.        
	Belani, who has engaged a lawyer to file a case in the consumer court, said the airline had promised full assistance from check-in till boarding at both Madrid and Frankfurt, but left them in the lurch.        
	After getting off the flight in Frankfurt, an airline employee put me on a wheelchair and escorted us to the transit lounge. She asked us to wait there, saying we would be taken to the boarding area for the Frankfurt-Calcutta flight three hours later, Belani recounted on Wednesday.        
	Around half an hour later, another Lufthansa employee escorted the couple to another part of the lounge and asked them to stay put there.        
	A third employee arrived another 30 minutes later and pushed Belanis wheelchair till gate number B43. The person told us not to budge from the spot. We did as we were told but nobody came to take us to the plane, said Belani, who owns a garments shop on Shakespeare Sarani.        
	We almost broke down when an employee told us that the flight had left without us. My husband couldnt move without assistance, our cellphone was not working and we couldnt contact our daughter, recalled Lila.        
	Airline officials allegedly gave no explanation and said that the best they could do was issue fresh boarding passes for a flight to Delhi. When we asked about our registered luggage, they insisted that the bags were on the Calcutta-bound flight, said Belani.         
	The couple reached Delhi around 1am on Sunday and spent a sleepless night in the lounge, allegedly without any assistance from the airline. They boarded a morning flight back to the city, only to learn at the airport that their luggage didnt arrive on the direct Frankfurt flight.        
	Two days later, the airline informed us that our bags were lying at Delhi airport. They apologised for the mix-up but can just being sorry undo the damage?        
	A spokesperson for Lufthansa said the airline was investigating the incident. We are trying to find out exactly what happened at Frankfurt airport and who were the staff assisting the couple.        
	The airline has promised to deliver the luggage home when it arrives in the city. Under normal circumstances, they would have had to collect it from Delhi, the spokesperson added.

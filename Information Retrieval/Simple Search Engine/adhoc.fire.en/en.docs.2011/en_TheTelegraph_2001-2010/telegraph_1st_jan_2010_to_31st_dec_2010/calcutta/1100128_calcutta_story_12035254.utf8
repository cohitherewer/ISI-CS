The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sudden surge   in mercury
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sudden surge   in mercury
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The minimum temperature on Wednesday rose two degrees beyond the predicted mark, stumping meteorologists.        
	The minimum rose suddenly to 14.4 degrees Celsius but its still in the normal zone. The maximum, at 28.1, was also normal, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.         
	The days have been quite sunny and the humidity is low. In the absence of any low-pressure formation around the city, the present condition should persist for the rest of the month, he added.        
	The weatherman, however, clarified that winter was not yet over.        
	Its simply a phase in the transition to the final leg of the season. The nip might be a little less but we are not ruling out a renewed dip in the mercury.        
	The transitional phase is linked to the change in the solar inclination. The northern hemisphere is now slowly but steadily tilting towards the sun, heralding the onset of winter in the southern hemisphere.        
	For the chill to return, a western disturbance has to remain active till it reaches Bengal.        
	There have been several western disturbances affecting northern India but they are dying out before reaching Bengal. If a strong and active western disturbance can reach south Bengal, the chill will be restored, said a scientist at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida.        
	Thursday is likely to be mainly clear, with the temperatures ranging between 13 and 28 degrees Celsius.

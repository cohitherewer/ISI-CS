The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puff-happy in health HQ
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Puff-happy in health HQ
          RITH BASU      
	More than 53 per cent employees of Swasthya Bhavan, tasked with spreading awareness about the ban on smoking in public places, do not know how to report a violation.        
	Over 95 per cent havent lodged a single complaint in the past six months, though as many as 78 per cent are uncomfortable with passive smoking.        
	Around 32 per cent are unaware that their office is a public place and hence, within the purview of the ban.        
	A Cancer Foundation of India survey among health department employees has brought into focus the apathy of the government, headed by a puff-happy chief minister, in enforcing the ban that came into effect on October 2, 2008.            Venue: Swasthya Bhawan
  Employees: 1,000 (approx)
  Respondents: 252
  Smoking in office: 9%
  Uncomfortable with passive smoking: 78%
  Complaints filed in past six months: Less than 5 %      
	The survey was conducted among 252 employees  219 male and 33 female.        
	The survey reveals the lack of awareness about the puff ban among the state employees expected to lead the battle against tobacco, said a ban crusader.        
	To stub out the controversy arising out of the survey, the authorities have decided to make Swasthya Bhavan in Salt Lake smoke-free by May 31, World No Tobacco Day.        
	The surveyors found that nine per cent of the health department employees smoked in office. The violation was maximum on the ground floor of the G+5 structure, where 31 per cent were found to light up.        
	This was because the canteen is on the ground floor. The authorities have now singled out the canteen for special vigilance, said Sutapa Biswas, the executive director of Cancer Foundations Calcutta chapter.        
	Though more than 16 months have passed since the ban became effective, the tobacco cell hasnt booked anybody for violation. What can we do? The challans for fine (Rs 200 for a violation) are still not ready. At least I havent received any, said Lakshmi Kanta Ghosh, the medical superintendent and vice-principal of NRS hospital.        
	A department official admitted that the challans had not been distributed. Some confusion persists about which department can lay claim to the proceeds from the fines, he stalled.        
	Several respondents said they found it awkward to lodge complaints against colleagues. We have decided to keep complaint boxes to ensure anonymity for the complainants, said an official.

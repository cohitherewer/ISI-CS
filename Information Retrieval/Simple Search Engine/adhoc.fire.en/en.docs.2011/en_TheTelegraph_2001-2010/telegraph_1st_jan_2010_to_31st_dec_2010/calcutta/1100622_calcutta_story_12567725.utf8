The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | PIL on house heritage tag 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      PIL on house heritage tag 
          SOUMITRA DAS                          The gate at 5 Russell Street. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                  
	The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach), an NGO, has filed a PIL against the CMC for removing the building at 5 Russell Street from the heritage list. This is the first such case in Calcutta. The building, which along with its vandalised gate made it to the list in February 2009, was removed in the latter half of the year.         
	The building has a long and well-documented history and once served as the residence of Calcuttas bishop. It is one of the few extant examples of colonial architecture of the 18th century in Calcutta.        
	The original house was constructed by Major Mark Wood in 1763 on 12 bighas, the first construction on the street, according to Schalchs map.        
	Civic servant Pattle leased it to the Company as the Episcopal Residence at a monthly rent of Rs 600. Bishop Heber, the second bishop of Calcutta, officially took up residence at 5 Russell Street in October 1825.        
	Till the consecration of the new cathedral named after St Paul, No. 5 was home to five bishops. It served as a boarding house for the young men of the Company after the death of Bishop Wilson. In 1916, the property was conveyed to the YMCA.        
	In May 2002, Calcutta High Court admitted a case filed by the Destiny of Calcutta Anglo Indian Association asking for permission to renovate and reconstruct it at its own expense, as the national council of the YMCA in New Delhi, believed to be the owner of the building, was allegedly not responding to pleas to repair the structure. The high court was told that two plaques recording the history of the building had been removed and that they were lying at Shakespeare Sarani police station. They still are.        
	In 1997, a West Bengal government expert committee met under the chairmanship of Barun De to identify heritage buildings in the city. The next year the list was submitted to the government, which forwarded it to the CMC, which subsequently included both the gate and the building on the heritage list.        
	Land sharks had their eye on this piece of prime property and its arched portal was demolished on the night of August 25-26, 2001, as it provided evidence of the buildings antiquity.        
	It is alleged in the Intach petition to Calcutta High Court and in earlier media reports that promoter Om Prakash Rajgariah was behind the demolition. Going by a copy of the agreement for sale available with Metro, on January 12, 1990, the National Council of YMCA had entered into a deal with Rajgariah to sell 5 Russell Street for Rs 1 crore 10 lakh.        
	A long tussle ensued to rebuild this gateway the way it should be. And although two architects empanelled with the CMC had a go at it, the gate still lies unfinished.        
	G.M. Kapur, the state convener of Intach, says after he read a newspaper report that the building had been delisted he wrote to the CMC seeking an explanation on what prompted it to do a volte-face. The PIL was filed after Kapur received no reply. CMC heritage committee authorities declined comment. The last hearing of the PIL was on April 9.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Eye on Messi and Maidan   Cup balm for left-back
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Eye on Messi and Maidan   Cup balm for left-back
  - Cup balm for first-division player felled by spine injury          RITH BASU                            JOY TO WATCH: Prabir Belel at his Hooghly home on Sunday (Sudip Koley) ; Lionel Messi (below)                                      
	For Prabir Belel, joy means watching Lionel Messi in action and trying to replicate some of his magic moves on the Maidan. This World Cup, Messi is just a TV screen away but the Maidan is a field too far for the 21-year-old from Hooghly.        
	As I was watching Messi in the World Cup match (against Nigeria) on Saturday, I couldnt help wondering when I would be able to play again, said Prabir, a first-division player struck down by a spine injury that forced him to undergo surgery last month.        
	Prabir, a resident of Haripur in Hooghly, has been playing for Barisha Sporting Club in the IFAs first division league since 2007-08. He first experienced back pain in mid-2009 but continued playing with the injury until the pain got really unbearable this May.         
	The doctors verdict? Prabir must take a prolonged break to undergo surgery and rehabilitation before resuming his promising career.        
	 Young footballers have very strong abdominal muscles, which normally keep the spine straight during hard body contact and falls. But injuries can happen. In Prabirs case, a nerve was getting compressed by a disc when he walked or tried to run, said Vikash Kapoor, an expert in sports injuries at Medica Superspecialty Hospital, off the EM Bypass.        
	Kapoor and spine specialist Chinmoy Nath conducted a 90-minute surgery on May 25 to free Prabirs problem nerve from the disc.                          
	The Barisha left-back has since recovered enough to walk slowly but his mind is burdened with thoughts of how his farmer father Shankar would repay the Rs 50,000 loan that went into his treatment. In the first division league, we are given only gari bhara (travel allowance) and food after practice. I dont have any money to help my father, rued Prabir.        
	Anjan Banerjee, the coach of the Dukhiram Majumdar Coaching Scheme that unearthed Prabir as a potential Maidan star in 2003, said the spine injury was the unkindest cut in his wards struggle to make a mark.        
	Prabir has worked hard throughout his career and would surely have been picked up by a premier division team this year. He would get up at 4am, cycle to the railway station to catch a train to Howrah and reach the Maidan by 7am. I spotted a winner in him because of his enthusiasm and commitment, Banerjee added.        
	Apart from his coach, senior player Sasthi Duley, also from Hooghly, had been supportive of Prabir. I am grateful to him for taking me to Bhaichung Bhutias doctor (Kapoor), said the left-back.        
	Although it reminds him constantly of his injury-hit career, the World Cup is also a welcome distraction for Prabir. At least I have something to look forward to over the next four weeks, he smiled.        
	So how soon can Prabir expect to return to the field? I am told I have to wait at least nine months before my doctors take a call on when I can resume playing. I hope they give me good news, said the Barisha player.        
	For now, some more Messi magic and a Brazil victory would do just as well for the footballer fighting to be fit.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Snatcher bites police bait
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Snatcher bites police bait
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Plainclothesmen caught a serial snatcher early on Friday after he rode into a trap set up using an elderly woman wearing faux jewellery as bait.        
	We arrested Sheikh Mushtaq who was active in the Lake area, while he was zeroing in on what he thought was another helpless victim, said Supratim Sarkar, deputy commissioner, south.        
	The 40-year-old was caught redhanded and 13 gold chains, worth about Rs 3 lakh, were seized from his shanty near Fancy Market in Kidderpore.        
	Sarkar said the police had set up the 60-year-old woman, who was being covered by 20 plainclothesmen posing as morning-walkers. The team was led by Lake police station officer-in-charge P.S. Mukhopadhyay.        
	A lot of complaints have been lodged against snatchers in the area around Vivekananda Park. Many complainants spoke about a biker who would snatch chains from elderly women between 5.30am and 8am. Such specific information helped us select the decoy, Sarkar said.        
	On Saturday morning, as the woman  whose identity is being withheld  strolled down the sidewalk near Kamala Girls School bordering Vivekananda Park, a bike from the direction of Sarat Bose Road slowed down and then stopped close to her.        
	When the rider, Mushtaq, lunged forward in an attempt to snatch the womans chain  coloured in gold but made of a cheaper material  two cops grabbed him.        
	There was hardly any resistance from Mushtaq, who readily confessed, said Sarkar. The sleuths also came to know the two-wheeler he was riding had been stolen.        
	Mushtaq, from Darbhanga in Bihar, has been remanded in police custody. He had earlier worked as an automobile mechanic in Bowbazar before shifting to Mumbai, where he faced a jail term. He came back to Calcutta seven months ago.        
	The cops suspect Mushtaq was not part of any racket. When asked during interrogation why he had stored the stolen chains in his shanty, Mushtaq apparently said he had failed to find any safe person to sell them to.        
	He told us he had planned to carry out a couple of more snatchings before heading off for Darbhanga, where he intended to set up a business, said Sarkar.

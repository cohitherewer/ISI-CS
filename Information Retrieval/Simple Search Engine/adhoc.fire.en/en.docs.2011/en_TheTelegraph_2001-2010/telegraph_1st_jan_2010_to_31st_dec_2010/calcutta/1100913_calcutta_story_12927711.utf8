The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Burrabazar shop on fire
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Burrabazar shop on fire
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A fire broke out in a third-floor garments shop stacked with inflammable materials like clothes, cartons and papers on Sunday morning.        
	The shop is housed in a five-storeyed building in Burrabazars Noormal Lohia Lane, a stones throw from Nandram market where a blaze raged for 100 hours in January 2008.        
	No one was injured and the extent of damage could not be ascertained till late on Sunday.        
	A team from Burrabazar police station, around 150 metres from the spot, rushed to the spot, followed by firemen who came with 10 tenders.        
	A short-circuit in the meter box might have caused the fire. A forensic team will visit the store on Monday to find out the cause, said an officer.        
	The entrance is too small and the stairs are very narrow. There are no fire extinguishers in the building, he added.        
	The fire department has lodged an FIR against the owner of the store, Jaichandlal Vinod Kumar, and the buildings owners for poor maintenance and absence of fire-safety measures.        
	CESC has snapped power supply to the building, which houses several stores and godowns.        
	The police said the fire had also spread to a portion of the adjoining building, from where residents had to be evacuated.        
	I was in the kitchen when I got a burning smell and peeped out of the window to find thick black smoke coming out of the third floor of the adjacent building, said Gauri Bhojak.        
	Metro climbed up the narrow staircase to reach the fire-ravaged store later in the day and found it stacked with combustible materials. There was no firefighting device around and naked wires were hanging from the ceiling and the walls.        
	 Death in tank: Tapan Mondal, 35, died of suffocation when he and two others were cleaning a septic tank of a building under construction on Kapali Road in Kankinara, North 24-Parganas, on Sunday.        
	 Clash: Residents of Sarenga in Howrah clashed with trekker owners on Sunday after the death of a 14-year-old boy in a road accident. A police contingent was deployed to bring the situation under control.

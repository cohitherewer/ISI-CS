The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Govt-CMC drive to revamp Hooghly ghats
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Govt-CMC drive to revamp Hooghly ghats
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Deepti Naval during a film shoot at Kashi Mitra ghat, which will soon be beautified along with 13 other Hooghly ghats.                                  
	The Left Front government of the state has decided to work with the Trinamul Congress-run Calcutta Municipal Corporation to reconstruct and beautify 14 ghats on the Hooghly.        
	Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya has spoken to mayor Sovan Chatterjee on the project at a time Mamata Banerjees party is realising that there could hardly be any civic progress without the governments co-operation.        
	According to the plan, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, which functions under Bhattacharyas department, will develop nine ghats and the rest will be the civic bodys responsibility. I have spoken to the mayor and he has agreed to the proposal, Bhattacharya said at Writers Buildings on Tuesday. Well start work after finishing the ground-level arrangements, the mayor said.        
	The CMDA will develop Pramanik ghat, Annapurna ghat, Golabari ghat, Kashi Mitra ghat, Hara Chandra Mullick ghat, RC Goenka ghat, Ganpath Rai ghat, Mullick ghat and Haragobinda ghat.        
	The CMC will reconstruct and beautify Ahiritola ghat, Prasanna Kumar Tagore ghat, Adyasraddha ghat, Chhotelal ghat and Moti Sil ghat.        
	Bhattacharya, who did not give a timeline for the project, said his department had received Rs 14 crore from the National Ganga River Basin Authority for the project. The revamp plan includes making seating arrangements and setting up gardens and change rooms for bathers on the river bank.        
	Minister Bhattacharya said he had also asked the civic body to appoint a consultant for a solid waste management project in an attempt to reduce the Hooghly pollution. The project will be sent to the National Ganga River Basin Authority for approval. The Centre will bear 70 per cent of the cost and the state the rest, he said.        
	While announcing the joint action plan, the minister regretted Mamatas decision not to make the state government a party to the drive to develop the riverfront.         
	RITES, which is under Mamatas railway ministry, Calcutta Port Trust, which comes under the shipping ministry that has a Trinamul leader as a junior minister, and the CMC are part of the project.        
	...the state government could have been made a party as it always cooperates with the port trust, Bhattacharya said.        
	Mayor Chatterjee, however, has shown his intent to work with the government. Taking a leaf out of the mayors book, the Trinamul chairperson of Salt Lake municipality, Anita Mondal, has decided to call on Bhattacharya to discuss development projects in the township.

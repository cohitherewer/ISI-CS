	Police on Friday issued a series of orders for Holi revellers with a special focus on people living in highrise buildings and housing estates.        
	The officers-in-charge of all 48 police stations have been asked to visit the housing estates and highrise buildings and warn the residents against throwing colours from the terrace or balcony on pedestrians.        
	Action will be taken under the Calcutta Police Act against anyone found forcibly smearing others with colours, said an officer at Lalbazar.        
	Our men will patrol the city on Saturday and Sunday. Heavy Radio Flying Squads, too, will be kept ready. Police teams, including women cops, will be posted at Hooghly ghats to ensure there is no trouble during the post-Holi bath, the officer added.        
	The cops have also prohibited the use of microphones during Holi celebrations. As it is, the use of mircrophones and loudspeakers is now banned because of Madhyamik, said an officer at Tollygunge police station.         
	Cops in plainclothes will be on the road to keep an eye on drunken revellers.        
	This year, cops have also banned the sale of abir and other colours on thoroughfares in an attempt to minimise chances of trouble.        
	nBlockade: Eastern Railway employees blocked Strand Road for around 20 minutes on Friday, demanding immediate steps to fix an electric wire that was hanging from a railway building at Fairlie Place. The blockade was lifted after cops intervened.        
	nMishap: A 42-year-old man was critically injured after being hit by a taxi on SP Mukherjee Road on Thursday night. Arabindo Majumdar, 42, a resident of Thakurpukur, was taken to MR Bangur Hospital. The taxi driver fled.         
	nProtest: Trinamul Congress workers demonstrated in front Bidhannagar Municipality on Friday afternoon, protesting the civic bodys apathy in tackling mosquito-borne diseases which they claimed were on the rise.         
	Trinamul leader Anupam Dutta said the fogging, which the municipality started on Thursday evening, was an eyewash.

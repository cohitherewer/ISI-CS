	A 62-year-old man was seriously injured when three unidentified youths on a motorcycle shot at him from a close range in Behala on Monday.        
	Indubhushan Mitra was at his office-cum-residence on Satyajit Ray Sarani in Parnasree around 12.45pm when the trio came on a bike and shot him in his right leg.        
	We suspect the trio had come to collect money from Indubhushans nephew. Failing to find the nephew, they shot at Indubhushan, said a senior officer of Behala police station.        
	The Mitras are in the cable service distribution business, looked after by Indubhushans nephews  Anshuman alias Mona and Arup. On Monday, three persons, in their early 20s, came on a bike and asked after Arup and Mona. On learning they were not at the office they started abusing Indubhushan, said Ajit Mitra, Indubhushans elder brother.        
	When Indubhushan shouted at them, one of the youths fired at him and it hit the wooden table beside which he was seated. He raised alarm but by then the youth had fired a second round that hit him just above his right knee. After this the trio sped away, Ajit added. Local people gave a chase but the trio managed to escape.        
	Indubhushan was first taken to Vidyasagar State General Hospital. Later he was shifted to CMRI hospital where his condition is stated to be stable.        
	Arup and Anshuman are Trinamul workers and Indubhushan was also our supporter. But we dont think there could be any political rivalry behind the shooting, said Anjan Das, a former Trinamul councillor of the area.        
	Later in the day, mayor Sovan Chatterjee visited Indubhushan at CMRI Hospital and blamed lax policing for the shooting.

                      More than childs play                    Theatre is a source of joy and inspiration to people of all ages. The need to support childrens theatre is felt most now as the cultural space for childrens activities appears to be shrinking rapidly. Children not only enjoy participating actively in dramas but learn a great deal from watching performances as well. Being universal in appeal, such theatre also reaches out to the child in all of us. It provides us the secure space we need to come in touch with the innocent side of our nature, transcending the barriers created by the adult world. Trained under the guidance of theatre personality Rama Prasad Banik, the students of the drama section of Nehru Childrens Museum are presenting the ongoing 7th drama festival, a five-day event that promises to edify and entertain, besides highlighting various topical issues of social relevance. To be staged today is one of the groups most popular productions, Jadiyo Sandhya (a scene from the play appears here). Based on the theme of the importance of hope amidst failure and adversity, it has the power to motivate youngsters and grown-ups alike. Drama and direction: Rama Prasad Banik.                  Event: Play in Bengali Jadiyo Sandhya, as part of 7th Drama Festival of Nehru Childrens Museum When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts

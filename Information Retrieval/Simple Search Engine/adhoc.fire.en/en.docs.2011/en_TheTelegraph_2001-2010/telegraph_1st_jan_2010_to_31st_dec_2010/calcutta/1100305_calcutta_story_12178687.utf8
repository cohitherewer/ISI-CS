          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An 80-year-old woman, apparently dumped by family members, was found alone on a road in Liluah on Wednesday night.        
	Lakshmi Mandal, a resident of Singti in Udaynarayanpur, was handed over to police on Thursday.        
	The police said the woman might have lost her mental balance. Once she said her daughter had left her alone on the road. Then she changed her version and said that it was her daughter-in-law who had dumped her.        
	Lakshmi told Liluah residents that her daughter had dumped her on the pretext of taking her to Howrah Maidan for shopping.        
	Sharmistha Das, a resident, said: I saw her sitting near our house on C Road around 10pm. Sharmistha served the woman dinner and allowed her to spend the night on the verandah of her house. She was looking tired but never once did she beg money or food.

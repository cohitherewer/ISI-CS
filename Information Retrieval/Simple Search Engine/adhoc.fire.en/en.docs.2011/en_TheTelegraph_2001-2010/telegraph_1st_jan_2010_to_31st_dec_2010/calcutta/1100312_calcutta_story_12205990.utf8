                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Headmaster denied bail
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The anticipatory bail plea of the headmaster of a school near Barasat, accused of submitting fake academic certificates, was turned down by a North 24-Parganas court on Thursday. Hemanta Kumar Chakraborty, 63, allegedly applied for the post of headmaster at Rabindra Vidyapeeth in Guma using forged documents.        
	According to sources in the school, Chakraborty had said that he was a doctorate in arts-philosophy from Visva-Bharati in Santiniketan and had furnished the relevant documents. He was appointed headmaster in August 2002.         
	Parimal Pal, the secretary of the managing committee of the school, said Chakraborty was due to retire in 2012 and had submitted his documents to the school last year to start the proceedings for releasing his pension and other post-retirement dues.         
	I sent the documents to the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and Visva-Bharati and was stunned when they wrote back saying that the certificates were fake, he said.        
	The school lodged a complaint against Chakraborty with Ashoknagar police station on December 22. The committee members alleged that the police didnt take up the investigation properly, and moved court. After a directive from the court, the cops lodged cases under IPC sections 420 and 423 (cheating and forgery) against Chakraborty.         
	Chakraborty went into hiding soon after. On Thursday, when the matter came up for hearing, Chakrabortys counsel Aslamun Jaman pleaded that his client be granted anticipatory bail till the police investigation was over.         
	Teachers are the backbone of a nation; the headmaster is accused of a grave mischief, the judge observed before throwing out the plea.        
	Exam transport: CTC will run special trams and buses for HS examinees and their guardians on all exam dates starting March 17. The bus routes include Joka-Patuli, Garia station-Howrah station, Tollygunge-Nicco Park, Howrah station-Munsirhat and Rajabazar-Ghatakpukur. The tram routes include Belgachhia-Esplanade, Shyambazar-Esplanade, Gariahat depot-Esplanade, Gariahat-Howrah Bridge, Behala-Joka and Galiff Street-Esplanade.         
	Couple held: The daughter and son-in-law of Namita Biswas, who was found dead in her Baguiati home on Tuesday, were arrested in Park Circus on Wednesday for allegedly killing Biswas. Police said Rinku and Pronab Das were nabbed after Biswass brother lodged a complaint accusing Rinku of killing her mother. An officer said the couple had confessed to the crime.         
	Homemaker dead: Swapna Jaiswal, 32, who was admitted to a hospital in Kanchrapara on Monday with burns, died on Thursday. Her family members went to Bijpur police station to lodge a complaint of torture against her in-laws, but were allegedly refused by the cops.         
	The family and some local residents then blocked the road in front of Swapnas in-laws house and allegedly pelted a police jeep with stones. The cops resorted to a lathicharge to disperse the mob and detained six persons.

                Four Iranians, including two minors, were arrested at the city airport on Wednesday on the charge of travelling with forged passports. A. Mehboob, her six-year-old son A. Marin and 15-year-old daughter Mariam, and another companion identified as Masood Sulemani flew to Bangkok from Mumbai on April 9 on their way to Sweden with forged Lithuanian passports. Officials at Bangkok airport detected the forgery and sent the group to Calcutta on April 11. The Iranians had arrived in Goa and contacted an agent for asylum in Europe. The forged Lithuanian passports were provided by the agent.    Rocky Hela, a Class VII student of EC School in Salt Lake, was electrocuted while trying to pluck mangoes from a tree near Tank 2 on Wednesday. The 12-year-old boy suffered 52 per cent burns after he grabbed a high-tension cable to break his fall while climbing down, said doctors at Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment. Police said the transformer connected to the cable developed a snag under the impact of the mishap, triggering a 30-minute power cut in the area. Hela lives at the Postal and Telegraph quarters in CC Block, the cops added.     Passengers of the Howrah-bound Rajdhani Express complained on Wednesday about the food served on the train. The passengers said the food was stale and inadequate. There were cockroaches on food trays. The catering staff refused to look into our complaints, said a passenger. After the train reached Howrah, deputy commercial manager and the station manager visited the pantry and collected food samples and the trays.    Eastern Railway will open an additional computerised passenger reservation counter each at Gariahat and Dakshinapan complex in Dhakuria on Thursday morning. Officials said railway minister Mamata Banerjee had asked the authorities to increase the number of reservation counters.    A fire broke out on the ground floor of the MLA hostel on Kyd Street on Wednesday evening. The guard of the building noticed smoke coming out of some electrical wires and informed the fire brigade. One fire tender was pressed into service to douse the fire. A probe suggested that a short-circuit led to the fire, said an official.    Rabi Das, 26, was beaten up by youths at Indranagar in Sodepur for allegedly trying to steal a bicycle on Wednesday afternoon. Police said the youths tied Das to a lamp post and kicked and punched him. The police rescued him and took him to Panihati State General Hospital.

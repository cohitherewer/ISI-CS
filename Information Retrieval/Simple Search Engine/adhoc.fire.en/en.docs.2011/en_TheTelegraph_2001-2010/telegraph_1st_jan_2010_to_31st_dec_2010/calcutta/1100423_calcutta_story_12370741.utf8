The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Screens to prevent track death
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Screens to prevent track death

	An energy-saving glass wall encasing the platforms of East-West Metro stations will rule out suicide on the tracks, a frequent headache of the authorities of the citys north-south Metro.        
	We have thought about erecting glass screens on the edge of the platforms as an energy-saving measure since the stations will be air-conditioned. But as you have pointed out, the screens will also eliminate chances of suicide and that will be an added advantage, said Ajay Singh, a transportation expert and consultant to the East-West Metro.        
	The walls will have gates with which the doors of the trains will be aligned. The gates will be opened and shut simultaneously with the train doors.        
	Around 100 people ended their lives by jumping on the tracks of the existing Metro since 1988.         
	The lives would not have been lost had the platforms been encased in screens similar to that of East-West Metro.        
	Singh said the east-west link, scheduled to be operational in 2013, will be better than Delhi Metro.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City trapped in dark swelter
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City trapped in dark swelter
          OUR BUREAU                          A Salt Lake thoroughfare, leading to Central Park, visible only by the headlights and tail lights of vehicles on Thursday evening. (Pabitra Das)                                   
	Sailen Manna is a beaten man today. What marauders in boots could not do to the barefoot defender on alien soil six decades ago, the darkness at home has managed to do.        
	This is the worst I have seen in years, the 86-year-old football hero told Metro from his FD Block home in Salt Lake, by the light of a hand-held emergency lamp on a sweltering Thursday evening.        
	We are suffering power cuts at least four times a day in this terrible heat. I never thought I would have to suffer like this, said the former Mohun Bagan and India great.         
	There was no respite in sight from the heat or the power cuts for the fourth consecutive day as the minimum temperature stayed four degrees above normal at 27.7 degrees Celsius and the peak demand power shortage stood at 810MW  210 in the CESC-served areas and 600MW in the state utility-serviced zones.        
	What that meant was power cuts ranging up to eight hours in Salt Lake and up to three hours in most parts of the city.        
	Coming home after work seems like entering a world of darkness. This is not load-shedding but a total supply failure. The local shops have even run out of candles, grumbled Kumar Shankar Sadhu, the secretary of the Bidhannagar (Salt Lake) Welfare Association.        
	Last year, the state electricity board had asked us to declare our actual consumption and deposit extra security. To my knowledge most residents have done that. And this is the service we get in return, added the resident of Salt Lakes GD Block.        
	The city was better off, but try telling that to HS examinee Payel Sen of Tollygunge. What happened to the grand promises of there being no power cuts till the exams were over? How can we be expected to study for the most crucial exams of our lives in this darkness and heat? demanded the teenager.                  
	A CESC spokesperson confirmed that the situation has remained practically unchanged for four days now and the weathermans forecast too would do nothing to cheer up HS examinees.        
	There will be no relief over the next couple of days. In fact, there could be a rise in temperatures. Norwesters arent expected this week, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore. There is little chance of improvement as long as the heat-wave conditions prevail over the neighbouring districts of south Bengal, he added.        
	The India Meteorological Department (IMD) declared March 2010 as one of the hottest in its recorded meteorological history. The analysis of monthly temperatures shows that this March was the warmest, breaking previous records at many places in the country, said an IMD statement uploaded on its website on Thursday.        
	According to the IMD, the maximum and minimum temperatures could remain above normal by two to four degrees Celsius over south Bengal for a week.         
	The probability of April remaining warmer than normal over Bengal is also very high, although departures will not be as high as in March, said an IMD official.

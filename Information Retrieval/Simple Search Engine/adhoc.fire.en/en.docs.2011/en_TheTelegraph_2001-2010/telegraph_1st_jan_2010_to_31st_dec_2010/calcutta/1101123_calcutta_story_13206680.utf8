          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Seven dacoits looted at gunpoint Rs 2.7 lakh from a petrol pump barely 500m from Howrah police station late on Sunday. The gang exploded two bombs before walking away.        
	Kamal Deb Roy, 45, and Nandu Roy, 40, were on duty at Kanak Service Centre on Church Road when three men barged in around 1.30am, said police.        
	They pointed guns at Kamal and demanded the key to the iron chest in the room. When Nandu tried to rush to Kamals aid, the four other dacoits entered the office and hit him on the head from behind.        
	Nandu, who hails from Jharkhand, said: There were seven dacoits, all in their late-20s. Six of them were in jeans and T-shirt. At least three were carrying revolvers.         
	The gang probably came from the direction of Howrah Girls College. I saw the men walk towards Bangalbabur bridge after the dacoity, said Kamal.        
	Akhilesh Chaturbedi, additional superintendent (rural), Howrah, said: We are trying to find out whether the dacoits are from the area.

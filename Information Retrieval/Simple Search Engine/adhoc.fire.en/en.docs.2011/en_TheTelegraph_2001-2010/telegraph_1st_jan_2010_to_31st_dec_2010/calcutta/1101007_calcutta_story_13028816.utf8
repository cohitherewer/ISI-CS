                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rain alert for 72 hours

	Brace yourself for the sting in the tail of the monsoon.        
	The Met office has warned of heavy rain in the city and south Bengal over the next two to three days, dampening Puja shopping plans and prompting the state government to sound an alert in the coastal districts.        
	The Met office has informed us that there may be heavy rainfall accompanied by storms till October 10, disaster management minister Mortaza Hossain confirmed on Wednesday.        
	The trigger for the rain is a low-pressure area that formed a couple of days ago over west-central Bay of Bengal along with an upper air cyclonic circulation off the Andhra Pradesh coast.        
	The two formations have resulted in the incursion of a lot of moisture into the atmosphere over south Bengal. The thunderclouds should bring consistent, occasionally heavy thundershowers over the next two to three days in the region. Thunderstorms are also a possibility, an official of the India Meteorological Department said from New Delhi.        
	Smart showers over the last couple of days have dragged down the Celsius, but the comfortable weather has been marred by fears of a Puja washout in the last lap of a monsoon that has been weak for the most part.         
	September has been the rainiest month of the year, partly compensating for the heavy deficit of July and August.

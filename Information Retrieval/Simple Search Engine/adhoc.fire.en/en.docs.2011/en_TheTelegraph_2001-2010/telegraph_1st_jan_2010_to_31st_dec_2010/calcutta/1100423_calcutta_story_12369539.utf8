The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hail, the empowered hawker
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hail, the empowered hawker
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          Business as usual on hawker-filled Canning Street on Thursday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	If you want to become an empowered citizen of Calcutta, become a hawker.        
	The draft of the West Bengal Urban Street Vendor Policy framed by the municipal affairs department  a copy of which is available with Metro  makes it clear that the government is out to turn street vendors into the citys most privileged trading class.        
	Metro decodes the clauses in the policy that blatantly seek to empower the 3.25-lakh strong, and growing, hawker army at the cost of reducing you to a second-class citizen.              
	Intent: To give street vendors a legal status with formulation of an appropriate law and thereby providing for specific and pre-determined legitimate vending/hawking zones.        
	Implication: Introduction of a licence raj to replace the existing practice of hawkers paying police, politicians and civic officials to grab your space on the pavement.        
	Intent: To provide civic facilities to the vendors in the identified spaces for vending.        
	Implication: Rent-free commercial space and civic facilities for hawkers, including toilets, drinking water supply, waste management, lighting and parking space. While all of these services will be officially free for the hawker (except a nominal annual registration fee), owners of legitimate, trade licence-holding shops in the same area have to pay tax and other charges to the government for the same facilities.         
	Intent: To promote, where necessary, the organisation of street vendors, i.e. unions/co-operatives/associations and other forms of organisations to facilitate their collective empowerment.At the time of earmarking of space, reservation for Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, minority and physically challenged should be in accordance with their share of the population.        
	Implication: Politicisation of the entire process of identifying legitimate vendors, issuing identity cards and granting space on pavements. Unions affiliated to the ruling party will rule the roost.        
	Intent: The existing street vendors may be identified either through photographic, digitised surveys/census of street vendors and their locations or by inviting applications.The applicant shall submit proof of use of space for a period of more than 10 years, if applicable, duly certified by competent authority.        
	Implication: Party, union or local authorities to decide who gets identity card and who doesnt. No hawker can provide legitimate proof of having done business from a particular space for over 10 years simply because he doesnt have a trade licence or tax papers or power bills.        
	Intent: Street vendors who are meeting conditions stated in the policy shall be registered and issued identity cards.The identity card should contain vendor code no; date of issue; name, address and photograph; name of any one nominee from the family; nature of business; name of business; category (stationary, mobile, peripatetic); and if stationary, the vending location.        
	Implication: The inclusion of the name of a nominee in the proposed ID card leaves scope for illegal resale of space.         
	Intent: Street vendors shall not have the right to either rent out or lease out, or sell the spot earmarked for him. Special condition: Any deviation will require special permission from competent authority in urban local body.        
	Implication: Civic body officials to decide which is a special case and which isnt, leading to more corruption. Just as stalls in civic markets are illegally sold and legalised later, a hawker can treat a piece of the pavement as his personal asset and sell it by bribing officials to declare it as a special case.        
	Intent: Urban local authorities to allocate sufficient space for temporary vendors markets (weekly haats, night bazaars, festival bazaars, street food marts etc) whose use at other times may be different (public park, exhibition ground, parking lot etc).        
	Implication: Your childs favourite park or the parking lot near your preferred Sunday haunt could soon turn into a weekly haat.You cant lodge a complaint either if a night bazaar in your neighbourhood disturbs your sleep.        
	Intent: Mobile vending in all areas, even outside the vendors markets, unless designated as no-vending zone.        
	Implication: Vendors on wheels get access to almost any area, reducing the exercise of regulating hawkers to a sham. A vendor with a cart and a card can openly do business on a thoroughfare, adding to the traffic congestion.

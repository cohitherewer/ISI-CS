The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Return with rider to 2 blocks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Return with rider to 2 blocks
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          The police chief at Stephen Court on Monday        
	The residents of the two unscathed blocks of Stephen Court, homeless for a week, will be allowed to return to their apartments if they fulfil certain conditions.        
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, who visited the Park Street landmark on Monday afternoon, said the residents of blocks III and IV had been called to a meeting at the office of the deputy commissioner (south) on Tuesday morning.        
	Representatives of CESC, fire services department and the civic body will also attend the meeting.        
	The police chief said the residents would be handed over two sets of guidelines. The short-term conditions, which include steps to fix unsafe electricity connections, will have to be fulfilled before the residents are allowed to move in. The long-term guidelines can be complied with in three months.        
	The decision to allow the residents of the third and fourth blocks to move in was taken at a meeting Chakrabarti held with officials of the civic body, fire and power departments and CESC at Stephen Court.        
	The residents of the first and second blocks cannot return now as their apartments are in a dangerous condition, said Chakrabarti.        
	The announcement brought a smile to the faces of the residents of the third and fourth blocks but sparked resentment among those who live in the other two blocks, which bore the brunt of the blaze.        
	Each and every resident of blocks I and II has visited his/her flat. Most of the apartments did not suffer any major damage. We can easily repair the affected parts and start living there but the authorities are ignoring our plea, said Nitesh Agarwal, a resident of a fifth-floor apartment in Block I. We have moved court.... Our fate hinges on what the court will decide.        
	Narendra Sahani, a resident of Block III, said: We will surely attend Tuesdays meeting and try to follow the guidelines.        
	A fire department official said the owners of the ground-floor shops have also been asked to attend Tuesdays meeting, where they will be urged to put in place proper safety measures before they reopen their establishments.

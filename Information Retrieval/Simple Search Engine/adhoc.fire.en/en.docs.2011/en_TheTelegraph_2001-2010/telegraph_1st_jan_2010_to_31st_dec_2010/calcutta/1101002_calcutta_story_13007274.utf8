The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stephen accused surrenders
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stephen accused surrenders
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A key accused in the Stephen Court blaze case, Pradeep More, surrendered at Bankshall court on Friday, following the rejection of his anticipatory bail plea the day before.        
	More, in his 60s, is a director of Stephen Court Limited which is responsible for the upkeep of the Park Street landmark.        
	He has been booked under IPC Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and a string of other charges.        
	The other two directors of the company  Sanjay Bagaria and Sushil Sureka  are already behind bars.        
	Police said More, who had been absconding since the March 23 blaze that killed 43 people, had signed all documents related to the collection of maintenance fees from the Stephen Court occupants.        
	This suggests More was fully aware of his responsibilities. Yet, he did not bother to turn up when the building caught fire, said an officer of the detective department.        
	More has been remanded in police custody for 12 days.        
	Bagaria was picked up from a guesthouse in Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh on August 24 and Sureka surrendered in court on September 17.

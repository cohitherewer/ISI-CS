                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Probe team blames fridge for Presi fire
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The fire services department has held a refrigerator at a Presidency University chemistry laboratory responsible for the October 29 fire.        
	Fire services director-general Jogesh Chatterjee has submitted a preliminary probe report, which says the refrigerator is the primary suspect though other causes cannot be ruled out.        
	I received the report on Wednesday. It says the fire was caused by the refrigerator, which was in a laboratory. However, forensic experts will submit their report within a week. The actual cause of the fire will be known from that report, fire minister Pratim Chatterjee said at Writers Buildings on Thursday.        
	Asked about the preparedness of educational institutions to tackle a fire, the minister said he had spoken to higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri about safety measures that could be taken.        
	Director-general Chatterjee and additional director-general Debapriya Biswas met the education minister on Wednesday to discuss the possible steps.        
	It was decided that the institutions would be asked to submit reports on their present arrangements. After that fire department teams will visit the institutions and suggest steps to be taken.        
	The government will bear the expenses for the safety upgrade at its institutions but the private ones will have to make their own provisions, the fire minister said.         
	The fire department, he added, may ask every institution to set up a control room to alert the agencies concerned and local people during an emergency.        
	The director of the forensic science laboratory, Dhurjati Sengupta, is conducting a parallel probe into the blaze.        
	nWriters alert: The fire minister said the electrical wiring at Writers had been overhauled spending around Rs 30 lakh. I have asked the PWD to set up a control room. Its impossible for a few employees of my department and some cops to keep watch on the huge premises, especially at night. Any day you may see the Writers has been turned to ashes. I have told the chief minister about my apprehension, he added.

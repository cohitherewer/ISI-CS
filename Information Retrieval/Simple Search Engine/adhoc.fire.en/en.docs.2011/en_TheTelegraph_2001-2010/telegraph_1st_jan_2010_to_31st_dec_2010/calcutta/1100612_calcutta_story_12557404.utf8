The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Showpiece township in no-mans land
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Showpiece township in no-mans land
                                          
	The first two hours following techie P. Rajshekhars fatal fall from an 11th-floor New Town apartment on Thursday evening proved how residents of the so-called showpiece township have been stranded in no-mans land.         
	Neighbours of Rajshekhar at Greenfield Heights, where the engineer from Hyderabad used to share an apartment with four colleagues, said they had to wait one-and-a-half hours for a team from the local police station  located at least 20km away  to arrive and remove the body.        
	New Town police station is nearby but the complex in Action Area I is under the jurisdiction of Calcutta Leather Complex police station at Bantala, off the EM Bypass. Can anything be more ridiculous than having a police station in the vicinity and yet being forced to dial one that is 20km away? asked a resident.        
	The police are treating Rajshekhars death as suicide based on circumstantial evidence and a statement by his father, who admitted that his son would get depressed staying away from home.        
	At Greenfield Heights and the nearby complexes, the question on everyones lips was whether Rajshekhar would have received timely treatment had he been only injured. The nearest private hospital is at least 10km away and the government one is even farther.         
	Metro measures the extra miles a New Town resident needs to walk for even the basic necessities of life.

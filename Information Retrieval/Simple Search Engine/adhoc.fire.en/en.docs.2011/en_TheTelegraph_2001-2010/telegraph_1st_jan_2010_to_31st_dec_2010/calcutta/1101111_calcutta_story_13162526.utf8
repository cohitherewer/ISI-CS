The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 2 held for multi-crore fraud
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      2 held for multi-crore fraud
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two men who had allegedly swindled over Rs 2 crore each out of an airline and thousands of poor Calcuttans were arrested on Tuesday and Wednesday.        
	Mukesh Kishanpuria, a 42-year-old textile trader, used to buy air tickets on the Net providing details of credit cards belonging to his relatives and then cancel each twice  at a counter and online simultaneously  so that he was refunded the amount he had paid twice, according to police.        
	Jet Airways had lodged a complaint stating that it had refunded twice the price of 163 tickets that were brought at different times and then cancelled, said an officer of the cyber crime wing of the detective department.         
	When an air ticket bought online is cancelled, its price is credited to the buyers account. The records take a couple of minutes to be updated online.         
	Kishanpuria had managed to cancel one air ticket twice several times, taking advantage of the lag in the update of records, said joint police commissioner (crime) Damayanti Sen.        
	The airline claimed the double cancellations allegedly perpetrated by Kishanpuria had cost it Rs 2.9 crore.         
	The traders name had cropped up in the cancellation records and he had been declared a proclaimed offender. He was arrested in Bankshall Court, where he had gone to surrender on Wednesday. His passport had been impounded earlier, said a cop.        
	Kishanpurias properties on Indra Biswas Road, British India Street and Balmukund Makkar Road have been attached.         
	Joydeep Nag, 33, was arrested in Pune on Tuesday night for allegedly defrauding thousands of people in the Sealdah area to the tune of Rs 2.5 crore.         
	Nag, who worked as a security guard in Pune, ran a daily deposit scheme in Calcutta from there. The Sealdah residents had deposited money in the scheme. They lodged a complaint when Nag could not be traced.         
	The bigger the amount deposited, the higher the interest rate Nag had promised. This lured people to take loans from banks and invest in the scheme, said an officer of Entally police station.

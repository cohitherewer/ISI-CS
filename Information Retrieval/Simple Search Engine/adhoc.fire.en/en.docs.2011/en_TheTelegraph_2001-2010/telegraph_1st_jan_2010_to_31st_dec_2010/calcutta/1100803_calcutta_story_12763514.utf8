                      Colours of the season                    The first drops of rain always bring a smile on our faces. The smell of wet soil, the damp grass and the slosh of puddles under our feet fill our hearts with inexplicable happiness. Rains also inspire romance and, thus, have been traditionally associated with music, poetry and art. Monsoon Moods, the ongoing art exhibition, celebrates the onset of the season with a collection of small, affordable artwork by eminent artists of the city. Dhiren Sasmal explores the medium of acrylic with pastel on board. His cheerful and vibrant works reflect the joy of childhood and nature. Subrata Ghosh has perfected his unique style of layering his canvasses with jewel-toned hues. He then paints faces of women, deities or heads of the Buddha using various shades of white. The colours of the rainbow emerge from his canvas, giving an ethereal aura to his very serene studies. Madhuwanti Banerjees colourful heads of village women are an expression of the myriad hues of rural India. The show also features haunting faces and landscapes by Gautam Sarkar in his signature realistic style, and a large collection of patachitras, both in the Kalighat style and old pieces from Midnapore chitrakars.

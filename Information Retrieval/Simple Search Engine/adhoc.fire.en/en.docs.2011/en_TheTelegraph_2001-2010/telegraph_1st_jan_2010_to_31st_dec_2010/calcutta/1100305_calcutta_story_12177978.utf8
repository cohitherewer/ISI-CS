	SUKUMAR GHOSH,
  Baisali Park									      
	Every cricketer dreams of playing at Eden Gardens. The stadium is at present under renovation but Id like to see it in a new avatar but with its traditional feel intact. Changes are inevitable in the sitting arrangement. Comfortable fibre glass chairs should be used. There should be enough leg space between the rows. All blocks must be covered to protect spectators from the sun and the dew. The drainage system should be improved to eliminate water-logging. Escalators can be installed for the aged.                 KSHAMA AGARWAL, 
  Girish Park        
	I want proper issuance of tickets and allotment of seats and a larger LCD screen.                 ARNAB MANDAL, 
  Garia        
	I think the facilities at Eden Gardens is on a par with international standards already. So, it will be difficult to improve on perfection. The only drawback is lack of international matches. A venue noted the world over for its huge spectator capacity has been neglected by the BCCI.                 SALIL KUMAR KAR, 
  Kedarnath Das Lane        
	The main problems faced by viewers are the scarcity of drinking water, lack of proper eateries and toilets. In view of the increasing number of women frequenting the games, there should be separate seating arrangements for them.                SWATI MASKARA, 
  Uttarpara        
	The much-awaited renovation of Eden Gardens has finally started. To keep eve-teasers and toughs at bay, guards should be posted at key points. The seats should be made more durable and comfortable. Instead of rows of concrete, individual chairs should be arranged. The number of toilets should be increased, keeping in mind the stadiums capacity. They should be clean.                 INDRA KUMAR SAGGI, 
  Address not mentioned        
	I hope the toilets are renovated and more are built for both men and women. Also, the food supplied by various caterers should be hot and the food court area pollution-free.                INDRANIL SANYAL, 
  Address not mentioned        
	A renovated Eden Gardens must provide essential amenities like sufficient drinking water so that visitors dont have to buy packaged water. Proper illumination of the stairs is of utmost importance. Very often during day/night games, the elderly find it difficult to climb the stairs because of the absence of proper lights. More seats should be covered with fibre glass sheds to protect from the rain. Transport facilities at night should be looked into as visitors may find it difficult to go home after the matches.                 PIYUSH TAMAKHUWALA,
  Address not mentioned        
	Eden Gardens requires a giant television screen, like in Adelaide, Australia. The seats should more comfortable and the authorities should get nets like those in Bangalore so that plastics bottles can be allowed in.                P.B. SAHA,
  Salt Lake        
	At a time when cricket matches can be comfortably seen sitting at home, Eden Gardens is packed to capacity to the delight of players. What is likely to draw more spectators to the ground is a stop to police excesses in the name of maintaining discipline in the stands.                A.S. MEHTA
  New Alipore        
	Renovated Eden Gardens must have adequate drinking water facilities, hygienic food stalls, proper toilets and more entry points to avoid the huge queues. Seats should have more leg space.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rail seeks plot
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rail seeks plot
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The railway ministry has written to the CIT asking for the Ultadanga plot where No. 4 Basanti Colony once stood. The slum was gutted in a blaze on January 12.        
	State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the letter proved that the plot did not belong to the railways, as claimed by minister Mamata Banerjee.        
	Government sources had refuted Mamatas claim, saying the 173-cottah plot was owned by the CIT which now functions under the CMDA.        
	In the late 1980s, the railway ministry had paid Rs 90 lakh for 43 cottahs. The part of the plot on which Basanti Colony came up belongs to the CIT, said Bhattacharya, who is also chairman of the CMDA.        
	The railway ministrys letter, sent on January 25, urges the CIT to hand over the land for better utilisation after freeing it of encroachments.        
	Bhattacharya, however, could not explain why the 43 cottahs were not transferred to the railways.

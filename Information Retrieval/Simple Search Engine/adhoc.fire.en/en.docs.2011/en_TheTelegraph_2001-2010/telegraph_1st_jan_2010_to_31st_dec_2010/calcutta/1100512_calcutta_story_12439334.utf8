                      Forms of feminism                    Passion goaded her creativity and expressed itself in her work which, for her, was worship. She exemplifies the Keatsian concept the poetry of the earth is never dead. The sheer lyricism of Meera Mukherjees sculptures are moving and awe-inspiring, to say the least. Men laying cables, masons beating the roof, labourers digging for a tubewell, people sleeping on the pavements have become eternal works of beauty. Her acute observation of the wide gamut of work done by women made her a true feminist. Images of women gathering waterlilies, stitching quilts, repairing fishing-nets, carrying water or threshing corn, have shown the unrecognised economic worth of their domestic labour in a way that reams of research papers could not. Though upset when a famous sculptor told her that her work looked repetitive and boring, she refused to be convinced. She felt that the boatman, the nulia could not be expressed in any other way than how she represented them. Weavers at their looms, the male labour passing the soil to his female mate had to be the very way she had conceptualised. Much later, she did some abstract calligraphy. But what is important in her works is that she believed firmly and steadfastly in all her creations. Being hosted to mark her birth anniversary, Memories of Meera acquaints us with the various facets of her creative personality. Featuring Reminisces of Meera Mukherjee, a talk by Maitreye Chatterjee and Adip Dutta; Meera Mukherjee  The Sculptor, a talk by Pranabranjan Ray; and Songs Meera Loved, a presentation by Kishore Chatterjee. Also, an exhibition of her works, which will continue till tomorrow from 2 pm - 7 pm.

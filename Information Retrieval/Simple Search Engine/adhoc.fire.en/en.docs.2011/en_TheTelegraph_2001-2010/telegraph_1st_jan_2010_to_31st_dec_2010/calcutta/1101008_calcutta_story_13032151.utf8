The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Old problems by new name 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Old problems by new name

	New Town was renamed Jyoti Basu Nagar on Thursday, a change that means little for residents who still have to do without basic civic services.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee conferred the new name  the state cabinet had approved the move last month  on the showpiece township, which was once touted by the Left Front to be the best in India, at a programme in Action Area I.         
	We needed this town. This will help reduce the pressure of population on Calcutta, which has over 70 lakh residents. This town will be home to about 15 lakh people eventually, said Bhattacharjee.        
	About 2 lakh people have shifted to the township over the past five years, according to Hidco, the state government agency in charge of developing the township.        
	We had moved to New Town expecting it to be a dream-come-true township. It has turned out to be a nightmare so far, said Swapan Ray, a 59-year-old RBI official.        
	Whether it is called New Town or Jyoti Basu Nagar or Karl Marx Nagar, our problems are unlikely to be over soon, he added.        
	The complaints range from poor roads to erratic power supply, lack of adequate transport options to unreliable water supply.        
	At the programme, Bhattacharjee, his cabinet colleague Gautam Deb, former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and Left Front chairman Biman Bose heaped praise on the township, overlooking the problems residents face everyday.        
	State Congress president Manas Bhuniya was the only one to point out a few flaws, although in a guarded manner.        
	We need a trauma care centre, an art gallery, a stadium with indoor and outdoor facilities. These are a few of the things needed, besides quality civic infrastructure, he said.        
	Bhuniya also spoke about the controversy surrounding land acquisition for New Town.

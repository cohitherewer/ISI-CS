The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Toxic turmeric invades kitchen
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Toxic turmeric invades kitchen
  - Big brands warn consumers about cheaper fakes flooding market          AMIT CHAKRABORTY AND SAIONEE CHAKRABORTY                       
	HOW TO SPOT A FAKE  Too yellow  Too dull  Leaves darker stains   
	 HOW TO GET AROUND IT  Go organic  Make your paste from turmeric cloves                                
	If your curry looks too pale or too bright, chances are you have been tricked into buying toxic turmeric.        
	The market is flooded with turmeric adulterated with artificial agents, representatives of four major spice brands warned on Friday.         
	A homemaker or a seasoned cook can easily make out the right colour and flavour of turmeric powder. If in doubt, they should confront the retailer and demand that he pull up the supplier, a spokesperson for the spice manufacturers said at a news conference.         
	The warning punches a hole in every homemakers belief that each tablespoon of branded yellow powder that she puts into her curry comes with the healing properties of turmeric.        
	 Buyers need to be aware and complain to the enforcement directorate if they find their turmeric adulterated, said the spokesperson.        
	Homemaker Krishna Banerjee, 59, complained about the turmeric powder she had bought recently becoming a cuddly mass when mixed with water. It neither tastes nor looks good, she told Metro.        
	The price of raw turmeric has hit the roof in the wholesale market  Rs 170 a kilo  raising the price of the powdered variety to Rs 250 a kilo. The trend is likely to continue at least till October, after which the prices are likely to ease, sources said.        
	Brands like Shalimar, Cookme, Data and Sunrise are pinning their hopes on a good monsoon and a rich turmeric harvest to bring prices down and push the cheaper fakes out of the shelves. Prolonged consumption of anything toxic is bound to harm your liver and digestive system, warned fitness expert Neeraj Surana.        
	 Good turmeric should be orangey yellow. Adulterated turmeric may even contain carcinogenic agents, pointed out Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta of Kewpies.        
	Nutritionist and t2 columnist Hena Nafis suggested another way to spot the fake. If the haldi leaves too much of a stain, it means its quality is suspect.        
	According to Dasgupta, the best way to beat the fake was to go grandmas way and crush turmeric cloves at home.

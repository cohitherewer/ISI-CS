The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CMC mulls cracking licence whip
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CMC mulls cracking licence whip
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The civic authorities are planning to stop issuing trade licences to those who run their businesses out of buildings declared unsafe.        
	The move is long overdue, said mayor Sovan Chatterjee. If a building is declared unsafe it means it can endanger lives. How can we issue licences to traders who have establishments in such buildings? I also think that such buildings should be immediately vacated.        
	The licence department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has already stopped collecting fees from New Market vendors who have their shops in condemned parts of the heritage building. It has also stopped renewal of licences of the traders who have rented space in the 48 buildings that are considered fire-prone.        
	It is the responsibility of the owners, occupants or tenants of a building to maintain it. Any neglect will only cost their lives and trade, said Dipankar Sinha, the civic architect and chief town planner.        
	There are over 3,000 buildings in the city recorded as structurally unsafe in civic documents. Of them, a little over 2,000 are in north and central Calcutta. A few buildings are in a poor state because of disputes among the co-owners.

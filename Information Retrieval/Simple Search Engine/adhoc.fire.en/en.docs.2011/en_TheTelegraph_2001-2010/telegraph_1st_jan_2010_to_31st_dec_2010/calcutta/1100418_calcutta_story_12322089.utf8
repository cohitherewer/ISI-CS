The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ignore sun at own peril
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Ignore sun at own peril

	At the root of the ongoing power crisis in the state is the lack of availability of good quality coal. The situation will only get worse and solar energy could be the saviour. But how prepared is Bengal to use it as a resource?         
	The states all talk-little action bug seems to have bitten its solar energy development plans.         
	In view of global warming and the increasing threat from emissions...we are planning to shift from coal-based thermal power to solar power, the chief minister had said at a recent meeting at the Falta Industrial Export Zone.         
	Pointing out that only five per cent of Bengals total energy consumption was met by non-conventional sources, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said: We will try to reap the maximum benefit from the Central Solar Mission.        
	State IT minister Debesh Das says that the government has plans for a 100acre solar industrial zone at Andal and a 200acre SEZ near Panagarh mainly for non-conventional energy industries with the Centres support. Alternate energy expert S.P. Gon Choudhury said the Centre is targeting production of 20,000 MW solar energy by 2022 and Bengal would try to contribute at least 1,500MW.        
	But other than eyeing central help, the Buddha government has done little to promote solar energy in a state where 56 per cent people still live without electricity.         
	This attitude was evident in the state budget too, at odds with the central solar mission or initiatives taken by other states. There is no tax exemption or VAT holiday on solar equipment and no subsidy on using solar power, rue green activists in Bengal.         
	West Bengal is grossly underutilising its solar resources, complains activist Subhash Dutta, who recently moved a PIL on the issue.        
	In Bengal 97 per cent of power is derived from thermal power projects, though there is tremendous potential for solar power. The state gets on an average of 250 clear sunshine days in a year a potential of 17,199MW, says Dutta.        
	He adds that the states building rules allow setting up solar projects on rooftops. But that hasnt helped. While 33,000 houses have rooftop solar panels in Bangalore, there are only 600 such houses in Calcutta.         
	Experts point out that though the Electricity Regulatory Act 2000 makes state electricity regulatory commissions responsible for promoting alternative energy by directing power companies to buy green power, no such steps were being taken in West Bengal.         
	Such orders have come out in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh but not in Bengal. Investors are shying away from Bengal as banks are not ready to fund such projects, says the owner of a solar energy business.

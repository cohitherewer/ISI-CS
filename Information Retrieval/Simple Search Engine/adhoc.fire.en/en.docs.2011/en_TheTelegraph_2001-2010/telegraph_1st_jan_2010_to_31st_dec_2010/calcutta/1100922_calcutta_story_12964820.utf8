          A STAFF REPORTER                          Ashish Pandey                                  
	A bus requisitioned by Calcutta police to ferry cops during President Pratibha Patils visit mowed down a teenager on Central Avenue on Tuesday afternoon.         
	Ashish Pandey, 18, was halfway down the road near Mutty Lal Seal College from the fire station end when the signal turned green and the bus driver stepped on the accelerator. Caught between the bus and another vehicle, the Class XI student of Tantia High School in Surti Bagan stopped in his tracks and was crushed under the rear wheels of the bus.         
	The bus driver fled even as a crowd gathered at the spot.         
	Ashish succumbed to his injuries at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. He was sari trader Dashrath Pandeys only child.        
	The police have started a case of culpable homicide caused by rash and negligent driving under Section 304A of the IPC. The bus (WB-04/0334) was requisitioned on Monday and the driver was asked to report to the 5th Battalion office of the Armed Police in Ultadanga on Tuesday. The bus was on its way to Ultadanga when the accident occurred, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters). The requisition now stands cancelled, he added.        
	Father Dashrath said Ashish had stepped out of his fourth-floor home at 3 Surti Bagan Lane, near Mohammed Ali Park, around 1.30pm to meet a classmate. He had told his mother that he would be back in 20 minutes. We received news of the accident half an hour later, he cried.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Union circus inside zoo
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Union circus inside zoo

	If you visit the zoo in the next few days, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi will be there at the gates to greet you.         
	Once inside, more surprise awaits! The zoo resembles a party office with flags, festoons, leaders cut-outs, placards and microphones in every nook and cranny.        
	Intuc (Indian National Trade Union Congress) has organised an agitation inside the zoo so that the 128 employees who are its supporters  of the total staff strength of 142  are recognised as state government employees and get retirement benefits.         
	We have been preparing for the past few days. Our agitation starts tomorrow when our leader Subrata Mukherjee will address the members inside the zoo, said Rakesh Kumar Singh, the general secretary of the Calcutta Zoological Garden Employees Association.        
	Our agitation will continue till our demands are met, added Singh.         
	To ensure that the agitation results in maximum disturbance, 1,000 flags have been put up along with 40 giant cut-outs  most of them of a beaming Subrata Mukherjee with folded hands  placards and graffiti. Loudspeakers are set to be installed on Monday. Flags on boulevards and rotaries are blocking the view of the zebra and monkey enclosures.        
	Mukherjee, the Trinamul Congress vice-president, has been removed from the presidentship of the Congress-backed Intuc but he continues to head the zoo employees union affiliated to the trade union.        
	When eight marmosets were stolen from the zoo in August 2009, political parties of almost every hue had created a ruckus on the campus, manhandling the director and usiing loudspeakers.        
	Intuc was the most disruptive, putting up giant cut-outs of Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Subrata Mukherjee, who was in the Congress then, inside the zoo. Intuc has its own constitution and people cannot be removed from or inducted into it on a whim. The general council has voted in my favour, Mukherjee told Metro on Sunday.         
	Asked why there was Singh and Sonia but no Mamata on show in the zoo, the Trinamul leader said she had nothing to do with the agitation.        
	In 2009, over 300 protesters had gathered and used loudspeakers inside the zoo, terrorising animals. The deer enclosures are close to the main gate. Deer get frightened even by soft sounds. During last years demonstrations, they had hid themselves in corner of the enclosure. The monkeys had started screaming, said a senior zoo official.        
	According to rules framed by the managing committee of the zoo, use of public address system and shouting of slogans are not allowed on the premises. The zoo authorities can lodge an FIR against those who violate the rules.         
	The zoo has over 2,500 animals and on Saturday it received three more in two Asiatic Lions and an Iguana.

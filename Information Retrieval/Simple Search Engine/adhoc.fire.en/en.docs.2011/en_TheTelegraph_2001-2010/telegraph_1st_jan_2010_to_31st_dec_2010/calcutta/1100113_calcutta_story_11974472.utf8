                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Varsity fest bar sparks protests
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A decision by the Jadavpur University authorities to ban cultural programmes on the campus, including fests and freshers welcome, has triggered protests by students.         
	With barely a month left for the start of the fests, students of the science, arts and engineering faculties, supporting both SFI and non-CPM organisations, agitated against the diktat on Tuesday.        
	The students stopped the protests after vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh agreed to meet the representatives of the three non-CPM unions to discuss their grievances. The students welfare board of the university had recommended the ban on cultural programmes to prevent sound pollution.        
	We are ready to consider the students demands but they must agree to abide by the pollution control norms, said P. Ghosh, the university registrar, on Tuesday.        
	SFI members squatted outside the vice-chancellors office and took out a rally on Tuesday to demand withdrawal of the decision.         
	Members of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union put up posters and painted graffiti demanding that the ban be revoked. The students unions of the arts and science faculties, Forum for Arts Students and We the Independents, also agitated.

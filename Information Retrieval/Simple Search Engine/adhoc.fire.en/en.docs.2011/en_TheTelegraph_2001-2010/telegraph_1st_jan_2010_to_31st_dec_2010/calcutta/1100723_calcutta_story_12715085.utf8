The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blaze in   godown,   alarm in New Market
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Blaze in   godown,   alarm in New Market
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Panic spread through the New Market area on Thursday evening after a fire broke out in a nearby godown and fire tenders took 40 minutes to reach the spot from the headquarters, located a five-minute drive away.        
	Although the fire on the ground-floor godown at 3 Moti Seal Street was put out before it could spread, the incident took many back to the Stephen Court tragedy four months ago when fire tenders failed to reach the Park Street building in time to save lives.        
	For adjacent New Market, the fire was a reminder of the nightmare of 1985 when an entire section was gutted.        
	Fire brigade officials contested allegations about a delayed response to the SOS from Moti Seal Street. Four fire tenders had the flames under control within 15 minutes of their arrival, said a senior official.        
	A short circuit in the allegedly poorly maintained building could be the cause of the fire. It looks like a meter-box short circuit. The godown was stuffed with cardboard, photo albums and frames, an official said.        
	Mohammed Irshad, who had hired the godown two months ago, said the fire might have originated in the kitchen of an eatery on the upper floor or an electrical goods store on the ground floor where welding work was underway. I suffered a loss of at least Rs 2 lakh, he added.

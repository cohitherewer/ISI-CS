          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A balanced diet, a positive environment and adequate sleep are the best ammunition you can give your kids as they embark on mission examination, that was the word from experts at the Horlicks Anandamela workshop  Mission Exams 2010  on Monday.        
	With the Madhyamik examinations starting on Tuesday and other board exams lined up through the next month, parents need to relax and help their kids deal with stress, the experts said at the workshop, held at a city hotel.        
	Tension among students start with the parents, especially the mothers. We tend to overdo our concern for our kids right before an exam, causing more harm than good, said actress Chaiti Ghoshal, a participant at the workshop that included psychiatrist Sabyasachi Mitra, Anuradha Das, the director of Calcutta International School, and nutritionist Reshmi Roy Chowdhury.        
	If a child does not want to wake up in the morning to go to school, make sure he goes to bed earlier than usual, the experts said.        
	Roy Chowdhury added to the list of dos and donts for parents. Coconut water is good during exams, but not numerous glasses of milk. Also, avoid giving chocolates to a child who has an exam the next day as it increases anxiety, she said.

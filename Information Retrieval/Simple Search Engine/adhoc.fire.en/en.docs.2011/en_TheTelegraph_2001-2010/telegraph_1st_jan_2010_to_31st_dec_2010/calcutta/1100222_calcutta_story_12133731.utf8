	A Walt Disney workshop in the city has offered young Calcuttans a chance to make Mickey Mouse and gang dance to their own tunes.        
	An artist trained by the Disney designers has been demonstrating the basics of animation and cartooning to kids at the companys stall at the GS India International Mega Trade Fair in Science City for the past 11 days. The fair ends on Monday.         
	This is the first time we are participating in a fair in Calcutta and we are excited about the possibilities. Apart from exposing children to animation for the first time, this will help us connect with the city, a Walt Disney spokesperson told Metro from Mumbai.        
	Arka Das, 7, who lives with his father at his workplace in Birganj, Nepal, was among those who tried their hand at cartooning for the first time at the workshop. I had no idea that it is so easy to draw the faces of cartoon characters, said the boy.        
	Children love cartoons but most of them arent trained in drawing the characters they spend so much time thinking about. The kids who attended the workshop now at least know that there is something called cartooning, said Rajib Das, the trainer.        
	About 15 children have been attending his hour-long classes at the fair every day. The participants stand to win a trip to the Disneyland in Hong Kong through a lucky draw.

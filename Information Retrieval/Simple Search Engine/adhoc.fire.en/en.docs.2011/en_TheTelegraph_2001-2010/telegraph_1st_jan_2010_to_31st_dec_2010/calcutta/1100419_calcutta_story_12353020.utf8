The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Polkes eclectic vision
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Polkes eclectic vision
          ARKA DAS                           Film-maker Gautam Ghose and Reimar Volker, the director of Max Mueller Bhavan Kolkata, inaugurate Music from an Unknown Source at CIMA Gallery. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Its a fortunate proposition for the Calcutta viewer to witness a comprehensive sequence of Sigmar Polkes works.         
	The Cologne-based artist/ photographer is a central figure in post-war German art and has been at the cutting-edge of moderne kunste (the modern art movement from 1968 which is credited with irony, parody andis audaciously poster-like in style) with a constantly mutating style, with a marked irreverence for the conventional.         
	The series of Polkers 40 gouaches on show at CIMA Gallery, titled Music From An Unknown Source, offers a glimpse into this eclectic artists vision. The exhibition, in association with Max Mueller Bhavan Kolkata, was inaugurated last Friday by film-maker Gautam Ghose, who spoke of Polkes art as explaining the inner soul.         
	A biting, sardonic wit has always underscore Polkes work, often hailed as an anarchist trait. He had been one of the founders of the Capitalistic Realism, the anti-art movement which started in Germany in 1963.         
	The works on display all date back to 1996; much later than the period in which Polke was still discovering his visual language. These gouaches offer a glimpse into the fluid evolution of that idiom; the art surpasses boundaries of a language to morph into symphonic music; of tone, texture, form and figure. The title of the display warrants this process.        
	Comic strip-like drawings and digitised photograph-like images share wall space with splashes and tonal swirls in this mid-90s series, replete with titles that are often snatches of conversation; perhaps a nod to Dadaist influences. In his curatorial note on the display, Bice Curiger points out Polke setting traps that some interpretations would appear to walk straight into.        
	There, Have A Bit More Caviar, Its Delicious With The Vodka, reads one. The corresponding image is of a street scene, a situation which can give rise to a hundred interpretations. The ambiguity of image and title  the latter obviously a lead-in from the artist to coax the viewer into the game of analysis  is deliberate; perhaps a hint at encouraging freedom of thought, from convention, as it were.        
	Vibrant colours, especially crimson and lilac, a latter-day obsession with the artist, invade some of the figurative poster-like works: a family portrait in According To Statistics Every German Owns 10,000 Things.         
	The figurations are almost surreal, dream-like. The geometry often veers to the chaotic, but converges on a harmonious whole. The social commentary is all-pervasive, albeit always with the humour in place. Even on blatantly sexual themes, like the Sphinx of Sigmund Freud, with a nude man and woman lolling in the foreground, presents a nebula of papercut cards with pop-artesque baby figures on them. The elemental is another recurring motif.         
	Polke is known to use everyday objects in his work  paint, lacquers, pigments, screen print and transparent sheeting in a single frame. Music From An Unknown Source presents gouaches, where the unique rhythm of Polkes art finds new expression in a molten, disintegrated cadence.        
	Given the analogy of music, it is fitting to quote one of Polkes titles to define this show: Whats it actually about? What do you find in your mouth? I find the inside. And in the inside? In the inside I find the morning. Listen, your mouth is made for your ears. Listen.

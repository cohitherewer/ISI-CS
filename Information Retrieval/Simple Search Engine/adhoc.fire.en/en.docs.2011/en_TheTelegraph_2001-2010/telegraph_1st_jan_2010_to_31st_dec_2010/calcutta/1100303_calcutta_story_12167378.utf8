             Save maidan: Apropos Army sees red over greens, February 11, I would request Metro to continue highlighting issues that are important to the environment. Its about time everybody understood the importance of taking care of our surroundings for a better life.     Dipankar Chatterjee, 
  New Jersey, United States 
                                  
	Apropos Station boon for fringes, January 7, railway minister Mamata Banerjee went on an inauguration spree, unveiling new projects every day possibly with an eye on the Assembly polls in 2011. While new projects are always welcome, one would like to point out that they should be spread evenly.           
	Banerjee has said several times that while there was a demand from residents of Noapara, near Dum Dum, to build a station there, she gave them a Metro workshop. Now she has also given them two stations  a suburban railway station and a Metro station.           
	Noapara being a long neglected area, such acts are commendable. However, Banerjee and her party colleague Saugata Roy (MP from Dum Dum) are overlooking the plight of the nearby Belgharia station. The trains are overcrowded and their numbers insufficient as compared with the huge population they serve. Several accidents have resulted from overcrowded trains and their unreliable schedules.           
	While Banerjee is extending the Metro to Barrackpore, that wouldnt help the majority of those using the Belgharia station. This is because the proposed overground Metro service would run from Baranagar to Barrackpore along BT Road, which is far from Belgharia railway station.           
	As a result, the people residing on the eastern side of the level-crossing at Belgharia (like East Belgharia, Jatin Das Nagar and Nandan Nagar) and Nimta would remain totally neglected.           
	Extension of the existing Metro directly from Dum Dum to Belgharia could possibly reduce the sufferings of the railway passengers of Belgharia.

	Metro has raised a very important question, Will you donate your body?, in connection with Jyoti Basus decision to do the same (January 22, 2010). A cadaver is the best textbook for a medical student. A shortage of cadavers is undermining the practical training of our doctors. What people tend to forget is that they and their loved ones are bound to visit these ill-trained doctors and surgeons some day.             
	But some people cannot accept body donations as it conflicts with their religious beliefs. I would like to make a suggestion here. If the relatives of a donor are unwilling to give away the body to a medical college permanently, donated bodies can be given back to the family after a period of 15 days or so, by which time medical students can perform dissections and other research-oriented work.           
	If the bodies are preserved in cooling chambers and dissection carried out in air-conditioned labs, there is little chance of bodies decomposing within 10-15 days. The bodies could be embalmed to preserve them so that it doesnt hurt feelings of the relatives. This way, the relatives will be able to perform the last rites, albeit a little late.           
	Govind Das Dujari, Diamond Harbour Road                     
	My father, a Marxist, donated his body in 2000, before such a thing became fashionable even among Marxists. I think donating ones remains is a noble gesture but I have my reservations about donating for the benefit of medical research in Indian medical colleges. That is because the vast majority of Indian doctors have no intention of serving anybody but the rich. Medicine is seen as a trade and a means to make as much money as possible. And there are those  such as myself  who leave India at the earliest opportunity, to practise medicine abroad!           
	Aroup Chatterjee, London                               
	Apropos Old? Theyre 90 years young, January 15, I would like to mention my father, who turned 95 on January 19 this year. My father is an educationist and retired as the deputy secretary of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education 37 years ago. He is busy all day, either teaching children  primary school to college  or writing stories. He is writing a book of world stories for children. His mobility has been restricted for the past year after a nasty fall but that doesnt prevent him from visiting his library on the floor above his bedroom. He is still president of a school and takes part in their meetings.             
	Suven Sarkar, Ritchie Road                     
	My paternal aunt, Maya Sen, is 91 years old and very active. She was a student of Rabindranath Tagore and has a vibrant personality. She is one person for whom 90 is really just a number.           
	Chandraboli Sen, Address not mentioned           
	My uncle Ranendra Nath Bose completed 90 years on February 17. He is fully alert mentally and has an excellent memory. He still maintains his daily routine and helps my aunt about the house.           
	Shankar Bose, Address not mentioned                     
	B. Chaudhury, the father of tabla exponent Pt Swapan Chaudhury based in California, US, completed his 100th birthday on December 12, 2009. The event was celebrated in a grand manner by his family in Calcutta. Chaudhury is very fit and does not depend on medicines He practises yoga regularly.           
	Sujit Bhattacharyya, Salt Lake           
	I would like to add the name of the former mayor of Calcutta, Kamal Kumar Basu, who is quite active at 93.           
	Anirban De, Address not mentioned                     
	Kudos to Metro for bringing out a novel article on people who are 90 years young. The article would serve as an inspiration for those who are not 90 yet but have become inactive because of arthritis or other ailments.           
	A.S. Mehta, New Alipore     
	I was stunned to read that a social function was organised at the girls hostel of Calcutta National Medical College (Hostel as wedding host, January 5). How could the principal allow a wedding to be held on the premises? We would be really worried about sending our children to study at such an institution. What is happening in our Bengal? Political parties want to defy the system with their power.             
	Biplab Paul, Dankuni, Hooghly                               
	To reply to the question What change do you want to see in Calcutta in 2010?, dated January 1, the first change I would like is Calcutta becoming a city free from pollution-induced diseases, achieved by removal of all polluting vehicles and maintenance of water bodies. The orange hue in the city night sky should vanish to expose a clear sky.             
	Jaya Ghosh,Dr Sarat Banerjee Road           
	I visit Calcutta once a year and every time I look for improvements. I wish the international terminal at the airport is made more attractive so that it appears more welcoming.           
	We always blame the citys problems on over-population, corruption and illiteracy. However, some of us are also to blame for the condition of Calcutta today. Jumping traffic signals, dumping rubbish on the road or committing nuisance at street corners is commonplace. It is not that we are unaware of the rules, we are just lazy and irresponsible as citizens. We cant always blame the system when we are part of that very system. We should, as individuals, set examples for each other.

	India is going to become the world capital of diabetes. I would like to see my fellow citizens taking preventive steps like yoga, proper diet and lifestyle modification.           
	Sanatan Mahakud,Address not mentioned           
	As a citizen of Bengal, I want to see a curb on rash driving of buses on the streets of Calcutta.           
	Arpan Das, Address not mentioned    
	Changes I would like to see in Calcutta in 2010:           
	 All roads in Calcutta should be concreted within a stipulated time. This would improve the traffic flow and reduce the maintenance cost of roads in the long run.           
	 For improving connectivity within Calcutta and reducing traffic congestion, flyovers should be constructed at regular intervals from Beleghata in the east to Strand Road in the west, and connect these flyovers with the road network.           
	 Buildings should be constructed on roadsides for parking of vehicles only, which will free the roads.           
	 All new residential buildings must either have a basement or stilted area for parking of owners and visitors vehicles.           
	R.M. Chackraburtty, Address not mentioned           
	The hue and cry over land acquisition in Singur and Nandigram and the loss of lives by the hands of Maoists have turned our Sonar Bangla into hell. This must be stopped. Second, the roads of Calcutta are in a sorry state. Most are accident-prone and their immediate renovation is the need of the hour. Third, the state-run hospitals are in a mess. Modern equipment must be installed there.           
	Atif Ayaz, Serampore, Hooghly           
	In 2010 I want to see better roads and a cleaner environment in Calcutta. Roads made of poor quality materials prove fatal, especially during monsoons. Roadside trees should be trimmed. Roads and pavements should be cleaned at least once a week and garbage disposed of at appropriate places. The civic body should use covered vats for transporting garbage. Also, citizens must develop a civic sense.

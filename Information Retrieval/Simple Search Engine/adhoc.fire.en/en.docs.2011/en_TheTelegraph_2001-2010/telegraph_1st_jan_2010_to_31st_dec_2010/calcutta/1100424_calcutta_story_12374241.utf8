The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plea for Stephen money
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Plea for Stephen money
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The fire department has written to the finance department seeking money for the compensation to be paid to the next of kin of those who died in the Stephen Court blaze on March 23.        
	Fire minister Pratim Chatterjee had earlier announced in the Assembly that the family of each deceased would be given Rs 2 lakh.        
	Since my department doesnt have money to provide the compensation, we have approached the finance department for funds. I have also talked to finance minister Asim Dasgupta. I hope the matter will be settled soon, Chatterjee said at Writers Buildings on Friday.        
	The fire minister, however, refused to set any deadline for the disbursement of the money.        
	According to Chatterjee, the finance department had informed his office that the process of allotting funds would start once the government received all reports of the DNA test performed on the victims whose bodies were charred beyond recognition.        
	Chatterjee said this was the second instance of his department giving out compensation to the families of blaze victims.         
	Earlier, the department had provided financial help to the families of those who died in a Sodepur garments shop blaze in May 2008.         
	Normally we do not have such arrangements but these two were exceptional cases, said Chatterjee.

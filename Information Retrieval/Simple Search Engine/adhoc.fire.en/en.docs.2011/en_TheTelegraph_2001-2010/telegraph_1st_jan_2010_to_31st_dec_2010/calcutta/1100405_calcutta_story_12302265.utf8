	Four members, including two employees of Blue Dart, have been arrested in connection with the loot of Rs 1 crore in cash and jewellery from the couriers Domjur office in Howrah last Thursday.        
	Jewellery worth Rs 90,000 was seized from Chandan Das, Ashok Jena, Biswajit Ganguli and Chiranjib Das, who were picked up on Saturday.        
	Chandan and Ashok were employees of Blue Dart, while Biswajit and Chiranjib were in the armed gang that raided the office. It was apparent that insiders had tipped off the gang. There were several tin boxes in the office but the gang broke open the one that contained jewellery, said a sleuth.

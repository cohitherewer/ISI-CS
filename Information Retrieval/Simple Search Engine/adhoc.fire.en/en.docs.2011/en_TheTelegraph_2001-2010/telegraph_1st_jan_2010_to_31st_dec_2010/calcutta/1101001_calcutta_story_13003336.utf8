                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rally ban, extra cops to keep the peace
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta police have banned rallies in connection with the Ayodhya verdict, including peace gatherings, and made special arrangements to maintain peace in the city on Friday.         
	Three additional control rooms have been opened across the city besides the existing one at the Lalbazar police headquarters. Heavy Radio Flying Squads and Radio Flying Squads have been pressed into service to keep a watch on the situation.         
	Any attempt to disrupt normality, even by bringing out peace rallies, will be dealt with firmly. The city has shown remarkable restraint and we are thankful to everyone for this. Senior officers will be positioned across the city throughout Friday, said a senior officer.         
	A school in Ultadanga had brought out a silent procession ahead of the verdict but the police stopped the students and asked them to go back to school, he added.        
	On Thursday evening, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti held a closed-door meeting with senior officers. It was decided that an officer of the rank of deputy commissioner would be in charge of the control room at Lalbazar. The officers in charge of the 48 police stations have been asked to go on regular rounds.        
	Extra police personnel will be deployed on Friday morning. Besides, cops would patrol areas with mixed population, under 18 police stations, round the clock to ensure there is no disturbance, said the officer.        
	The police have appealed to transport operators not to withdraw buses from roads. People should report those spreading rumours, said an officer.

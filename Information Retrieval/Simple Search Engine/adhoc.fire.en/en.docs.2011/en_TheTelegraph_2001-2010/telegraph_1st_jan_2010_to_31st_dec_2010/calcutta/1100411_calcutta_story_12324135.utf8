The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Binodinis mentor 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Binodinis mentor 
                              The auto-adventurers in Calcutta. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya.                            
	A poet, a dramatist, an actorhe threw himself into everything with the utmost vitality he was also exceedingly sensual, his sex life was much discussed he drank enormously, took opium and so forth says Christopher Isherwood in his lecture used as an introduction to Girish Chandra Ghosh: A Bohemian Devotee of Sri Ramakrishna. The book by Swami Chetanananda recently published by the Vedanta Society of St Louis presents, among other things, many lively accounts of the women who came in contact with Girish Ghosh.         
	So what was the writer of Prafulla, Balidan, Bilvamangal, Jana and many more like in real life? Was he a womaniser or a passionate lover? Was he a guide and a teacher moulding actresses to fit the roles in his plays or was he himself drawing inspiration as a dramatist? What, for instance, was his relationship with Sister Nivedita?         
	The book records that the deaths of his first and second wives Pramodini and Suratkumari had left Girish distraught with grief and repentance for having wasted so much time on theatre. He had even tried to give it all up.        
	Then there are excerpts from actress Binodinis autobiography that Girish had asked her to write. Having acted in the lead of most of Girishs plays till 1890s, Binodini was hurt when her sacrifices for Star Theatre were ignored. But she recalls how when her hair had to be cut after it got entangled in a stage cable during a performance of Nala-Damayanti, Girish had consoled her with a joke about English actresses for whom wigs and dentures were a part of the regular costume.        
	Auto charity                  They named their nursing home in a tiny lane in Phoolbagan Charring Cross, adding an extra lsquo;r rsquo; lest you confuse it with the reputable Charing Cross Hospital in London. Now that rsquo;s what we call a ldquo;cross-over rdquo;. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta      
	One is a detective sergeant, another a lawyer, the third a pilot and the fourth has a corporate job. All four live in and around London. But for the past few weeks William Halliday, Chris Hogg, Andy Hoar and Karen Bennet have been driving autorickshaws across India, for a cause, of course.         
	We were looking for an adventurous holiday where we could also work for a charity, said Halliday in Calcutta last week.         
	The Internet led them to the Frank Water Projects, which works for setting up water filtration plants in rural India. Next they came across Rickshaw Run, an allied project under which participants drive autorickshaws through India to collect money for the cause.         
	The four reached India on March 26 and started their tour in Cochin. The journey is far from comfortable, but they are enjoying the adventure.         
	The quartet have taken well to Indian food. Chris Hogg says he was delighted to discover a namesake in Calcutta  Hogg Market. We went to Hogg Market and I had my picture taken there, laughed Chris. The four watched an IPL match at the Eden Gardens.         
	From Calcutta the group headed for Darjeeling and then to Gangtok.         
	Once they return home, they will publish an account of their travels on the Internet and ask friends and well-wishers to donate for the cause.         
	The sahibs wife        
	A couple of mothers decided to have tea at a restaurant off Park Street after dropping off their boys at school. The parking lot being overcrowded as usual, their driver was compelled to park it in a manner that flouted traffic rules.         
	A young sergeant pointed out their remiss and was about to penalise him when one of the mothers, who declared herself to be the wife of a senior police officer, protested. She said considering her exalted position, the young cop had no business to fine the driver. She called up hubby, and after stating the facts, handed over her cellphone to the sergeant. Browbeaten and chastised, he took back the challan from the driver.         
	But not for long. He decided to give the top cops better half a piece of his mind, even if he was a subordinate. Before leaving, he asked her: Do you think it was worth breaking the law for only a hundred-rupee note?                     POULOMI BANERJEE AND SEBANTI SARKAR

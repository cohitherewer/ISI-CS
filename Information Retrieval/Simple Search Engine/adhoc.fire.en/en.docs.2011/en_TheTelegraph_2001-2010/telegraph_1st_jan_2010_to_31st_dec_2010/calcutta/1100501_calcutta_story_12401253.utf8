Ending today, they showcase a pret line of ensembles thats just perfect for the hot summer season. We felt that there is a dearth of good western clothes in the city. So we have put together a collection that we think, will do well here, says Ruchi. On the racks is a simple range. Clean and structured silhouettes with minimal embellishments are what the collection offers. Mostly dresses, it also packs in tunics, tops and jackets. Prices start at Rs 3,000 and go up to Rs 15,000. The range will also soon be available at Panache, 26 Lansdowne Terrace.

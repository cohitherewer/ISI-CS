	Trust Calcuttas die-hard soccer fan to find a new jersey to wear. With Brazil being shown the door by the Dutch and Argentina being blown away by Germany, who is the city supporting in the semis? Metro spoke to 100 Cup followers  including 39 Argentina and 33 Brazil fans  the morning after the last four were decided, to find how the tide has turned for unheralded Germany and stop-start-stop Spain since Dunga and Diegos defeated boys disappeared into the dungeon  
	Bastian Schweinsteigers blazing runs down the left flank not only left schoolteacher Prasenjit De, 33, breathless but also converted him from an Argentina fan to a German one midway through the 4-0 Saturday shocker. I have always been an Argentina fan but I think the Germans are playing 22nd century football. They have such excellent ball control and speed. I will support them just for the quality of their football.        
	If the 4-1 defeat of England was a warning, Germany blanking out Argentina has made Joachim Loews young, underrated squad the fan favourite to win the Cup. That striker Miroslav is Klose to becoming the highest Cup scorer ever is a bonus. The before-and-after fan count in our poll says it all: 10 before quarters, 43 now.        
	43%              David Villa      
	spain  
	Spain has not been like a rampaging bull in the Cup ring so far but David Villas sharp shooting and playmaker Xavi Hernndezs deft passing have seen the worlds number 2 team emerge as a serious contender for the Cup and its fan brigade swell. For those like Presidency College student Jhelum Roy, 19, how the Spaniards look rather than play is what matters, though. Their players are cute, especially (Cesc) Fabregas. Although I am still mourning for Brazil, I have decided to support Spain in the semis (if not the rest of the Cup), she says. England supporter Ankit Chandak, 25, thinks Spain would be unstoppable despite running into the German juggernaut in the semis. Spain has the better player for every position, he says of the team thats number two in the Calcutta Cup stakes as well.  
	27%                    Arjen Robben      
	the netherlands  
	The city may not be going all Dutch yet but the Oranjes performance on a disastrous samba night for Brazil has had more than a few fans blowing the vuvuzela for Arjen Robben and Co. Former Ranji Trophy player Kalyan Ghose has, however, been backing The Netherlands since Day I of the Cup.   
	The Dutch were the first to play total football but they have never won the Cup. Its time they won, especially because they have a very good team this time, says the 63-year-old ex-cricketer.        
	Like Spain, the Dutch treat has got better with every match and the teams fan base has also increased with many of the converts coming from the Brazil and Argentina benches. Before the quarters, only one among our 100 respondents was a die-hard Dutch supporter. Post-Friday, it has risen to nine.        
	9%                    Diego Forlan      
	uruguay  
	If someone had said at the start of the tournament that Uruguay would be the lone Latin American team in the semis, the Calcutta fan would have scoffed at it. Diego Forlan and Co. are now not only the sole custodian of South American pride in South Africa, but also the favourite among some fans here.   
	Argentina mourner Arijit Banerjee has pinned his hopes on Uruguay to keep the spirit of South American soccer alive in the face of the European onslaught. I think Forlan has been the Cups best forward. Uruguay just might turn out to be the big surprise of this edition, said the 31-year-old techie.        
	Hes not the only one who believes in Uruguay. The team that did not get a single vote out of 100 till the quarters is now equal with The Netherlands in the Calcutta sweepstakes.        
	9%        
	All but 12 of the 100 respondents, aged 13 to 63, picked a favourite for the remainder of the Cup. Six said they were undecided while an equal number said they did not care anymore

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Privacy the casualty in aim-and-shoot city
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Privacy the casualty in aim-and-shoot city
                              SAY CHEESE: Friends in a nightclub use the cellphone camera the way it is meant to be used. (Rashbehari Das)                            
	Snap-happy cellphone users, beware. The city on Saturday saw a suspected stalker being arrested for clicking a woman on his cellphone at the Netaji Bhawan Metro station. The 35-year-old accused was charged with insulting the modesty of a woman, by word, gesture or act under section 509 of the Indian Penal Code after the woman complained to the police. Metro turns the spotlight on the growing menace of privacy violation by cellphone cameras.        
	Is clicking without permission an offence? If the person clicked feels his/ her privacy has been violated and complains to the police, it is taken as an offence.        
	Under which section can the offender be booked? Section 509 of the IPC for word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman. It also states that a person is liable to face punishment for intruding upon the privacy of a woman. The section is bailable but if found guilty, the offender can be imprisoned for a year.         
	Any helpline? 100 or 1090        
	With cellphone snaps becoming such a menace, why are more offenders not booked? On most occasions, the offenders get a free pass as the victims dont complain. We want more women to protest against such indecent acts, says Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, the city police chief.        
	What can the arrest mean for women in Calcutta? Hear it from Meghna Dass, who is studying for her IAS. I faced the problem right outside my house, when a group of young men started taking my pictures. The problem is that there is a split-second hesitation in most of us, as one does not want to create a scene. Hence, we usually let it go, as I did then. This Metro arrest will encourage more women to register complaints with the police...        
	The menace stretches from mall to dance floor, campus to campus. Says Ishita Mazumder, a third-year student: My friend was hanging out in a mall when she saw a man clicking away on his mobile. She confronted him, got the crowd behind her and forced the man to delete all the pictures he had taken of her. The more we protest, the number of men who think they can get away with this will decrease.        
	What measures have other countries taken? In Australia, mobiles are banned in and around swimming pools. In Korea, phone-makers must incorporate a camera click noise of 65-plus decibels. In Japan, all camera phones sold must make a clearly audible sound whenever a picture is taken. In the US, the Camera Phone Predator Alert Act requires any mobile phone with digital camera to sound a tone whenever a photograph is taken.  
	SEE CELEB, SNAP CELEB

	 I don rsquo;t like the idea of being clicked randomly by people.   I am always very alert. Whenever I see someone clicking me on his or her phone surreptitiously I ask them to stop. But when I am attending a function, people merrily keep clicking. So, I am extra careful. Anybody can harass me by posting obnoxious pictures on the Net.... I never say no if someone asks for permission to click.

	 I hate it when people click me on their phones. I have protested vehemently on two occasions. Once I was stepping out of court and saw two men clicking me on their cellphones. When they didn rsquo;t stop, I snatched their phones and smashed them to the floor! Then, on a flight to Bangkok, a man clicked me twice. I warned him but he didn rsquo;t listen. My sister took his phone and deleted all the pictures. But it rsquo;s not possible to pick a fight every time.

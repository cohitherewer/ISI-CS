                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Guild slams unfair fee
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Calcutta Book Fair 2009 at Milon Mela. A Telegraph picture                                   
	The Publishers and Booksellers Guild has written to the chief minister urging him to take steps to improve the infrastructure at Milon Mela and refused to pay the enhanced fee for holding this years Book Fair at the Bypass venue.         
	The book fair is scheduled between January 27 and February 7. But guild officials alleged that the facilities at Calcuttas only official fairground, were far from adequate.         
	The state government hiked the rent for Milon Mela from this year saying that the ground was almost ready.         
	The guilds concerns come close on the heels of similar grievances voiced by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which organised the Industrial India Trade Fair at Milon Mela barely a week back.         
	Despite the assurances given to us by the government last year, the ground is still not ready. A toilet block has been set up right in the middle of the ground, but its incomplete. The drainage and water systems are not in order either, said Tridib Chatterjee, the guild secretary.         
	Even the construction of a footbridge, meant to help visitors cross the Park Circus connector and enter the ground, has not been taken up, but we have to pay more rent, Chatterjee complained.        
	Mexico is the focal theme at Book Fair 2010. Mexican film festival will be held at Nandan and a Mexican food festival at the fair.

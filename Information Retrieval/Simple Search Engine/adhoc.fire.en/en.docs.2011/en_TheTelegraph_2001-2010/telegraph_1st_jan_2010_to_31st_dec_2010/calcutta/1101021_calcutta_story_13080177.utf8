The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro warned of backlash
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Metro warned of backlash
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti has warned Metro Railway of a violent public backlash in the wake of Wednesdays derailment.        
	Glitches have been taking place for a while now. There were problems during Puja as well. But todays mishap was alarming. It was terrible, he said at Writers Buildings following a meeting in finance minister Asim Dasguptas chamber along with chief secretary Samar Ghosh and joint commissioner of police Damayanti Sen.        
	The police chief said he wouldnt blame commuters for becoming insecure, impatient and violent given the frequency of Metro disruptions.         
	One cant really blame them, said Chakrabarti. Peoples lives and security are at stake. We are extremely worried. We can only look after the law and order aspects. We do not have the authority nor the expertise to tackle the technical issues, he added.        
	Chakrabarti said chief secretary Ghosh would convene a meeting, possibly on Thursday, with the police and Metro Railway authorities on how to minimise disruptions and handle emergencies. There needs to be a long-term plan, a set of preventive measures in place to avoid a recurrence of such incidents, he added.

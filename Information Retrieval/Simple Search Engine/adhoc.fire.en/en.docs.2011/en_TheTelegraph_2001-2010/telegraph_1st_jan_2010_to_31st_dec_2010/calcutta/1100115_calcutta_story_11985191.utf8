          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An all-action Saturday awaits the city as two high-profile visitors  Manmohan Singh and Amitabh Bachchan  will spend January 16 here.        
	The Prime Minister will attend a series of programmes, including the inauguration of the closing ceremony of 150 years of St Xaviers, while Bachchan will be busy promoting his next film Rann and attending a school function.        
	Singh, expected to touch down at Dum Dum airport at 11.35am, will go straight to Science City, where he will lay the foundation stone of a science exploration hall and attend two other programmes.        
	The Prime Minister will reach St Xaviers on Park Street at 4pm and stay there for around 40 minutes. He could not be with us the last time as he fell ill three days prior to the programme. But this time he has kindly consented to grace the occasion, said rector George Ponodath.        
	As for Bachchan, asked about his weekend schedule, he texted Metro: Yes, I am coming to Calcutta on Saturday. He is supposed to be joined by wife Jaya and could stay the night in town.

                      The thundering sound of silence        Sanatan Dinda tiptoes his way into the beholders senses and strikes him with a resounding thud, paralysing his inner being, forcing him to behold, silently, awe-struck. He is an artist who delineates the paradox of elements in his works, stretching the boundaries of his imagination into breathtaking visual poetry; sometimes narrating a splendid story, sometimes tantalising viewers or leaving clues or codes to solve a series of complex puzzles and enter the hallowed precinct of the artists sacred sanctum. Only when one actually takes up the challenge to decode the barrier, the exercise becomes a rewarding experience. The chiaroscuro effect produced in his sketches is mesmerising. In the current solo exhibition, Dinda has infused another dimension into the realm of realistic portraiture, a tangible feel and an uncanny three-dimensional sculptural finesse. With expert brushwork, he transforms a flat surface into cracked, dramatic compositions. His paintings and sketches are enigmatic and the open-ended conclusions are left intentionally to provide food for thought for viewers.

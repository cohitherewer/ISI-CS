The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court cracks whip on auto rule
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court cracks whip on auto rule
										      OUR BUREAU      Foul Fume - TT for City                              
	Calcutta High Court has asked for a status report on the execution of the two-and-a-half-year-old order on auto emission around which the government seems to have created a smokescreen.        
	The division bench of Justice Pinaki Ghosh and Justice Shukla Kabir Sinha, which took up the foul-fume case on Wednesday after almost a year and nine months, asked the chief secretary to file a report within a month listing all the steps taken to implement the order issued on July 18, 2008.        
	The bench also asked for a clarification on why the government had failed to force all illegal autos, including two-stroke ones, off the road.         
	A large number of autorickshaws are still plying in the metropolitan areas. According to the court order, two-stroke and also diesel autos are banned in the city. What steps has the state taken to carry out the order? the bench asked advocate-general Balai Ray.        
	Ray admitted that police had failed to track many unregistered autos that were sharing numbers on different routes.        
	A monitoring committee headed by the chief secretary had been formed during the last hearing in 2009. The committees brief was to file reports at regular intervals on how the state was executing the high court order.         
	Metro, which has been campaigning for clean air, takes stock of the implementation of the order.         
	TWO-STROKE AUTOS         
	Barely 25 per cent of the 80,000-odd two-stroke autos plying within the metropolitan area have been replaced with four-stroke LPG vehicles. The switch has been limited to the municipal corporation area, adjoining Salt Lake and parts of Howrah. Old, polluting two-stroke autos continue to ply in three-fourths of greater Calcutta.        
	We have converted around 20,000 autos but old two-stroke autos do ply in many areas of the metropolitan belt, transport minister Ranjit Kundu told Metro on Wednesday evening, blaming the Trinamul union for their refusal to switch to cleaner fuel.              
	OLD VEHICLES        
	Night checks by the pollution control board have confirmed that commercial vehicles 15 years or older (registered before January 1, 1993) continue to ply. According to the court order, these were to be withdrawn by December 31, 2009.        
	Our raids have revealed that many taxis plying in the city are over 15 years old. We hand over the offenders to the police, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the state pollution control board.         
	Most of these vehicles ply freely in areas under the state police.               
	MONITORING        
	The auto emission monitoring committee headed by the chief secretary  and supposed to submit fortnightly reports to the court  has met only twice so far and hasnt submitted a single report.        
	The notice for the third meeting was issued twice but withdrawn on both occasions, said Jadavpur University professor Pinaki Bhattacharya, a member of the panel.

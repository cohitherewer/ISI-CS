                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      HC lawyers call off ceasework
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The four-day ceasework by high court lawyers ended on Monday after the newly-appointed chief justice, J.N. Patel, expressed regret for Thursdays alleged police action.        
	The bar association had called for an indefinite ceasework after police allegedly evicted some lawyers from a court room they were occupying on June 24.        
	The association representatives had demanded that the chief justice take penal actions against police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, and the high court registrar-general, M.P. Srivastava.        
	The chief justice expressed regret over Thursdays incident and sought seven days to meet our demands. After his assurance, we decided to suspend our agitation till July 2, association vice-president Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said on Monday.        
	The normal functioning of the court would resume from Tuesday, he said.        
	We also apprised him of the space crunch lawyers are facing in the court. He promised to provide 2,000sq ft on the second floor of the old building and take steps to fill the vacant posts of judges, said Rana Mukherjee, the bar association secretary.        
	After talks with the bar members, the chief justice called the police chief and the registrar-general separately to his room.

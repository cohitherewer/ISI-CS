The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Princes diary has business amp; adda
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Princes diary has business amp; adda
          OUR BUREAU                          CALCUTTA CALLING: Andrew in Mumbai. (AFP)                                  
	The city has a date with royalty as Prince Andrew touches down on Thursday to boost British business and build bridges with the erstwhile capital of the Raj.        
	As reported in Metro on February 25, the Queens second son will be wearing the hat of UKs special representative for international trade and investment.        
	Sources said Andrew would be flying in on a chartered flight in the afternoon and putting up at Taj Bengal. His Royal Highness the Duke of York has been working tirelessly to promote UK trade and investment globally and I am confident that his visit to Bengal will help strengthen business and commercial links between the eastern part of India and the UK, said Sanjay Wadvani, the deputy high commissioner.        
	If Thursday evening is meant for a high-profile dinner, Friday morning will see the royal guest attending a seminar on Low Carbon Economy, organised jointly with the CII.        
	In the afternoon, the former husband of Fergie will ditch the power suit for a cultural adda with a few Calcuttans like film-maker Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury. Its a great opportunity to tell a prince about our films. As the UK, where I shot parts of Anuranan, is always keen to support cinema, something constructive could come out of the adda. I would like to gift him a DVD of Antaheen (that won the National Award).        
	Also at the adda would be Amitava Bhattacharya of the NGO, banglanatak.com. I will probably talk about the impact of folk theatre.        
	A peek into Prince Andrews diary does not reveal a date with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee or with crickets Prince of Calcutta (away on KKR duty).

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Thieves break into cop office 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Thieves broke into the 10th floor offices of two senior state police officers at Shantiniketan Building on Camac Street and decamped with fax machines, printers, paperweights and Rs 4,600 on Saturday evening.        
	The theft came to light on Saturday night when security guards found the locks of the offices of IG (welfare) Anil Kumar and additional director-general (housing) R. Singh broken open.        
	The two offices are part of a complex which also houses the office of the additional director-general (rail), guarded only by private security.        
	After a preliminary probe, officers of Shakespeare Sarani police station said the theft was probably the work of drug addicts. We have questioned the two security guards at the building but nothing concrete has come out, said an officer.         
	The 11-storey building houses several offices, most of which are closed on Saturday and Sunday. Even the police offices are closed on Saturday and Sunday. It seems the thieves were tipped off by the guards, added the officer.         
	Policemen injured: Four cops were injured when a Calcutta police van lost control and rammed into a road divider near the south-east gate of Raj Bhavan on Old Court House Street on Sunday afternoon. The cops were taken to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where three were discharged after first-aid. The other injured cop was admitted to Calcutta Medical Research Institute.        
	Marathon: Binign Lyngkhoi of the Army Sports Institute, Pune, won the Airtel Calcutta Marathon for men for the second consecutive year on Sunday. Kavita Raut from Karnataka won the womens race. She had also won the marathon last year. The run was flagged off on Sunday by actress Vidya Balan.        
	Stamp release: A first-day cover and commemorative postage stamp of Rs 5 were released by governor M.K. Narayanan at the bicentenary celebrations of the Bible Society of India on Sunday at St Pauls Cathedral.

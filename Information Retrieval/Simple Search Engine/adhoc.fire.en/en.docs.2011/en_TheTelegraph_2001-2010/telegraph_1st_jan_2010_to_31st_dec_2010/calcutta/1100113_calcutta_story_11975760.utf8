The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rescue roads blocked
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rescue roads blocked

	A blaze in Ultadanga was devouring everything coming its way while fire tenders were held up by blockades on Tuesday afternoon.        
	Around 100 autorickshaw operators descended on the Ultadanga crossing at 10.20am to protest the lack of enough LPG stations in the city.        
	Within minutes, queues of stranded vehicles stretching several kilometres fanned out in three directions from the crossing.        
	All approach roads to the intersection were also choked as auto operators put up blockades in Kankurgachhi, Phoolbagan, Beleghata and Lake Town and on Jessore Road.        
	The blockade at the Ultadanga crossing was lifted after 12.30pm, as the protesters rushed to the rescue of the fire victims in Number 4 Basanti Colony, adjacent to Bidhan Nagar Road station. But the snarls continued till 3pm.        
	Fire department officers said the first five fire tenders reached the spot within minutes of receiving the first call at 1.20pm. But even at 1.30pm, Metro spotted bumper-to-bumper traffic on the approach roads to the Ultadanga crossing.        
	Around 2pm, Trinamul Congress supporters blocked arterial roads and key crossings across the city, kicking off an hour-long protest against price rise and political violence in the state.        
	As a result, tenders from CR Avenue, Howrah, Free School Street, Cossipore and Lalbazar were delayed on their way to the blaze site.        
	Fire department sources said the tenders from the CR Avenue station took almost an hour to reach Ultadanga, a distance usually covered in 15 minutes.        
	Fire minister Pratim Chatterjee said: The fire tenders were blocked by Trinamul supporters. Such an incident is unheard of in a civilised country.        
	Trinamul Youth Congress president Madan Mitra said Tuesdays disruptions were part of the partys week-long agitation against the Centre and the state government.        
	He, however, said the party had decided against blocking Ultadanga and VIP Road because of the devastating fire.        
	Did he presume the tenders would fly to the spot bypassing the choked approach roads?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Math test after results for two
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Math test after results for two
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Two of the four ICSE examinees whose mathematics answer scripts were lost by the board appeared for a retest on Friday, two days after the results of the examination were declared.        
	The other two examinees had sat for a retest on Tuesday. Those who sat for the examination on Friday could not appear in Tuesdays retest as their schools were not able to complete the necessary formalities.         
	The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, which conducts the ICSE, contacted the four examinees on the evening of May 15 and told them that they would have to take their math test again on May 18.         
	The four, from different city schools, had appeared for the ICSE math examination on March 29. Nobody noticed that their answer scripts were not in the sealed packets that were dispatched from the test centres.        
	The mystery of the missing answer scripts came to light during the tabulation of results earlier this month.        
	All the four candidates have written the math test. We are trying our best to declare their results by next week, said Gerry Arathoon, the additional secretary and the officiating chief executive of the council, on Friday.        
	Teachers, students and guardians have criticised the board for forcing the four to sit for a fresh math test so long after the exam.        
	Council sources said it was forced to hold the retest since it was wary of a petition under the provisions of the Right to Information Act.         
	Since the answer scripts could not be traced, the only other option the council was left with was to award the four marks on the basis of their performance in the selection tests, said a source in the council.        
	What would we have done if any of the four examinees had challenged their math mark and demanded to see their answer scripts under the provisions of the RTI Act? Such a situation would have brought more disrepute to the council, said a source.

	The first edition of The Heritage Schools fest Youthopia, organised in association with t2 from May 6 to 8, included a range of events, from acrobatics and dramatics to quizzes and sparring. The high point was cricketer Sourav Ganguly dropping by to inaugurate the fest and to interact with the students. The competitive events saw participants engaged in a treasure hunt in Hidden Secrets and playing a paintball match in Shoot At Sight. Comicature saw them come up with innovative comic strips, while .com saw tech geeks construct their own web page.The host school came first, followed by Birla High School (Girls), South Point High School and MP Birla Foundation                  
	Parikrama rocked the stage on Saturday with old favourites like But It Rained and Open Skies. Songs inspired by the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, including Am I Dreaming? and Tears Of The Wizard, a tribute to the wizard Gandalf. Other popular numbers like ACDCs Highway To Hell, Iron Maidens Fear of The Dark were also part of the bands repertoire for the evening.                   
	Heritage Fashion Extravaganza had 11 schools fighting for the fashionista throne. While the host school put up a Spring-Summer Collection 2010, St Lawrence High School went for a mafia theme while Lakshmipat Singhania Academy dressed up in emo, punk, geeky, sporty and formal avatars, in keeping with their American high school theme. City models Jessica Gomes and Neeraj Surana gave away the first prize to St Thomas School for Boys while the host school bagged the second prize.                  
	The western music competition had 10 schools fighting for the crown. With 10 minutes allotted to each team to perform two songs, there was tough competition on stage. St James School started off with the rendition of Born To Be Wild made famous by the Canadian rock band Steppenwolf and Zeros PSP 12. Other bands that impressed were Assembly of God Church, Park Street, who performed Chop Suey by Systems Of A Down and ACDCs Highway To Hell.         
	The kids look like they are having fun, smiled Bertie Da Silva, one of the judges. Agreed another judge, Ben Westley, who has played with city rockers Hip Pocket in the past. St James School came first, The Heritage came second and Assembly of God Church was third.

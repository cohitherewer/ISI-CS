  - Himachal holidayers make it back, boy loses family in Bhutan tragedy          OUR BUREAU                           Tourists trek through the snow near Rohtang Pass on Saturday. (PTI)                                        
	Most of the 50-plus tourists from Bengal who were stuck near Rohtang Pass and other areas of Himachal Pradesh last week because of heavy snowfall are safe, having managed to trek or hitch rides at exorbitant rates to lower altitudes.        
	Among those still stranded are the 18 members of a group from Tamluk in East Midnapore, stuck near Kelong, 51km from Rohtang Pass.         
	We have been trapped here since Wednesday. On Thursday, we were supposed to start for Rohtang Pass but because of strong winds and continuous snowfall we werent able to venture out. Since then, the snow has just been piling up, said a member of the group.        
	He alleged the Himachal government did not help them in any way. Those who had been able to make it back to Shimla or Manali from Rohtang and Chitkul are also unhappy with the role played by the local government.        
	Bengal civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee said the state government was in touch with the Himachal government to ensure the safe return of the tourists.        
	He criticised travel operators for misguiding tourists. According to the Himachal government, it is unsafe to travel to places at high altitude, such as Rohtang Pass, after October 15. But operators turn a blind eye to such warnings, said Mukherjee.        
	Mihir Patra, a 56-year-old schoolteacher from Dhakuria who had been stranded with his family at a dhaba 5km from Rohtang Pass on Friday, said cars charged exorbitantly to ferry them to safety.        
	His 80-year-old uncle Sunil Baran and 65-year-old aunt Kalyani had to trek 15km through the snow from Mirha to Lalapat after the snowfall subsided on Saturday since they could not afford to hire a car after paying several times the normal rates at the dhaba.        
	Avijit Das, 34, a trader from Howrahs Belgachhia, who had been stranded in Kalpa, 255 km from Shimla, on his way down from Chitkul, also complained of government apathy.

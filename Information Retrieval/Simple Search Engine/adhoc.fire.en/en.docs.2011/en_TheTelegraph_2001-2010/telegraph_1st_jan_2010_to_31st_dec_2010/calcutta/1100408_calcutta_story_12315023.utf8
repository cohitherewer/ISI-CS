The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Drive to restore landfill jheel
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Drive to restore landfill jheel
          JAYANTA BASU                                          
	The civic authorities on Wednesday started demolishing encroachments on Bikramgarh Jheel, off South City, that has shrunk from 100 to 20 bighas following rampant landfill by a section of realtors.        
	Our workers, helped by police, started pulling down a recent encroachment that had stopped the flow of the jheel, said Sushil Sharma, the mayoral council member (environment) in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	We will remove other recent encroachments, too. After that the water body will be fenced.        
	Civic workers during the day tore down a wall with a gate reading 87 Prince Ghulam Hossain Shah Road, which Metro had highlighted on February 23 as having come up eating into the jheel.        
	The report had pointed out that the water body, spread across wards 93 and 95 in Jadavpur and Golf Green, was being filled up unchecked by private enterprises enjoying political patronage.        
	What was once a 100-bigha sprawl in the early 1950s now measures barely 20 bighas. Residents alleged that the landfill gathered pace over the past five years, since a large residential-cum-commercial estate started coming up in the vicinity.        
	The publication of the Metro report was followed by a meeting on March 5 at Writers Buildings, where PWD minister Kshiti Goswami, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya decided that the water body would be fenced.        
	On Wednesday, mayoral council member Sharma said the restoration and beautification of the water body would start after the demolition of encroachments and work on the fencing were over.        
	Sources said the tendering process for the fencing had been been cleared by the civic authorities         
	The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority is supposed to provide us with a demarcation line for the fence and the alignment of the proposed road that will run parallel to the jheel on the southern side. The restoration work will gain momentum once we get these inputs, said a senior civic official.        
	A local resident welcomed the demolition move but expressed the fear that vested interests might get it grounded.        
	Environmentalists said filling up of Bikramgarh jheel  the drainage catchment for the area  would immediately affect about 10,000 people in the vicinity with waterlogging during monsoon.        
	In the longer run, more than 50,000 people in the two wards will be hit.

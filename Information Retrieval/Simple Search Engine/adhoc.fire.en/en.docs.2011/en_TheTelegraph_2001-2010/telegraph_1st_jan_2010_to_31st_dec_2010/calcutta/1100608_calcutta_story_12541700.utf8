The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Waterman rides a wave for change
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Waterman rides a wave for change
  - First peek into mind of mayor-select					 					      11 QUESTIONS      DEEPANKAR GANGULY                        Sovan Chatterjee				                                       
	The morning after being anointed the 37th mayor of Calcutta, it was business as usual for Sovan Chatterjee. It was almost inevitable that the first task at hand for the mayor-select, better know as Jol Sovan, was overseeing the repair of a pipe-burst.        
	The 47-year-old councillor of ward 81 rushed to the road behind his house to oversee the restoration of a damaged water pipeline on Monday morning. The water assignment punctuated a morning of celebration with supporters and residents queuing up outside his residence and office and congratulatory calls and messages flooding his dark red Nokia communicator.        
	But he did make time to speak to Metro at his Gopal Bhavan in Behala.        
	Mamata Banerjee has said she will turn Calcutta into London. As mayor, what is the first step you will take to make that happen?        
	Discussions are already on to take up the beautification of the riverfront, in collaboration with Port Trust. Didi has taken personal initiative. Calcutta must become a tourist destination. But I must clarify that the dream of making Calcutta into an international city cannot be realised overnight.        
	There is a jumbo expert committee headed by an ex-mayor. Doesnt that show a lack of trust in you? And how will it function?        
	No, the advisory committee has been formed to ensure the citys holistic development.... Let the experts first come on board.        
	Several city pockets do not have access to filtered surface water supply. Can Jol Sovan change this?        
	My priority will be to reach filtered water to every household, at least 130 litres per person per day.        
	Will you introduce water tax, something you had tried and failed five years ago because of Mamata?         
	There will be no water tax. This is our decision.        
	Water tax was a pre-requisite for the ADB loan. What if it refuses to pay the second phase of Rs 3,000 crore?        
	The party will meet and decide. And how much water tax can we raise? Rs 30 crore? Why harass people for that?        
	Hawkers now rule the pavements. What will you do?        
	We are not against hawkers but the pedestrians right to use the pavement must be safeguarded. A proper balance is needed between pavements for pedestrians and room for hawkers.        
	Whats your plan for north Calcutta and Burrabazar?        
	Drastic and determined steps must be taken. We will push for vertical expansion provided more space is left vacant at the ground level and road space is widened.        
	There are over two lakh illegal buildings in town...        
	Razing them is not the solution. Regularisation is the way forward, provided safety and fire norms are followed.        
	Will you pull down the illegal parts of Nandram?        
	The court order on Nandram market (demolition of upper storeys) must be followed. The interests of the traders will also be looked into.        
	According to you, the mayors responsibility is to delink politics from the delivery of civic amenities. What does that mean?         
	There was a tradition in the CPM-run civic boards of neglecting the non-Left wards. That will not happen now.        
	What changes can Calcuttans see within the first fortnight of your term?        
	Thoroughfares will be cleaned, in the morning and evening. And one day every week, all major statues will be washed and cleaned.       With inputs from   Tamaghna Banerjee

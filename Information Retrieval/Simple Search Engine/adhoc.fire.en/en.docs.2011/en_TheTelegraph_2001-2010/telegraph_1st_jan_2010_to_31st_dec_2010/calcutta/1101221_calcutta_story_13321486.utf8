The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Touts shifted, not banished
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Touts shifted, not banished
          SANJAY MANDAL AND SUBHAJOY ROY                              
	Army officer Santanu Ray had thought the taxi and trolley touts at Calcutta airport were on strike when he arrived from Bangalore last week and managed to walk to his car without being pestered once.        
	Although it came as a pleasant surprise, I do remember thinking that it was too good to be true. I am so used to being chased by touts after stepping out of the terminal, he said.        
	The exit of the tout brigade from the entrance is one of the few changes that have come about since Metro began highlighting how fliers were being hounded by them and inconvenienced by official incompetence at every step.         
	But while tout raj seems to be a thing of the past at the terminal entrance, they lurk in the parking lot.         
	They have been merely pushed back, not banished. I walked from the terminal exit to the parking lot undisturbed the other day, only to be surrounded by a gang of touts the moment I entered it, revealed a frequent flier.         
	The reason for the tout-free faade is, of course, the deployment of more uniformed personnel. Not only do the touts stay away from the entrance and the exit, even traffic is seemingly better behaved.        
	A CISF officer said a squad had been formed, in the wake of the Metro campaign, to rein in touts and unruly drivers who block the car lanes. We have been working in co-ordination with the police. At least five CISF personnel now man the area. Also, taxi drivers are not allowed to spend an extra minute in front of the terminal, the officer added.        
	Three personnel with whistles on their lips chase any vehicle that idles in the lanes. As many as 60 cases have been filed at the airport police station over the past month against touts and errant drivers, the officer said.        
	At the gates, the CISF personnel on duty look more active, if not efficient, than before. On most days, fliers now dont need 10 minutes to walk the 10-metre distance from the porch to the check-in arena or the general lounge.        
	So do these changes mean that the airport that has become a laughing stock is ready to turn the corner?        
	These are cosmetic changes at best. The chaos inside the terminal (reported by Metro on Monday) has actually got worse, rued a passenger.         
	Then there are new eyesores like the three holes in the left car lane that would have done a putting green proud. They are round, big holes of around six inches in diameter. You could get injured if a foot lands on one of them, complained engineer Soumya Ghosh.        
	An airport official said the holes were drilled as part of the modernisation project, but failed to explain why these had been left uncovered.

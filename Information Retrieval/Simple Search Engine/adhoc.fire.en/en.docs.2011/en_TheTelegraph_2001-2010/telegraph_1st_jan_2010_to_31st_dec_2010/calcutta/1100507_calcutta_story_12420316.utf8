The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City rides a wet wave
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City rides a wet wave

	Several spells of heavy thundershowers swept the city on Thursday afternoon and with the Met office predicting more rain in the next 24 hours, Calcuttans can look forward to a comfortable weekend.        
	The 26.9mm of rain the city received in 24 hours, till 5.30pm on Thursday, dragged down the maximum temperature (31.9) by four degrees compared with the day before.         
	The minimum temperature, too, was three degrees below normal.        
	A heavy cloud cover could be seen from 3.30pm and the first thunderclap was heard half an hour later. Spells of rain that started around 4.30pm went on for two hours.        
	As expected, Calcutta experienced thundershowers on Thursday afternoon. The rain has lowered the mercury by several degrees, said an official of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Friday, the weatherman said, is likely to be generally cloudy, with the possibility of rain or thundershowers towards afternoon or evening. Temperatures are likely to range between 32 and 25 degrees Celsius.        
	If there is heavy rain on Friday, the maximum temperature could hover around the 30-degree mark, a happy occurrence in the city during this time of the year. The cooling effect will continue through the weekend, said an independent meteorologist.        
	The weather office attributes the consistent formation of thunderclouds in south Bengal over the past few days to abundant incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal.        
	An official of the India Meteorological Department in Delhi said isolated thundersqualls were likely in the region in the next couple of days.        
	The conditions are favourable for Norwester activity, he added.

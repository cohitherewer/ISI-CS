                Barun Pradhan, 10, a resident of Orissas Berhampore who was abducted allegedly by mistake, was reunited with his family in Howrahs Amtala on Wednesday evening. Pradhan went missing from Berhampore on October 4. On Tuesday evening, he was found in a drowsy state inside a bus at Amtala.   olice suspect the abductors had picked up the farmers son by mistake. When they realised their fault, they probably drugged him and put him on the bus. The bus driver and conductor noticed the boy and informed cops.

Police started a murder case against the in-laws of Mohua Bhattacharya, a homemaker who allegedly set herself on fire late on Tuesday. Bhattacharya apparently told police moments before she died that she had set herself on fire out of frustration at not being allowed to visit her parents for a long time.    Chandrika Dey, 28, a homemaker, was stabbed to death by Rabin Karmakar, 32, on Wednesday. Police said Karmakar called Dey out of her Kanchrapara home around 9.30pm and stabbed her.
